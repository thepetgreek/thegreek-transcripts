1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:21,680
and greetings folks and how are you folks tonight and we got Greek and Sam

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:30,300
online hi greetings everyone this is a ritual of rituals every week for the I

3
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,240
guess the anti pranking and let's inform some idiots on this planet about things

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,380
that they were in front of them that they never see anyway I don't know what

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:49,160
else we do we do how are you Sam I'm doing quite fine okay good it's on your

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,200
mind tonight uh-huh there's always things on my mind but specifically for

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,960
streaming purposes I guess we'll look at some things that I've been trying to

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,120
figure out this week and maybe you have something you want to bring up on your

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:16,380
own accord I will say that my week generally does consist of the familiar

10
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,620
to most people nine to five so studying has to kind of take a backseat I wish it

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,940
wasn't like that but like they say I'm so happy to get home after work that I

12
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,020
forget how pissed off I was all day so no wonder I keep going back right but

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,940
the people listening might know about work but I don't think they know about

14
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:40,300
studying mmm so and it take that whichever way you want to so good but I

15
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,280
do only have fortunately or unfortunately one sort of topic of

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,020
attention for this stream and after that I'll just have miscellaneous questions

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,440
that I tuck away for a rainy day or a Skype call with the Greek so I've been

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,480
thinking about the sort of coming religious abandonment that's the people

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,120
are going to be manifesting when things start to change based on what's

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,920
outlined in some of the minor prophets we can deduce that the world will soon

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,460
experience some kind of a reformation and spiritual understandings and they'll

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,000
abandon their religions and ultimately ancient history and these scriptures

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,100
will be held in the highest esteem and then once that happens everybody

24
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,760
realizes that contemporary religion is based on a mixture of paganism

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,340
Hellenism and ancient Greek philosophy and ignorance yes which is paganism

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,020
yeah that's right it's funny when people say I'm proud to be a pagan I'm

27
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,940
like you're stupid you just admitted to being stupid and I even you know when I

28
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,020
was doing the sonic events with Ocelli I was like you just admitted you're an

29
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,140
idiot that's okay next subject you know so and if people people not aware of the

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,960
gravity of what they're saying obviously when it comes to those things I want to

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,420
throw in an item there because I've been pondering this for over a decade it

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,680
doesn't say for how long they're going to leave their religions and acknowledge

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,300
the most high that there will be a more temporal let's say more permanent

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,820
situation of that in the future after the mop-up crew see I don't like calling it

35
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,040
the second coming or end times or all that because no one even knows what

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,440
those things mean I mean I know what they mean but when you tell people

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,860
phrases like that they just they glaze over you know like a donut so I just call

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,720
it the mop-up crew because they can attach that people are always

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,260
complaining about stuff and say oh it's not perfect it's not a fair world so when

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,800
you say mop-up crew they can attach that to their idiotic worldview whatever it

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,620
is pagan or they're just learning or they're not want to learn you see what

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,280
I mean so so when this acknowledgement I call it more of an acknowledgement than

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,660
the change of the world religions because remember when the mop-up crew comes when

44
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,340
they perform what they are going to do it has to be lawful because the logic

45
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,780
behind that is there there will be I'd ever read anywhere that they're gonna be

46
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,399
sniveling humans about why they did it obviously there's gonna be a lot of

47
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,240
contention about the situation but not about that so it has to be done when

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,680
it's lawful so how much does like a Catholic or Mormon or a Jew or Christian

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,220
or average pagan have to admit acknowledge the most high and the right

50
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,940
thing for how long it's not that they have to admit it and that's it

51
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,900
be all end all it's you know as a condition it just has to be admitted you

52
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,860
see it's like when when someone is in court for sentencing how long do they

53
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,780
have to admit that they're guilty they just have to say it right it's just a

54
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,220
passing moment it's a momentary thing so I'm not suggesting that the abandonment

55
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,240
of all these the pagan Catholicism and pagan whatever you see in the world is

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,520
going to be an absolute abandonment because there are places in scripture

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,160
that do state that they even after they acknowledge they go back to how they

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,340
were before and even worse I'm just paraphrasing right mm-hmm so I just want

59
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,500
to throw that in as an initial comment and what they're going to bring what I

60
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,840
suggest is going to be worse is they're going to do arrow duels and you know

61
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,600
which is basically temple prostitution overt sacrificing and all this other

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,660
stuff so so continue yeah as far as that goes I can definitely see there being

63
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,160
various subsections of people with varying degrees of responses to what's

64
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,900
happening you'll have people that will probably throw themselves headlong into

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,840
abandoning their religious convictions because they would have been set up that

66
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,480
way I mean it doesn't take much examination to realize there's a whole

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,240
lot of fraud being perpetrated and some people will want to get away from that

68
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,860
real quick and maybe some 80 year old Catholic lady that really felt like

69
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,920
Jesus is our Savior is probably going to come back and try and do some kind of a

70
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,660
syncretism between acknowledging the Most High and her old Catholic stuff

71
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,960
this probably be probably be a range of things and by the way I just want to throw

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
in since you brought that around I had once done a small restoration project

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,440
because old people like that do accumulate a lot of stuff and she got

74
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,920
stuffed in a nursing home and the only thing left was this little tiny piece

75
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,580
of furniture I restored it for it was about an 80 year old piece and I told

76
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,100
her the truth and she was in shock about everything and she was in her 80s

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,500
and this is over a decade ago and she was like oh I better find out more

78
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,420
about this and she was a very unique example of the human condition

79
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,700
regardless of her age but now that since you brought up the old Catholic lady I

80
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:02,320
have actual first-hand experience with one so good okay so it is positive but

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,020
usually the group as a whole is finished when you think of humanity and

82
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,500
wholesale it's like you know in certain archaeology and

83
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,880
architecture courses they take the the whole class for a tour at the landfill

84
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,300
because the best stuff you'll find in archaeology is at a landfill and

85
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,540
architects also like to look at landfills because it tells you a lot

86
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,420
about the culture so basically when you are about this is a the earth and

87
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,340
people are part of a spiritual landfill at the moment you see what I mean it's

88
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,580
all garbage so it doesn't take much they're still going to be in the landfill

89
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,180
even when they acknowledge but but go ahead I don't want to go off on too much

90
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,620
on what really is going on now let's just stay on the on the point about the

91
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,920
religion what else is on there about what else you got about it well it's

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,740
kind of clear that the prime prediction for all this is in Zechariah 12 and 13

93
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,820
so more specifically 12 10 to 13 6 so you would forget about the chapter

94
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,740
markers because that's just stuff the King James translators have put in there

95
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,140
arbitrarily but you have a sort of continuous account from 12 10 to almost

96
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,440
14 so right I shall pour on the house of David in the inhabitants of Jerusalem a

97
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,179
spirit of favor and prayers and they shall look upon me whom they have

98
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:36,700
pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only son it's worth

99
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,059
noting noted noticing I think that the prophecy is concerning not only

100
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,780
Israelites but it says all the inhabitants of Jerusalem so I'm

101
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,600
guessing no matter who they are as far as race cultural religion right back to

102
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,420
geographic thing right back to the geography of things yes so if the whole

103
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,320
the whole population is going to have some kind of a spiritual rejuvenation to

104
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,320
understand and accept the truth and then I'm guessing that that will reverberate

105
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,720
around the world through the television the internet mass media and things like

106
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,940
that yeah so yeah people will begin to abandon what they previously right

107
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,020
whether it's momentary or daily or weekly for a period it's going to be for

108
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,560
a time just like they you know like if you bring up 9-11 right now anyone I was

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,380
15 years ago or people have a curiosity and the interesting thing about 9-11 is

110
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,540
if you brought up what happened the day or week of there were too much in the

111
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,100
shock to listen so either way whether you tell them when it's happening or

112
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,900
just after it happened or much later they're not going to get it but they're

113
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,040
going to be in some state like that if you know what I mean when they abandon

114
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,480
their religions you know I like using 9-11 it's a perfect metaphor for that

115
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,980
because it's sort of supernatural you know how can you take 200,000 tons of

116
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,060
steel and turn it into dust in eight seconds that's supernatural but it's not

117
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,440
but because of people's ignorance they they brush it away it's like oh no big

118
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,760
deal you see so this is going to be within that realm I suggest there it

119
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,940
won't be in so much that realm in the place in and in and near in about the

120
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,160
place of Jerusalem because I would suggest in order for a temple edifice to

121
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,000
be put together you can't build it on a cemetery over dead bodies that are

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,840
buried you know when even though whether you know it or not a temple will not be

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,960
allowed to be buried or built over a burial place right even if you even if

124
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,300
you you have to be absolutely sure that there are no bodies buried underneath

125
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,660
that edifice and what and you know how they you know how they do that they they

126
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,220
keep scraping all the every all the loose dirt until they get down to what

127
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,950
bedrock so there's some guy out there he's been a pretty good biblical

128
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,750
scholar for several decades he says oh it's going to be on the Mount of Olives

129
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,010
and you know I'm not going to say who it is you know who I'm talking about

130
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,370
right they they still have remnants of some guy that proponents of their work

131
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,430
Christians of course they're schizophrenic because they expound

132
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,770
Christianity but they say away with Christians do or bad okay all right so

133
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,470
schizophrenic so they say it's going to be built on the Mount of Olives oh really

134
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,430
so you're gonna scrape it down to bedrock and what do you see when you look

135
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,870
at the Mount of Olives except if you go on Google Earth you other than a

136
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,170
couple of apartments a couple of falafel places and and some small businesses

137
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:48,000
what is it what is it known for right cemeteries so so okay I'm giving a

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,040
little deep more detail than I need for the point the point is when you see a

139
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,740
dedication like a Hanukkah right to the temple you can't have churches and mosques

140
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,320
and you know all that pagan crap has to go you know the via de la Rosa and all

141
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,600
that crap that they have there you know that the a skepulous you know that that

142
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
Jesus stuff that has to be cleared out of there that's going to be the stuff to

143
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,500
really watch as your precursor to what you're doing with the topic at hand is

144
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,670
because it wouldn't be lawful in other words when you see the prediction or the

145
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,150
assumption and a strong presumption that there'll be a temple in the near future

146
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:42,110
will it be a lawful or unlawful one well I'll be lawful in order I just gave you

147
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,290
the requirements for it to be what you know for the temple will be lawful you

148
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,190
can't have pagan temples like churches yes if you listening for the first time

149
00:12:51,190 --> 00:13:00,170
churches a pagan temple mosques are pagan temples so how are they going to

150
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,650
clear are they going to clear out all that filth and junk out of Jerusalem

151
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,540
well that's something to watch for I think it's going to be done using

152
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,140
natural either an earthquake there's someone wrote that there might be a

153
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:21,760
tsunami coming in well I'll be one hell of a tsunami or it might just be man

154
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:30,390
that does it in a fire or a riot kind of fervor that's been done before where

155
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,270
buildings have been burned down and tore down in a riot type situation so I'm just

156
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,770
stating these things as facts based on the requirements of certain things that

157
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:50,270
are viewed as facts right right so as a result the inhabitants whether they're

158
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:57,050
Jews or Muslims or Christians so-called they will presumably banish idolatry and

159
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,050
paganism from the region and it's also says in the prophecy that Yahweh himself

160
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,350
will rid the area of evil spirits would formerly been in that area who caused

161
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,950
these antagonisms and things to prevail and it shall be in that day that I cut

162
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,570
off the names of the idols from the earth and they shall be remembered no

163
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,430
more and I shall also remove the prophets and the unclean spirits from

164
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,530
the earth so there is a sort of more primary reason why you can't really get

165
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,890
anything done in Jerusalem at the moment because there's a spiritual

166
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,810
underpinning right in other words all that spiritual underpinning is based on

167
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,890
the law basically preconditions conditions and requirements for for

168
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,590
certain things to take place most people are not familiar with that by the way so

169
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,090
they think they've been so duped about spirituality think oh it's in your

170
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,430
heart or what you believe in they don't understand even though they see a

171
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:53,010
physical brick-and-mortar or pragmatic substantive representation of that you

172
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,090
know through iconography and whatever pagan crap they're doing they think it's

173
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,930
solely non-material but here we're I'm suggesting I think what you brought up

174
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,750
also Yahweh clearing the place out it's also you can't clear the spirits out and

175
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:18,570
leave the building you know what I mean so and also just one other thought it

176
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,810
like in Europe you have a lot of churches in America there's a lot of

177
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,910
churches when it happens there what do you think is going to happen to the ones

178
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,770
everywhere else I'm not saying that it will but I'm just that'll be quite a day

179
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,110
I think I've mentioned before the Vatican will be a discotheque they

180
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,370
already have all the sodomites and the cocaine in there all they got to do is

181
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:49,390
put up some ball and some lights and it anyway good well actually the Vatican is

182
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,670
interesting because they would have to probably turn on themselves that's

183
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,470
interesting and they already are but like violently I don't know if the

184
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,170
priesthood I don't know if the state Italian state will come in and take the

185
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,150
moderates they'll blow themselves up I don't know well they're a city-state

186
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:12,510
like Washington DC and the city of London and you know they'd have to ask

187
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,700
for help yeah and they might it depends it's gonna be you know it you know how

188
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,900
they say may you live in interesting times it's gonna be so interesting but

189
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,020
I'm suggesting and I've been on the record for many years saying when these

190
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,960
things happen no matter how extreme no one's gonna really notice anyway because

191
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,700
of the cosmic censorship they're gonna be led to it being okay and the metaphor

192
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,280
there as you know how many times have you I've got on the record saying if you

193
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,280
took a newspaper and sent it back in a time machine you know a newspaper from

194
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,660
today or last week or last year send it back 50 or 100 years it would completely

195
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,400
and it was known it would stop the entire society and they would say we

196
00:16:50,400 --> 00:17:02,720
have to stop everything so these things don't happen so I think you've also said

197
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,240
things to the effect in the past that people it's gonna come a time globally

198
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,619
will people like the rabbis and priests and preachers and imams and things of

199
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,859
that nature will be shown to be false teachers and the prophecy specifically

200
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,760
does talk about that they will be so ashamed of their previous positions that

201
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,380
they'll pretend to have been something else like farmers or something right man

202
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,900
of the light working the land yeah and when I remember if you look at that

203
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,960
closely maybe this is not the right time to do it and that's right not the

204
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,100
right time for me to bring it up because I haven't looked at that many years but

205
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,440
that is a twofold thing that happens twice by the way in other words I think

206
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,380
it was in Isaiah and someone else's something similar to that but if you in

207
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,500
other words they will they will initially state that and then they will

208
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,060
go back to it and then it either after the you know the first resurrection

209
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,300
because most people think you know when the mop-up crew comes it's going to be

210
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,120
hunky-dory right it's not it's going to be pretty crappy on earth for at least

211
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:17,000
70 years if not more so but you'll be taken care of whoever you is so there'll

212
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,540
be a time then as well you see but anyway continue and it just let's just

213
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,600
bring this up as something to revisit in the future because I have to get all my

214
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,820
in a row to present that yeah my studying hasn't been thorough enough to

215
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,780
have details on that but I've seen it because you have the same similar things

216
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,360
being said in Isaiah 25 27 and it toggles back and forth and sometimes it

217
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,080
seems to be talking about this period and then other times it will say in that

218
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,780
day and usually in that day is millennial kingdom cleanup and it's

219
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,680
saying some similar things then so you kind of get confused like what's it

220
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,860
talking about which way it's the exact time right well you'll know that well

221
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,560
either way you know there is a time coming that's to expect that whether it's

222
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,800
a single fold expression of that condition or a dual fold expression of

223
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:16,560
that condition so specifically and it shall be when one prophesies again that

224
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,360
his father and mother who brought him forth shall say to him you shall not live

225
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,680
because you have spoken falsehoods in the name of Yahweh and his father and

226
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,200
mother who brought him forth shall pierce him through when he prophesied

227
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,700
that's interesting and it shall be in that day that the prophet shall be

228
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,300
ashamed and everyone of his vision when he prophesied and not shall not put on a

229
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,280
hairy robe to deceive but shall say I am no prophet I am a farmer for a man sold

230
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,620
me as a slave in my youth and one shall say to him what are these wounds on your

231
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,560
hands and he shall say because I was wounded at home by those who love me

232
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm not sure about that last bit what they're saying there but piercing is

233
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,980
well you have to you have to take it this way you know what's if you've

234
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,820
spoken falsely against Yahweh it's a form of blasphemy or blasphemy in itself

235
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,360
like you know yeah first degree second degree third degree right and that's

236
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,000
capital punishment but because it's a high level you're pierced in other words

237
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,020
instead of being just stoned be usually when there was a stoning they beat you

238
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,360
up right or cut your kill I don't want to get into cut your Achilles tendon so you

239
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,760
can't run I mean there's a lot of if you want to there's not much on the

240
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,660
internet by the way but there's a lot of historical stuff on how stoning was done

241
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:38,400
through the ages right and make a long story short here real short it was

242
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,000
always death by stoning but when you were pierced it showed that you had no more

243
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,840
free will to move meaning that you were pinned down to something you see or it

244
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,780
was usually a tree or a stake or something that you can you know it's

245
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,260
going to be difficult to drive a nail through someone into stone so you need

246
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,200
some kind of a cellulose type material or something you can you know drive usually

247
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,000
wood is the best material to nail into right I mean you can come up with

248
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,820
certain modern composites that you can nail into but wood is still the best so

249
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,780
it was typically a tree and usually when it was a big show they nailed you

250
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,380
to a cross beam and then they put a rope on that and they put the rope over a

251
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,340
branch and lynched it up they pulled you up at a good height right and then when

252
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,520
you got to the finished height they tied off the rope and then they nailed your

253
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,720
feet so you wouldn't dangle I just gave you a description of how the Messiah was

254
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,600
and with two others on the same tree left and right so but but in the case of

255
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,040
Stephen they didn't do that they just don't know they just stoned him out

256
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,520
right yeah in other words they threw him a pretty good beating and then stoned

257
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,340
him on the spot he wasn't pierced right and Paul was not pierced either they just

258
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:03,120
don't mm-hmm yeah usually to get pierced you you are it's a more formal display

259
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,580
of your crime where with Paul and Stephen it was okay we had enough for

260
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,100
this asshole you know so it would be just like now or even not even so much

261
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,980
go to the Western movies in the u.s. and they just shot you right you were in the

262
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,660
bar you had a fight and they shot you right there or outside where when it was

263
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,660
more formal it was a firing squad where you were actually tied to a pole with a

264
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:33,020
bag over your head but either way you're shot right you see the analogy

265
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,660
when it's an official execution by firing you were tied to a stake with a

266
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,960
bag you know you've seen that you've heard of it or seen the depictions of

267
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,260
that where many people were shot because of the group you know had enough of this

268
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,620
guy run in his mouth right so this is a little more formal it seems or it seems

269
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,000
like the people are taking the law into their own hands it seems versus taking

270
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
it to a priest so this is one of the fine points in the scripture where it

271
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,520
needs to be read in context and move further along but you know a lot of the

272
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,720
things that we just I just mentioned the past few minutes I've said before but I

273
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,980
think I threw in a little more detail so whether you apply it to what we're

274
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,220
discussing right now in Zachariah or just the general concept of how

275
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,960
executions capital punishment was done I think it's it's all right to say what

276
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,520
I just said so okay go ahead that's fine so I'm guessing then that the end of

277
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,120
this sort of versus saying that these guys will have been people will have

278
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,060
attempted to kill them or stone them but they will have failed and that's why

279
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,060
they have these hand piercings and then when they're asked about it they're

280
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,980
gonna lie and say well I was wounded at home I don't know why you would say I

281
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:56,000
was wounded at home by those who love me well who's speaking there who's

282
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,140
speaking there is an interesting thing it's a farmer guy yeah yeah I know that

283
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,460
it's it's but who is speaking really I mean you know how when you look at the

284
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,940
Psalms I'm not suggesting this I need to go back and look I'd like to do a study

285
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,880
on the book of Zechariah I'm glad you're bringing it up but you know when you read

286
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,140
the Psalms a lot of people have done studies on the Psalms like well this is

287
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,480
the Christ speaking through David right or it's the psalmist because there's a

288
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,340
what five or six or seven psalmists in there so so we need to look at just the

289
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,280
condition right now that you're bringing up and you know who's you know who's

290
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,000
saying yeah that's it that's an interesting thing to look at you know is

291
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,760
it the Christ speaking through there you know is he the one that's speaking

292
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,520
against Yahweh no so that has to be examined the translation needs to be

293
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,180
examined yeah but we know that it's the former pastor Ramon that's me so far

294
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,080
yeah so far because remember the Christ in in historically was considered to be

295
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,960
one of these even though he wasn't right if you read a historical accounts

296
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,760
outside of Scripture they paint him in a very negative light as you know a

297
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,980
negative spiritual character there is history in Scripture by the way most

298
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,880
people think it's all this stuff but there is the history that the gods are

299
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,760
concerned with you won't find iPhones and airplanes and trains and vaccines in

300
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:38,880
there actually you will find vaccines indirectly but anyway do we have an

301
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:47,100
exact time when this will happen as far as you know yeah after after 2025 yeah

302
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,280
and I know not an exact date but a time after this said this is after the

303
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,200
seven-year period is over yeah and when this seven-year period is over there

304
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,180
will be without a shadow of a doubt you will see that coming like just like you

305
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,860
would see you know the weather coming if you had access to you know weather

306
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:15,880
maps right this is this is forecasting with accuracy so this is the seven-year

307
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,240
period that's going to set everyone up in a Hollywood style fashion mind

308
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,760
control the I saw someone in chat I just want to NLP neuro linguistic

309
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,580
programming this is people talk about brainwashing you know from intelligence

310
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,260
agencies government religion whatever any authority brainwashes the public oh

311
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,640
you ain't seen nothing yet talk about brainwashing but at the same time

312
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,520
there's going to be expansion of the consciousness meaning you know what you

313
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,120
think about what you know into this direction of what's lawful what's you

314
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:01,220
know proper and changes yeah because remember as things come more and more

315
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,580
further after the 2025 2026 period no one's complaining about being deceived

316
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:15,740
you ever notice that so because the propaganda is so strong but it's also

317
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,420
backed up it's not pure propaganda because pure propaganda is just that

318
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,460
it's going to be backed up by substance and signs and visions and testimony of

319
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:39,640
these things and visual you know you know YouTube's on it right so yeah let me

320
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,640
just throw this in again I've said it maybe a thousand times that you're being

321
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,140
played folks you're being played but you're not being played by some scumbag

322
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:53,900
whatever attorney or mobster or punk you're being played by the gods so don't

323
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,460
feel bad but you're being played so in other words you're being set up to be

324
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:10,570
punked and it's well-deserved by the way so okay good so once people begin

325
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,510
learning these things as we've said they'll be predictably upset that they

326
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,830
haven't comprehended how simple in plain the truth is compared to the

327
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,630
traditional stuff that they've been fed and I would imagine that there would be

328
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,550
a fallout I mean I don't I haven't been to any of the Asian countries but it'll

329
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,050
be interesting to see for example how things would unfold there horribly

330
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:40,750
horribly for the monks and the religious authorities yeah but anyway people are

331
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:47,570
not familiar what they do to when the Asians get upset but I kind of respect

332
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,910
them for that like you know you could look this up if there's a corrupt

333
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,490
policeman in the name you know it's not like America the Western world they just

334
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:00,490
complain and the attorney that the cop is working for laughs at everybody no no

335
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,350
they know they find out where this guy lives and they pull him out of his house

336
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,830
and beat him to death right so you could look this up don't don't you know in Asia

337
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:19,070
so yeah they're gonna be what they're going to be dipped dipped and dived for

338
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,850
just like a lot of white people are non-white non-asians let's say you know I

339
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,670
don't know if you're born there and you're white or you're an Asian I guess

340
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:31,090
so but a lot of non the the stupidity of ancestral worship you know people say oh

341
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,450
I asked my I heard this white guy actually from Sweden he's saying that

342
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,230
you know I'm looking for help from my dead parents and I'm like you're an

343
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:44,630
idiot you know and all this you know you know this the typicals you know

344
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,110
religious stuff that comes out of Asia there's a lot of quote-unquote white

345
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,570
people or non Asians that have fallen for that stupidity too but they're they're

346
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,050
living in a different culture in a Western culture they're not going to

347
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:04,770
react like the Asians will in their culture so they will climb the Himalayas

348
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:15,820
and grab those monks and throw them off the cliffs yes they will so so yeah I

349
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,040
mean the follow-up for the Joel Osteen's and the ayatollahs of the world won't be

350
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,260
so nice but what will be understood is the fact that the religious leaders have

351
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,160
been very ignorant of what's in their professed text not just in terms of

352
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,500
pushing traditions like Christmas or Ramadan but you also have things like

353
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,560
Christians essentially teaching that the spirit is immortal when it says

354
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,980
very clearly in 1st Timothy that only God is immortal or Yahweh is immortal

355
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,500
right and they can't even define the spirit or the soul they interchange it

356
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,000
that's yeah so now we're going to talk about crazy people which is okay I'm

357
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,940
okay with it because Christians are just insane that's a that's easy to

358
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,760
surmise and it doesn't mean if you're insane you cannot ever be sane you can

359
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,580
but you you know if you talk crazy shit believe in crazy shit and don't want to

360
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,700
look up what you you know whatever you're you're crazy right it's pretty

361
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,940
simple doesn't mean that it's a terminal so the leaders of these people are

362
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:28,320
going to be held at a higher responsibility obviously and the

363
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,040
intention is not to dwell overly on that but there is an aspect of it that should

364
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,580
be looked at the fact that the on sort of the what they call the Jewish or the

365
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,940
Islamic side people are very ignorant of their own history of Jerusalem and they

366
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,860
don't even for example know where the Temple of Solomon was built or stood so

367
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,560
I'm right and the reason specifically though isn't I mean yeah you could say

368
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,240
that they're stupid or that they're crazy specifically though it's because

369
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,320
as Isaiah says in chapter 29 for Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep

370
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,980
sleep and has covered your eyes the prophets and he has covered your head

371
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,980
the seers and the entire vision of you is like the words of a book that is

372
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,660
sealed which men gave to one who knows books saying read this please and he

373
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,840
said I'm unable to read it for it is sealed and the book is given to one who

374
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,920
does not know books saying read this please and he said I have not known

375
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,680
books or basically I can't read which is kind of reminiscent of Greek speak

376
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,040
right or vice versa yeah I can't read it because I'm illiterate or I can't read

377
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:37,340
it because I'm blind yeah they have a spirit of deception that's been placed

378
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,300
on them which is why they don't know anything that's right that's right it

379
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,080
doesn't mean that you have to be and once you're aware of it you can wrestle

380
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,660
with it by the way and I mean that literally in your mind you know so

381
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,620
correct me if I'm wrong because as far as the temple stuff goes I have not had

382
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,240
enough time to look into it but I believe that the original temples were

383
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,980
situated on the southeastern ridge of the plateau that Jerusalem is on yeah

384
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,660
which is Ernest Martin and there's three other people in the 20th century who

385
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,580
came up with that it's not just Ernest Martin by the way but he's he's done the

386
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,460
most work on it and I could pull up their names by if you give me some time I

387
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,920
looked at these notes I did about five years ago on literary proofs or literary

388
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,900
apologetics on where the temple was and you know that was discussed as early as

389
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:46,100
the 1920s so okay yeah it was there for the simple reason that I figured out it

390
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,340
was there on my own initially without the details that after studying these

391
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,480
other men was through the prop the two prophecies that state Jerusalem be

392
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,560
plowed like a field and not one stone will be like left upon another and also

393
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:10,530
the third thing is that everything I was taught was a lie so and also the first

394
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,830
thing that I came up with to read on a on the temple was when I what's the

395
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,909
first thing if you want to look at a historical account of that time you're

396
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:29,290
going to run across our good friend Joe Josephus right and what did Josephus

397
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,270
write in one of his works he's been to Egypt he saw the temples and they're

398
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,590
nothing as an engineering marvel compared minimal compared to the

399
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,650
structure at the temple now when you look at that pile of rocks they call the

400
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,130
temple does does that look more astounding than the temple than the

401
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:54,870
pyramids of Giza no way not at all so there must have been something there

402
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,310
that was so far more interesting you see

403
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,080
absolutely so um in that case as far as a location that would have been where

404
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,220
the city of David was next to Mount Zion with the which is being on when you say

405
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,980
city of David that would be like the size of your average city park right now

406
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,600
and I'm not talking about the big parks talking like you know maybe a would be a

407
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,920
modern Cartesian square block or two you know because you could put a hundred

408
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,940
houses on a square block you know all around four sides let's say right so

409
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,960
when we say these things they're very small like Jerusalem is what not even 20

410
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,000
acres 30 acres you know or hectares of 15 hectares or you can it's very small

411
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,920
but good so yeah but before it so on when the city in order to destroy the

412
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,200
city of David it would take no low no less than or no more than a hundred or

413
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,920
two hundred people with pry bars that are about as you know a little more than

414
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,240
waist-high and a couple of donkeys and maybe 24 hours

415
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:16,570
hmm right and a simple a zippo you know what a zippo is right lighter cigarette

416
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:25,830
lighter okay no it doesn't seem like a size sizable camp but yeah so its

417
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:31,350
absence is no is there's no big deal it was our construction it could be

418
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:38,410
rebuilt in a month and the current religious authority seemed to be quite

419
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,230
unequated with that as well as the prophecies of the destruction of Mount

420
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,710
Zion and not Ophel where the temples were located which would have happened I

421
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,290
think in sometime in the Simon the Maccabee era last part in the second

422
00:36:53,290 --> 00:37:01,350
century BC so that particular destruction you can find that in Isaiah

423
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:07,930
29 but what's also stated is that Yahweh would cause them all to be blinded so

424
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:17,730
that they would sort of forget about it and for 2,000 for 2,000 years right so

425
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,790
um the particular verses pertaining to this is woe to Ariel woe to Ariel the

426
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,190
city where David dwelt and year to year let the festivals come around I shall

427
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,770
distress Ariel and there shall be mourning and sorrow and it shall be to

428
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:39,150
me as Ariel Isaiah 29 so what it seems to be addressing here is that Yahweh is

429
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,650
going to personally bring about some kind of a distress to Ariel and I guess

430
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,150
you would have to ask what is Ariel and what what I found is that it's a

431
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,630
symbolic name for both Jerusalem and the altar itself a burnt offering in the

432
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,650
temple sometimes the temple itself there seems to be an overlap but Ezekiel

433
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:02,490
does make it clear in chapter 43 that what Ariel is the altar because it says

434
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:09,190
the aerial or the altar of L is 12 cubits by 12 cubits and as describing

435
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:14,910
the dimensions and what it actually says is the aerial the aerial 12 long by 12

436
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,970
wide and I believe aerial is derived from the word are you are you meaning

437
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:27,050
lion so the altar literally means the line of L every L and that seems to be

438
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:33,510
it's a metaphor for perhaps the Holy of Holies or his central location because it

439
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:42,390
also denotes a place of fire or a place of cleansing but continue yeah so

440
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,290
basically what he's saying is that he's gonna put Jerusalem and the temple upon

441
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,050
the altar of burned offerings so that the city and the temple will become an area

442
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,390
and that would be destroyed in a similar manner that the altar flames consume

443
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:00,410
sacrifices seems to be what it is and then the following verse shows Yahweh

444
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,350
marshalling some kind of siege and other destroying machines against the city of

445
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,110
David in the temple I shall encamp against you all around and I shall lay

446
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,570
siege against you with a mound and I shall raise siege works against you so

447
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:17,730
on and so forth and then it talks about the city being destroyed and then

448
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,790
everything in that area will be lowered to the ground and submerged into the

449
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:27,050
bedrock until there's nothing left and I think we can see overlaps with Simon

450
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:33,190
the Hasmonean events in the second century BC because I think that there

451
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,270
were Gentiles Syrian Gentiles who had been living in the city of David for some

452
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,070
couple of decades and that created a conflict between the Judeans trying to

453
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:48,130
use the temple and these Gentiles and then if you see the destruction of the

454
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,370
area as Yahweh evicting these strangers then that's a fulfillment of that

455
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,690
prophecy because they do get kicked out and it was it was also voluntarily

456
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:03,510
dismantled and put back together because it was I think in Isaiah it was inhabited

457
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,650
by evil spirits right they were summoned meaning on the lower parts you

458
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:18,350
know right oh yeah I think there's and you know there's stories about a pig

459
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:24,470
being sacrificed their stories I mean you know left and right about it but but

460
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:30,570
either way there was definitely cosmic censorship and but these events did

461
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,190
happen and the temple is not what people you know are told politically it is or

462
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:44,490
religiously mm-hmm today right so the specific verses the multitude of your

463
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:49,010
strangers that is to say Zion strangers or the city of David strangers shall be

464
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,090
small like dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that

465
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,750
passes away and it shall be in an instant suddenly thou shall be visited

466
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,790
by Yahweh with thunder and an earthquake and great noise and storm and tempest

467
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,670
and flames of devouring fire and I think that we do there is some historical

468
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,010
records of an earthquake hitting Jerusalem at that point and also a fire

469
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,730
being the city being torched with fire soon after that so you can also see that

470
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:23,390
as being a continuation of that prophecy fulfillment it wasn't I don't know if it

471
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,470
was as big as the earthquake that happened the time of Isaiah in that you

472
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:35,950
read about in Amos that is brought up in other places as well but it was more

473
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:41,170
local but I have run into articles that were written about historical I haven't

474
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,710
seen the historical you know we know we're more direct actual history but

475
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,870
just articles about the weather in the time period then the earthquakes were

476
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:56,970
happening all through the first millennium there one report is you know a

477
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,150
along the Jordan Valley there was an earthquake and a schism opened up and

478
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,830
fire was coming out of it for 40 years you know I mean does that sound like an

479
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:10,970
exaggeration yes but nonetheless it's not good

480
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:22,360
yeah I've also read that at a later time the waters of the Gihon spring became

481
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,520
quite bitter to drink and later showed up would speculate that it was inhabited by

482
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,360
demons because they couldn't use water for anything so that would also be in

483
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,100
line with the prophecy about familiar spirits speaking from the ground and

484
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:42,000
occupying the region which is yeah Isaiah 29 4 or 5 or something and your

485
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,160
voice shall be like that of a medium out of the ground and your speech shall

486
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:53,220
whisper out the dust so yeah and also be aware folks this is a repeat of this

487
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,340
currently you know and when I go out into public I see it literally I see

488
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,900
people speaking and they don't know what they're saying but I'm not talking just

489
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,680
like you know some trashy thing or whatever I'm talking about like someone

490
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,020
who's a university astronomer and I'm not even part of the conversation to and

491
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,540
to instigate a little Greek you wrote in the wrong way so here's the thing it

492
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,320
was two people talking me and I was out of the way listening so imagine if I

493
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:32,620
went in there holy crap I didn't you know so right and like I said before

494
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,760
Isaiah 25 repeats a lot of this stuff that you have these walled cities that

495
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,620
will be brought down made into turn into dust and he lays the exalted city low

496
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,060
and so on and I think the city of David was at one point higher than even the

497
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,960
temple mount it was pretty elevated so you could say that that's being referred

498
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,480
to there also because they cut it down to the bedrock and actually submerged it

499
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,500
so all of this is probably what is eventually going to be understood once

500
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,800
this rejuvenation comes to Jerusalem and the censorship that the Jews and the

501
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,000
Muslims you have regarding the temple I mean that's intriguing it's an

502
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,580
intriguing showcase of how hopeless human beings are in the face of

503
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,380
external input because the temple never seems to be central to their way of life

504
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,420
the Judeans whether they were living in the region or whether they were living

505
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,860
abroad whether they were righteous or heretical whether they were secular or

506
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,140
following the law or whether they were young or old didn't really matter so it

507
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,900
would seem inconceivable that you know just a few years of Babylonian captivity

508
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,120
or problems at any other period of time when the temples were not operating

509
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,520
normally would have allowed the whole nation to forget where it stood for

510
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,380
almost 800 years but not only did the Israelites forget but even the Arabs

511
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,500
forgot because the temple was an international thing like everybody

512
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,660
knew where it was as a political group they did but there's always been

513
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,420
certain individuals that had gone to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage and did not go

514
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,700
up to that Fort Antola where they call the Dome of the Rock they went down by

515
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,820
the Gihon Spring there's always records of people know this is the other thing

516
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:17,020
when we speak about these things you know even cosmic censorship it's in

517
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,940
wholesale terms but not everyone you see but those those that are not the

518
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,840
everyone's are such a small group it's insignificant it's almost like not

519
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,720
having might as well say that they don't even exist that's how minor they

520
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:38,460
are there's always a witness by the way if you know what I mean right you even

521
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,940
if you don't know about it right that's why you know I tell people you know if

522
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,720
someone says I'm the only one who does that well there's just someone else you

523
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,780
just haven't heard of because typically there's a duplicity in this this thing

524
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:56,760
we call existence you know you know there's there's always going to be I

525
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,720
shouldn't say that in a way for sure but there's there's more than one you even

526
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:10,590
though you're just hearing one yeah it has been known but you know what do you

527
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,550
do you live in a community that says the temple is up here and you say no it's

528
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:24,460
not you'll be ostracized yeah but fortunately now you people can work a

529
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,100
job or a job and make enough to go about their own personal life with less

530
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,280
personal interaction I mean with less interaction with others that about their

531
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,720
personal life right I mean like one perfect thing would be to live in an area

532
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,940
and work out of the house or where you live so you don't have to interact with

533
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,820
these scumbags but that sounds rather antisocial Greek well you know what

534
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:55,700
you know everybody's got their own perspective on it I guess but I did that

535
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,660
once it was nice yeah it is it is it's quite cool actually we're a deserted

536
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,640
island and then they come to rescue you're like no we throw rocks at them go

537
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,440
home leave me alone leave me alone they're like no you got to come with us

538
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:18,340
because the attorneys can't get you from here well that's about all that I

539
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,920
have on this topic I mean it's fairly straightforward as far as just reading

540
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,760
the prophecies it's interesting like I said that they haven't picked up on it I

541
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,880
mean like you said there's always going to be select individuals or smaller

542
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,220
groups and I know that the rabbis have their sort of secrets that they keep I'm

543
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,320
sure that to some extent they know about it but it's not openly acknowledged I

544
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,980
think even if you read the the targums and the midrash they don't really

545
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,780
address this prophecy they're explicit in any explicit way it's just touched

546
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,840
upon lightly but they don't explain anything so even in their own yeah it's

547
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,300
it's just glossed over because if they looked at it they know that the temple

548
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,260
was not the domes rock but oh yeah oh yeah that's and it is quite well known I

549
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,180
think I've read brought up this story before I was once in California I was

550
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:15,180
speaking to a former Merced guy who was in the IDF and his I'm not going to give

551
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,100
I don't think well I'll give more detail his when his dad was a rabbi and when

552
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,720
his dad died 30,000 people came to the funeral so he was a popular rabbi right

553
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,020
and when I explained to him where the temple was he started crying and I

554
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,880
thought it was because of a quote-unquote religious faithful you

555
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,060
know revelatory moment of acknowledgement right and I said I'm

556
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,900
sorry it's so emotional to you he says well let me tell you why it's emotional

557
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:48,340
to me he says because there have been soldiers in the IDF Air Force that were

558
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,620
ready to do a suicide run with an f-16 jet into the temple of the mount to

559
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:59,060
destroy it to bring about you know apocalyptic you know a change and we had

560
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:05,110
to go and shoot them down and and he knew some of those guys that did that so

561
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:10,750
in other words because they're people are being lied to where it is you have

562
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,090
these suicidal types in the military that have access to it by the way if you

563
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,730
you know you people say about what do we do about chemtrail planes well it's up

564
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,410
to the mill you some if you have a true patriot in the US Air Force to go up

565
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,910
there and take one of those planes down I don't mean shoot it down but bring it

566
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,930
down you know what I mean but you they don't exist right it's America whatever

567
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:37,210
but he had mentioned to me that there were people in the Israeli military that

568
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:41,730
were planning on doing suicide runs on the temple mount what they call a temple

569
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,390
mount to cleanse it your change the condition there and they were taken up

570
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:51,670
by their own people that's why he was emotional about it it seemed like the

571
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,210
information of it not being the temple at all was secondary to his own personal

572
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,730
grief of that situation which is not discussed by the way this you don't hear

573
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,310
oh yeah we had to kill some Israeli IDF because they were planning on blowing up

574
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:11,050
the temple mount you know that doesn't quite make the news if you know what I

575
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:22,370
mean so I wanted to share that with in this sonic I think I have before so

576
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,880
that's an aspect of the grief it can cause right if you have a religious

577
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,560
zealot now their zealoty and their fervor is misdirected it's a waste of

578
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,440
time again isn't it where if they actually these religious zealots knew

579
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,600
where the temple was they would say well holy crap we can build it at any time

580
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:52,400
all we got it I think I think it's either a heritage site now or it's owned

581
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,520
by some Palestinian farmers or people I think but I think it's a heritage site

582
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,700
though meaning it's it's not considered to be under private ownership you know

583
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,320
but you know they know what to do the guy go if it's owned by a private

584
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,600
Palestinian the guy goes to sleep he wakes up dead you know that's that's how

585
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,240
these things work you know what I mean this is the world that you know he slips

586
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,060
on a banana peel or dies in a car accident you know these things are

587
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:30,170
strange how how human life is not regarded by the gods you know the gods

588
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:36,650
any God has no problem with taking out people for even no reason so that we

589
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,970
that we can see this is something people have to keep in the back of their minds

590
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:52,540
you're we're all expendable yeah they offer protection until your job is done

591
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,420
for them and then when you're done you're disposed of or dispatched to the

592
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,220
resurrection when I the reason why I say dispatch the resurrection because when

593
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,620
you're dead you have no consciousness so there might be a magneto dielectric

594
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,280
perception when you die that you hover over your body for a few seconds when

595
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,560
whatever demons are oppressing you or following you around grab that field and

596
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,720
push it around and you could see for a moment but then it's lights out or bright

597
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,180
light which is the ATP in the imploding in the body which is what keeps cells

598
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:32,260
going you know phosphates so anyway there's anyway that's just a counter a

599
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:41,620
little bit of the stupidity of the new age stuff well I'm good on this topic

600
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,960
unless there's something else you want to look at I'm kind of depleted

601
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,960
otherwise Oh except for some miscellaneous things here or there

602
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,020
speaking of looking at I brought up to someone earlier this is a total

603
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,600
lascivious talking about in my early days you know 60s and 70s an old man

604
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,980
gave me a World War two memorabilia and what was in there was put pin-up girls

605
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,100
if anyone remembers the concept of a pin-up girl giving the soldiers and one

606
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,020
of them was postcards and pinups of Virginia Bell so you guys look up

607
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:22,720
Virginia Bell and I brought this up to someone earlier here today we were

608
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,340
talking about you know World War two you know 1940s 1950s eras pinups so that's

609
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:36,600
something to look at what anyway it's nothing new you know what I mean by the

610
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,940
pinups you know they send soldiers a pretty girl those usually soft dick you

611
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:48,560
know if you know so anything to look at no there's always other than the

612
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:55,360
constant random stupidity on the it's easy to banter on these constant random

613
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,940
stupidity on the rectangle but you know what the newspapers are even worse and

614
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:06,720
the periodicals are even worse so you know print I think food clothing and

615
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,340
shelter is still the should be the paramount pursuit of upping the quality

616
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:17,240
of those things and it's not a trivial pursuit by the way and make make busy

617
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:23,480
time until your time is over otherwise and you know there's a lot to discuss on

618
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,480
food clothing and shelter and health and upping the quality of that

619
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,800
consistently I mean you know how in scripture it said that Christ did so

620
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,500
many things he filled so many books right you could fill all the books I mean

621
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,480
we can discuss from now till 2025 without stopping except for drinking

622
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,320
water on how to up food of clothing and shelter right that seems to be an

623
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:56,960
interesting thing always to discuss another thing to discuss is what's

624
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:04,040
coming with more detail and I'm always hesitant on doing I'd like to be more

625
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,540
redundant at this point because I don't I think that the the stuff that I brought

626
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:13,640
up is light years or miles ahead of anything else there's no reason to go

627
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,160
into more detail but there will be a reason to go into more detail in the

628
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,120
near future when I myself personally get more information from what's how it's

629
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,120
going to come you know what I mean so instead of giving out a myriad of

630
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,200
details now that might need some adjustment in the next year or two in

631
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,340
terms of the you know imparting the information of the details I'd rather

632
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,460
wait because there's going to be an opening up of certain quote-unquote

633
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:50,440
books and knowledge in this area to give more detail on so the only other thing I

634
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,480
would say about what's coming is if you are a student of prophecy which most

635
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,000
people hate that but most people you get a lot of lip service on they want to

636
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,100
learn and study but most people you know that's you know how you know you

637
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,680
know how I why I say that that most people actually hate finding out the

638
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,560
truth it doesn't matter what they say look at what they what what they do and

639
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,780
there's almost other than you and maybe one other that I don't see anyone really

640
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,240
studying or really putting something and this is not to disparage those that are

641
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,440
not I haven't you know haven't displayed it but I don't see much develop even on

642
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,460
the rectangle if you go on the rectangle and look up prophecy or biblical studies

643
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:40,520
it's still the same garbage that's always been on there so I think do you

644
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,800
want to be a garbage you know pick up crew you know like you ever see the guys

645
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,380
in parks with the bag and the spike and they pick up all the litter or do you

646
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:53,460
want to find some clean ground and start doing some pretty good study you know I

647
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:59,300
think the second is always best but and I don't think the time for that is still

648
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:05,280
yet to go into deeper study and then of course the book of Revelation is still

649
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,440
off-hands publicly I probably will always be I would like to pursue the

650
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,180
book of Zechariah in concert with of course you have to harmonize it to the

651
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,380
rest of scripture in concert though with the book of Daniel which by the way the

652
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:26,720
book of Daniel doesn't really come into play until after 2025 2027 even do you

653
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,500
know what I mean because it's the it's the last dynamic because if you read the

654
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,720
book of Daniel it's very dynamic you know what I mean and the dynamics don't

655
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,300
start until that time period you know the dynamic attributes of what they call

656
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,000
the Antichrist or instead of Christ yeah he's 20 years old right now yeah so if

657
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,640
you want to if you want to go to every world database and find every Assyrian

658
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,300
male that was born between 1997 in the year 2000 that would cover all of them

659
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,580
you could pin it you could find them pretty wouldn't be too hard I'm not

660
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,980
talking about remember that movie The Omen you know let's go find me you know

661
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:13,060
the son of Satan he's not the son of Satan by the way so anyway that's an

662
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,600
interesting thing of research look around for an exceptional 20 year old

663
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,800
Assyrians on the internet I don't know Facebook Twitter whatever website you

664
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,180
got some whiz kid kind of thing you know I'm using the term kid literally here

665
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:30,480
you know I mean or you know he's going to be a very upstanding individual

666
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,040
actually not a kid actually you might want to call him human he's probably in

667
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,120
the media right now and you don't even know it who this leader will be and the

668
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,960
reason I'm bringing this up is not to create a you know an air of intrigue

669
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,140
around this character but just to show you how there is no dynamics until after

670
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:57,780
that that relate to the book of Daniel after 2025 2027 around there in you know

671
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,360
and when I use those years they start in the spring like for example 2018 hasn't

672
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:10,400
really started yet right I mean starting soon it starts in the spring right so and

673
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:18,120
this is an interesting time period also watch for very this is I'm gonna I'll go

674
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,480
on I didn't want to I was thinking I've been researching this now for about six

675
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,800
months and I'm gonna go on the line and say it look for very rapid military

676
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,880
movements known as aggressive movements this year starting in the spring and

677
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:38,280
going till next spring or in and around the area of Israel you know what I mean

678
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,960
by that is like false flags assassinations political moves political

679
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,180
changes quite possibly I wouldn't say more than 50-50 the monarchy and Jordan

680
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:54,080
will be expelled around this time I wouldn't say that could happen even in

681
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,720
the next you know seven years from now but that would be an interesting thing

682
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,260
and the reason I'm bringing this up again is a few weeks ago there was an

683
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:07,560
article of the monarchy and Jordan had to expel his members of his family for

684
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:12,960
forming a violent coup against him right you could look this up it didn't

685
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,880
make you know front-page news but it was in the Jordanian Times I think or

686
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:24,400
whatever I'm on whatever is the name of the paper in Arabic so this is a year of

687
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,980
right now I would look for very rapid changes things that don't make sense what

688
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:34,000
I mean about false flags you know the Illuminati Illuminati's right and the

689
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,900
Freemasons and these guys guess what who's bidding they can't do anything

690
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,220
unless they're allowed to do it by various spiritual elements that are you

691
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,660
know taking marching orders from the most high so and what I mean by a false

692
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:54,460
flag is do you remember there was a Palestinian and alleged Palestinian

693
01:00:54,460 --> 01:01:00,200
vest suicide bomber about five or six years ago blew themselves up it wasn't

694
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:07,040
in Jerusalem but nearby I think in a tour bus on a busy street you said well

695
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,780
you know well Greek that happens all the time they were not really haven't been

696
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:19,100
any lately like that but why when I say false flag is the reports that came out

697
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:24,240
from boots on the ground there was a shop owner about 20 or 30 meters

698
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,420
downstreet from that explosion and when the security came around he they came in

699
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,620
and guess that collected body parts right because they had come through the

700
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:44,210
window but those body parts were frozen solid so what so okay for those of you

701
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:49,090
that need for me to piece it together for you no pun intended they loaded up

702
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:56,570
the bus with frozen cadavers and blew it up you get it anyway so who's they I

703
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,610
don't know was there a suicide bomber or not I don't know but I could tell you

704
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:04,950
from boots on the ground report was a frozen forearm and a frozen tibia came

705
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:09,030
through the window frozen solid and that doesn't happen in summer you know or

706
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,390
late spring Israel you know you don't have people walking around hard as rock

707
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:17,570
so so even even though that obviously was a false flag of some sort it did have a

708
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:22,230
political effect so don't mind the false flag aspect what I'm saying is watch out

709
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:26,050
for all of it right and even if it's shown to be a false like it still has a

710
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:32,050
political impact like give another commentary like right now they're

711
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,310
saying Netanyahu might be indicted by the police right I just saw that is yeah

712
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:42,190
that's completely the police have no authority to do that by the way it's

713
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:45,110
such a joke but you know everyone buys it because you know how I know everyone

714
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:48,830
buys it because no one knows the law the police don't work for the police don't

715
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:53,530
have any power like that even in Israel but that's what they're putting out

716
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:58,150
there because it's time for him to go it could be the tooth fairy is indicting

717
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,130
him and everyone would say yes he's being indicted he's a bad guy by the

718
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:07,170
tooth who's indicted tooth fairy but it doesn't matter even if you see so what I

719
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,210
mean how ridiculous is please can't indict anybody they're an agency they

720
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:15,590
work for the attorney but but that's what they're putting out and that's you

721
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:24,760
know so what it doesn't matter if it's you see how you know I mean anyway you

722
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,600
know this is a giving example you know you have a lot of people coming out in

723
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,520
the community now called whistleblowers you know of course of them

724
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,220
most of them are fake but you know how you know you got a genuine wish little

725
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:40,020
government whistleblower one of their first things and I thought the first

726
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,420
thing on the early in their impartment of what their purpose of speaking as

727
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:51,460
they call everyone and anyone working in their agency an idiot or stupid I'm

728
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,260
serious if you start saying here I'm a whistleblower from this agency or that

729
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:02,400
agency and they're doing this if they're they're not real but when you know you

730
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,240
got a real one when he says yeah I work for this agency and they're all a bunch

731
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,580
of idiots and you know if they didn't have guns and it's such bad things it

732
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:14,880
would be laughable right yeah okay yeah there so there you got how you have a

733
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,100
good testimony there and and I'm saying this from first-hand experience I've run

734
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:24,540
into guys you know various agencies and when you sit down so I said they're all

735
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:29,480
a bunch of idiots you didn't say some of them it's just like if you know people

736
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,020
in the military army Air Force Marines whatever that are not just grunts you

737
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,740
know like officers if you've ever read I've known people who had relatives and

738
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,080
they write lettered back letters back whether it's from Afghanistan Iraq or

739
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,220
where have you and they said there were their their own men are more dangerous

740
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,040
than the enemy and their own men are killing more of his own men than the

741
01:04:50,040 --> 01:05:03,570
enemy is every time and what you don't hear about that so anyway so I'm just

742
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:13,850
saying it because it's true no it's verifiable it's fine I just have one

743
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:19,290
last sort of biblical related thing because it's certain things I don't know

744
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:23,850
I guess it tickles certain sensibilities I've brought up the

745
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:29,530
Leviathan thing before and you gave a little bit of exposition on it we

746
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,970
couldn't really nail anything down specifically maybe it has a horn maybe

747
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:37,410
it doesn't but then I saw it in a different place when I'm reading up on

748
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:41,770
this Isaiah Zachariah prophecy more suit it's maybe a little more supernatural

749
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:47,750
than we thought right but go ahead well I don't know exactly what it is I mean

750
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:52,210
you come across in Isaiah 27 I was fishing around and just randomly came

751
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,990
across it in that day Yahweh shall visit with his sword hard great and steadfast

752
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:04,830
upon the Leviathan the fugitive serpent the torturous serpent and he will kill

753
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:09,730
the monster which is in the sea so what does this have to do with some random

754
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:13,830
sea monster because now it's almost speaking of it like it's the Nakash

755
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:19,010
using the word Nakash what do you know about Greek mythology and the sea

756
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:24,050
monster and what do you know about Canaanite mythology and the sea monster

757
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:30,130
what do you know about there are no accounts of Israelites going to the sea

758
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:35,970
as if they were almost didn't they're afraid of it the Danites did yeah they

759
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:39,130
did but you didn't see other you know you didn't see them as a group there

760
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:49,870
were on foot 99% of the time and 94% of them 99% of the time right let's see 90

761
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:57,110
yeah 93% of them 99% of the time are on foot unless they're walking on water no

762
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:02,450
pun intended yeah and what do you know about the the

763
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:14,590
God of the Canaanite God of the sea think about it actually not much do a

764
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:18,070
live search it sounds like you're in front of the rectangle I'm not I'm ready

765
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,830
to go outside for a moment and come back in I shouldn't lose reception but what

766
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:26,390
was there a Canaanite God of the sea I think it starts with a T or an A I think

767
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:34,070
it starts with a T this is gonna require some research yeah we're talking about

768
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:38,470
gods you know now or so we're you know are we crazy because we're talking about

769
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:44,190
things we can't see right now you know anyway I have a God called yeah God of

770
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:53,930
the sea yeah that's that's the one yeah you know come after your ass very

771
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,750
aggressive at the at a certain time period especially during the time of

772
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:04,020
Abraham and that such it was very aggressive I don't have any images

773
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:14,150
well I don't think anyone does and if they are they're contrived well it seems

774
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:21,020
as if Yahweh doesn't like him very much and I'm guessing I don't think Yahweh

775
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:27,060
likes anyone anymore but anyway no it takes a lot to please him at this point

776
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,560
because he's imagine someone that you like is standing in a landfill do you

777
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,939
really want to spend time looking at them you know it's like come on get out

778
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:46,680
of there already you know he doesn't have a lot of gods that he points out by

779
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,840
name and says that he has an issue I think Moloch is one but I don't think he

780
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,479
ever says he's gonna kill Moloch personally he does not saying no no hold

781
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:01,120
on a second I'm not saying that Yom is Leviathan and vice versa or any but I'm

782
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:09,600
just saying it is pretty flippin interesting to look at the condition you

783
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,700
know what I mean so what else Leviathan comes up about four times in scripture

784
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:29,479
five but he's always he's always painted as something undesirable that has to be

785
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:47,260
conquered yes so I don't yeah it's all very vague information but um you know

786
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:57,480
yeah for now it is vague mm-hmm but what I find I you know I can't it's hard to

787
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:02,380
reconcile this idea of the Nakash in Genesis being anthropomorphic but then

788
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,900
you're calling the Leviathan Nakash and that's not anthropomorphic presumably

789
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,580
right so you can't have it be both ways Nakash has to be of a certain is

790
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:16,900
apparently a certain species of Elohim it'd be nice to establish what that is

791
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:23,540
you can't have it be well Nakash is also isn't Nakash somewhere also translated

792
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:29,800
as divination or sorcery in the Old Testament in context in that context

793
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,220
well here's the interesting thing you know there's a certain arrogance about

794
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:46,140
living in this time period right now when I say arrogance I mean it goes back

795
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:49,460
to like that when the founding of the modern religions that we that are around

796
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,780
Islam modern Judaism and Christianity there's an arrogance instilled in that

797
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,300
right mm-hmm I'm not talking about the

798
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,460
stupidity of it I'm talking about the arrogance now you see what I mean the

799
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:08,540
pride and arrogance of it so the I think that that persistence of that pride and

800
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:15,960
arrogance and stupidity you know at tag it along you know it's it's okay to be I

801
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,340
don't know anyway like stupid people don't know they're stupid right but to

802
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:26,940
proud people know they're proud I would suggest that yes I would suggest that as

803
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,780
as time goes on we're gonna get a little more information on this and and you

804
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,380
know what you're ready I'll even go out on a limb and say this we might even get

805
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:41,520
manifestation of it so I mean there's always been very prominent snake worship

806
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,660
cults in most countries as far as go stretching back to ancient times so

807
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:53,200
there's something to trigger if something does manifest well the snake

808
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,700
was associated with the breath in ancient Egypt right I shouldn't say right

809
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:03,820
like it was wholeheartedly but if you study I don't even like to go in on

810
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:09,500
Egypt ology because it's such a fine line you know because it's such rubbish that's

811
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:16,300
out there it was associated with various aspects of life and more

812
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:24,300
specifically the what they call what we call the soul or the breath right that's

813
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:30,340
why you saw it on the Pharaoh's headdresses and things like that it was

814
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:35,880
not in certain Native Americans also associated with that they were I think

815
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:43,930
in Egyptian hieroglyphics a snake is written as the footless one you know but

816
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:49,410
you know by the way I'm just going to give a private thing I meditate on off

817
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:53,730
and you know what what I'm going to say sorry about that water there what I'm

818
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:57,710
going to say I'm we do a sonic event and I'm like who the hell cares no one

819
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:02,310
really wants to hear this stuff you know and on the other hand they say they do

820
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,790
but they you know it's like let's what should we talk about right that's this

821
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:11,130
is like a diversion now right but what should we talk about right so so and the

822
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,570
thing is there's lots to talk about but it really you know it really I think

823
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:21,990
giving people a heads-up is always the best way to give information you know

824
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,890
heads-up means what's coming next week what's coming next month what's coming

825
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:30,870
next year and also how to put things that have happened in perspective and is

826
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:37,910
defining Egypt a logical terms of a necessity I wouldn't say so at all unless

827
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:41,770
it matters you know it's poignant to something we're discussing I'll put it

828
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:46,410
even to this point that most of Scripture which I've gone publicly and

829
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:51,770
said many times has nothing to do with most people anyway getting into a lot of

830
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:57,070
the fine points without constantly being redundant about the overall story that

831
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:01,610
has a lot to do with everyone because their feet are on the ground that kind of

832
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:11,110
pertinence you see is another view of it so you know the concept of having a

833
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:18,770
reference you know commensurability Scripture is commensurable in almost

834
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:23,610
every other aspect of what they call mythology religion but except for the

835
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,050
ones that are completely diaposed you know like when they tell you you

836
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:31,350
die you go to heaven and I'm not talking about that I'm talking about certain

837
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,490
prophecies you know when you hear about the fifth the flood myth right you know

838
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:39,550
they call it the flood story every culture has one when you talk about end

839
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:44,410
times every culture you know says good people are going to be treated badly

840
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,890
good will be evil evil will be considered good there's going to be a

841
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:54,310
schism between male and female there's going to be a cleanup period you know

842
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:59,790
every culture has that you know so that's what's commensurable and just you

843
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:03,790
know commensurable meaning like if you say foot and yards they're commensurable

844
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,910
by inches or if you say meters and centimeters is commensurable by

845
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:11,630
millimeters in other words is a common denominator common divider Scripture is

846
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:17,630
a common divider for all things and those commensurable things those things

847
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,470
that can be shown that do affect everyone on the planet I think are of the

848
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:28,170
utmost importance importance to discuss but I will suggest also that the gods in

849
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:32,470
Scripture and the Most High are having their own little private wars that we

850
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:38,130
are not given a lot of information about and I mean that literally you know

851
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:43,970
when I say a private war right a war and that doesn't mean a hot war hop doesn't

852
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:47,430
you know when I said you could have you could be in a state of war and in

853
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:59,100
Stacey's also where nothing is going on yeah sure they are yeah so yeah so now

854
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,440
now we're good now we're gonna have to get nosy are we to find out about the

855
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:10,140
Leviathan yeah I mean you would have to look at some kind of a reference

856
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:17,020
material for you have to look at everything and then have find a good

857
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:23,790
reference to explain everything you have to look at every single sea monster

858
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:29,250
sea god sea creature that would be within that realm that range of size and

859
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:35,750
description everything and then what are you using as your reference is of course

860
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:42,050
the obvious Scripture right and archaeology good archaeology is is a good

861
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:47,690
is a good reference by the way that's where you really got to look at the

862
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:52,270
pictures folks when you when you do archaeology look at the pictures don't

863
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:57,390
read with these morons right I mean you could but you better have a very high

864
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:08,120
level of discernment look for pictures we know he's in the Mediterranean

865
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,940
somewhere because that's where the abyss is but beyond that I don't know I'm

866
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,200
guessing that is pretty significant is there under is there an underwater cave

867
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:26,790
that goes from the Mediterranean to one of the inland rivers you think hmm let's

868
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,490
just say I never said that let's bring that up in another time or maybe I will

869
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:39,500
in the future if I get more information on it so but these are just things that

870
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,980
you want in other words you know when you throw something like that statement

871
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,120
out there I just did I think it should actually have a relaxing effect on the

872
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:57,920
mind for rationality right you know I shouldn't stress anyone out there

873
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:04,600
shouldn't the only stress you should have is stress itself anyway whatever

874
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:11,900
that means so anyway the theme was you brought up good

875
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:17,100
never Zachariah I was about to say because I cried I did suggest in the

876
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:24,300
past that that is a pivotal book for studying understanding these times I

877
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:28,980
mean pivoting pivotal meaning that a lot of things are gonna rotate you know

878
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,500
there's gonna be a lot of movement and the only one explain you won't be able

879
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,760
to explain why these things are happening geopolitically and locally in

880
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,960
that part of the world or it possibly your neighborhood unless you understand

881
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,840
the things that are going to be coming listed in the book of Zachariah and then

882
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,980
after that most likely later on will be more things listed in the book of Daniel

883
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:54,100
and Revelation when she actually I won't I'll just say if you study the book

884
01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:02,940
Revelation most of it happens in one day so you know most of the dynamics that

885
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:07,220
occur on earth let me just say most of it you know because you know most of it

886
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:12,240
is actual dictation right you know like a third but it's like a third party

887
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,560
dictation it's like you're watching someone receiving dictation that's what

888
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:22,240
most of it is but the actual dynamics on earth happened one day so once it starts

889
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,340
you won't have a lot I mean it's just in a day's work right you know what I mean

890
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:31,980
so it'll happen quick you know in other words it's like have you ever had a

891
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:39,720
dislocated shoulder or known anyone who has when the arm comes out of the socket

892
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,320
enough what they do is they they sit you down and say okay you're gonna go

893
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,100
see the doctor and before you see the doctor these two orderlies are going to

894
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,820
help you out these big guys and they say listen we're gonna pull your arm back on

895
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:56,740
three so you're you're in pain and then they're like one two boom and they pull

896
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:01,620
your arm on two not on three because they know on three you're gonna tighten

897
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:06,100
up right you're expecting it they pull it a little sooner you see what I mean

898
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,420
if you tell someone I'm going to pull this part of your body that hurts on

899
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,960
three guess what happens when the number three comes you cringe you tighten up

900
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:19,620
you flex you right but if I tell you I'm gonna pull it on three and I pull it on

901
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:28,620
one and a half or two you didn't see it coming did you so yeah most of the

902
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,460
idiots that are alive today are not going to see anything any of the stuff

903
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:41,380
we've ever discussed coming at all on this planet they can't so I hate to tell

904
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:45,020
people this but I people born in the past few hundred years because it goes by

905
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:51,440
generation you're born here to be target practice for the gods I'm sorry you're

906
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:57,740
not mentioned at all you're mentioned in the most negative possible light it's

907
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:02,880
like breeding it's like breeding creatures to be blown up no different

908
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:09,760
than except for a very small group which is listed out how it's going to be

909
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,060
done separated it's just like a movie set you ever see movie sets when they

910
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,420
spend all this time before CG building them you spent weeks and months building

911
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:25,560
them and just to blow them up in five minutes don't take it personally though

912
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,320
see if you got some other punk human doing it yeah you might want to take it

913
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,500
personally get out of the get out of the situation but when the gods are doing it

914
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:40,400
now you ain't going nowhere and that's the positive stuff you don't want to

915
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,280
hear me say the note the negative stuff is keep that to myself I was I'm not

916
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:51,240
gonna tell you what I really think you've heard that before so don't take it

917
01:21:51,240 --> 01:22:01,260
personally how can you not take it personally well you'll see later food

918
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:10,080
clothing shelter is there any progress on finding about finding out about this

919
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,900
thing regarding the satellite geo imagery emissions that can locate where

920
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:20,140
the four Eden rivers were you know I have to go back and look at that again

921
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:24,720
but there has been information coming up and going away and I don't is there

922
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,500
anything on the rectangle about that by the way I haven't looked into it really

923
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:36,700
did we mention that publicly or do you and I do it in a private it was public

924
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:46,540
that was from a discussion I've had with someone that worked in geophysics you

925
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:51,040
know oil companies and mineral companies they've been putting information

926
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:57,100
together so much for the past you know 75 80 years since of airplane flight and

927
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:00,140
by the way when you're in airplanes photographing the earth to use what's

928
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:04,940
called stereo photography right it's a two cameras and when you view the print

929
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:09,640
you view through a stereoscope you know and gives you a 3d image very important

930
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,040
so it's very different than looking at images on the internet or whatever

931
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:20,140
yeah and this is these are things that are being bounced around and I hear that

932
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:24,920
it was shut down once their biblical references came up in other words you

933
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:31,090
know study into that area so let's let's just say that's a field of study

934
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:36,230
that needs to be continued right and we'll see if we can bring up if I can on

935
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:46,750
my end work on that in the future so I guess moving away from sort of biblical

936
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:50,750
things you talk a bit more about how the food market works in general like when

937
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:54,070
you mention how the fish is always going to be two years or one year old right

938
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,550
kept in storage the typical fish you know the stuff that people buy in the

939
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:03,990
market not all fish but you know the you know what what do people eat

940
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:09,850
halibut salmon tuna those are them and whitefish flounder those are the main

941
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:14,650
staple you know when you ask someone you know fish most Americans use it fishes

942
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:20,330
fish they can't even discern you know those types of fish you know like the

943
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:25,770
ones you get at the fast-food stores and restaurants yeah what they do is in

944
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:32,930
order to keep the market stable is you have inventory to meet demand so you can

945
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:37,090
you can do you know commodities markets work on that they look at charts of how

946
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:43,270
what the demand has been on a particular item and in order to keep it stable they

947
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:48,890
have extra on background you know so most most of these fish from what was

948
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:53,130
this from someone in the industry that told me that that you when you go out to

949
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:58,230
eat or in the store the typical you know commercial fish that is already two

950
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:04,070
years old you know it's a season and also with fruit as well apples can be

951
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:12,070
stored in nitrogen for over a year right leafy greens obviously not but certain

952
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:18,270
things like certain citrus certain hard you know fleshy fruits like apples and

953
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:21,930
pears and things can be over a year old and they're and they're gotten from all

954
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:27,010
over the world put in storehouses and then put on the market accordingly you

955
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:35,660
know as as they would be expected what does that do for the efficacy and

956
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:44,940
vitality of the food not much so yeah the veg believe it or not there's more

957
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:50,800
veg sold than meat on the food market you know non-meat you know you know so

958
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,300
that is really the focus of when you speaking of food supply how that is

959
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:02,040
controlled it's not good by the way but it's good enough to keep you alive

960
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:19,000
no one on the meat front yeah meat is pretty pretty sketchy that that on the

961
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,780
meat front here to give an example how that works back in the 80s there was a

962
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:27,600
red meat scare you know like red meat was bad for you and then I think there

963
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,340
was some kind of a boycott with or internal transportation issue or

964
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:42,160
something but red meat cow meat bovine got a bad rap so the slaughter rate and

965
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:47,620
the meat being animals being slaughtered for their meat went down drastically but

966
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:54,500
the the demand for leather goods did not so the leather good supply was

967
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:58,680
supplied by the animal being slaughtered for meat and the leather going to the

968
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:03,680
leather side of the economy right but when the cows were let's say stop being

969
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,800
slaughtered at a high rate guess what happened to the leather the demand

970
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:13,120
stayed up but the supply went down so if anyone remembers in the 1980s if you

971
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,700
bought a leather jacket that was a hundred bucks all of a sudden next year

972
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:23,200
it's 200 bucks or leather shoes right that were made from cow you know the

973
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,180
price of all these things jumped up so there's certain things that can't be

974
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:31,120
controlled like that you know when they're tied in hand in hand like for

975
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:38,000
example if just to put it more simply restating the whole thing if people

976
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,560
decided not to eat cow meat or bovine meat that's fine but they also have to

977
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:51,820
decide that they no longer have a demand for what leather right the skin

978
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:57,340
of the animal you can't say you or we're going to diminish the demand of the

979
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:03,500
flesh and the muscles of the animal but we want to keep the the demand for its

980
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:08,440
hide up well now you're going to be slaughtering cows for their hide and

981
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:14,540
what that created was a big boom in research of synthetic leathers if you go

982
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:19,200
on the market today there are some even synthetic petard leathers that unless

983
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,020
you really know leather or look at the back very closely you can fool your

984
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:32,460
average person with it you know what I mean so that's one thing that the plant

985
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:40,380
world will have a hard time substituting for is a leather type material you can

986
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:53,150
achieve it using composites you know plant fibers with resins right so that's

987
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:56,610
an aspect of the food market that is rarely discussed you know when you have

988
01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:02,690
a by-product that is in demand and the main product does not it drives a

989
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:09,550
synthetic market doesn't it you can have a breathable synthetic leather it does

990
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:19,880
exist it's not on the market I think as it could be like for example you know

991
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:26,500
like Ferrari got it got into one point the exotic car manufacturer where they

992
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:37,260
actually started ranches on their own to breed cows that were not contained by

993
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,140
barbed wire because if you've been around cows you know they'll be eating

994
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,140
grass and they'll lean up against barbed wire and they'll cut themselves and they

995
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:48,560
don't mind it too much but when their hide is harvested you see the scar on

996
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:55,260
the hide and when you're putting together a 200-300,000 whatever car you

997
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,960
don't you know you want perfect leather so they actually got into that aspect of

998
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:09,460
it now the the aspect of food I'd never really like going on record to say I'm a

999
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:12,720
vegetarian but it is most the most noble diet

1000
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:20,160
noble versus base would be to eat a plant-based diet and like I say I've

1001
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:26,180
been saying for a decade and more a decade and a half what's 2003 that's a

1002
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:31,820
that's 15 years right so it's more than a decade so what they call 2003 this the

1003
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:36,640
scriptures indirectly promotes a vegetarian diet not directly but

1004
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:41,360
indirectly right what I mean by that it doesn't say be vegetarian or eat only

1005
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:46,440
plants even though it does state I have the plants for as your food it doesn't

1006
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:51,260
say only and also in Leviticus it does state that if you touch the flesh of a

1007
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:56,860
dead animal you're unclean if you put a chicken sandwich to your mouth or a goat

1008
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:02,460
sandwich goat roti or whatever is that the flesh of a dead animal yes it is you

1009
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:07,400
so it doesn't say directly but indirectly it's it's about as strong as

1010
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:12,520
it gets right so that's why I would say the most noble diet to have and I'll go

1011
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:22,800
on record to say is to eat that vegetable matter and noble but more

1012
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,040
specifically I mean if we're just gonna be practical because most people can't

1013
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,240
understand scripture what you're talking about anyway why does the plant diet

1014
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:39,100
offer a higher quality and volume of nutrition I would suggest that you have

1015
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:44,840
to have you know I've said the scripture is about the written by the

1016
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,920
gods to the gods and we just happen to get it so you know it's given to us

1017
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,900
also you know as a CC car you know we know someone CC's it's been forwarded to

1018
01:31:53,900 --> 01:32:00,920
us that's how you one would view it and there's very high level of science in

1019
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,600
there what the gods consider to be clean or unclean or tomorrow to me you know

1020
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:13,300
which is not clean right is is within their obviousness there's a certain you

1021
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:18,120
ever notice certain things in scripture it's it's do's and don'ts have an

1022
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:22,640
obviousness heir to them you know and if you ask why it's like well it's if you

1023
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:28,960
have to ask why it's not for you I usually say you know that's why you know

1024
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,740
the legalistic part of scripture starts out in Genesis he made this and it was

1025
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:37,120
good he made this it was good in the land separated this it was good he made

1026
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,560
the animals it was good but then you know people get to the part where the

1027
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,920
laws and the behavior oh and that's not good right you see so it's it's a it's a

1028
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:52,560
contrast on the human character as well but other than saying that about

1029
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:58,300
scripture if you look at what science gleans around nutrition you let's say

1030
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:05,420
protein you know a slab of meat might give you 30 or 40 grams of protein and a

1031
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:12,560
vegetable serving might only give you seven or eight and people think well then

1032
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,920
if I want protein I need to eat meat but what science doesn't tell you is in

1033
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:22,800
terms of biocompatibility only four or five grams of that protein if not less

1034
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,220
of the meat is compatible and about seven or eight grams of the vegetable is

1035
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:33,640
biocompatible so where are you going to get more protein now the plant but the

1036
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:39,040
meats gonna transmute anyway so what's compatibility about compatibility means

1037
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,320
what how the body reacts to it give you another example I knew guys sold life

1038
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,940
insurance back 20 years ago so and when you agree to get on that they send you a

1039
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,920
postcard you're supposed to prick your finger and there's like dots on there

1040
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,020
and put two blood samples and send it in so I test you for AIDS right and I said

1041
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:01,460
you know I know these people here go talk to him selling life insurance as

1042
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:05,060
well you know I warned them about you anyway if they're dumb enough to go for

1043
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:08,560
it that's between you and them and I said all these people will beat will have

1044
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,620
AIDS even though they had don't have AIDS I said I said how are you gonna do

1045
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:16,440
that so you'll see so what when these people did this blood test thing for the

1046
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:21,100
life insurance thing I told him go to a steakhouse if especially if you eat meat

1047
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:25,100
and eat a really rare steak I mean if you like rare steak it's even better but

1048
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:29,480
get it like really rare and he don't eat a good sized portion of it and then wait

1049
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:32,400
about two hours and then do a blood test and you're gonna come in as like a

1050
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,980
possibility you know very strong you know like they want to test you again

1051
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:40,780
that you might have AIDS right because when you eat that meat within a few hours

1052
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:45,240
if you do what's called an AIDS test you're gonna show a mild to strong

1053
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,320
positive that you have AIDS even though you don't you know because of the

1054
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:56,820
mitochondria junk that's put in the blood right so I was just messing with

1055
01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:00,680
them but it was a good it was a good point it's provable what I just told

1056
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,740
you if you know in the past 20 years they probably changed the criteria of

1057
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,200
that because they're looking for viruses that don't exist so they

1058
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:12,460
whenever you perpetrate a fraud like electrons or viruses or protons or or

1059
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,440
you know whatever you have to keep changing it to keep your victims off

1060
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:26,220
balance right you can change the criteria of how you define it so anyway

1061
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:33,770
yeah just pass this through the body I had a conversation today out in the

1062
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:38,810
market with a so-called person worked in a one of these health food stores I

1063
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:44,010
said pull up a image of the intestines you know from the lumen all the way to

1064
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:47,090
the wall and all that and they looked at it and I said okay now I want you to pull

1065
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:52,530
up an image of a steel belted radial tire or cross-section and they looked at

1066
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:56,150
it and they're like they look alike I said yes that's right you're the first

1067
01:35:56,150 --> 01:36:01,170
person that ever came across and said yes they look alike how much absorbing does

1068
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:09,700
a steel belted radial truck tire do none intended you can when you look at in a

1069
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:13,520
human intestine or animal intestine there is absolutely no intention of

1070
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,760
absorption there as a matter of fact if it does happen you will die of sepsis or

1071
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:26,060
get sepsis in a in a way you see so you know the the other thing of it is Sam

1072
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:32,900
what do you see with your eye and your perception with a clear mind right you

1073
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,640
let me give you an example you ask most people in the Western world especially

1074
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,320
children where does milk come from or meat come from you know what they say

1075
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:46,760
comes from the store they don't know what it's like to have a pet animal and

1076
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,640
a pet cow or a pet goat or a pet chicken and kill it and eat it your appetite

1077
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:57,400
goes down really fast when you're not used to it and even when you're used to

1078
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:07,410
it you don't do it often it's funny over here there's a there's a fast-food

1079
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:14,490
place in America and it's called chick something I'm not gonna fi LA whatever

1080
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,530
and and I call it the born-again chicken sandwiches because they you know they

1081
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:22,090
pride themselves and being closed on Sunday they're boarding and Christians

1082
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:25,470
right I said oh you're gonna go get a boarding and you want one of these says

1083
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,910
someone wants offer is that I don't want a boarding and chicken sandwich you know

1084
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:33,590
I mean but anyway they don't know what they're doing and you know but anyway I

1085
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:37,830
just had to throw that in there as a little dig perhaps you want a boarding

1086
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:45,810
and chicken sandwich you see how ridiculous yeah hopefully it's in season

1087
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:52,390
you want to eat seasonally because the body works optimally right if you can

1088
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:57,130
actually it's not about if you can you should it's one of those things that you

1089
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:02,250
almost cannot you should not elect as being optional you should avoid things

1090
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:06,310
that don't grow within the cross latitude in other words if it comes from

1091
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:12,330
across the world that place where it comes from is it does that place have

1092
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:19,210
the same climate and weather as you do and if it does you'd be safe but the best

1093
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:26,030
is to eat locally that's why you can kiss mankind goodbye because most of the

1094
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:30,770
markets are international until that goes away with you well the only way

1095
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:35,510
international markets will go away as with disaster and catastrophe right you

1096
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:39,770
know the ability to ship things goes away and that's not going to happen

1097
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:55,420
post cleanup post mop-up yeah there are foods that can mentally slow you down

1098
01:38:55,420 --> 01:39:00,300
yes I mean like have a permanent effect on your mental processes as far as being

1099
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:07,480
able to think and recall and fluidity of thought yes logical sequences I have

1100
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:12,540
a I have a test for that very simple and anyone can do this at any age I used to

1101
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:16,900
do it with younger people because believe it or not as time goes on you'll

1102
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:22,180
notice most of the health complaints are coming from younger people right more

1103
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:28,200
more and more before you eat something write your name you know or the name

1104
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:35,140
sign it or or however you write whether it's in print or script have a meal and

1105
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,580
wait five or ten minutes after the meal and write your name again but on a

1106
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:45,680
separate piece of paper and then compare the two you know we could wait a half

1107
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:51,760
hour than wait an hour and you'll notice that let's say you have some junk food

1108
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,500
you know stuff that's offered at the market today and you eat it and you

1109
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,480
write your name and you'll notice sometimes that you know it's not being

1110
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,860
written as you're writing it you know it's screwed up that's how negative the

1111
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:09,320
effect can be you see and what that's a motor skill test right you know from the

1112
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:14,460
mind to the hand by the way that's a whole other thing to discuss by the way

1113
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:20,180
you know how you see in scripture the arm is you know of Yahweh and this and

1114
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,440
that you know does the you know that does your hand ever do anything that your

1115
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:28,960
mind doesn't want it to do does the body do anything that the brain doesn't

1116
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:34,960
want it to do you know what I mean so so when you read those things you know

1117
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,960
anyway that is a very simple motor skill test you know you'd think certain

1118
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:48,180
athletes would well they do athletes are very picky about what they eat

1119
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,620
specifically on how it reacts to themselves like sometimes if you're

1120
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:54,800
around athletes and you offer something even though it is considered a

1121
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,760
good food they may not want it because and yes and why is I don't like the way

1122
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:03,500
I feel when I do that right they know that it messes up their motor skills so

1123
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,220
the easiest way to see that as motor skills like give you an example six year

1124
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:13,940
old girl eight year old boy 13 year old girl all in the same room having sweet

1125
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:20,380
snacks chocolate milk ask them to write their name all right they can write at

1126
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:26,040
that age and and then have the snacks wait 15 minutes and what the interesting

1127
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:31,000
thing was they couldn't even write it across the line it was like it was

1128
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,100
ruled paper it went down it went across a little bit then it went down on a 45

1129
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:43,690
degree angle I mean that's how critical it was with these small people so

1130
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:47,510
imagine people going to junk food even you know born-again chicken sandwiches

1131
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:52,990
through a drive-thru they're eating this crap and and they're behind the

1132
01:41:52,990 --> 01:42:00,670
wheel which is a 5,000 pound you know or 2,500 or kilo missile on rubber tires

1133
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:15,190
right I mean the reason I ask is from personal I guess observation of

1134
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:19,170
something that would have transpired because when I was a kid I had a

1135
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:24,590
certain way of being able to think and then once I graduated high school and

1136
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:28,190
left the third world country that I was living in and came back to the West

1137
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:32,310
something changed quite noticeably and of course at that point I wouldn't connect

1138
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:36,970
it to the food but there's a certain fluidity of thought that when I was 15

1139
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:40,710
16 just doesn't exist anymore I guess I would have to trace it to

1140
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:45,210
something in the food but even when I was a teenager living where I was living we

1141
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:51,450
ate junk food it was powdered milk it was you know Oreos and whatnot alongside

1142
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:55,370
whatever local food that we were eating but for some reason the effect became

1143
01:42:55,370 --> 01:43:03,880
more pronounced when I moved back to the West oh yeah the gods the gods have a

1144
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:08,320
funny way of doing stuff like that you know think of it this way if you have an

1145
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,620
organism living on a planet and it's living on the planet because of food and

1146
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:17,560
water and air you want to mess around with them you what you don't have to

1147
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,900
mess around with them you just mess around with their food water and air

1148
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:31,440
don't you right yeah I mean that's that's how you get rid of a monster you

1149
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:37,860
don't by the way fight it you starve it or poison it you know through its food

1150
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:43,540
supply so you got seven and a half billion monsters walking around potential

1151
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:48,300
monsters the gods are like oh yeah these guys they won't even see it coming they

1152
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,680
don't even know what's going on and they never will well I mean not until you

1153
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:56,420
know never when I say never I mean and within the ever within the ever if it

1154
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:06,450
doesn't happen then it's never you know I mean and I've reiterated this in the

1155
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:09,530
last sonic event if you got problems in your life it's not you it's people

1156
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:15,890
around you by the way if you if you know the truth yeah so but if you go back to

1157
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:20,010
their ways and you know like all these self-help gurus you know just wake up

1158
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:23,630
and say oh I'm so glad for all the things that I got and everyone around me

1159
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:27,350
bullshit well go back to that and you'll see everything will start getting

1160
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:33,470
better for you right because now you're in accord so the hardest thing about

1161
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:39,070
finding out the truth is how do you live with the morons around you gracefully

1162
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:44,570
right and that's something I've never really gotten into too much but that is

1163
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:49,470
also something that is absolutely necessary to be able to do which is

1164
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:53,610
actually you'll be expending twice the energy because on one side you're

1165
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:57,690
running the program of reality real reality and then the other one you have

1166
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:02,250
to project the program of stupidity because of the people around you by the

1167
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:06,130
way I have an interesting letter to read in a little bit which might be

1168
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:10,670
interesting unless you have any other thoughts on on that I got a letter in

1169
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:17,190
the mail it's actually a lawsuit and I'm going to read it I think would be I was

1170
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:24,030
going to scan it and post it up but I'd rather just read it I mean it'd be

1171
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:32,460
interesting and I want to say a lawsuit it's it's it's formal you know you will

1172
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:39,400
I'll keep it anonymous but I'll use the initials instead how's that yes and it's

1173
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:46,310
regarding sonic events by the way oh so whoever is bringing it to you listens

1174
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:55,030
to Greek speak yep that's fine yeah and I think there'll be you know let me see

1175
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:59,130
if I could bring this up I was I didn't really think about it when I got it a

1176
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:03,530
few days ago I was thinking oh this will be interesting to read then I just kind

1177
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:13,390
of forgot about it till just now I'm gonna keep it anonymous which is not that

1178
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:19,410
difficult you know when you look at a lawsuit how it's printed out it's got

1179
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:29,610
the case on the left and all the other details and all this other stuff one two

1180
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:38,070
yeah it's two and a half pages or two pages okay here we go you ready the

1181
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:43,930

1192
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:54,390
opinion via internet radio broadcasts worldwide CP the plaintiff versus the

1193
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:59,570
Greek claimant and the case is over number episode number nine Ocelli and

1194
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:07,690
the Greek February 2nd 2017 in caps underscored objections by plaintiff

1195
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:11,210
regarding comment made by claimant about all surface-dwelling earth inhabitants

1196
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:16,610
aka space eaters of the earth comes now the plaintiff CP and respectively

1197
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:22,690
respectfully states as follows all caps objection I hereby object to the

1198
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:25,350
statement made by the claimant on the American Freedom Radio broadcast

1199
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:29,710
February 2nd 2017 here the Chuck Ocelli show on episode 9 of Ocelli and the

1200
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:33,730
Greek statement of facts claimant made the following statement on internet

1201
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:38,510
broadcast via American Freedom Radio quote that's why I tell people everyone

1202
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:42,470
you've ever known everyone you know and everyone you will meet as a moron and

1203
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:45,690
I've been telling this to people for more than a decade and no one's

1204
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:51,230
rebutted it so now you know legally it stands the Greek spoken by the Greek on

1205
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:56,370
Ocelli and the Greek to 9 2017 while that may be true that from the time of

1206
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:59,870
birth until some 36 years after the fact the plaintiff could not be considered

1207
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:03,950
quote a moron spiritually speaking but he has since demonstrated through much

1208
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:07,530
study observation and practice of scriptural law and is no longer a quote

1209
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:11,770
moron that being said the plaintiff does agree that through the observation the

1210
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:17,170
majority which is 99.99999% of the space eaters inhabiting planet earth do

1211
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:22,210
indeed have the mental capacity of a 12 year old child has since grown beyond

1212
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:26,310
that to one of approximately 21 years of age even though the plaintiff is

1213
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:29,970
significantly older the plaintiff has matured demonstratively beyond the

1214
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:33,890
spiritual quote moron through maturation and objective engagement of historical

1215
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:37,510
study and observation of not only his own behavior but that of his immediate

1216
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:40,630
surroundings as well as a significant number of years of scriptural study and

1217
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:44,990
practice albeit he has since realized that the versions of KGV of scripture

1218
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:48,890
quote he has engaged in tremendously inadequate when utilizing original

1219
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:52,450
languages of preservation through interlinear comparison where for CP

1220
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:56,590
praise and demands but the historical record reflected the Greek statement no

1221
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:00,730
longer stands unrebutted be that the plaintiff's historical record reflect

1222
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:04,150
that he is indeed matured beyond the mental state of eight or twelve year old

1223
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:08,430
child see the plaintiff intends to continually mature beyond that of a 21

1224
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:12,270
year old earth inhabitant to that of a mature and lawful man reflecting his

1225
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:17,890
papal age which shall not be revealed in this objection sign CP pro se litigant

1226
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:21,570
such-and-such and so certificate of service this is to certify that a true

1227
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:24,210
and exact copy of the foregoing instrument has been sent via United

1228
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:28,650
States mail postage space to the Greek blah blah blah on this 31st day of

1229
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:34,990
January papal subject calendar lawfully 31st day of the 11th month year yet to be

1230
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:42,510
lawfully determined CP signed so in that case I will demur and state that we

1231
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:57,070
do have a viable objection and we can't and somehow state the facts herein as

1232
01:50:57,070 --> 01:51:05,090
being accepted as fact and we and and properly rebutted so that's one out of

1233
01:51:05,090 --> 01:51:12,560
over a decade so there you go and there's quite an effort made I mean look

1234
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:18,460
is it a gag you know Bruce I showed you know is it a joke no it's not it's this

1235
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:24,680
is a proper statement because why because now we have what of it a written

1236
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:33,320
record of it and a sonic record of it isn't that interesting so the let the

1237
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:41,640
record stand as such that this has been rebutted and it stands until further

1238
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:46,640
changes are admitted or other admissions but so far all the admissions and

1239
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:53,500
evidence provided grant an exception with this particular man known as CP and by

1240
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:59,920
the way thank you for your continuing support CP and your diligence and I

1241
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,260
figured you wouldn't mind me reading Senate it reading this out if you are

1242
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:10,020
listening you call in if you want but either way I just I thought that would

1243
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:22,480
be an interesting little thing to throw in good for CP I mean it is self

1244
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:29,840
analysis though well whatever it is I thought it would be apropos to to read

1245
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:35,320
read it because it is done properly it's more than yeah in other words it's self

1246
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:40,940
and out but it was also addressing you see the whole the whole issue which was

1247
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:53,350
what I had said it was done properly you like that Bruce yes I did Greek it

1248
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:58,930
was most interesting what I might do is just scan it using one of those silly

1249
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:03,070
pads actually they I was told you don't even need one of these flatbed scanners

1250
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:07,490
anymore because that iPad thing does just as good right yeah they're not too

1251
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:12,010
bad not too bad yeah pretty close and and I'll just take off some of the

1252
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:16,870
personal info on both sides and I'll put it on an imager thing maybe that does

1253
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:21,330
that work well for you yes that does imagery you could capture it and maybe

1254
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:27,110
convenience what's that at your convenience yeah I'll do and then I think

1255
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:30,570
that would be something you might like to put up in images thing I will

1256
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:39,650
certainly put it up yeah all right I'm not near the rectangle now I am in the

1257
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:45,010
office actually but let's see is there anything going on in chat getting hit up

1258
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:56,850
on Skype as well let's see not really what's anything else you want to add or

1259
01:53:56,850 --> 01:54:05,810
take away Bruce or Sam no I was I I've been taken away by your discussions

1260
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:07,790
again you and you and Sam both

1261
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:14,750
but what's this a study on socialist countries that you came across with for

1262
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:18,110
the doctor said that when it says that when the doctors want to strike them

1263
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:22,770
mortgages were empty yeah they did oh I look it up is there anything left of it

1264
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:27,950
online no I don't even know what to search for what's this what's this put

1265
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:32,490
it when the morgues morgues morgues are empty when hospitals shut down or when

1266
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:38,130
doctors doc put in doctor strike morgues empty I don't know how your keywords I

1267
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:43,810
guess how browsers work yep the more more the most recent one which was about a

1268
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:49,770
decade and a half or so ago was done by an Israeli group believe it or not from

1269
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:55,730
what I remember and by the way folks things that are on the rectangle do get

1270
01:54:55,730 --> 01:55:01,070
taken down and scrubbed I've had people I've sent links to things that I thought

1271
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:05,870
were interesting a couple of years ago since computer guy says oh I'll find it

1272
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:09,430
and he gets he never got back to me I got back to me says oh no yeah it was

1273
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:22,740
scrubbed so but there is a socialized medicine and by the way one thing you

1274
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:26,100
don't hear about much is strikes and boycotts and things like that unless

1275
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:34,690
it's a political thing you know so and here's the thing about the Americans

1276
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:37,430
I've been you know ever since the election this is not just the Americans

1277
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:40,610
but you know each society is slightly different just like you Sam mentioned

1278
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:43,850
you were in a third world country and you know whatever change you notice a

1279
01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:51,390
change these morons here they don't understand what's going on in a big

1280
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:54,530
level they're always questioning America and they've got you know their new

1281
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:58,550
president now whatever not disparaging him because they're all none of them

1282
01:55:58,550 --> 01:56:05,530
weren't any good ever and they shouldn't be because obviously they don't

1283
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:11,770
understand they're trying to break this natural or cultural cycle you ever heard

1284
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:17,750
what I mean by that is you know what goes around comes around right so the

1285
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:23,750
this country here known as the American states it was started by violence and

1286
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:31,970
disease from foreigners right there was a proclamation that King George did that

1287
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:35,190
really pissed off that what they call the founding fathers of America that

1288
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:39,890
proclamation was a no more expansion past the Mississippi or the colonies to

1289
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:44,230
preserve the not the native people right and George Washington all those

1290
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:49,990
guys like screw that we're gonna go genocide them all which they did now

1291
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:53,210
they'll say well they're still Native Americans but there's so few that if you

1292
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:58,370
say they were all killed it's pretty pretty close but anyway this country

1293
01:56:58,370 --> 01:57:05,550
here was settled by violence and disease by spreading disease and violence how do

1294
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:09,570
you think it's going to end I don't know

1295
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:16,890
disease and violence maybe so I don't know about protecting American values

1296
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:21,790
and this and that because I just laid it out for you folks and unfortunately yes

1297
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:26,810
I am here but now we're in the situation where it doesn't matter where you go

1298
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:31,770
which country you go to because now it's global but I think within the global

1299
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:36,290
scheme you'll have these little micro turnovers you know what I mean by like

1300
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:41,450
what goes around comes around personally like for example look at Israel and

1301
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:45,870
scripture says I will bring you back I will once again make you right what goes

1302
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:49,030
around comes around kind of thing well how do you think the Americans are going

1303
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:56,620
to end up in the Canadians and those guys anyway this is not a political

1304
01:57:56,620 --> 01:58:07,990
statement this is a universal statement meaning all-encompassing right so yeah

1305
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:10,790
so these morons here you know go ahead you can have your born-again chicken

1306
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:15,210
sandwiches in your stupid bowls and all that other stuff but it's good that they

1307
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:21,680
don't see it coming even when it's happening they'll deny it and of course

1308
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:32,160
you have the mop-up crew so anyway also you've mentioned and I have to look into

1309
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:37,900
it because I think it's it's an extensive topic but the Renaissance was a

1310
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:42,060
movement which effectively shut down any worthwhile spiritual developments in

1311
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:48,760
favor of this sort of inward-looking new age based it's all about you the

1312
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:54,800
individual follow your feelings blah blah blah somewhat expand on that

1313
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:00,460
somewhat the Renaissance was the start of the military-industrial complex you've

1314
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:05,180
heard of that term right now when you say industry most people think like you

1315
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:10,100
know weaving looms and coal mines and I know industry meaning banking because

1316
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:14,440
most industries work hand-in-hand with the financers right so the banking

1317
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:21,400
industry controls it just means an overt but no I shouldn't say overt not a non

1318
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:27,260
overt actually the opposite commercial development with the bankers are in

1319
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:34,140
control of everything right if you look at major history it's been you know like

1320
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:37,880
for example war you know that all wars are bankers wars right you've heard of

1321
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:43,880
that right well you know country developments of countries and industry

1322
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:50,580
is based on the banking and behind it and the real battle is with the finances

1323
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:54,000
and with the banking and that's what came out of the Renaissance predominantly

1324
01:59:55,020 --> 02:00:03,340
and really what it was is a recentralization of the papal power you

1325
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:08,400
know from the Emperor and vice versa you know a little struggle going back and

1326
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:17,100
forth you know and to answer the question about the individual that's the

1327
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:24,620
divide and conquer you know you get everyone to focus on the individual on

1328
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:29,620
themselves only and then you've got them all pigeonhole don't you and you that's

1329
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,300
how that you know by the way and when you've got everyone focusing on what

1330
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:37,900
they're going to do you take them out one by one and instill fear or instill

1331
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:43,560
hope or however you're going to do whatever your end goal is oh that was

1332
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:49,700
the Renaissance was not a Renaissance at all it's Renaissance was like after

1333
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:58,680
9-11 the terrorism thing you know what terrorism what Renaissance but as far as

1334
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:05,300
the individual thing I mean that also has a polarity to it where there's also

1335
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:09,640
this sort of leftist group mentality that we see quite prevalent today with

1336
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:13,800
identity politics where people are forcing themselves to identify as group

1337
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:20,620
members and then doubling down on that group identity along lines of say race

1338
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:25,800
or class or whatever yeah on one hand you have individual focus but then yeah

1339
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:33,320
they're suckers yeah they're just suckers and and Gustave Le Bon if you

1340
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:37,040
ask any of those people why they're doing it and you look at what they

1341
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:42,840
reference as the core belief it hardly resembles that at all but yet they're

1342
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:50,380
doing it but look the expect the race war or the race conflict to increase

1343
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:56,660
because especially in what they call the American states is because it was a race

1344
02:01:56,660 --> 02:02:03,640
war when the country started essentially right magazines and newspapers were sold

1345
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:18,410
based on the how much of a headcount they had on Indians right but do we do

1346
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:23,190
we know specifically weddings well I guess you said the banks but because I'm

1347
02:02:23,190 --> 02:02:25,970
trying to figure out what the institutions are that are there that

1348
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:29,590
were pushing that at the time because what you're presented with is often some

1349
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:35,190
philosopher or some Leonardo da Vinci character who's pontificating about I

1350
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:39,390
don't know the benefits of individualism but then behind that you

1351
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:43,390
would have the machinations that are actually putting into effect what what

1352
02:02:43,390 --> 02:02:50,590
they want and I don't really know where to find that repeat that well as far as

1353
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:54,290
the Renaissance you have the most front-facing aspect of that is the

1354
02:02:54,290 --> 02:03:02,190
artistic like Leonardo da Vinci and whatever is being done in Vienna by

1355
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:07,190
certain individuals but then as far as what's actually taking place

1356
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:12,570
ideologically to shift mass mass consciousness that's being pushed

1357
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:16,530
somewhere else and I'm trying to find what institutions are sort of

1358
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:26,370
responsible for that the banks and the universities yeah universities became

1359
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:32,550
quite popular the church became popular all those things are malevolent by the

1360
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:45,260
way in intent and in and in practice all right you know people were back you

1361
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:48,600
know University I mean people have figured out now I think especially in

1362
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:53,120
the past 30 years universities a joke only the the weakest minds actually

1363
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:57,480
think there's anything to be gotten out of there they're well endowed you know

1364
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:03,760
with laboratories and things like that devices you know tools grunt work so it

1365
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,920
it's not taking that seriously but if you went against university politics and

1366
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:12,960
education you know more than 150 years ago or a hundred years ago your life was

1367
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:18,100
at stake you know or your livelihood was now it's not so much because I

1368
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:26,520
everything everyone realizes an unspoken joke right but that was just as

1369
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:30,460
dangerous as speaking out against as it was the church and if by the way if you

1370
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:35,080
read up on you know the persecutions that were done on people that wanted a

1371
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,820
translation of the biblical text or went against the Christian dogma or the

1372
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:45,660
Christian tradition the it was always that not what they were doing was wrong

1373
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:48,540
the ones that were persecuted was because they were disrupting a thousand

1374
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:56,480
years of tradition you know it you know and that's that's also the rise with

1375
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:00,700
people that the the what they call the bar association or the legal society

1376
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:05,980
came into prominence as it is today back then because right now everyone

1377
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:10,280
misses the point and it's actually been illustrated in the American news a year

1378
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:14,800
ago when Trump said we're going to stop immigration and some like district judge

1379
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:18,680
said no and he stops it so they're telling you the attorneys are running

1380
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:24,200
the country right not the president right if you go to a doctor he says well

1381
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:29,380
I can't legally do that well so the attorneys running the hospital now if you

1382
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:32,960
go to the university why legally can't teach that well so the attorneys are

1383
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:37,580
running the university now right you go to the restaurant well I can't serve

1384
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:40,880
legally serve that also the attorneys are running your restaurant now I'm gonna

1385
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:48,080
keep going right I knew a fellow out of England he was an attorney I said what

1386
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:55,540
do you do he says he said I edit medical textbooks and I'm like what do you know

1387
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:59,400
about medicine is nothing very little so how the hell are you editing them

1388
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:08,690
think about it and what is an attorney a Satanist right I mean it's an

1389
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:12,770
adversary so everybody loves it you know that's what they want I still hear

1390
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:15,930
these idiots on the rectangle occasionally we want justice oh yeah

1391
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:28,120
really you're a fucking moron anyway excuse the medical term there but the

1392
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:31,680
Renaissance is an interesting thing only because I mean when when is the period

1393
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:37,520
of the Renaissance classified as a 15th century with 13 1400s 1500s and it was

1394
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:46,800
already you know call it the pre Victorian it was pre Baroque get a

1395
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:54,940
Baroque it's a Baroque but anyway that was the what would you say what would you

1396
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:59,840
when you say I would say 14 1500s what for Renaissance right 13 14 that's

1397
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:06,380
they want to start late 1300s and then into the 1700s yeah that's when

1398
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:09,480
everything started like Christopher Columbus discovered America by the way

1399
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:12,920
if you guys want to turn your head inside out you know we spoke about the

1400
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:17,060
Minoans before briefly or the Keftari I think they're mentioned in Deuteronomy

1401
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:21,820
how they were even just right yeah you know we slaughtered them too right they

1402
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:27,280
kind of got in the way that's a Chaldean term Keftari for Minoan or from the

1403
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:30,900
island of Crete by the way they're a very prominent culture Mycenae as well

1404
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:33,760
and everyone only knows about the Egyptians there on that time period but

1405
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:40,220
do you know that they had mined over a million tons when you deal with metal by

1406
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:44,140
the way million tons is not a lot even though if you drop it on your foot it

1407
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:49,040
will break your toe right Bruce or you know but a million tons in mining terms

1408
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:54,200
is not much but it is a million tons from the Minoans had mined that much

1409
02:07:54,200 --> 02:08:00,960
copper native copper from Michigan we're talking about 2000 BC 1500 BC

1410
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:06,880
where's Michigan Great Lakes area of the States that's six thousand miles away

1411
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:11,840
yeah and it's it's the evidence is irrefutable but no one wants to look go

1412
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:18,920
online and look up Minoans mining copper in Michigan I mean they're finding

1413
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:25,300
thousands of artifacts and bodies buried and by the way with isotopes you

1414
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:28,840
know you can check the isotope of any metal and you'll know where it came

1415
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,740
from because the isotope of the copper from Michigan is different than the

1416
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:37,660
isotope of the copper anywhere else right so basically the copper that was

1417
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:41,540
used and what they call their idiotic Bronze Age was fueled by the Americans

1418
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:49,020
by the Americas you find it look Minoan copper from Michigan in America what is

1419
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:56,060
that that this is this is roughly 1500 1600 BC what does that do for your

1420
02:08:56,060 --> 02:09:03,280
history what you know you don't necessarily put a million tons in a

1421
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:10,280
backpack and swim across the Atlantic no you don't I mean yeah we're talking

1422
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:16,340
about seafaring lines what I mean by a line is you know when you're going out

1423
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:22,080
right you'll see other ships coming and you wave right right right you get it

1424
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:26,480
it's not like oh are we gonna make it no you are as a matter of fact when you're

1425
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:29,620
going there's you'll see other ships coming you might stop for a minute and

1426
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:35,640
share things too you know and islands on there are islands in the Atlantic by the

1427
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:41,960
way on the way out right so you know it's when you tell people crossing the

1428
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:46,200
Atlantic they go that big body of water no there are islands out there you could

1429
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:50,800
look really close on Google Earth and there's plenty of places to stop from

1430
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:57,400
Europe to the States you know Bruce guys Sam we feel exactly you could look I

1431
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:00,920
mean where's Bermuda you know I mean that Bermuda but Bahamas and other

1432
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:05,300
places and whatever maybe I'm not using the right terms but you'll see there's

1433
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:10,320
lots of little places to stop so one dead snack right now Center if I

1434
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:19,640
remember correctly yep so they have a hard time but you see I shouldn't say a

1435
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:23,060
hard time no one's having a hard time because everyone knows everyone who's

1436
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:27,420
anyone knows that these universities are they won't hire you unless you're an

1437
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:33,960
idiot now it is possible to be an idiot and be have a talent at one thing and you

1438
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:39,180
obviously will be compensated for doing that thing well but generally they don't

1439
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:42,680
hire people that are competent you know individuals I mean I have never met

1440
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:47,320
anyone in any university system or any professor any academic that I would

1441
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:50,460
invite over for dinner even though I have in the past I wouldn't do it anymore

1442
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:56,720
because they're all the same pretty much they're there to brainwash your children

1443
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:01,860
and the youth but they do it voluntarily no one's putting a gun to anyone's head

1444
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:05,420
and the ones that are not there for that don't last in the system very long at

1445
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:09,380
all year two years three years five years tops and then they just leave and

1446
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:13,420
discussed all of them that are competent so if you say that these people are

1447
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:17,300
incompetent and you could say even evil is pretty pretty accurate description of

1448
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:25,320
them it's in your face the real history of discovery or the real history of how

1449
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:30,620
the earth was pretty much covered and navigated by anyone and everyone at any

1450
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:35,520
time in history and why am I saying this because during the Renaissance you

1451
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:41,600
have Christopher Columbus by the way as they tout right coming over now by the

1452
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:45,500
way you know there is an argument was an argument about the origin of Christopher

1453
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:48,780
Columbus and you know there are various places in Italy that have plaques this

1454
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:55,220
is where he was born right he was financed by Spain and with blessings of

1455
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:59,860
you know the powers that be but you know if you go to the island of Chios there's

1456
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:03,180
a little humble house and they have a little plaque very on very not well

1457
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:06,840
known at all is this is where Christopher Columbus was born it's a

1458
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:12,500
Greek and you know if you're French by the way when you sign your name you sign

1459
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:17,900
it in front you know French right or when you're when you're Arabic you sign it in

1460
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:23,500
Arabic when you're right now how many Pete how many Greeks sign their name in

1461
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:30,160
Greek just about all of them right now if you go on the rectangle I don't know

1462
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:34,700
if it's up maybe it is go find Christopher Columbus a signature is that

1463
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:36,020
in Roman English
