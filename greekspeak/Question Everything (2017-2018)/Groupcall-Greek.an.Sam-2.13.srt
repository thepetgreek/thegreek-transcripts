1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,070
But, you know, if you go to the island of Chios, there's a little humble house, and they have a little plaque, very not well-known at all.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,570
This is where Christopher Columbus was born.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,410
It's a Greek.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,230
And, you know, if you're French, by the way, when you sign your name, you sign it in French, you know, French, right?

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,970
Or when you're Arabic, you sign it in Arabic, right?

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,990
Now, how many Greeks sign their name in Greek?

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,210
Just about all of them, right?

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,930
Now, if you go on the rectangle, I don't know if it's up, maybe it is, go find Christopher Columbus's signature.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,410
Is that in Roman English, or Roman Italian, or Roman, or is it in Greek script?

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,550
It's in Greek.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,710
You know, so...

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,130
Oh, boy.

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,750
I'm not saying you should go out and convince or debate this topic, because evidence means nothing, right?

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,850
But Christopher Columbus signed his name in Greek.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,410
You know why?

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,010
Because he was Italian.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,810
See how stupid things are?

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,230
Did you find this, by the way?

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,770
Is there anything on the rectangle about this?

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,990
Okay, so this is what...

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,270
I'm being sarcastic, because this is what the Renaissance is doing, and still is today.

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,540
Versus what I'm counting, you know.

23
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,250
Are you familiar with any of this, Bruce?

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,930
The copper from Michigan?

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:46,490
No, that actually was a rather a bit of a surprise, and I am definitely going to check on that, along with the other one that you were just mentioning.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,810
Yeah, yeah, so this is all products of the Renaissance, all this bullshit, by the way.

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,650
Wow.

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,630
You know, that people think, you know, it's good.

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,390
I'm showing you that you can go a little bit deeper.

30
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,430
Which I fully intend on doing.

31
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,750
I'm back on the copper from Michigan and Ohio, and all the settlements.

32
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,990
I mean, there's the Tucson artifacts also.

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:19,510
There is artifacts all over the New Mexico, Roman settlements, and Minoan settlements, and it's not just finding something that's debatable.

34
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,110
It's rock-solid, you know what I mean?

35
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,630
And backed up by science, and it's ignored.

36
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,390
The Mormons got involved in this a hundred years ago, and they got approached.

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,090
What is this?

38
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,890
The Minoan civilization here?

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,350
They got involved in the archaeology of it, and they got approached, and they shut it all down, and they said they're all fakes.

40
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,490
Hmm, but anyway, that's politically what you're supposed to do, right?

41
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,900
Like the Mormons aren't fakes themselves, but anyway, so that's another little bit of study, too.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,920
The reason I brought up the Minoan copper in Michigan, it's not like one of these things that are debatable.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,260
It is like, I mean, it's like a B-52.

44
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,660
You know, it's like you said, an airplane crashed on my street today, right?

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,700
On the street that I live on, and you're like, are you sure?

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,260
It's a B-52.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes, I'm sure, right?

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,180
Yeah, you can't miss it.

49
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,580
It's so big that it'll crush you.

50
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,730
Yeah.

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,990
So, why am I bringing this up?

52
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,430
Because this is contrary to what you've been taught, still taught today out of the Renaissance.

53
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,730
Just like, for example, let's go back to American politics.

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:49,350
The crap that they're espousing in the political scene right now is the same crap that they were doing in the 1950s and 40s in America, and people are buying it.

55
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,790
They fall for it over and over and over again.

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,480
Find anything, Sam, on Christopher Columbus's signature being Greek or Minoan copper?

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
I know there's stuff on the internet in the chat.

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,380
There was a link.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, I found the signature stuff.

60
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,620
It's a combination of Greek and Latin.

61
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,980
First part being Greek, second part being Latin.

62
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:31,920
Either way, there's some interesting stuff to be, the reason I'm bringing these things up, if I had, if I settled in my mind a little bit, I'll bring up more stuff to counter the teachings of the Renaissance.

63
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,320
So, when you bring up the Renaissance, just like you said of the individual and the leftist groups and all that, it's really the teachings of the Renaissance, you know.

64
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:49,240
Now, whenever there is a financial boom, there is always a boom in art, whether it's music or, you know, pictographic or sculpture.

65
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,500
They tend to subsidize the artistic community, right?

66
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,540
Yes.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,240
Yeah, I mean you could see the Arabic or Arabesque influence in Da Vinci.

68
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,960
You could see Michelangelo didn't do it all on his own.

69
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,160
It's just like a plumber.

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
You ever call a plumber?

71
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,380
Fix something in the house or clear a drain?

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,420
Yep, if you ever do that, watch what's going on very carefully.

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,860
What happens is the truck pulls up, it says plumbing, whatever, Joe's plumbing, and there's two guys in the truck.

74
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,820
The plumber comes out, he greets you, and while he's greeting you, the plumber's helper loads up the tools.

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:48,100
They both come in the house, the plumber's helper gets into all the sewage and gets all whatever, clears the drain while the plumber's talking to you, plugs in the machine.

76
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,960
Plumber's helper cleans up, puts the tools back in the truck, and the plumber writes you the bill.

77
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,300
Did you get the picture of what's going on here?

78
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,820
It's just like a hospital.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,620
Everybody, the doctor, the doctor.

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
You ever go watch what's going in the hospital?

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,880
Who's doing all the work, the majority of the work?

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,060
The nurses, right?

83
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,400
The plumber's helper does all the work.

84
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you think Michelangelo stood there with chisels and hammers for weeks on end carving all that stuff?

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Or did he direct it and write the bill?

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,940
Was he, here's the other thing, was Michelangelo well-versed in scripture, which was a problem with the Pope?

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Yep, how do we know?

88
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,280
Look at some of the sculpture that he did.

89
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:50,180
He went wrong, terribly wrong, on the one where he has the Christ depicted after his death taken down off the cross with the mother holding him.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,460
That's totally wrong.

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,680
Because if you did a sculpture of that, it would be very simple.

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:09,960
You would have the mother, let's say the woman, holding something that looked like a skeleton from the front, all the bones revealed, with shards of flesh hanging, eye sockets open, no face on it at all.

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,940
The head would probably be twice the size of a normal head.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,940
The abdomen would be twice the size of a normal abdomen, with shards of flesh everywhere, like ripped newspaper.

95
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,580
It wouldn't look anything like that.

96
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,280
That's why, you know, how do you know the Shroud of Turin is a fraud?

97
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,980
It should take you 0.3 seconds, not 0.5 seconds.

98
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,220
Just look at it.

99
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:38,920
It's not someone who's been stoned to death, and neither is it based on the haircut.

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,740
Yeah, he has long hair.

101
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,200
Yeah, it should take 0.3 seconds.

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,360
If it takes you three quarters of a second to call it a fraud, you're slow.

103
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,980
Right?

104
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,960
Yeah, I'm being sarcastic, because it's well-deserved.

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,420
And how many morons do you think are still debating its authenticity, or how many morons even worse believe in that it is authentic?

106
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:19,580
So, there's going to be reckoning on all this stuff, and right now, this is the only place in the world you could hear this kind of talk, by the way, on these really ultra-minor, thanks to Bruce, recordings, and the Greek, and Sam coming across, and whoever else does.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,340
It's kind of sad, but at least you can be happy that you're hearing it.

108
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,409
There are other people that know this, but I assure you, no one's saying it.

109
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,169
All in one wholesale, one-stop shop, you know.

110
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,650
This is the truth.

111
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,490
I shouldn't say truth, but because that's where it's been bandied around.

112
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,570
This is like a convenience store, you know, of I wish it were a store at some point.

113
00:08:46,710 --> 00:09:03,200
I need to get cigarettes and coffee, and then fortunately and unfortunately, I have good taste in tobacco and coffee, so anyway, someone asked me, Greek, you're not taking out hurricanes anymore?

114
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,340
I said, no, because no one even wants to buy me a Starbucks coffee for it.

115
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,320
Not that I would drink that stuff, because some people that like coffee have a Starbucks, and they're like, oh, I get all jittery.

116
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,860
I don't feel good.

117
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,300
I said, it's because it's over-harvested.

118
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,540
When you over-harvest coffee, it gets this strange caffeine quality, and you know what I mean by poking at it too much?

119
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,220
Like back in the old days, the growers, you know, with the hemp, you know how they made it stronger?

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,300
They just kept poking the plant, and it developed THC as a defense mechanism, right?

121
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,820
I don't know.

122
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,520
Bruce might be old enough to remember those days.

123
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, yeah.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,420
That's how you did it.

125
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,480
You kept pruning it, so it would...

126
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,820
Anyway, now I think that I heard recently from someone that the stuff is so strong now, it's almost hallucinogenic.

127
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,300
I don't know.

128
00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:00,660
I don't touch this stuff, because if I ever do, I remember maybe a decade ago taking a toque off of some, yes, an admission of guilt, not really, and I was waiting for it to wear off.

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
I just didn't like the way it felt at all.

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:04,980
So...

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,760
I don't...

132
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
and that's one of the things that I don't get, you know what I mean?

133
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,420
Smoking weed or whatever.

134
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,180
I don't get it.

135
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,210
Escapism.

136
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,310
What's that?

137
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Escapism, because, you know, apparently life sucks or something.

138
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,570
Yeah, whatever.

139
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,110
I don't know.

140
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,750
I think it's a...

141
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,370
yeah, it's...

142
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,710
let's just say it's an acquired state.

143
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,690
You know, like an acquired taste, but an acquired state.

144
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,630
I mean, it's better than putting knitting needles in your eyes, but, you know...

145
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,670
Speaking of drugs and such, I think at one point you said that the 60s counterculture was an intelligent psyop, actually.

146
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,810
Absolutely.

147
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,390
But for what, though?

148
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,550
Oh, how do you destroy a generation, little by little?

149
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,610
Now they don't have to do it anymore because they got smartphones to do it for them.

150
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,230
Yeah, but what do...

151
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,130
What do idiot intelligence folks need to know that for?

152
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,910
To know what?

153
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,850
About how to destroy a generation.

154
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,190
What do they care?

155
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,350
Oh, why not?

156
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,950
See, the whole thing was the condition...

157
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,890
You know, people think America is so stable.

158
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,910
It's extremely unstable because it's a supermarket to the world.

159
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,070
This is one thing people will never get, when I say never within their ever...

160
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,170
America or the States is not really a country.

161
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,030
As they think it's 50 little individual countries or 48, and it's not even that.

162
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,050
It's a marketplace.

163
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,890
Why do you think you have so many attorneys and so many prisons here?

164
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,590
You know, when you go to a big mall, if you're caught shoplifting, they have a little holding cell in there.

165
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,950
Are you familiar with that?

166
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,090
Bruce, have you ever heard of that?

167
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,650
Yeah, they have a little prison in the in the shopping mall, believe it or not.

168
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,450
A detention.

169
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,430
Detention, yeah.

170
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,930
So, this is...

171
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,750
America is not a country.

172
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,470
It never will be.

173
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,130
Who's an American?

174
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,930
You live on a street.

175
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,230
You got a guy born in India.

176
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,010
I'm American.

177
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,470
A guy born in Spain.

178
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,090
I'm American.

179
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,730
Yeah, right.

180
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,370
Sure you are.

181
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,670
You can't define it.

182
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,810
It's a big supermarket, but imagine instead of the customers going home, they sleep in the supermarket.

183
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:26,730
You see?

184
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,270
So it's very interesting.

185
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,550
I think George Carlin summed it up.

186
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,890
Shopping mall from one end to the other.

187
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,990
Sea to shining sea.

188
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:47,390
And you're all given a credit line to use it, and the attorneys are like, no, the attorneys will do anything to make sure that you guys never find out how the money system works.

189
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,490
That was another interesting subject to look at.

190
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,550
The churches, how they are tax exempt.

191
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,930
There's no usury fee.

192
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,100
Taxes are just a fee.

193
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,640
Right, exactly, a usury fee.

194
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't think it's usury.

195
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,860
I'll tell you why.

196
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,380
Because you have two systems.

197
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:29,960
If you really comprehend Title 12, Section 411, because it's written on an eighth grade level, and most people can't comprehend it because it is on an eighth grade because they can only comprehend third grade or less, it says that you're not authorized to use Federal Reserve notes, right?

198
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,280
Right.

199
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:41,340
Okay, but then it tells you, because you're not, you could use them to make a demand for lawful money, but are you ever going to get lawful money?

200
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,660
No.

201
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,600
Because of the democratic consensus.

202
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,540
Correct.

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,040
Everyone has decided.

204
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,520
That's why nothing is ever going to happen with the Fed, because everyone's endorsing it with their signature.

205
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,520
I was at Ocelli once.

206
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,500
I went in with my endorsement.

207
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,860
I had to change the subject.

208
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,420
I was like, oh boy, this is not the right, you know, venue to discuss it on Ocelli the Greek.

209
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,820
I think it has to be done on a separate way alone or someone else who can understand it.

210
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,800
The taxing is not there to do anything other than to regulate the money supply.

211
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,440
Right?

212
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,010
And also it has another, in other words, you just pull it out of the system.

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,010
Because why do you have to do that?

214
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,610
Because you have something called inflation.

215
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,030
So, which inflation is a tax also.

216
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,770
Give you an example.

217
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,690
In 1920, a car was about 2000 bucks.

218
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,990
1930, a car was about 2000 bucks.

219
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,590
1940, a car was about 2000 bucks.

220
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,890
1950, a car was around 2000 bucks.

221
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,930
1960, it started to go up to 33,000.

222
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:59,850
So in 1910, if you put 2000 bucks in a jar and buried it and you woke up in 1940, can you buy a car with it?

223
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,210
Yes.

224
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,910
You know what I mean?

225
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,910
You didn't have inflation as much.

226
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,590
But now if you put whatever a car is, you put it away.

227
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:17,870
I mean, I went a couple of years ago, someone was talking, when I get a pickup truck and he left, he says, he wants 60,000 bucks for a pickup truck.

228
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,550
It's like, you're joking.

229
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,230
So it should be like 10 or 12.

230
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,790
So if you put 10 or 12,000 bucks away 10 years ago, can you buy a pickup truck?

231
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,110
No.

232
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,850
So that is a tax.

233
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,090
In a fiat money system, you're taxed at a rate of about 90%.

234
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:45,990
Meaning if you figure out all the taxes, which include utilities, whatever earnings you have, 90% of it goes out to you, you know, for your average By the way, the average, I think, salary in America is 61,000 a year, right?

235
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,730
So if you're not making 61,000 or more, you're in the poverty level, by the way.

236
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:51,990
Okay.

237
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,970
Which is roughly 1,200 a week.

238
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,330
So.

239
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,850
But Title 12, Section 401 is really simple.

240
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,930
Let me just give an example, a simple example.

241
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,470
A guy works at an auto parts store.

242
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,790
Okay.

243
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,930
And he, it was a national chain.

244
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,110
And he tells the boss, like, I'm using Title 12, Section 411, don't do any more deductions.

245
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,950
Oh, no, no, you're crazy.

246
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,470
You're one of those tax protesters.

247
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,370
They go up and down through legal, nothing happens.

248
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,630
Okay, so.

249
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,090
They're doing direct deposit in his bank account.

250
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,130
He can't get out of it.

251
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,350
He said, we won't give you a check.

252
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,590
What do you do?

253
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,460
This is what I just explained is a scenario for most people in the job market today, right?

254
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,600
They get direct deposit.

255
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,200
Okay, so what do you do?

256
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,200
Well, what he did was, you close the bank account.

257
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,220
And then when they try to do direct deposit, it bounces back.

258
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,580
And they come to you and they say, hey, listen, we tried to give you your paycheck, but it bounced back.

259
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,760
He says, yeah, you know, I can't have that account anymore.

260
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,440
Then guess what they did?

261
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,960
They had to give him a check now.

262
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,480
Because initially they said, no, no checks.

263
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,380
So you have to go beyond what they're telling you and be proactive.

264
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,520
So he closes the account.

265
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,920
Check bounces back to the corporate and they say, well, we're holding your checks now.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,720
We can't do that.

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,680
We have to give it to you.

268
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,200
Well, cut me a check, asshole.

269
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,319
And what they did was they cut him a check, right?

270
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,940
So, you know, where it says pay to the order of, that's clear evidence that whenever you use anything that says pay to the order of, you're ordering up money.

271
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Remember how I explained how it works?

272
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,340
Right.

273
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,320
When you write somebody a check, it gives the illusion that it was taken from one account to the other.

274
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,780
It wasn't.

275
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:50,820
But anyway, so he gets the check and on the back he writes lawful money only 12 USC 411 and signs it with a semicolon between the first and last name.

276
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,300
If you just do it exactly like it is on the driver's license or any ID that you have, it's fine.

277
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,020
Lawful money only 12 USC 411.

278
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,320
And every time he did that, he did a photocopy of the check.

279
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:14,760
And if you have a photocopy machine at home, by the way, and you don't want to do a lot, you can send the same piece of paper if you just reposition the check and it'll print it further down.

280
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,300
You know what I mean?

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,660
Anyway.

282
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,580
Or you could scan it.

283
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,880
So at the end of the year, it comes time to do a 1040 the next year.

284
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:35,040
So what he does is he writes down all the amount that they deducted and he has no income and all the amount that deducted should come back all of it because there's no income because he's making a demand for lawful money.

285
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,660
And where they tell you to sign the 1040, he just wrote see exhibit A.

286
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:49,840
And exhibit A is copies of all of the endorsements on the back of the checks that you wrote lawful money only USC 12 411.

287
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,800
And you put a little letter in there say these are all the instruments that you know about right?

288
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,800
And these are all your salary and this is all true.

289
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:08,080
Well, about not like a month later, like most people, but like four days later, he gets the check for the entire amount back.

290
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,920
Everything, no questions asked from the IRS.

291
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You just take it to your boss and say, see, I got it all back and they don't care.

292
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,020
So you're going to have to wait.

293
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:27,220
It's not like this return stuff, you know, well, how much are deductible and you know, anyway, I just gave you one example of how it works because you're not going to get lawful money.

294
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,300
So at least at this point, see the IRS knows it, but the IRS agents don't know it.

295
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,060
Why?

296
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,360
Because then they want to do it, right?

297
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,420
Because they're getting taxed, right?

298
00:19:39,980 --> 00:20:00,460
I've been to an IRS office where a guy gave $150 to make payment and they didn't want to take the cash and finally, they came out with a clipboard and they wrote 50 and they wrote the serial number and I said, well, you're doing that because if you don't document it that way, this office creates a tax liability and she was like, holy shit, where you come from?

299
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,320
You're not one of these space heaters, you know?

300
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:23,560
So anyone that complains about that should just do a little bit of research that when you're using something that you buy somewhat, when you're not authorized to use something, can you say that you're also being prohibited from using it?

301
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,860
Somewhat.

302
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,860
It's an indirect way of saying it, right?

303
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,060
If you're not authorized to go somewhere and you go there now, aren't you following through on a prohibition of some sort?

304
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,500
Okay, so when you're using something you're not authorized to use or prohibited stuff and all that, is there a penalty for that?

305
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,680
That you have to return something?

306
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,140
Yes.

307
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,980
So nowhere in the U.S. 12 U.S.C. 411 doesn't say that you're ever going to, they have to give you lawful money, it just says you have to evidence the demand.

308
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,680
Right.

309
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,980
How are you going to pay taxes when there's, you're not authorized to use

310
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,280
the money that,

311
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,600
and taxes don't pay for, look, go to any CAF or Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of any town in the U.S.

312
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,780
They'll tell you, they'll say, well, we spend 3 million to the police, 5 million to the courts, this million to this, wait a minute,

313
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,260
wait a second, when you go to the courts, the city's,

314
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,900
the accounting says that we're spending 3 million a month to keep the courts open,

315
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,620
but you know, they give you no listing on how much the courts take in and fees and penalties.

316
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,040
Where does that go?

317
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,540
Oh, 3 million, 5 million a month for the police.

318
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,640
Where's all the money, don't the police write tickets for fines all the time?

319
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,860
Where does that, where does that go?

320
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,980
You know, there's no accounting for any of that?

321
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,160
And how many people are bringing this up?

322
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,720
Someone says, well, this guy does a video.

323
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,420
No, that guy's an idiot.

324
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,400
I looked at what he says.

325
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,560
He's not bringing up anything.

326
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,810
Come on, people, this is planet Earth.

327
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,650
I'm not saying wake up because you don't want to wake up in it.

328
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,870
You know, better to be asleep.

329
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,250
If you could sleep on a picket fence, you'll be happy here.

330
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,550
You know what I mean?

331
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,410
You know, on the edge of a picket fence, fall asleep.

332
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,370
If you're comfortable, I mean, that's the only way you're going to be happy.

333
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:19,570
Because if you don't know what's going on, you're always going to bitch and whine on how they took your paycheck or you paid this fine or whatever.

334
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,530
But if you do know what's going on, you're not going to be happy because you can say, how can all these people be morons?

335
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,590
Except for the one that sent me the legal rebuttal, of course, CP.

336
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,870
Thank you, Chris, for doing that, by the way.

337
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,030
Do you see, I hope, Bruce, does that clear up Title 12, Section 411 a little bit more?

338
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,390
It does, yes.

339
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,190
Anyone can do it.

340
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:51,190
But if you're accepting direct deposit or use credit cards or PayPal or all that, you see, I was going to start a PayPal thing and I got back and forth with them.

341
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,170
They wouldn't let me do any conditional responses.

342
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,070
And I found out that they could run it through any clearinghouse they want.

343
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,250
So when the money goes from terminal to terminal computer, I can't get in there and say demand for lawful money.

344
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,770
So there's no way that you can do a PayPal lawfully.

345
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,710
I don't see it.

346
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,690
At the end result, when money comes into your hand, could you not document that as the money received?

347
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,210
Yes, you can.

348
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,030
But in the middle, if they decide to stop it, you have no recourse.

349
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,750
And that happens.

350
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,480
But it's digital at that point, isn't it?

351
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,700
Yeah, but it's digital when it comes in.

352
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,980
But you have to state that it's lawful right before it lands.

353
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,360
And you can't.

354
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,020
Only after the fact.

355
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,840
It's totally unlawful.

356
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:48,800
So if you're using PayPal, you're using debit cards, you could probably do it with a debit card if on the bank account you have on the signature card.

357
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,500
Now, if you go to a Wells Fargo or Bank of America and sign up for a bank account, they do it with a digital pen, just sign here.

358
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,980
Well, you know how many times when you return something at a hardware store, they ask you to sign with a digital pen?

359
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,200
Do you think that you don't think they're going to put that signature in inventory and use it on other stuff?

360
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,240
Right.

361
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,440
They do.

362
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,560
Now, I'm not going to say who does and for sure, because I don't know and I don't care to know.

363
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,440
I just want them to go away when the mop-up crew comes.

364
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,800
But if you think that you are signing digital pads and that's all it's for, you're an idiot.

365
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,000
They're putting that shit on contracts that you don't know.

366
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,040
Here's proof of it, indirect proof.

367
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:44,620
Wells Fargo, if you remember, about a year or two ago, they got in trouble because they opened up about two million credit card accounts for people who didn't even know that those accounts existed, right?

368
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,160
Right.

369
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,560
Do you remember that?

370
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,860
Yeah, I do remember.

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,620
Well, what does it take to open a credit card account?

372
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,540
A signature, doesn't it?

373
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,640
Where did they get those signatures?

374
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,440
From all those signatures they have on a warehouse, whenever those idiots sign those signature pads.

375
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:09,660
So if you're going to open a bank account, say you want it on paper, you're not going to sign the signature thing and then just tell the guy, go to the back, pull up the thing and hit control P and print it out for me, please.

376
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:17,220
And then just do, when you sign it, lawful money only, type 12 USC, and then sign the name and then it's on record.

377
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,600
And you're starting with your bank account that way or the bank account that way at least.

378
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,620
There's going to be fraud going on the whole time.

379
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:36,760
When you, let's say, have a thousand bucks in the bank, if you take out a hundred, if you withdraw it in cash, that's one way to affirm that it is a clean withdrawal.

380
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,760
But when you get a check and you deposit, even with lawful money, it's not being taken out of the company that you work for account.

381
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
It's being created there on the spot.

382
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,740
That kind of fraud, you can't stop.

383
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,620
Because that's just how it works.

384
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
I think you guys remember me.

385
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,800
You know, Sam, let's go over it real quick.

386
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,240
If I write a check to you, Bruce, for a hundred dollars, or let's say, Bruce, you write a check to me for a hundred dollars.

387
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,860
You send it to me in the mail.

388
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,680
It's a check now.

389
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,320
And I get it in the mail.

390
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,620
I take it and I say, oh, a hundred dollar check from Bruce.

391
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,320
I go to the bank.

392
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,240
I give it to the teller.

393
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,560
She looks at the front.

394
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,400
She sees your signature.

395
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,220
She looks at the back.

396
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,720
She doesn't see.

397
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,840
She goes, I can't use this.

398
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,640
Well, because I didn't endorse the back, right?

399
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,480
Correct.

400
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,020
When I endorsed the back, I asked her, can you use it now?

401
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,860
I used to screw around with them that way.

402
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,160
And she said, yeah, I could use it now.

403
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
And the only thing banks have in their inventory is transaction numbers.

404
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,260
So they bring up the next transaction number.

405
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,460
They put your information in.

406
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,500
And because there's two signatures on the check, she creates the hundred dollars right there.

407
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,440
Not out of thin air, based on the requirements that they are told that they can create this hundred dollars.

408
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,740
Now she has the information on Bruce's bank.

409
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,180
And this bank that I use calls Bruce's bank and says, we did the thing.

410
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,720
Because you know how the Mothra also talks.

411
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,340
You know that thing you told me about the thing?

412
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,940
Oh, that thing?

413
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,100
Yeah.

414
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
What about that thing?

415
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,540
It wasn't so good, that thing.

416
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,080
Oh, the thing.

417
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,380
Right.

418
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,040
You get it?

419
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,600
So anyway, the bank that I'm using calls Bruce's bank and says, we did the thing for a hundred bucks.

420
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:12,100
So now Bruce's bank takes the hundred bucks out of the account that he sees, puts it into another account under his name that he doesn't see.

421
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,680
So when you go to the account that you do see, Bruce, it shows that the hundred dollars are taken out.

422
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,580
And because you don't know what's going on, you say, oh, the Greek cashed the check.

423
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,740
They took it out from my account.

424
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,780
That's why, right?

425
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,320
Right.

426
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
That's not what's going on at all.

427
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,860
It's still in your name at the bank.

428
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,480
Then it sits there and the bank says, this is an abandoned funds.

429
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,800
And then they file an abandoned form, abandoned funds.

430
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,140
Then they wait a little bit.

431
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,420
Then they file a claim form.

432
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,760
And now you know how the bankers get their money, their personal money, credits, because they're not allowed to create it on their own either.

433
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,620
They have to finagle.

434
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,300
So one thing you can do is put, let's say, a thousand bucks in the bank, go spend it all.

435
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,380
At the end of the month, give the bank the statement.

436
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,820
There'll be a thousand dollars at the beginning.

437
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
The bottom would be zero.

438
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,840
Give the bank statement with a claimant form.

439
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Say, I want to claim all those funds I just spent.

440
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,120
Uh-oh.

441
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,740
Uh-oh.

442
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,700
Watch what happens.

443
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,080
And it goes right to legal.

444
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,080
You don't go to the teller because she's a complete idiot.

445
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,040
How do I know she's an idiot?

446
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,680
Because if she wasn't, she wouldn't be a teller.

447
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,260
It's very simple.

448
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,220
I mean, it's mathematical.

449
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,840
So watch what happens.

450
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, you want to see a show and every, you know, and you're all, all of you using this stuff are being defrauded.

451
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
You cannot escape it.

452
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,140
You cannot escape it at this point.

453
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,780
You're finished.

454
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,460
Now, you know, even on this little stream, you know, I just lost $9,000.

455
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,780
That's 99% of the people, right?

456
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,400
So if there's 20 people listening, like only one quarter of one person's brain got what I just said.

457
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,680
So that's why I don't get into this stuff too much.

458
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,160
And I'm not belittling or berating the people on the stream.

459
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,600
Say, yes, you are Greek, but, you know, sorry, that's the truth.

460
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,360
Most of you, whoever's listening, this is not going to get it.

461
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,480
That's how simple it is.

462
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,480
And that's how censored that, you know, the people on this planet are.

463
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,160
You get it?

464
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,780
You could just say no or yes, it doesn't matter.

465
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,640
This stuff is one of the core subjects of the cosmic censorship.

466
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,660
Understanding how the money system works.

467
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,000
Why?

468
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,080
Because you know why the money system is 100% fraud right now?

469
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,200
Because the gods are doing it, not because man is doing it.

470
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,890
You know how I know that?

471
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:40,990
Because if they pulled such a fraud on you and you weren't censored, it would have been uncovered within a few days or a few weeks and stopped.

472
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:50,350
But because it's been going on for over 50 or 75 years and you can't even explain, the simplest explanation, still people don't get it.

473
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,790
That's absolute proof of cosmic censorship.

474
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,170
Just like you were stating earlier with Isaiah.

475
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,570
You know, close their minds and their eyes and their ears and everything.

476
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,710
Now, am I special or anything?

477
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,370
Not at all.

478
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:11,190
I'm in a really tough situation to be around such stupidity and censorship.

479
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,270
Am I any less censored?

480
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,130
Not necessarily.

481
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,630
But regarding this topic, yeah, I'm less censored for sure.

482
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,490
That's obvious.

483
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,760
But as a whole, am I less censored?

484
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,500
I don't know.

485
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,800
And it doesn't matter.

486
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,860
Because I'm here with y'all.

487
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,410
And you're never going to understand the money system based on the ever that you have left.

488
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,430
That's an assurance.

489
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:46,710
What will happen as things wrap up, there'll be an inkling or an impression or an inspiration to stop using it.

490
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,870
And then it'll fall apart.

491
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,110
You see.

492
00:30:52,420 --> 00:31:00,540
But if you, anyway, back to anyone listening to this, if you wrap your mind around Title 12, Section 411, all you got to do is make a demand.

493
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,720
And then just say, hey, look, you want to tax me on this or you want this?

494
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,920
Give me some lawful money first.

495
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,580
You see?

496
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,050
Lawful just means it has to be based on something.

497
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,360
Ultimately, even now, people don't understand money.

498
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,570
And you have these idiots.

499
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,770
But there's this one guy, someone's, I get, fortunately, I don't get berated whoever sent me the links.

500
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,750
This guy, he's really popular.

501
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,230
I mean, he, this moron, his initials are JW.

502
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,290
Ocelli has interviewed him a couple of times and asked me, I said, this guy's a total moron.

503
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,030
He, this guy, he's got huge following, right?

504
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,070
I mean, you can just look at the thing, the statistics.

505
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,070
And to show you how piss poor the humans are.

506
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,630
He's predicted the collapse of the dollar no less than 50 times in the past four years.

507
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,010
And he gives dates and it never comes and he still gets more followers.

508
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,450
And never once does he bring up it's a credit-based economy.

509
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,430
You're supposed to be an expert on gold and silver or something.

510
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,810
Laughable, laughable, space heater stuff.

511
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,100
Are you a 900 watt space heater or a 600 watt space heater?

512
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,120
Is your cord kinked or is your switch broken?

513
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,750
It's deplorable.

514
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,690
I mean, the gods must be just laughing.

515
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,670
I shouldn't say laughing their ass off, but they must be like, this place stinks.

516
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,090
And you know what?

517
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,090
It does say it stinks to high heaven, doesn't it?

518
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,930
Somewhere in there, Sam, if you could back me up on that maybe.

519
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,690
Yes, it does.

520
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,890
Their stench comes up.

521
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,270
Yeah.

522
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,240
So money you'll never understand within the ever that's left.

523
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,340
You'll never understand how the human body works ever with the ever that's left.

524
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,120
Right?

525
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,700
Most likely you're probably never going to understand scripture in the ever that's left.

526
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,300
You're just going to understand enough that it's lawful for the mop-up crew to come.

527
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,140
You see?

528
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,940
Kind of like a traffic ticket.

529
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,980
Most people don't read those things.

530
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,300
If you read it, it's open wide.

531
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,100
What makes a traffic ticket lawful is that you did what?

532
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,140
You endorsed it.

533
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,740
You signed it.

534
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,600
They don't care.

535
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,000
They don't watch.

536
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,680
You try to read it.

537
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,460
They're going to get mad.

538
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,120
Just sign it.

539
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,540
You ever see people with contracts buying a car or something?

540
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,440
They think they're buying a car.

541
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,440
Just sign it.

542
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,120
Don't read it.

543
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,940
Yeah, you're never going to understand within the ever that you have left.

544
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,940
You're not going to understand anything.

545
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,900
The only thing I understand is that are you experiencing pain, comfort?

546
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,100
Is your stomach growling?

547
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,000
Let me put something in it so it's not on my thirsty.

548
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,960
Let me drink something wet so I'm not thirsty.

549
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,020
Some stupid stuff on the rectangle or tv.

550
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,100
Yeah, you're not going to get anything.

551
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:11,260
Now the reason I'm saying it this way is because you're never going to understand anything that is going to make a viable change in the civilization that you live in.

552
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,500
Ever.

553
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,400
In the ever that's left.

554
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:25,199
Ever ever it will be because you're going to be ruled with an iron fist and an iron rod.

555
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:36,760
Which you're being people who talk about a police state and all this other stuff and not so much now about termination of the population growth.

556
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,360
Yeah, all that's going to happen, but it's not going to be done by man.

557
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,219
And when the mop-up crew comes, you know, you're going to be ruled with a very heavy hand.

558
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,139
I hope no one is under the delusion that they're not.

559
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:51,680
Right?

560
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,900
You're going to be ruled with an extremely heavy hand, but it's going to be benevolent.

561
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,660
There's not going to be any lying.

562
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,700
You're not going to have attorneys.

563
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,180
I assure you there will be no attorneys.

564
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,380
You're not going to have little scumbag priests and ministers and pastors.

565
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,740
Right?

566
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,740
You're not going to have supreme court justices.

567
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,740
There isn't going to be no justice.

568
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,600
That's for sure.

569
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,680
No goddess religion.

570
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,080
That's for sure.

571
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,360
Right?

572
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,880
You're not going to have vaccines.

573
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,820
You're not going to have the doctors that you have now.

574
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,020
You'll be well-versed, taught to be well-versed in the human body.

575
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,640
Yep.

576
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,180
It's going to be quite interesting.

577
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,680
So none of this Greek speak applies, by the way, to this society, and it shouldn't.

578
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:39,900
Why?

579
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,160
Well, first of all, hardly anyone understands what's being said.

580
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,000
And it's not because I'm smarter than everyone or anyone listening at all.

581
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,300
If you don't understand it, how the hell are you going to implement it or meditate on it?

582
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,840
Meditate means to grab a thought or a concept and think about it over and over and over.

583
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,340
Very often, I hate to think about what's going on between the ears of the people listening to Greek speak.

584
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,380
They grab on to, and just from reading emails occasionally and other things, I see they just grab on to one or two words.

585
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,760
Oh, I know this word and I know that word.

586
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,660
Maybe if I piece them together, that's what he said.

587
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,800
No, that's not what I said.

588
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,280
You know.

589
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:31,150
But at least, Bruce, you're archiving these, and somewhere along the line, someone will come along and actually listen to this and figure out what's being said.

590
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,570
Now, I'm being sarcastic because deservingly so.

591
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,630
I know there are people that hear this and know it.

592
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,730
They can get it.

593
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,570
What I'm saying is even if there are or there aren't, it doesn't make any difference.

594
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,430
Things are going to happen the way they're going to happen and for good reason and well-deserved, by the way.

595
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
You could take it up with the gods later.

596
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm sure you'll have plenty of time for them to listen, but I think there's going to be a change of heart and a change of mind in the future later on when things are overt.

597
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,320
That's the other thing.

598
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,980
Do you ever get the feeling, Sam and Bruce, that this past 6,000 years has been about secrets?

599
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,320
It's all secrets.

600
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,580
But the majority of the secrets, not all of them, but a majority, meaning more than half, if not three-quarter, are in plain sight.

601
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:50,960
Then the leftover, let's say the quarter that's left over, if you divide that in half, half of them are so hidden and cryptic that you probably will never figure out in this situation, and the other bit will be figured out.

602
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,410
To make things lawful, by anyone.

603
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:10,970
And what I mean by figured out, right now, that many of the things that have been deeply hidden by the gods can be shown and you still won't recognize them as such, as something that has been hidden and uncovered.

604
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,550
So it's quite interesting.

605
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:46,010
I keep saying it's quite interesting, because the focus, although it sounds like a trivial pursuit, on food, clothing, and shelter, and then, of course, within that, hopefully you will have good company, even if it's an animal friend or whatever, and good interactions, and you'll be conservative with what you've been given, and use it as best and highest use.

606
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,170
And that's all that's really that can be done.

607
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:55,830
The rest of it is just whatever free will you want to exercise in that direction.

608
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,310
Like, for example, there could be someone that could really be into Greek speak and also be into American football.

609
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,230
I can't see that the two are reckoned, but it is possible, but unlikely.

610
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,790
I think it's actually an impossibility, but who am I to say it's really an impossibility?

611
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,530
It is possible.

612
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,570
Wait, what?

613
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,330
Based on what?

614
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:15,650
Why?

615
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:31,430
Well, let's just say, forget about Greek speak for a moment, is it possible for someone to be studying scripture, objectively, and how, you know, the real scripture, and be a big football fan into sports?

616
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:32,810
Is it possible?

617
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,310
Yes.

618
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,870
I'm not seeing it.

619
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,590
I'm not seeing it either, but it is possible.

620
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,210
Why?

621
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,470
Why are you not seeing it?

622
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,370
Not that I'm into it.

623
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,590
I hate American football.

624
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,950
Or any sport.

625
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,690
For the reason, very simple reason, is because eventually when you're into sports, it's a very social thing.

626
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,950
And you're going to be interacting with others.

627
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,030
And if you look at your average...

628
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,490
You can watch it on TV.

629
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,030
Yes, you can watch it on TV.

630
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,690
That's what I mean.

631
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,450
It could be possible.

632
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,990
But then how much of it can you watch?

633
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:07,170
You see, so in other words, what I'm saying, though, even though it's food, clothing, and shelter, there's a myriad of interests that you can incorporate, but those are really minimal.

634
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,310
That's personal.

635
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,950
That's the personal aspect, you know?

636
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,790
Mm-hmm You know, that's like years ago when you used to go to a fine tailor for a suit.

637
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,830
They ask that if you're a man, they ask you, how does your stuff hang on the left or the right?

638
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,130
Because they make an adjustment for it, right?

639
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,750
You know, whatever.

640
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,130
So, I mean, who's to say how it should hang?

641
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,810
That's my lascivious comment for the day, by the way.

642
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,770
Maybe the second one.

643
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,890
Third.

644
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,710
Third, okay.

645
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,290
Yeah.

646
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,630
You carnal people out there, you can blush or run or yell or whatever.

647
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,190
Fine.

648
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,670
So, and I hate it when people call it your junk because it ain't junk.

649
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,920
So, nonetheless, I think I'm good for today.

650
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,300
I'm gonna have to retire soon.

651
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,540
Yeah, and thanks for doing this, Bruce.

652
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,500
Oh, no, no problem.

653
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,820
No problem.

654
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,380
Yeah, and one of these days I'll tell everyone what I really think.

655
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,460
I remember one of your discussions quite fondly.

656
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,120
Well, you know, then that was discussion was about how to fix.

657
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,100
You can fix anything.

658
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,660
It's just that.

659
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,600
You can fix anything.

660
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,680
And everything, yeah.

661
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,040
But the thing is that people aren't gonna like it.

662
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,400
Well, then don't ask me to fix it.

663
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:30,660
No, they're not.

664
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,580
No, no, they're not.

665
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,060
And I think what I told you was very objective.

666
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,740
I think you were being soft, actually, that night.

667
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,060
Yeah, right.

668
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,200
It still ends up, in other words, it still ends up.

669
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,100
It still ends up not being pretty.

670
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,820
Well, yeah, you're gonna lose, to fix it, you're gonna lose about three quarters of the population instead of 90 to 90.

671
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,280
Just on the first couple of minutes.

672
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,180
Yeah.

673
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,900
Well, the better, I mean, I'm not saying you could do it better than the gods, but for sure, three quarters of people gotta go.

674
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,740
I'll go on the record for saying that.

675
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,000
That's without a doubt.

676
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,400
The gods are going to eliminate 95% of y'all.

677
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,460
But for sure, what I see so far, three quarters can't be around it to make the world a better place because they're seared.

678
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,760
You cannot change them.

679
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,180
It's just like when you work at the foundry and you're pouring, let's say, pawls for a sailboat pin, right?

680
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,920
You know what a pawl is, right?

681
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,660
Looks like a rod with a hook on it.

682
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:37,080
And if the mold is no good, in other words, if the metal casts out, it has to be melted again and cast again.

683
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,440
In other words, most people are cast into just pure evil and they don't even know it.

684
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,640
And they don't want to know it and you can't change them.

685
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,440
And it's not because I say it, it's because they say it.

686
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,640
And I used to hear people say, by the way, maybe Bruce, you might have heard of it living here.

687
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,840
I'll defend to the death what you believe in for your right or some stupid stuff that people say, right?

688
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,360
Yeah, I do recall that.

689
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,180
You better stop saying I'll defend to the death because one of these days you might be accommodated.

690
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,380
And it ain't worth dying for.

691
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,380
It's some stupid shit.

692
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,060
Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, all that stuff.

693
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,380
That's some real dumb shit.

694
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,420
None of that shit.

695
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,380
Right, so, oh no, or, yeah.

696
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,580
Yeah, that's some dumb stuff, man.

697
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,700
And yeah, but here's the thing, they will be accommodated.

698
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,800
And they're not, yeah.

699
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,960
Yeah, that's one of the examples that I can give.

700
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,580
And you can even see the evil that's in the little children.

701
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,580
They're raised into that.

702
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:44,680
Right.

703
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,840
So, and the gods have a pretty good solution for that.

704
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,700
They're going to turn all these young people, especially that were born 1998 up until around 2005 and so.

705
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,760
Oh, yeah, you're going to see what they're going to start doing.

706
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,940
Not now, but much later.

707
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah.

708
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,100
You're not going to say, do it for the children anymore.

709
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,640
So, it's not them.

710
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,320
They're just being used at this point.

711
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:19,500
It will be interesting to see how those cloakalism does it.

712
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,440
And they're in that little bit that are left.

713
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,580
The majority of them are just a representative sample of the scumbags on the planet now.

714
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,940
But they're going to be ruled and rearranged by the gods, which no man can do.

715
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,080
You know what I mean?

716
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,100
No, no one can do it.

717
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:43,140
You're going to have to have supernatural, ultra-natural and dino-natural beings to do it.

718
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,640
It ain't going to happen.

719
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,020
There's no, it's really, really bad.

720
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,900
It's, yeah, but it's not so bad if you don't know that it's bad.

721
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,440
Does that make any sense?

722
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,020
It's not so bad if you don't know how bad it is.

723
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:05,860
If you know, if you just go out to objectify and learn on your own, objectively what's going on, it's really bad.

724
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,520
I don't recommend anyone do that.

725
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,680
I recommend focusing on how to improve your food, clothing and sheltering.

726
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,740
So well, Greek, how come you're talking about these things?

727
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,260
Well, because it's not that I have to get them off my chest.

728
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,560
It's just that it's kind of sublime to see how no one else is discussing them so simply.

729
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,820
It's just retarded.

730
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,870
So yeah, you don't want to know.

731
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,650
Well, here's the other thing.

732
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,570
You're going to have to learn how to weave and loom and create happiness.

733
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,090
People try to, you ever say they want to find happiness?

734
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,730
We're under a rock?

735
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,870
Are you thinking you're going to pick it out of your belly button or someone else's belly button?

736
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,510
No, no, no, no.

737
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,330
You're going to have to learn how to create it once you find the truth.

738
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,650
I don't even like to use that word, the truth.

739
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,330
Look at all the morons out there using it.

740
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,950
So yeah, it's really, really bad.

741
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,170
So I don't know.

742
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:05,610
What do we get?

743
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:08,510
What's that?

744
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,730
Another word that they destroyed.

745
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,430
And they don't even know what it means.

746
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,530
They have no reference.

747
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,910
Even here's the sad thing.

748
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:24,550
They're deceived about you know how I say if headquarters is full of deception, only deception can come in and go out of it.

749
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:26,890
So yes.

750
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,450
Yeah.

751
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,670
And the thing is they, it cannot be changed.

752
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,270
Not because it cannot be changed.

753
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,410
It's because they've decided that they don't want it changed.

754
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,030
So.

755
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:41,890
Yeah.

756
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,270
It's all about them.

757
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,270
I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to check out.

758
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:49,650
Sorry guys.

759
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,550
That's fine.

760
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,670
Let's uh, let's just say sorry for the whole thing.

761
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,410
And uh, thanks and sorry and thank you.

762
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,170
And we'll do it again maybe next week.

763
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,390
Thanks Bruce.

764
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,790
Hey guys.

765
00:46:59,070 --> 00:46:59,390
Yes.

766
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:08,310
And uh, I want to thank you again and uh, all the uh, 20, what is it, 20 listeners tonight.

767
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,310
So a lot of people got an earful.

768
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,490
So I want to thank you both.

769
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:13,230
What's that?

770
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,030
That, that are hearing.

771
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,330
Yeah.

772
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,570
We don't know who's listening.

773
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,290
Correct.

774
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,210
And I want to thank you Sam and uh, Greek.

775
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,370
You uh, outdone yourselves again.

776
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,070
Well, so have you with your archiving skills there.

777
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,630
So um, everyone take care.

778
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:29,150
Thanks again.

779
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,090
Okay, be well both of you.

780
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,290
And be well everybody out there and you have a good night.

781
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,330
And we'll catch you next time.
