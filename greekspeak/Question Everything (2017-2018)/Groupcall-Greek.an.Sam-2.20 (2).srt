1
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,310
And greetings folks, and we are on live here with the Greek, and shortly Sam.

2
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,950
Greetings, greetings.

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,910
How are you doing tonight, Greek?

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,390
Okay.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,190
Good.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,670
We're doing another ritualistic sonic event.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,110
Seems like once a week on the Pope's work schedule we just seem to come around.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,530
We seem to do that.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,810
Yeah, I don't know why.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,670
I think, well, I do know why, because it's easy to fall into these things, right?

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,350
It's kind of like a drive home.

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,530
When you're going home, you don't really think about it.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,370
You just kind of put yourself in autopilot.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,070
Yep.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,670
So you kind of got this autopilot thing going.

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,590
Oh, yeah, it's what they call Tuesday on the Pope's work schedule.

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,830
Sam will probably be around.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,730
We'll jostle some people around.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,630
And here's the interesting thing, and maybe Sam should volunteer this information, but maybe I'll do it for him.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,510
He didn't really get on this path until he heard Greek speak, right?

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,290
And I'm sure he – well, it's not a matter – you know, it's a matter of character also.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,710
You either have it or you don't.

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:31,710
So when you – when we do this every week with Sam, it's – or almost every week, it's really a form of enthusiasm or a form of his pursuits along the lines of things that I've mentioned.

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:40,190
Not that I've mentioned anything that anyone else couldn't see or figure out, just that I happen to be the only one in this direct way.

25
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:49,990
So that's why we kind of keep it going in a way, as maybe a model or a paradigm for others.

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,930
And it's well-appreciated.

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,370
It really is.

28
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:01,170
There's a lot of things that I think – I myself for certain have learned an immense amount, a wealth of information.

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,410
Well, it makes one of us.

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:20,030
Speaking of learning, folks, if you learn to apply what's called the right-hand rule, which is, you know, you make a fist with your thumb pointing out, the current moves one way and the magnetism moves the way of your thumb, you know.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,690
The curled fingers are the current and the thumb direction is the direction of magnetism, right?

32
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,430
Correct.

33
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:45,210
Well, you turn that around and you have a magnetic – you have a current vector and you have a magnetism vector and then you have a coherent vector of force, which is not acceleration, which is a sense of doing work.

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,710
You know, when you say force, you know.

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,450
Right.

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:57,410
So when you start playing around with these things and you figure out what gravity is, how do little droplets of water evaporate?

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,590
You know, people say, well, the air is light.

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,930
You know, it's as light as air.

39
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,610
No, it's not.

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,410
The water droplets evaporate.

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,550
They're not lighter than air.

42
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,050
They're heavier than air.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,390
They have to be because it's still water.

44
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,750
It's not another phase or – I mean, yeah, it's not.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,110
It's just regular liquid water in small droplets going up against something that is heavy.

46
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:22,950
Right.

47
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,470
So once you put these together, what is water?

48
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,930
It's pretty interesting.

49
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,050
And then you learn to make things lighter than they are because weight is not mass.

50
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:45,530
You know, you can put – you know, you can move a – someone wading in water, like waist deep, can move a rowboat with ten people in it easily if they're walking beside it.

51
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,330
You know, you can pull it.

52
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,930
Let's say if you tied a rope to a rowboat with ten people and you're on dry land, you can pull it pretty easily, even 20 people.

53
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:01,690
But if you put the 20 people on a crate or ten people on a crate on land and try to pull them, you're not moving.

54
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,910
Do you see the analogy?

55
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,900
So there's several things here going on.

56
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,320
Are you still there, Bruce, or did I lose you?

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,019
Yes, I just noticed that I was over-gained on something and it wouldn't let me start.

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,579
There we go.

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,420
Okay.

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,980
So until Sam comes on, anything else going on?

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,460
Let me get the chat on.

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,300
Is there anything that's not cringeworthy in the chat?

63
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:41,380
Well, we had a little discussion about the Assyrians – no, Pythians.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,740
Pythians?

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,440
Okay.

66
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,720
Are you sure?

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,380
I think it was.

68
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,560
Parthians.

69
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,760
Parthians.

71
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,880
Parthians.

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,300
Let me scroll.

73
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:13,140
By the way, whenever I turn on a chat, I just look at – right now I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

74
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,240
Eight or nine comments is what the screen allows.

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Oh.

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,920
I take the scroll bar and I just keep pushing it up.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,100
Oh, no, I'm afraid to push the scroll bar up.

78
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,020
I don't want to.

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,800
So whatever is in front of me – yeah.

80
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,760
I understand.

81
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,240
It's still an Earthly-based chat, but nothing against those in chat.

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,580
I'm grateful that people are getting together and, I think, are discussing this kind of stuff.

83
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,820
It goes in all different directions, but a lot of times it touches on things that have been spoken about, which is always good.

84
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,840
Or beyond.

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,020
Or beyond would be better.

86
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah.

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Because the things that have been spoken of, now you're just parroting.

88
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,660
Correct.

89
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,180
Okay, so I don't see – Go ahead.

90
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll just wait for the – put the road on the show.

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,140
Right.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,980
Anything else you wanted to bring up?

93
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:41,780
Well, other than I was talking with you a little bit before we came on and talking about the hive mentality and how unnerving that was.

94
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,700
Yeah.

95
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,480
Well, the division – this is a time of division on Earth, and you can divide it many ways.

96
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,020
You know, good and evil, hot and cold.

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:59,620
But I would say the hopelessly stupid and moronic, and then the semi-intelligent, semi-rational.

98
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,660
That's the division.

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,680
And when you get – people can go between those two groups, but unfortunately the condition is terminal.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,180
If you're in the hopelessly stupid and moronic, you will probably always be there.

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,080
There was no changing that around.

102
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,440
No, no.

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,780
And to your grave.

104
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay, let's bring in Sam.

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,020
He says he's ready.

106
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,420
There's that.

107
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Let me just add to that.

108
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Education, college, you know, stuff has nothing to do with what I just mentioned.

109
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,000
So it's actually true.

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,520
Sam.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,680
Hello.

112
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,000
Can you hear me?

113
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,180
Yes, you made it.

114
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,640
All right.

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm on a new computer now, so I don't know how I sound, but I hope it's fine.

116
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,200
You're fine.

117
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,360
Yeah, it's pretty good.

118
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,100
A little bass.

119
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,260
Yeah, you could always do what's called the Echo Sound Test Service with Skype and use headphones, and it gives you all the nuances.

120
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:15,520
They don't use a very good – when Skype does the Echo Sound Test Service, they don't – when they record yourself, you know, on a little trial, 19 seconds or so, to listen to yourself back, they use a very low-quality playback.

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,500
It still gives you a sense.

122
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
We could hear you.

123
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,120
I would say there's – I get more ambient.

124
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,280
I get more room.

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,460
That mic is a wider mic than the other mic.

126
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,600
Whatever you're using was narrower, but that's the critique.

127
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,720
So what's on your mind this week?

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,260
How are you doing?

129
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm doing fine, much the same as last week, and looking into different things, most notably, well, some things about North Africa and Egypt and things of that nature and how that pertains to prophecy.

130
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
Not much.

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,240
When you say North Africa, that's a pretty long stretch.

132
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:10,480
I would go definitely Levant and east all the way to Afghanistan, and I would consider the northern Mediterranean rim more so.

133
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,400
But nonetheless, Egypt is there.

134
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,160
It is defined by North Africa, and that's very important.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,400
But the stretch of it going west, not much, other than it being a satellite, you know, influencing.

136
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,880
So if Egypt needed something, guess who's going to step and fetch it?

137
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,180
Yeah.

138
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,680
I mean, I think you've made it a point to continuously point out the role of the coming Middle Eastern Union

139
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,580
alongside certain current world powers playing second fiddle in some Mediterranean countries,

140
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,620
like Cyprus being satellite powers, and that kind of emphasis is certainly all very well,

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,300
and it's in line with Scripture, but I think it does make itself a little bit guilty of omitting,

142
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,780
in much the same way that almost every commentary about world affairs does,

143
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,200
whether future or past, it sort of omits the role of countries in, say, Africa or North Africa,

144
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,700
which Scripture prophesies about also, right?

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,140
And it's definitely not a nationalistic thing because I could care less, but there are things said about those countries that one could take note of.

146
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,620
And I don't just mean Egypt.

147
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:28,160
I mean, the Egyptian pharaohs don't even look like the sub-Saharan Africans or the current Arab populations, and hardly anybody ever brings that up, that they're a race unto themselves that much isn't known about.

148
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,560
So these sort of pan-African or black nationalist folks that use Egypt's symbology, that's a joke.

149
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:50,840
But we can sort of establish that not only is there going to be a Middle Eastern Union rise to power, but also a sort of African or North African Union, Central African Union also, that comes on the scene, and that the Antichrist actually takes issue with that.

150
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,800
And, you know, I think that that's discernible.

151
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
Let's not sell that region short.

152
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,600
I think it is, I mean, size-wise, it certainly, it has stagnated under Western influence, but it's bigger than America.

153
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,620
Oh, and it's very rich, yeah.

154
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,800
Yeah, very rich.

155
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,120
Oil reserves, mineral deposits, lots of stuff for archaeology to find.

156
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,540
And I think...

157
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:23,500
Cultural art and tradition that is almost based on, like, xenophobic preservation like the Chinese hasn't changed, so it's a good place for study.

158
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:36,680
And it does receive acknowledgment from ancient cultures like Greece, and it does intersect with the Aegean cultures like the Minoans, being dark-skinned also, so it's not insignificant.

159
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,020
Now, if you were to talk to me about, say, South America, I don't know anything in Scripture that talks about South America.

160
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,080
It might be in the Table of Nations, I haven't seen it yet, but it doesn't ever come across as being prominent.

161
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,040
I don't see anything about Australia in there.

162
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,160
No, and the antithesis is true, there's no one in South America that knows anything about Scripture.

163
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:08,080
Sure, but we do get some artifacts that come out of places like Ecuador and Klaus Don and stuff, that stuff is interesting.

164
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:17,620
But Scripture doesn't really talk about it, unless, of course, I just haven't scanned sufficiently through the Table of Nations, which there is a good chance I haven't done that.

165
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:38,820
But prophecy shows that some kind of a union will be created, led by Egypt, and extending in scope some thousands of miles southward into the area of Sudan and Ethiopia at least, and westwards some 2,000 miles maybe, to include Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and maybe even Morocco, to create some kind of a combination of nations that have influence.

166
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:55,280
Sure, if you want to, just from a resource perspective, the use of hippopotamus and elephant ivory was so common, I would say it was prevalent in the world.

167
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,540
Where did it come from predominantly?

168
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,560
Where is your biggest crop for that?

169
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,900
It's deep down into the continent almost, right?

170
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,560
So there had to be communication, and what would you call it when you have a reciprocating culture?

171
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,540
Trade, commerce, a treaty, and you do that with organization.

172
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,940
See, a government doesn't want to deal with people, it wants to deal with another government, like with like, right?

173
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,560
So there's going to be some organization.

174
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Right.

175
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:45,580
And yet, I mean, obviously, the further that you get from the Middle East, the less potent the narrative becomes, but we do get a cutoff point around what they're calling the Kingdom of Eritrea, which obviously, not Eritrea, Ethiopia, but that's obviously not current-day modern Ethiopia, but it would cut off somewhere around Central Africa somewhere.

176
00:13:47,200 --> 00:14:06,880
So I think that one of the bigger, even when you look at Egypt, one of the bigger obstacles to Egyptian expansion, and I mean ancient Egypt or Egypt of 2,000, 3,000 years ago, was difficulty in securing the Libya area, and now Libya is in shambles, or what they call modern Libya.

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,200
So it wouldn't be hard for Egypt to push its influence westwards in years to come, and what a coincidence that Libya is now a failed state.

178
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,120
I wonder why that happened.

179
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,960
Right.

180
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,760
Well, because of many reasons.

181
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,040
I think there's some hubris there, too, but that's okay.

182
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:35,680
But sort of cosmically, I can see it making sense, because in some way, Libya has to come under the influence of Egypt, based on what, at least based on what I'm seeing, we can take a look at it.

183
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:47,200
So you have the book of Daniel, Chapter 11, that provides some info, but it's easy to overlook it because it's only a few sentences, and essentially what I'm looking at is just a few sentences, but you can sort of read a lot out of it.

184
00:14:47,360 --> 00:15:02,300
So it says that you're going to have the king of the north and the king of the south situation, and there's going to be a bunch of different ones, and you have verse 36, and the king shall do as he pleases and exalt himself and show himself to be great above every mighty one and speak incredible matters against the L of the mighty ones.

185
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,040
We know this is the Antichrist.

186
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,780
Anybody who doesn't know that sort of has to validate that on their own.

187
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,620
It's not too difficult.

188
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:25,460
And then you move on into verse 40, and it says, and at the time of the end, the sovereign of the south shall push at him, and the sovereign of the north will rush against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships, and he shall enter the lands and overflow and pass over.

189
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,820
So not only is this Antichrist figure coming with land forces, but also naval forces.

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
So we know that the kingdom of the south is not a landlocked country.

191
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,380
It has to have a coastal region.

192
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,500
And also you have to ask yourself, south of what, north of where?

193
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,620
And obviously this is one of the harder things to nail down with regards to this part of Daniel.

194
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:55,460
I can only speculate, but if Jerusalem is, quote-unquote, more or less central of the world, then I'm thinking north or south from there.

195
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,900
And if it's not Jerusalem, then it could potentially be north or south of whatever kingdom the Antichrist is reigning from.

196
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,140
Which is basically Israel.

197
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,320
Right.

198
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:18,980
Something I wanted to add in, by the way, when you look at the key cities, and this is after 2028, right, the spring or fall of 2028, spring of 29, right, on the Pope's work schedule.

199
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:34,280
Okay, when you look at the key cities of Tyre, Sidon, or Tyre and Jerusalem and Babylon, it doesn't denote those are three different countries like they are today, Lebanon, Israel, and Iraq.

200
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:42,740
It denotes three cities of the same, this is a strong inference, and a strong, it's beyond speculation, by the way, but it's an inference.

201
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't ask me to go anything beyond that, because my answer to that at this point, you'll see.

202
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,000
But I would suggest studying maps of ancient Israel, their borders, you know, as far as they went.

203
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,380
Now, the way they did borders was whatever, if you followed the laws, you were under their jurisdiction.

204
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,060
You see how it worked?

205
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:13,020
It wasn't like the Egyptians where they ran through your country and they put a marker and then they ran out and said, well, okay, our border extends to this marker that we just placed, right?

206
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:27,480
So, the reason why I'm saying this is because, you know, when Solomon extended his sovereignty to the Negev, that meant that the people of the Negev obeyed his laws, right?

207
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,920
So, wherever his laws you obey is where your borders are, boots on the ground.

208
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,260
So, I would suggest more of an inference and less of a speculation.

209
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:50,040
I would infer and suggest very highly that Israel, not as the state known today, but the cities of Tyre and Babylon close by will be under what's called Israel.

210
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,500
Right, okay, but this is after 2028.

211
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,900
Yeah, 2020, 2029, right.

212
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,320
So, you know, just like Lebanon, you know, I haven't gone, I'll go out on a limp.

213
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:18,500
All this stuff going on in Syria is to break up Syria and parts of Syria will now become parts of Israel, sorry, and parts of Syria will become parts of Assyria, Iraq, right?

214
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,580
Sorry, you know, I'm not making this up.

215
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,920
It's not that I wish it or whatever.

216
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
This is what can be read out of prophecy.

217
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:33,400
So, if you want to overlap what I just said on what you see on the rectangle based on the news, I hope it makes sense.

218
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,760
So, and I've actually gone on a limp.

219
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:50,420
Oh, back in 0304, I did a public speaking venue and I described how Israel is going to really quadruple its landmass, you know, in terms of jurisdiction into these areas, and a lot of people were just very upset by that.

220
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,920
And I was like, I'm not making this stuff up, neither do I wish it, nor do I wish it doesn't happen.

221
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
I'm just saying either way, leave myself, this is not a political statement that I'm making, right?

222
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:14,640
So, anyway, back to the concept of the continental Africa, which is Egypt as well, which makes Egypt unique, by the way, because it almost is like a different race of people.

223
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:26,140
So, I want to just tie that in with a lot of the propaganda that's – well, I shouldn't say a lot, but there is these Hebrew Israelites, whatever, these black folk that think they're the original Israel and all that.

224
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:36,960
I once left a comment about a decade ago on a talk show or something, I said, you're never going to find a pharaoh with an afro or a pick in his hair, you know?

225
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,160
I mean, I was being derogatory there.

226
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,480
Yeah.

227
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,760
Remember the 1960s, the Black Panthers, they'd have the picks with fists in the end of it?

228
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,500
Yeah, so, you're not going to find one of those.

229
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,120
As a matter of fact, you can validate what I'm just saying through archaeology, and no, they didn't pull all the mummies out and replace them with the beef jerky looking white guys.

230
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,820
So, anyway.

231
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:16,830
Yeah, I mean, it would be nice to get a little more exposition on that aspect of things, aside from the humor, but yeah, I do know that the black Israelite movement sort of are on their own sort of fringe thing.

232
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,910
Yeah, I just want to throw that out there, because people are going to hear this, and they're going to be thinking, well, what about this then?

233
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,970
So, there's a lot of what abouts we can throw in and interject while we're speaking.

234
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,710
That comes to mind because I have firsthand experience of dealing with those idiots.

235
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,870
So, anyway.

236
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,270
Go ahead.

237
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:41,730
Yeah, I mean, as far as the Antichrist and his base being out of Jerusalem, that comes later, though.

238
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:50,230
First, he starts off with his base in places like Babylon, Lebanon, and Assyria, and then...

239
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,990
Hold on, hold on.

240
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,970
First, you know where he's really going to start, right?

241
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,590
In the UN.

242
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,310
Well, yeah.

243
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,590
You know, those international...

244
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:06,290
Because here's one thing, he doesn't come into power secularly in Israel.

245
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,730
He comes into power spiritually in Israel.

246
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,930
Secularly, he comes on the scene as a world-known character.

247
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,070
We've had certain precluding paradigms or foreshadowings of this.

248
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,830
For example, remember when Obama was his first election?

249
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,730
He visited Germany a month or two before the election, and half a million people showed up to applaud him, right?

250
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:40,130
What the hell does an American candidate for the executive presidential seat get so much support in Berlin for?

251
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,250
Yeah, that was odd.

252
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,070
I don't know if you guys remember that.

253
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,670
It's a little tidbit.

254
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,450
So, you're getting a lot of this international stuff going on.

255
00:21:50,870 --> 00:22:01,070
So, he will be favored internationally, secularly, and it's very clear in the book of Apocalypses that he rolls with a crew.

256
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,250
And the only way he gets the seal of approval with a quote-unquote spiritual Israel...

257
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,630
Because Israel is going to be very spiritual by then, by the way.

258
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,290
They're going to be more spiritually minded as opposed to being atheist or agnostic like they are now.

259
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,230
The only way anyone with that mindset will accept them is from a spiritual perspective.

260
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:33,770
That's why when you read in the book of Revelation, he is a prophet that comes out of the sea, which is the people or the multitude with horns.

261
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:40,970
Because who do the Israelites consider their greatest prophet?

262
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,710
He had horns, too.

263
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,470
So, anyway, I had a discussion with someone regarding the word keren.

264
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,770
And it's such a universal term that you know what horn is in Greek, right?

265
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,250
Kerata, or kerenta, again.

266
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,570
So, there's an aspect here that has to be considered.

267
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:07,670
When we bring up this Middle East Union and the agreements and all this, it's got two sides to it.

268
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,450
One is the secular side of the age, the material greed and the power and whatever is sold to the people at the moment.

269
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,130
Then you have the spiritual side.

270
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:25,750
So, it seems like the people who are spiritually minded of the gods, knowledge of the gods, and those who are worldly minded will accept both.

271
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,190
Where now it's very contrary.

272
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,150
You have people that are secularly minded or worldly, they don't accept spiritual leadership.

273
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,610
And then you have those that are more spiritual that don't like the worldly leaders.

274
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,590
This is a unique thing that's going to happen that we have never seen before.

275
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,230
So, I just wanted to throw that in there.

276
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,810
Sure.

277
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,690
But I guess what I was, what was I saying?

278
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,730
The Jerusalem thing comes later.

279
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,590
Because he does have other bases first.

280
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,590
And I actually think the Jerusalem thing comes really close to the end, like a few years before.

281
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,650
Right, because he has to finish up there.

282
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,750
As a matter of fact, he's dragged back to that place.

283
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,110
Exactly.

284
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,830
And using an Assyrian method, which is a hook in the jaw.

285
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,350
So, before all of that happens, we have this Daniel bit with the king of the north versus the king of the south.

286
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,410
And my thing is, I'm just going to...

287
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,470
We know that one of the kings of the north is this Antichrist character.

288
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,090
And he's moving up against the king of the south, which is some kind of...

289
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,590
Now, hold on.

290
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,670
I'm going to stop you right there.

291
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,210
Is there really a word in Hebrew for north and south?

292
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,850
I know that sounds philosophical.

293
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,830
Go ahead.

294
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,470
I mean, if it's a literal question, I can address it.

295
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,130
But I'm going to guess, yeah, cardinal points are pretty important regardless of the language.

296
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,910
Well, they don't really...

297
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,570
What's interesting, if you do some history on those cardinal points, they don't really...

298
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,050
It's just east they have.

299
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,190
Then they have anti-east, and then north and south are not clearly defined.

300
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,690
But anyway, that's just a phenomenon in the Hebrew tongue.

301
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,110
Go ahead.

302
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,090
Okay.

303
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,470
But is there still a directional element?

304
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,770
And, you know, you have a central reference point.

305
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,310
And north from there, it's whatever.

306
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,790
And south from there, it's whatever.

307
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,610
Of course, if you change the reference point, then north now becomes something else.

308
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,770
Like north of America is not the same thing as north of China.

309
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,520
So I'm still going to, unless, of course, there's an objection, because I don't want to sway too much on this.

310
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,400
I think that, yeah, it's north of something and south of something.

311
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,360
Sure.

312
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,620
Let's just say that needs to be investigated for more accuracy.

313
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,480
But as a matter of fact, I might do that right now.

314
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,000
I mean, it's north and south of something.

315
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,100
So I'm going to take it that it's the center of the world.

316
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,700
In other words, it's an axis point.

317
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,380
In other words, it's a point from a center point away from one point, let's just say, in opposite directions.

318
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,420
But let's just, while you're, go ahead.

319
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,700
I'm going to look at something in the meantime.

320
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,760
Okay.

321
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:10,080
So, like I said, if not Jerusalem, then one of the other Antichrist bases, which is going to be Babylon or Lebanon, and possibly Assyria.

322
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,860
I don't know if Assyria is officially stated as a base.

323
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,600
But we know he's from there and he does some stuff out of there.

324
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,040
So we're looking at countries that are south of that region that have coastal access.

325
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,620
And when, you know, if you look on a map, like immediately Egypt is the lead suspect.

326
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,060
And if you have any other candidates, you can, you know, throw them out there.

327
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,340
But as far as coastal access, I don't really.

328
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,900
I mean, it can't be Arabia because their coast is to the south of them.

329
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Right.

330
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,380
If you look at Egypt, their coast is to the north of them.

331
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,160
So you can come downwards into Egypt.

332
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,000
You can't come downwards into Saudi Arabia.

333
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,220
And going on in doubt.

334
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,660
That's good.

335
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,620
Okay.

336
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,060
Look, I just pulled up Strong's Concordance north.

337
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,540
It's Zafon.

338
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:03,660
And it's not defined as a cardinal direction, but it's defined as north or a place upwards of the east bank of Jordan is Zafon.

339
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,320
It's a city.

340
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:12,260
So if we go back to the words that are being used in the Book of Daniel for north and south, you might be surprised.

341
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,860
Are you looking at Daniel?

342
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,480
Do you do the Daniel specifically or just Strong's?

343
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:16,600
No.

344
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,500
Just Strong.

345
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,080
Strongstein.

346
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,100
What are you looking at in Daniel?

347
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm in 11, but let me just find north somewhere.

348
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,700
King of the Southland.

349
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,980
Well, in Southland it has Negev.

350
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,960
Yeah, that's right, which is a specific place.

351
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,980
So if I said you're in China and you're going to the Negev, that's very different than say I'm in China going to the south.

352
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,020
Oh, that must be India.

353
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,740
Right.

354
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,700
The Negev is in Egypt or close to Egypt.

355
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,420
Yeah, right.

356
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,920
So if you're starting in China, it's way west and then a little south.

357
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,120
So, okay, Book of Daniel, let's see, 11.

358
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,860
This is just something I came across a few years ago.

359
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,720
And when I pick up studying, this is a good time, this springtime, to pick up studying the Book of Daniel, by the way.

360
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,580
And the Book of Zechariah and the Book of Revelation.

361
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:20,800
Sorry.

362
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,220
Revelation.

363
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
No, that was a deliberate cough, sorry.

364
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,060
Because I don't want to say the word.

365
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,960
I don't want to suggest anyone study that because you're not going to understand it.

366
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,260
But the place of Daniel is a good place.

367
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,540
To start this spring.

368
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,260
Actually, is it?

369
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,800
Not really.

370
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,400
I don't think anyone is going to understand anything in scripture at this point by the looks of humanity.

371
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,300
But I'm just saying, let's just say you and I are just speaking and Bruce, you're listening and you're speaking to Bruce as well, right?

372
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,980
Book of Daniel is a good book that will start opening up.

373
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,340
And so is the Book of Zechariah in specifics.

374
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,390
So the King of the North is King of Saffon in Daniel.

375
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,690
Yeah.

376
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,470
Which is an area, is Philistia.

377
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:24,310
Saffon is, King of Saffon is, Zephon is, it's a place in Palestine.

378
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,490
Hmm.

379
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,830
Remember, they're going to have five kings there.

380
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:36,890
They're going to be ruled by, they're going to get, the Palestinian state will come into fruition with five leaders.

381
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:43,030
Five, like if you look at Hamas right now, I dare anyone to look at the leadership of Hamas.

382
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,250
How many leaders, how many are there?

383
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,870
Five.

384
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,470
Always.

385
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,110
Isn't that interesting?

386
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,210
Hmm.

387
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,930
Are you aware of that?

388
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,010
No, I did not know that.

389
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,950
I haven't pursued it.

390
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,890
Oh yeah, I've been looking at them for 15 years.

391
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,050
They always have five.

392
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:10,630
You know, the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, will kill one of them or two of them, and they get replaced, and they still maintain five.

393
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,110
Hmm.

394
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,250
So you're getting some, I just turned on the email, getting emails as well.

395
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:33,640
I mean, currently, they're saying that the Negev sort of sticks to southern Israel, but I'm guessing that in ancient times, that may have, that could have been any region that extended into Egypt or even further south, which would then hit into Egypt.

396
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,570
But we can't.

397
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,370
Your audio sounds different.

398
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,990
How about now?

399
00:30:52,350 --> 00:31:03,890
But as far as Safan, I don't know that that can really be limited to just the Palestine area, because the King of the North, this Antichrist character, doesn't come into that area to really reign until it's really the end.

400
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,990
Well, he does reign, but by word, by jurisdiction, by eminence.

401
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,970
Yeah, I guess that's true.

402
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,170
We don't dwell, he doesn't dwell there.

403
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,050
I mean, who knows?

404
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,110
They might have a good massage parlor there.

405
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,530
He rules the world by jurisdiction.

406
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:25,770
So we can't just isolate this Palestinian area as being the only area of focus for that.

407
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,230
This is just for public, let's say, expediency and for everyone.

408
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:39,590
Any discussion on the book of Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation, all this?

409
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:51,750
The amount of Revelation on those things is going to increase so much starting now that pretty much anything that we might have perceived in the past might be discarded or reevaluated.

410
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,050
You see what I mean?

411
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,850
Yeah, sure.

412
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:03,990
And this is a caveat to anyone, not because I say so, but because these things need to be examined temporarily.

413
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,450
Like, who are you, where are you, and when are you?

414
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,550
The when.

415
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,010
It doesn't mean we shouldn't do it.

416
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,930
I just think it's funny to, have you ever done something and a few years later looked at it and said, oh, this is ridiculous now, right?

417
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,110
That's why you have to really be careful.

418
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,790
That's where objective comes in, objectivity.

419
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:37,310
Things we know for sure about what I just mentioned, the one that temporarily would be most effective the soonest is the book of Zechariah, which we discussed slightly last week.

420
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:44,450
We brought up the concept of the Temple and people turning away and certain perceptions of religious leadership.

421
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,870
That will come before anything in the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation.

422
00:32:49,610 --> 00:33:01,470
Even though those book of Daniel and book of Revelation have taken effect already, the comprehension of it won't be as clear as it is now beginning to be.

423
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,810
Now meaning literally.

424
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,830
We're going into spring here soon.

425
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,140
Yeah, I'm not going to push too much on who are the king of the north and the king of the south.

426
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,720
If it doesn't tell us, we have to wait.

427
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,860
Right.

428
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Or as far as the geographical locations.

429
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,460
But we know that, I mean, you can use a common sense to figure out that the Antichrist is one of them and that we see him acting here in a certain way.

430
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:34,740
So if you look further down into verse 40, no, I just did 40, 41.

431
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,000
And he shall enter the splendid land and many shall stumble.

432
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,020
This is after he's crushed the king of the south.

433
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,100
And he shall enter the splendid land and many shall stumble.

434
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,120
But these escape from his hand, Edom, Moab, and chief of the sons of Ammon or Amnon.

435
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,820
I'm going to assume that the splendid land is Israel.

436
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,140
I mean, scripture is the gods talking, and I don't see that kind of language being used for other countries.

437
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,600
So, and then you have three countries east of the Jordan River that avoid being defeated, which are these other ones, Edom, Moab, and Amnon.

438
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,560
And then after that, he targets Egypt.

439
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,600
Verse 42, and he shall stretch out his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.

440
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,440
But he shall have power over treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt.

441
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,960
And the Libyans and the Kushites shall be at his steps.

442
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:34,120
So, Egypt today is sort of a land that was in recent history impoverished, and that was in the 90s and the 80s as far as I know.

443
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,960
And then they had their government overthrow in 2011, and it hasn't really regained its footing.

444
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,120
So, I think it might still be one of the poorest countries.

445
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:46,719
And that's still all Western influence to set up even more tension for what's coming.

446
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,440
All that Arab Spring stuff, by the way, I have contact with people there.

447
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,860
No one there with their right mind knew that that was not an organic thing that happened, by the way.

448
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,240
But it's there just to set up.

449
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,280
But by the way, let me just throw this in here again like I always do.

450
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,040
The gods don't give a crap about you.

451
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,520
Let me say that again.

452
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,360
No, I don't have to because I've said it so many times before.

453
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:24,680
What I mean by you is when you love someone or even if you're just discussing your own self, if you have physical harm done to you, that is not considered as something caring.

454
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,220
The gods do not care about you.

455
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,660
They will grab a million people and throw them in a meat grinder.

456
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,240
And if you ask them why they did it, they will say, we don't need a reason.

457
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,360
How dare you ask?

458
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,440
All of them.

459
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,440
So, have you ever heard somewhere, fear the gods?

460
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,980
And people say, oh, I don't fear.

461
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,760
That's fear.

462
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,760
I don't want the New Age idiots.

463
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,460
Why do they say that?

464
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,500
Because this is how they operate.

465
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,440
This is their MO.

466
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:59,540
So, when you read about these things coming about, this power is given to this Antichrist figure.

467
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,860
It's almost like a godlike power where there's an indifference to human life, let's just say.

468
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
So, I don't know when people are going to figure this out in mass.

469
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,640
Maybe later after the resurrection, most likely, most things will be figured out.

470
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,040
But they still think this, when we discuss things of the gods, they think it's a joke.

471
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,600
So, anyway.

472
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,260
It's like atomics or nuclear.

473
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,220
If you set one off in your living room, it doesn't care that it's your living room.

474
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,860
It will incinerate you, just the same as if you did it out in the middle of the desert.

475
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:44,400
Wherever the gods are, bad shit's going to happen, unless they want it to be otherwise.

476
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,860
And I'm talking about the benevolent ones now.

477
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,540
So, anyway.

478
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,520
I don't think people are paying attention.

479
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,540
You ever get that feeling?

480
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,940
I'm seeing it more and more.

481
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,580
I'm getting used to it.

482
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,440
I ask these morons, what god are you talking about?

483
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,500
The gods have no qualms at all about incinerating you and your children.

484
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,600
At all.

485
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,060
How do I know?

486
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,680
I've studied the scriptures.

487
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,700
What's wrong with you people?

488
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,060
You can't approach them with faith only.

489
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,940
Faith in what?

490
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,280
How can you have faith in something you know nothing about?

491
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,160
It makes you insane.

492
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,920
So, you better know how to play the sport.

493
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,640
It's a sport.

494
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,440
It's a cosmic sport.

495
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,360
You better be aware of the teams and the rules and all that.

496
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,240
So, anyway.

497
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,880
I just had to throw that in because people think this is either academic or spiritual or religious or whatever.

498
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
Or they like it or they don't like it.

499
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,080
They have no idea.

500
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,720
I think it's best that they don't.

501
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah, it's fine.

502
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,720
Either way.

503
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,940
So, yeah.

504
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,740
Egypt coming into prominence is interesting because they're really poor right now.

505
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:12,580
So, when it says that the Northern King comes into Egypt at the end of – close to the end of the age and says that he will have power over traders of gold and silver in Egypt, you have to ask, like, how do they acquire enough riches for the Antichrist to want to covet them when they're currently poor?

506
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,040
So, the whole country has to do a 180 for that to happen.

507
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,480
Well, they're poor because they're maybe dubbed.

508
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,780
I think Egypt has their own – I know Iran does their own manufacturing of cars and planes and things like that.

509
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:36,120
I don't think anyone is really poor right now because you can glean resources from the earth, you know, water, fuel, fuels, and minerals and things like that.

510
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,040
I think the poor is the restrictions put on by certain entitled classes or the masses, yeah, because the masses don't know the laws.

511
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,200
So, I think that is the culture of poverty more than the true poverty.

512
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,240
Right.

513
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't mean that the land is poor.

514
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,560
No.

515
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,720
I mean the culture has made them poor and the restrictions that are on them.

516
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
But that has to be lifted.

517
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,040
Yes.

518
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:08,900
So, that will be lifted for the place to become prosperous and not prosperous by some small measure either because why is this guy targeting them?

519
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:22,140
He could target any part of the world, but he targets them because they have something that he wants and also probably because they're resisting him, which is what I – which is why I speculate that they're the king of the south because the king of the south creates a problem.

520
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:30,040
The antichrist goes at him, and here I see him running over Egypt specifically and Egypt's allies.

521
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,040
But it puts Egypt at the head of that confederation.

522
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,800
And then it goes on to talk about the other countries, the Libyans and the Kushites shall be at his steps.

523
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,600
So, he's going to attack these areas corresponding to ancient Libya and the kingdom of Kush.

524
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:01,440
And like I said, modern people will make the mistake of imposing modern boundaries on these places, but modern boundaries don't even have bearing on the real ground because I've heard that you can walk from Egypt into Libya without even knowing you're in a different country.

525
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,480
So, what you're saying – That's like the US.

526
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,580
US and Canada is the same, forests and places like that.

527
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,060
They're not going to paint a line like they do in the middle of the street.

528
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,640
By the way, I want to interject something.

529
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:32,660
When the antichrist is using mechanized military to do this, and I said when, not if, or let's say if also in there, let's say tanks, planes, soldiers, what flag or by what jurisdiction are those military machines going to have?

530
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,380
You know how tanks and planes, they have a – what country they're from on there?

531
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:44,500
Guess what country when the – let's say hypothetically the antichrist does this with Egypt, right?

532
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,020
And he comes in with jets, tanks and things like that, right?

533
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,920
When you look at those jets and tanks, what flag will they be flying?

534
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,640
Israel.

535
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,790
Does that make any sense or no?

536
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,730
I'm only skeptical because he only takes Israel after this stuff happened, after the Egypt stuff happened.

537
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:13,530
He doesn't take it before or he doesn't move into the – he doesn't put his palace in between the two seas as it says until it's after all this.

538
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,390
So, whose flag is he going to be flying on the tanks and on the jets?

539
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:26,930
I didn't say it wasn't Israel, but if you're just going to say it like out in the open, I have a sort of instinctive pushback.

540
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,450
Maybe because I haven't read everything that I need to read, but is it a Syrian flag?

541
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:32,850
I don't know.

542
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,510
He's an Assyrian.

543
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,950
Yeah, but to the world, is he really an Assyrian or is he a Judean?

544
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,330
No, he's not a Judean.

545
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,690
Why would he be a Judean?

546
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,290
Yeah, that's a good point, isn't it?

547
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,830
Better look into that in the future.

548
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,640
There are those that claim they're Judeans and they're not.

549
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,080
Yeah, but we have – we already have people that we can point to with that.

550
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,260
Sort of.

551
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Remember, there's a precursor to everything, right?

552
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,260
This is part and parcel of the mindset.

553
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,200
The Samaritans are already those.

554
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,180
They're the ones claiming to be Jews or not.

555
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,980
Historically, they are.

556
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,060
Yeah, well, we're looking forward now.

557
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,980
Forward.

558
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,640
I'm just throwing things out because – let me just put it this way.

559
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,220
There's a lot of people that are Judean that deny being Judean, especially in Europe.

560
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,900
There's a book written about that, several books.

561
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,900
There's one that I heard of.

562
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,900
I don't have the author or even the name.

563
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:48,240
It was something in the title about the secrets of Jewish women, like women living in 19th century, early 20th century Europe in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and they would meet every so often in private and in secret and proclaim their Judaism.

564
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,840
But if they were out in public, no one knew them as such.

565
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,660
They thought they were regular Catholic indigenous people.

566
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:11,380
They kept it in secret for obvious reasons because of the – we want – the history of the quote-unquote Judeans is come to our country because we want your technology, your science, your ability to deal with math, numbers, money, medicine.

567
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:18,120
And then once they did that for a generation or two and trained the people, then they said we don't want you anymore.

568
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,020
Get out of here or we'll persecute you.

569
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,640
That's the story for the past 2,000 years, I think, even in America.

570
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:37,740
I think it was – most of the American presidents in the 20th century were extreme anti-Semites, openly, openly, not secretly, schematic.

571
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:44,580
And when I say that as Semites, I mean for non-Judeans as well, but anyone that was of Schematic descent.

572
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,660
So anyway, I just – okay.

573
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,320
I'll digress from that.

574
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,760
Let's go back.

575
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:50,840
That's fine.

576
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:58,920
In either case, you have the Libyans also and the Kushites getting overrun, and we have to consider their ancient borders.

577
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,280
Kush was a grandson of Noah, eldest son of Ham, and brother of Canaan, Mitzrayim, and Put.

578
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:16,220
Even though it's said that there's another nation of Kush somewhere in Afghanistan or near Afghanistan, I feel like we have sufficient evidence to this particular Kush being south of Egypt.

579
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:27,840
There's a verse in Jeremiah that points to them having some kind of skin color or skin pigment, Jeremiah 13, shall a Kushite transform his skin or leapart his spots, things of this nature.

580
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,400
And you have the Septuagint consistently translates Kushites as Ethiopians, and this is what the Greeks called them.

581
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,840
Strabo indicates that they looked similar to the Indians.

582
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,580
I think he said something like those who are in the Indus and those who are in Africa do not differ from each other.

583
00:44:43,800 --> 00:45:03,160
So both dark-skinned people, and Josephus will always be there to give an account of something, and he says of the Kushites, for of the four sons of Ham, time has not at all hurt the name of Kush, for the Ethiopians, over whom he reigned, are even at this day both by themselves and by all the men of Asia, called Kushites, antiquities of the Jews.

584
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:10,140
So Afghanis would be called Kushites or Ko, I don't think people, but anyway.

585
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,520
No, I think he's Africans.

586
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:13,940
Yeah.

587
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,580
So Kush in the Old Testament period, I believe, included Sudan as well as modern Ethiopia.

588
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,120
And I think it actually went down to the River Nile area, all like all of the River Nile area, actually.

589
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,680
So going like 2000 miles away from the Mediterranean Sea down into central Africa.

590
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,260
But I haven't been able to pinpoint exactly where I'm still looking into that.

591
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,240
But it's a pretty big region going southwards.

592
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,780
And then regarding Libya, you know, Libya is funny.

593
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:51,140
The Hebrew says Lubim, L-U-B-I-M, which is a word that is found on Egyptian monuments.

594
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,420
I've read that it means people who dwell in a thirsty land, which I guess would suggest a desert.

595
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,380
And it also gets equated with the land of Put, not Punt, which is something else.

596
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,320
By the way, the desert would be the wilderness, but go ahead.

597
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,820
Yes, it would be.

598
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,620
Land of Put being Libya.

599
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,040
Right.

600
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,840
Thirsty for what?

601
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Water or knowledge?

602
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,040
Maybe they were blocked.

603
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,260
Have you ever heard of censorship where information is put anywhere?

604
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,960
Now we're getting philosophical.

605
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,640
It sounds platonic now.

606
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,380
Go ahead.

607
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,380
No, I think it's thirsty more in the literal sense because, you know, cosmic censorship has been in place since the beginning.

608
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,500
So I think that these kind of references are not quite that present.

609
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,700
For example, Saudi Arabia, up until recently, if you were caught with a Bible at the airport entering the country, they confiscated it from you.

610
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,290
Which is fine.

611
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,490
I think they should all be confiscated at this point.

612
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,370
So people will say, wait a second, I've got to have this.

613
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,750
No, really?

614
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,090
I think you have to take a competency test before you get one.

615
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,910
You should have a license to get one of those.

616
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,430
Anyway.

617
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:05,870
Anyway, so Put, as I said before, third son of Ham.

618
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:11,130
He's also a brother of the aforementioned Kush.

619
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,990
And we know that Ham gets associated with dark-skinned people of Africa quite often.

620
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:23,430
I think Josephus also writes, Put was also the founder of Libya and called the inhabitants Putites from himself.

621
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:29,570
But the name, it has now, it has now has been by change given.

622
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,930
What's it saying?

623
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:41,750
But the name has been changed by one of the sons of Metzrayim, also called Libyos, antiquities of the Jews.

624
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,730
So that would explain the name change.

625
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,750
But Put and Libya, from everything that I've looked at, generally seems to be the same.

626
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,350
And the historians generally seem to say that.

627
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,890
Not to say that the historians are always right, but I found enough different references of that.

628
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:04,390
Metzrayim, obviously, was another son of Ham who creates Egypt, which is actually called Metzrayim and not Egypt.

629
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:15,470
Also a fragment, you have a fragment from Nebuchadnezzar II's annals that talk about his campaign in Egypt and defeating the soldiers of a place called Putu Yavan.

630
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,570
Which is literally Greek Libya.

631
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,270
And that would make sense as far as its positioning.

632
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:24,470
So in any case, ancient Libya goes out way into the West.

633
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,290
It's not just modern day Libya.

634
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:30,670
It was the whole African continent west of the Nile Valley into Morocco.

635
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,170
And I think even Herodotus validates that.

636
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:43,750
So when this king of the north takes over Egypt, he's also going to conquer the entirety of North Africa because that's what Libya is.

637
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,410
And also going down to southern Africa.

638
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,710
And this is sort of why I brought it up initially that that sort of area does have some kind of irrelevance.

639
00:48:54,930 --> 00:49:00,370
It's not just this sort of like Australia place that it doesn't really matter what happens there.

640
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,650
And after that, when he's done with this place, he turns his attention somewhere else.

641
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,530
Daniel 11 continues in verse 44.

642
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:26,250
So to harmonize that with all this directional talk, I think you do need to have some kind of a point of reference.

643
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,410
So this is continuing on the same book?

644
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,890
Yeah, same book, Daniel.

645
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:39,510
So right after he goes at the African, let's just say the North African Union, which extends all the way to Africa.

646
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,690
Or let's just say the African Union.

647
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:50,290
Once he goes at that and defeats them, then he gets news that there's some kind of trouble brewing in the north and in the east.

648
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,410
It doesn't say north or east of where, but once again, I'm just going to take the sort of…

649
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:55,930
Well, it does.

650
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:05,050
Well, just from a loose perspective, the word for north is the name of a place, more than a cardinal.

651
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:13,230
And east, usually, I forgot the word, but there's only one cardinal direction in Hebrew, and it's east, which actually is a description.

652
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,410
And guess what the description is?

653
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,990
What happens in the east every morning?

654
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:18,910
Sunrises.

655
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:19,750
Sunrises.

656
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,390
Yeah.

657
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,430
So let me look up the word.

658
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,570
I wasn't looking at it in the interlinear, that's why I keep saying the wrong thing.

659
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,190
I wasn't either.

660
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,650
No, it's not wrong.

661
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,830
It's to be considered.

662
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:38,470
We're not saying anything as it is.

663
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,950
We're considering these things.

664
00:50:40,190 --> 00:51:00,510
By the way, all of this stuff that you and I have been discussing and actually typically I discuss are things that need to be considered, and I ask questions about them, and not in a way to send the conversation of the dialectic into a wild spin, but to have them reconsidered and reconsidered again.

665
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:08,630
I think that there's more, I wouldn't say Cartesian coordinates on where these places are, versus a cardinal direction.

666
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:09,490
You see what I mean?

667
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,550
I think these are more Cartesian than cardinal.

668
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:26,550
Cartesian meaning, you know, you have two locations, you find the third, versus, you know, the way we, when we say northeast, southwest and all that, we think of it as directions on a compass.

669
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,190
Well, you know, if you keep going east, eventually you'll be going west to come back around.

670
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,850
So, I mean, you'll go to the west.

671
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:40,430
So I think these are more Cartesian than cardinal, even though there is no such term in scripture.

672
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,730
You know, this is for the reference, the mindset.

673
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,870
Right.

674
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:54,970
Well, as far as the interlinear, which I probably should have been reading from, yeah, I've been taking from the scriptures 98 just because it's easier to copy and paste.

675
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:02,910
Let me ask you, by the way, I might have to, are you looking at the scripture 98 electronically?

676
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,810
You said copy and paste, so it's electronic, right?

677
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:05,750
Yeah, e-sort.

678
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:06,750
Okay.

679
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,590
I was thinking of getting one of those again.

680
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,810
I have only the 2009 one here.

681
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:18,190
You know, by the way, I used to buy cases of those Bibles and give them away to people who wanted to read it.

682
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,350
You know, those were when I was younger and dumber and wealthier, I should say.

683
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,370
But, yeah, okay.

684
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:30,190
But I'm looking to get one in print again, so I guess eBay.

685
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,230
Anyway, yeah, but you said copy and paste.

686
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:33,690
I gave it away, so disregard.

687
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,050
Yeah, it's digital.

688
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:36,050
Yeah.

689
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:48,050
So it's actually saying in the interlinear that reports shall fluster him from the, and this is where the ISA is kind of confused.

690
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:52,370
It doesn't really know what it wants to say because in the translations box it has sunrise.

691
00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:00,230
But what it does is that it sort of fades out the word sun and just leaves the word rise as if it's undecided.

692
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,770
So when you look in the actual interlinear it says misrock, which means…

693
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,730
Well, it's like saying dawn.

694
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:15,890
If it's not a lady's name, when you think of dawn, you're going to look to the east if you know by definition the description of what dawn is.

695
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,150
It's first light after a lot of darkness.

696
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:25,710
Even if you don't know where east is, you're going to turn your head around, you know, 370 or 270 degrees until you find it.

697
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,110
You see, it's kind of like that.

698
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:29,550
Right.

699
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,290
No sun involved.

700
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,470
Yeah, because believe it or not, at dawn there is no sun yet.

701
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,890
The first hour you don't see the disc is still below the horizon.

702
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:39,930
Right.

703
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,400
And then when it says the north, it's Cephan.

704
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,860
So, something shall fluster him from misrock and Cephan.

705
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,760
Then he goes forth with great fury.

706
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,280
But, I mean, lightly translated east and north, I guess.

707
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,580
No, it's fine.

708
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,400
It's fine to be…

709
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:13,620
You consider it that way and then you consider it more literally, which is not the literal that we get in English, meaning the literal in the interlinear, let's say, or the language of preservation.

710
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,420
And it wasn't the book of Daniel also written in Aramaic?

711
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,960
I think so.

712
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,580
Originally?

713
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,440
Well, it was preserved in Aramaic and then of course it was canonized and reconsidered and re-scripted in the Hebrew.

714
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,860
There are Aramaic fragments of that, so I think that is what it is.

715
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,040
Predate the Hebrew, yeah.

716
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,190
So…

717
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,630
First century, I think they did it in Hebrew right before.

718
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,550
Okay.

719
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,430
I mean, yeah, this kind of does have to…

720
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,850
It redirects the thoughts because if we're going to go with the cardinal stuff, then, well…

721
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:53,930
You just look at all of it.

722
00:54:53,930 --> 00:55:12,630
When you look at the center point, if we're going to look at Jerusalem as being the center point or some kind of Middle Eastern area, whether it's Babylon that he's based out of or Lebanon or Jerusalem, well, if you look north of that, you obviously have Turkey and the Caucasus regions and Russia all the way to the north.

723
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:19,090
And if you look east of that, you have Iran and Central Asia and then East Asia and China all the way to the east.

724
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:26,010
But either way, we're not talking about the North or South American continents and we're not talking about Africa and we're not talking about Australia.

725
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,790
So, I mean…

726
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,490
Nobody should be talking about Australia.

727
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,350
But anyway, sorry.

728
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:40,830
So basically, once this guy gets the African Union, this is just conjecture, but he hears some kind of news that makes him mad and makes him go after other people.

729
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:49,410
So maybe the rest of the world starts murmuring that he's taken over too much territory, he just invaded and took over half of Africa, maybe they have to do something about it.

730
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:49,850
I don't know.

731
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,930
Either way, he goes out to subdue them, which he does.

732
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:57,910
He has success with that, meaning that he essentially takes over most of the Eurasian continent, I'm guessing.

733
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,450
Of course.

734
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,790
Afghanistan and beyond, yeah.

735
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:02,610
India.

736
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,630
Right.

737
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:13,570
And then it's only after that he conquers this Eurasian capital that he makes Jerusalem his capital, which is at the end of Daniel 11.

738
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:20,410
And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas and the glorious holy mountain, yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him.

739
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:27,730
So between the two seas, I'm guessing that's the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, which is where Jerusalem is located, which is also equated with the holy mountain.

740
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:38,050
And I think this is what Paul is referencing when he talks about a man who goes into the temple, sets up the abomination of desolation, and then starts calling himself Yahweh or God.

741
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,870
The previous one by name, yeah.

742
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:43,610
Yeah.

743
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:49,510
Because at that time people are going to start to delineate names because they're more than they are now even.

744
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:59,610
Right now you're still in stupidity beyond the eye, way above your ears in the world regarding all of these matters.

745
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:16,410
So in general the point that I'm trying to show is that the last two things that this Antichrist has to do to finalize his world domination is one, take over North Africa and parts of Central Africa, and then the countries north and east of that in Eurasia.

746
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,810
So only then does the last sort of phase start.

747
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:25,210
And then it says that his time is quite short because it ends with Daniel 11.

748
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,490
He shall come to his end and none shall help him.

749
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,010
And this is right after that.

750
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,390
And then it goes right into Chapter 12.

751
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:36,810
And it says that this is when Michael stands up, the great prince of Israel, and there shall be a time of trouble.

752
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,050
Speaking of which, let me just interject something.

753
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:42,790
I just got an email.

754
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,730
Ha ha ha ha.

755
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:51,410
These people who make video games are OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF SCRIPTURAL HISTORY or JUST HISTORY.

756
00:57:51,950 --> 00:58:01,730
In a game called MGS5, the Phantom Pain, the main character has a missing eye and a fake arm, and his base of operations is on the Sekiles.

757
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:07,270
I just thought I'd throw that in because it pertains to what you're interested in.

758
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:16,370
You and I have brought up in private conversation how there's an underlying current that underscores what's coming in the video culture.

759
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,390
Or, you know, video games and other things that are geared to young people.

760
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:26,790
So when these things do happen, the young people who are going to be most active, which I suggest, are going to already seem to look at these things, oh yeah, naturally.

761
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:27,730
You know, of course, right?

762
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,330
I never thought of that.

763
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,950
That's true.

764
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,570
Didn't you say once that they always go after the newest generation?

765
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,550
Oh yeah, or do it for the children.

766
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:51,420
Yeah, you do see a lot of interactions with the spiritual realm in video games and superhero movies.

767
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:58,620
But I think video games, frankly, is the most potent because it's the most taken-for-granted medium.

768
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:10,160
And it's also, I think, one of the most subversive ones because you're allowed to vicariously live through the characters in a way that you can't on a movie screen where the narrative is already laid out.

769
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:18,860
Well, and the fact that you used this in the naming of the characters, which I really found that interesting.

770
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:27,300
Yeah, there's some kind of a secret society.

771
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,000
I mean, obviously, secret societies run a whole lot of things.

772
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:44,700
But there's some kind of thing in the video game world that I have not been able to figure out as far as these people who create the games have some kind of a background in some esoteric collective that is never really talked about.

773
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:59,400
Because once you hit the 1980s, especially out of Japan, there comes this whole culture of anime and video games, which espouses things that don't seem to have anything to do with traditional Japanese history or Shinto anything.

774
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:06,940
And you see them in sort of the 80s magazines when they're doing interviews wearing t-shirts with the Star of David on it.

775
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:14,580
And they're making video games like Shin Megami Tensei, which is essentially a supernatural video game about demons versus angels.

776
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:20,580
And they're essentially depicting gods that are in the Bible.

777
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,260
And it doesn't make any sense where the Japanese would be getting that from.

778
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,200
Right, it's extracultural for them, yeah.

779
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:35,200
Yeah, but there's something very organized about it.

780
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,880
It's not just sort of a passing fad.

781
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,480
It's been going 30 years strong.

782
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,160
It's external input.

783
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,280
Yeah.

784
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,880
They're getting it from the ether, literally.

785
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,440
Don't try to define the ether.

786
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,240
Just learn what it does.

787
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,740
Like a bear.

788
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:58,160
Nobody knows what a bear is, but we know enough about it that when we say bear and I ask you, do you know what I'm talking about, you say yes.

789
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,360
But when you say ether, do you know what I'm talking about?

790
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
Most people don't.

791
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,060
Learn about the ether.

792
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:11,800
Recently listening to someone also, just to interject, like how screwed up science is, when you ask someone what light is or energy, they say waves.

793
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,920
What a bunch of crap.

794
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,080
If you're waving your hand, what is that?

795
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,040
That's your hand moving.

796
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,140
You cannot define something with a wave.

797
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:21,780
It's a motion.

798
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,360
Like if you look at the ocean, what do you see?

799
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:24,740
Waves.

800
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,020
No.

801
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,640
It's water.

802
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,020
You see?

803
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,540
You see how stupid the scientists are?

804
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,160
They tell you everything is a wave.

805
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:32,760
Well, no.

806
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,600
A wave of what?

807
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,320
Anyway.

808
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,360
So learn about the ether.

809
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,780
Learn about external input.

810
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:50,760
And these things, once you, let me just say it this way, just to sum this part up, this interjection, because you're on a good roll there regarding, because you can share more about the younger culture than I can.

811
01:01:50,760 --> 01:02:06,140
But when you establish that there's an external force, cosmic censorship, i.e. everything else that we don't see tangible that affects us, our ability to see or not see something, how does that happen?

812
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,780
You will never really figure it out right now.

813
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,980
Later on we will, post-resurrection.

814
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,220
But do you understand its characteristics?

815
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:28,100
So like you were bringing up, all those descriptions you gave were basically out of Japan, but there are video games that come out of America, or is it that the video game market right now is really Korea, Japan, and America, and you can't tell the difference anymore?

816
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,540
Well, the market is global.

817
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:43,200
But Japan has…

818
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,360
Oh, yes.

819
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,740
There are, okay.

820
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,760
There are studios.

821
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:47,580
I believe so, yeah.

822
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,120
So you have the major studios, obviously, that spearhead a lot of things.

823
01:02:52,460 --> 01:03:01,820
But with the video games, the way it works is that you have publishers, and the publishers really, they have all the money, and they're sort of the main powerhouse.

824
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:10,220
And then you have the developers and the studios, and a lot of them are independent, and the publishers will pay the studios to make the game.

825
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,360
So it's like, we'll give you a contract to make a game for a certain console.

826
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,020
Right, right.

827
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,840
So you've got a bunch of geeks in a room underground, in their basement, making these things for years.

828
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,380
Yeah, I got you.

829
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,280
Writing the code for it.

830
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah, okay.

831
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,260
Right.

832
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,720
And of course, that was more 30 years ago.

833
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,080
Now, the geeks are sort of running things in Silicon Valley, and they have their…

834
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,840
They have glass towers.

835
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:30,480
Yeah.

836
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,920
They have a better standing.

837
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,380
Okay, got you.

838
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,120
But a lot of stuff still does come out of Japan.

839
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,340
I mean, they own Nintendo, which is one of the big console guys.

840
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,540
They obviously own…

841
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,600
They put out the anime stuff, largely.

842
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:51,180
A lot of the classic video game brands still do attach themselves to Japan and come out of there.

843
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,380
So there's something in Japan that I have not been able to identify, not having been there.

844
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,200
I can't speak the language, but it's very clear.

845
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:05,560
A lot of the fantasy sci-fi stuff took its origins from there, starting in the 60s.

846
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,820
The Japanese are to Asia as the Greeks are to Europe.

847
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,700
What I mean by that is if you…

848
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,340
Look how different language, culture, and all that is, right?

849
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:16,260
Right.

850
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,880
Japan is sort of an anomaly, Asian anomaly.

851
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,060
Most…

852
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,300
The ignorant people don't see it that way, but it's very different.

853
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:25,700
Yeah.

854
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,960
And all the Asians…

855
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:31,900
You could deal with Asians of any country in Asia, even the Pacific Rim.

856
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,940
The moment you bring up Japan, it's like, oh yeah, that's like someone from Mars, you know?

857
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,040
Or I really like them or I really don't like them, whether you're speaking to a Malaysian, Chinese, Korean, or whatever.

858
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,200
If you're speaking to a Korean and you bring up Malaysian, okay.

859
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,180
But if you're speaking to a Korean and you bring up Japan, all of a sudden there's a strong sentiment that comes up, either positive or negative.

860
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:50,940
So go ahead.

861
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,040
Yeah.

862
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,820
What was I going to say?

863
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,760
Japan, something, something.

864
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,960
It got plugged out of my mind.

865
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,120
No, Japan, you were saying that it's still coming out of Japan.

866
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,140
They're very powerful, regardless of the independent studios or international community.

867
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,480
Even like goddess religion stuff.

868
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,980
Like it's very clear to me, the sort of goddess religion artifacts that exist in that culture.

869
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,880
But it's interesting because the traditional Japanese Shinto culture, it doesn't seem to reflect that.

870
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,680
It's very…

871
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,220
The contours for that are well-defined.

872
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,520
The sort of borderline aesthetic…

873
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,360
That's monism.

874
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,240
Monism in a way, which…

875
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,820
In a way, I would define a lot of the stuff we talk about.

876
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,380
Monism is that there's the God source and then there's everything else, and you ain't it.

877
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,920
Where everything else kind of blurs it around, but anyway.

878
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,320
Monism, if you were to define it…

879
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,180
Now, monotheism, which is stupid.

880
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,660
There's no such thing as monotheism.

881
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,420
That's like saying Santa Claus.

882
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:57,880
Monism is where you have the source and then everything else, and everything else is not part of that source, which is very scriptural, by the way.

883
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,260
So a pot is not the potter.

884
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,160
The bread is not the baker.

885
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:13,360
So there's a little bit of wisdom in monism, but what people think of it is…

886
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,880
Anyway, there is wisdom in Buddhism.

887
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,620
There is wisdom in the Hindu culture.

888
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,340
There's no such thing as Hinduism, which overlaps.

889
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,460
There is wisdom in Shinto.

890
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,120
There's no wisdom in Christianity, by the way.

891
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,860
Sorry, I'll go out on a limb and say that for the hundredth time.

892
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:33,540
There's no wisdom in a lot of Judaism and all their sects.

893
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,680
So let me just put it that way.

894
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,980
There's a lot of wisdom to be found in a lot of the stripped-down rits of the ancient world, but none to be…

895
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:50,580
And by the way, there's no wisdom to be found in any of the organizations now, like modern Shinto, modern Buddhism, and all that.

896
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,560
Those are just morons.

897
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:56,380
But I'm just saying, I'm talking about the rit now, right?

898
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:56,980
The script.

899
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,380
There is wisdom in the ancient Greek writings.

900
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,400
You know, what's interesting about Scripture, it delineates the culture of…

901
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,640
Two cultures are mentioned more in terms of knowledge than any other.

902
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,760
A little bit of Egypt, but mostly it's the Hellenes, the Greeks, and the Hebrews, right?

903
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:25,960
And just, I think I've mentioned this before, the Hebrews relied culturally and traditionally to get their knowledge and wisdom by revelation, by direct conveyance from an angelic being, from the Godhead.

904
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:37,680
Where the Greeks do it by deduction and philosophy through observation, right?

905
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,760
Looking for commonalities, you know?

906
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,180
Like, you know, the Phi, the relationship 1.116, you know, all that.

907
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,900
They try to find it within the creation itself.

908
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,720
So there's a lot of wisdom in all that.

909
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,260
Obviously, you know, if you're going to get a direct revelation from the Godhead through an angel, obviously that trumps the rest.

910
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:10,500
But the culture, basically, of the Judaic mindset is you get wisdom delivered, conveyed to you from an angel, through prophets, even though they hate it when they get it because they kill the prophets, right?

911
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,660
And the Greek side is you get wisdom by philosophy or by observing.

912
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:17,220
And there's wisdom in both, obviously.

913
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,399
But I would take the latter.

914
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,680
I would take it by revelation because it comes more direct.

915
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:25,700
But nonetheless, this is what's going on.

916
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,800
I just summed up 5,000 years worth of history, or maybe less.

917
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,279
Actually, let's say 2,500 years of thinking.

918
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:37,939
Indeed.

919
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:44,779
But to go back to what you were going to say about the Japanese, where are they getting it from now?

920
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,200
So, anyway.

921
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,100
Yeah, I don't know.

922
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,439
I mean, like the goddess religion thing, there seems to be two.

923
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,620
I'm speaking in very general terms.

924
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,800
This is just from observation.

925
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:57,660
There seems to be two parallel cultures going on in Japan.

926
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:00,819
And maybe even in China, you can sort of see it developing there.

927
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:11,680
You have the sort of traditional Shinto Japanese culture, and its spin-offs, and its sort of connection to what people call Buddhism, even though they're different things.

928
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:14,240
Yeah, they're not the same at all.

929
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:14,580
Go ahead.

930
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:30,500
And then you have this new wave, sort of post-1970s, 80s Japan, where young people are adhering to this video game anime culture that really does a good job of turning their brains to mush and turning them into morons.

931
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,939
It makes them very receptive to this sort of New Age way of thinking.

932
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,540
Believe in yourself.

933
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,359
Follow your dreams.

934
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:37,899
Be accepting of everything.

935
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,939
Don't be too critical.

936
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,479
And this sort of nonsense.

937
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:48,260
And these things exist side by side, and I don't really see there being...

938
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,340
But hold on.

939
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,400
All these New Age people, including them, they're being set up for the Antichrist.

940
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,820
Because it's going to be so easy for this guy to come on the scene and switch all that.

941
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,520
Yeah.

942
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,200
Because it's not a competing mindset.

943
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,800
It's a completely different mindset.

944
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:10,720
It's always easier to get someone out of one mindset into a completely other than to a competing mindset.

945
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:12,320
Right.

946
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,440
So, go ahead.

947
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,220
Yeah, so...

948
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,060
There's laying the groundwork ahead of time, isn't there?

949
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:18,800
Yes.

950
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:19,400
Yeah.

951
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,920
Yes, cosmically, I mean, it's obviously part of the setup.

952
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,160
That is the most God's-eye-view way of looking at it.

953
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:35,500
But once you start looking at it a little closer, I think it becomes interesting to delineate exactly what mechanisms are being used to enforce that.

954
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,460
And in this case, it's the video game culture and the anime culture.

955
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,260
And I mean, you do have a few North American powerhouses.

956
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,840
You have Blizzard Entertainment, which is a video game company in California.

957
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,160
They made sort of things that almost everybody's heard of.

958
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:56,180
World of Warcraft, Diablo, these very big online games that kids play for like eight hours straight type of things.

959
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,020
But still, Japan is a powerhouse.

960
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,920
Yeah, I just thought it was interesting what the guy wrote in the email because I didn't recognize that.

961
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,700
I figured you'd appreciate the details of the email.

962
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,060
It was Greek to me.

963
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,700
Well, actually not Greek, but you know what I mean.

964
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,460
I don't know any of that stuff at all, the names and all that.

965
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:21,180
But I figured you'd appreciate the detail of the email and that someone else is seeing the detail here.

966
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,160
Sure.

967
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,540
So, yeah, sort of moving back to what we were talking about.

968
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:39,220
I mean, aside from Egypt coming into riches or learning how to maximize their potential and what they have further along.

969
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:45,560
If you look at Ezekiel 29 and 30, it speaks of additional Egyptian related events.

970
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,980
It's a bit harder for me to conclude what's being said, though.

971
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,020
I have to look at it a bit more.

972
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,980
But Ezekiel 30, for the day is near.

973
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,980
Even the day of Yahweh is near.

974
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,220
It is a day of the clouds, the time of the nations.

975
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:01,000
The sword will come upon Mitzrayim and great anguish shall be in Cush.

976
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,580
And when the slain fall in Mitzrayim and they take away their wealth and her foundations are broken down.

977
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:18,180
So along with this downfall of Egypt and Cush, Ethiopia, it mentions an entire string of nations that generally seem to stretch out west and south of Egypt.

978
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:27,360
Like we've mentioned before, Ezekiel chapter 30, verse 5, Cush and Put and Lut and all the mixed people and Cub and the sons of the land.

979
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:32,200
The covenant shall fall with them by the sword and them being Egypt.

980
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,820
So looking at that, we know about Cush.

981
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,360
We know about Put, because that's Libya.

982
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,080
Then we have the nation of Lut.

983
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,480
I've had a hard time identifying them because you can go two ways with that.

984
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:53,000
Either you can take Lut as stemming from the actual guy, Lut, who was a son of Shem, grandson of Noah.

985
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:59,680
Or you can take it as a nation that stems from Lutim, who is a son of Mitzrayim.

986
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,640
So we know that these nations generally come from actual people that have the same name.

987
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,740
But you have two people here that are sort of similar names, Lut and Lutim.

988
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:15,460
In almost all the commentary that I look at, and I think that they're taking their cue from Josephus, they go with the Lut origin.

989
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:21,480
Which points to various Anatolian Turkish people, particularly the Lydians.

990
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,100
They're Semites, I should say, right?

991
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:25,760
Yeah.

992
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,020
This sort of Iron Age, what they call the Iron Age Kingdom of Western Asia Minor.

993
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:39,540
You have the Book of Jubilees also, when it describes how the world was divided between Noah's sons and grandsons.

994
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:49,080
It says that Lut received the mountain of Ashur, and all appertaining to them, until it reaches the Great Sea, and until it reaches the east of Ashur, his brother.

995
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,720
I just put in a search on Lut on a map.

996
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:03,240
And an older map has it as Beth Dagon, Yehud, Anu, Lut, Bonabreg, Afik.

997
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,700
It's not too far from the Great Sea, about 15-20 kilometers.

998
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,940
Hmm, the Mediterranean.

999
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,300
Yes.

1000
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,000
Yeah.

1001
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,040
So it's Beth Dagon, Jaffa.

1002
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:26,960
So Tel Aviv, it's just, let's say, 10 miles or 15 kilometers west and slightly south of modern Tel Aviv, which makes sense.

1003
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,480
Right?

1004
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:29,860
Yeah.

1005
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,560
Changing the names of places destroys the information.

1006
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:43,160
So, if it's not there now, and I don't know where this reference is, but let's just visit it and see.

1007
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,240
Ludum, Genesis, yeah.

1008
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,520
Ludum and Lut are different.

1009
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,280
Right.

1010
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,920
The Semitic Lut.

1011
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,220
That would be son of, not Mithrim, the other one, I forget.

1012
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,840
Son of Shem.

1013
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,740
Yeah, right.

1014
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,700
According to Herodotus, Leto was the first king.

1015
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,660
Argos, okay, there's a lot of stuff here.

1016
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,520
Not recognizable as Semitic, but it is.

1017
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:27,100
Okay, so if we put in something like that and we don't see much, and it's going to be a prominent or semi-prominent feature in the future, what does that mean?

1018
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,320
It means there's going to be, what, a revival of this, right?

1019
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,480
So something to look for.

1020
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:46,660
I mean, I sort of, I don't, Jubilees is obviously not canonical, but if it's offering up something and then you search for something that sort of agrees with it, I don't feel like it's, it shouldn't be discarded.

1021
01:15:47,000 --> 01:16:04,200
So saying that Lud received the mountains of Ashore up until the Great Sea, you know, we know that the old Assyrian Empire of 2000 BC, and not even just that, the Neo-Assyrian Empire of the 7th century, they extended all the way north into the Caucasus mountain area, so is that what's meant by the mountains of Asshore?

1022
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,520
I don't really know, I think it's possible.

1023
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:11,280
I think a revival is in order, I will know more, but it needs to be looked at.

1024
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:19,600
You know, speaking of the Assyrian people, you know, they're the most discounted force, even though they were not as prominent historically known in its time.

1025
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:20,600
Well, actually they were.

1026
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,260
They were.

1027
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,600
For 400 years they were, but they've been discounted.

1028
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,020
You know, where do you think Nebuchadnezzar came from?

1029
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,440
Wasn't he an Assyrian general?

1030
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,520
The senior?

1031
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,760
Oh, the first or the second?

1032
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,540
The first.

1033
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,740
Oh, I haven't looked into that.

1034
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,060
The earliest.

1035
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,440
Yeah, look into it.

1036
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,500
I'm just throwing this out there.

1037
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:48,200
I haven't looked into it in over a decade, but if you study, you know, obviously the Book of Daniel is pertinent, but the senior, the first Nebuchadnezzar, how did he come about?

1038
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,380
Now, you'll find this historically that he was an Assyrian that, you know, he turned on his own people.

1039
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:58,180
He got enough support, defeated them from memory here.

1040
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:05,400
He turned, he was an Assyrian general, you know, like a military force should have top three generals, let's say.

1041
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:13,440
You know, imagine one of them gets three quarters of the force, turns around on the other two, and then goes and then sets up his own deal later on.

1042
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:20,300
So, and settled, obviously, what we call Babylon or settled, you know, another place.

1043
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
Still exercising influence over what?

1044
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,000
The whole world.

1045
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:34,640
So, I just want to throw that in there, not to complicate, but to extend the perception of what we think when we bring up, you know, let's say someone like Nebuchadnezzar.

1046
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,780
I need to re-examine all that as well.

1047
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:46,200
So, when you say Nebuchadnezzar I, you mean the father of the second one?

1048
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:46,880
Uh-huh.

1049
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:47,720
Right.

1050
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:57,860
The earliest historical record of that name shows him, I believe, from memory as, you know, described, as I just described.

1051
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:08,100
I guess the only thing that I feel like, so let's not confuse one, two things.

1052
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:13,520
So, we have Nebuchadnezzar II and he has a father, but his father is not Nebuchadnezzar I.

1053
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,900
He's an Assyrian by name of Nabopolazar, some weird pronunciation, Nabopolazar.

1054
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:26,340
And then you have the actual Nebuchadnezzar I, which is a completely different guy from hundreds of years before that.

1055
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:27,700
Right.

1056
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,100
So, Nebuchadnezzar I is around 1000 BC or 1100 BC.

1057
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:41,060
And then you have Nebuchadnezzar II, which is in the 6th, 7th century.

1058
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:42,600
Right.

1059
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,840
So, his father, yes, was an Assyrian, but he's a different guy.

1060
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,320
He's not Nebuchadnezzar I.

1061
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,440
Yeah, we're talking about a big stretch in time, right?

1062
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,180
Yeah.

1063
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,780
But yeah, Nabopolazar is an Assyrian.

1064
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,760
That's interesting.

1065
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,500
That's why I say these, I've been crying, you know, watch Assyria, watch Assyria.

1066
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:12,640
Well, no, there's a million things to watch, not a million, but quantifiably there's at least several dozen things that need to be examined.

1067
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,270
And I've been trying to underscore the importance of, in reverse here, how Assyrians have been discounted.

1068
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:37,970
And how there's going to be a big bait and switch on that, where the spiritual, meaning where people lay their faith in, will be Judean, even though the characters behind it will be, you know, not Judean.

1069
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:44,090
So, here's an interesting way to talk about future events.

1070
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,210
Israel will increase in prominence.

1071
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:49,910
I'll say the word, I don't like to use it because it doesn't really hold true merit.

1072
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:54,510
The Jews will be in the news every day, all the way to the end.

1073
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,990
I assure you that, for sure.

1074
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:58,230
I'll stake anything on it.

1075
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:04,030
What you call, what the world at large calls the Jews will be in the news every day till kingdom come.

1076
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,270
Okay?

1077
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:12,370
And how they're going to be in the news is the same and more intense, right?

1078
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,390
More concentrated.

1079
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,390
But what's going to change is the way the people are going to view them.

1080
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:20,490
You see?

1081
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,870
And I'll just leave it like that for now.

1082
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:35,670
All this, you know, that's why, you know, strong steam, you know, I use that as a remark, a negative remark in a way.

1083
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:51,770
But you're going to see the influence of Israel at large, whether it's geographic, political, spiritual, religious, the people increasing in magnitude as time goes on, all the way to kingdom come.

1084
01:20:52,470 --> 01:21:02,510
But the powers behind it, that interest or that noteworthiness will change from being, you know, those people and other people.

1085
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:07,130
You know, as the Caesarian, the quote unquote, instead of or Antichrist.

1086
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,910
You know, by the way, let me just say it this way.

1087
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:14,790
When the Antichrist is in power, people are not going to say, oh, look at the Caesarian.

1088
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:24,250
I don't think I've discussed it in too much detail because I don't have that much detail that I could give in terms of temporal, you know.

1089
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:31,550
You know, like, oh, watch, this will happen first and then this will happen next exactly this way when this guy is here, you know.

1090
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:37,950
No, but I'm giving you more of a generality of how the perception at large will be.

1091
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:44,790
And you have roughly two or three more prime ministers before this takes place.

1092
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,570
I think I've discussed that before as well.

1093
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:50,870
This changed.

1094
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,030
And I'll go on record.

1095
01:21:55,150 --> 01:22:03,330
I'm the only one that has ever brought up that analogy ever, anywhere, to watch the prime ministers in the first chapter of Isaiah.

1096
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,370
Oh, let's give the Greek a big hand.

1097
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,790
Yeah, get a gold star.

1098
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:16,270
But anyway, that has to be watched as well and considered as part of the temporal nature of this information.

1099
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,470
I mean, how, you know, how objective can you be?

1100
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,590
Never enough, right?

1101
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,850
You can't be too objective.

1102
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:27,690
So the quest is to try to be as objective as possible.

1103
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:30,610
And you know you're going to fall short occasionally.

1104
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:34,090
But the thing is you have to keep persisting the objectivity of it.

1105
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:36,550
Define objective.

1106
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,450
Without subjectivity.

1107
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:43,370
In other words, you know what, also, it's like defining agapi.

1108
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,550
What is agapi?

1109
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:51,470
It's one of the primary words that are translated as love from the Greek.

1110
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,450
You really can't translate agapi.

1111
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:56,290
There are words in Greek that have no translation, right, just like Hebrew.

1112
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:57,670
There are words that have no translation.

1113
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:00,290
They can be directly translated to another word.

1114
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:05,970
Agapi means doing the right thing even though you don't feel like it.

1115
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:16,390
When you know that something is right, like, for example, to have love is like someone calls you at 3 o'clock in the morning and then they say, well, I'm going to the airport in the middle of the night.

1116
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,630
Can you please walk my dog?

1117
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:20,750
And if you're like, well, the dog needs to be walked.

1118
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:21,530
It's the right thing to do.

1119
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,270
It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

1120
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:23,190
I'll get up and come over.

1121
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:27,910
That's, you see, where if you don't have agapi, you'll say, oh, well, you know, it's too bad.

1122
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:28,970
The dog will have to wait.

1123
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,490
You know, it's 3 in the morning, dude.

1124
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:33,230
You see?

1125
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:35,890
So when you put that stuff aside, it's agapi.

1126
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:44,790
So when you put the problem with objectivity is like people, if people don't like, here's the, let me just describe it in a tiptoe, roundabout way.

1127
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:48,370
You ever talk to someone and say, well, I don't like that, so it can't be true?

1128
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,290
That's the opposite of objectivity.

1129
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:55,790
If people don't like the information, they will not even consider it.

1130
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:56,630
Because here's the thing.

1131
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:04,690
There's more to this at work than we believe or can want to admit to ourselves.

1132
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,930
And this is a thing about objectivity.

1133
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:11,770
And I'll tell you, this is how scoundrelous and how evil people are on the planet right now.

1134
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:15,750
Recently I was watching something about the fake moon landings, right?

1135
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,550
And some guy said that he brought this up to a professor.

1136
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:31,390
You know, there's over 30,000 pieces of evidence, which most, you know, like, you know, NASA has destroyed, by the way, all of their reference material on the Apollo missions, because they don't want anyone looking at it.

1137
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:37,490
Anyway, he had a discussion with a college professor in physics who believed in the moon landings occurred.

1138
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:44,050
And he showed him, you know, this, let's say, a binder of all the evidence that there's no way it could have.

1139
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,850
And the college professor stopped.

1140
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,990
This is a college professor now, entitled class.

1141
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:54,790
And he said that even if one of the astronauts went on national TV and admitted the moon landings were fake, I would still believe they went to the moon.

1142
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:08,560
So, when you discuss objectivity, that's why I brought up the word love, because part of objectivity is doing the right thing, the word agape, right?

1143
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:15,350
So, when you're not objective, are you doing the wrong thing?

1144
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,030
Not necessarily, right?

1145
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,110
No.

1146
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:23,490
But in this case, we're discussing objectivity.

1147
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,730
Let me just put it, I'll go on a limb, maybe not.

1148
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:29,950
Most people are not capable, I've said this before, I shouldn't say it like that.

1149
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,530
Yes, most people are not capable of being objective.

1150
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:37,230
Just like a fish is not capable of climbing a tree at this point.

1151
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,400
Well, there might be a fish that can climb a tree, but you see what I mean?

1152
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,300
It's as far-fetched as that.

1153
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,220
You know, like wisdom and knowledge is a prize in its own right.

1154
01:25:51,980 --> 01:26:00,400
You know, if you have that wisdom and knowledge and you have persistence and you can put up with all the filth in the world, then you can become very wealthy, right?

1155
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,680
Obviously, by taking advantage of all the morons.

1156
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:06,900
That's what's called marketing.

1157
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:13,580
But if you prize wisdom and knowledge above all, you don't have to do that.

1158
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:18,380
You'll be happy with just most basic food, clothing and shelter and comforts.

1159
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:25,670
Unless you want to deal with all the filth, meaning humans, people.

1160
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:33,670
Not all of them are filthy, but as a general, you could go to a landfill, not everything is completely filthy, but it's a landfill, yes.

1161
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,090
To be surprised that a landfill is filthy, you are an idiot.

1162
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:43,790
To actually think that humanity is not filthy and disgusting, you are an idiot.

1163
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:46,890
So anyway, I decided to throw that in there.

1164
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,610
Was that objective or subjective?

1165
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,550
Hmm, I'm going to leave that for another time.

1166
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,230
I think that was pretty damn objective, but anyway.

1167
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:58,730
Now, that would sound very subjective to someone else, wouldn't it?

1168
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,830
But I'm telling you, that's objective.

1169
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,070
So you see, these are various things on objectivity.

1170
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:07,250
It goes along hand in hand with love.

1171
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:12,090
When you read about the gods, the paramount thing is love, isn't it?

1172
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:15,650
Did he say objectivity?

1173
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,030
No.

1174
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:24,630
It's love, especially when you read what's called the New Testament, which you shouldn't read it because you're not going to understand anything in it.

1175
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:26,230
I'm talking about the public at large, right?

1176
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:30,750
Or you're going to think it's something else.

1177
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:35,950
You know, there are still idiots out in the world that talk about there's a different god of the Old Testament than there is of the New Testament.

1178
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:38,630
You know, this is how stupid people are.

1179
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,270
And what was it, just three minutes ago, I just gave you what's going on?

1180
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:52,050
So maybe, Sam, to define objectivity, I would use the word agape, which is almost untranslatable.

1181
01:27:52,510 --> 01:28:04,250
It just means it's usually translated as love, but it's a type of love where you do the right thing, you know what the right thing is, and you do it regardless of how you feel, right?

1182
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:11,390
Where you have also philia, which is, you know, friendship, brotherly friendship, close friendship.

1183
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:16,470
And then you have erotos, which is erotic, lustful, carnal.

1184
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:21,630
So objective is also the least carnal, right?

1185
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,070
Yeah, it helps somewhat.

1186
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:33,930
If you don't have supreme command over your own emotionalism, you cannot be objective, by the way.

1187
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:41,850
If you are always driving a car on an icy road and you don't know how to handle it, there's no way you're going to be objective.

1188
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:50,610
You know, if you're stuck in emotionalism, you cannot be objective, unless it happens by accident or happenstance, or at the point of a gun.

1189
01:28:52,030 --> 01:29:00,030
I think I just gave the analogy of the professor who admitted that even if the astronauts went on television and admitted they'd never landed on the moon, he would still believe they did.

1190
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:04,050
That goes beyond being objective or subjective, that is insanity.

1191
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:09,530
How many times have you heard me say, dealing with the public, you want to deal with crazy people?

1192
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:24,030
What do you think all these police, military, judges, generals, presidents, doctors, professors, lawyers, it is no different than going to a planet and coming back later and saying, what the hell happened here?

1193
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:31,070
Well, they took all the people out of the insane asylum and made them police, lawyers, judges, professors, doctors, psychologists.

1194
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:33,530
Yeah, that would make total sense.

1195
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:35,270
And the people love them.

1196
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,570
And the people love them.

1197
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,110
All of them, not some of them.

1198
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:49,270
Now, there are some in those fields that I mentioned, professors, police, judges, lawyers, doctors, that are not insane, that are pretty rational, but you know what?

1199
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:51,070
They don't last very long.

1200
01:29:51,130 --> 01:30:01,130
And when they do get all the training and they finally hit something like a bat across the teeth, they see what's going on, they look for an exit strategy, they usually last only a few months or a few years, max.

1201
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:05,890
So if you were to make a general statement that they're all basically insane, that's pretty accurate.

1202
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,530
But there is a small group in there that passes through.

1203
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,170
This is planet Earth.

1204
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:20,830
This goes back to that thing that Sam brought up before about the conditioning of a generation.

1205
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:27,310
I mean, look at how many generations have been conditioned already with that hive mentality.

1206
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:34,330
And there's various different shades of hive, but it all comes back to that same…

1207
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:37,030
But why are they conditioned, Bruce?

1208
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:41,330
Is it really conditioning or is it a precept of the law being applied?

1209
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:44,410
And what precept of the law would be applied?

1210
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,050
Think about it.

1211
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,730
It'll take a second pause.

1212
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,050
I'm going to go get some more coffee in the office and see if the Wi-Fi works.

1213
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:57,930
Okay, your point, Bruce, was that they're being conditioned, and I'm saying that it's the application of a certain precept.

1214
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:04,750
I wouldn't say the law directly, but I would say that it's a precept that you find in Scripture, which is, you know, I would say the law.

1215
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:06,790
What's being applied?

1216
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:08,310
What's being applied?

1217
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,230
The sins of the fathers get put on for how many generations, right?

1218
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:13,990
Right.

1219
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:19,990
The sins of the fathers get put on as many as three to four generations.

1220
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,490
Now, you could break that.

1221
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,790
That's right.

1222
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:27,910
So are they really being brainwashed or is it the sins of their parents being put on?

1223
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:29,870
And they're just bringing it into acceptance.

1224
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:34,730
Do you see the objectivity there using Scripture as a reference?

1225
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:39,870
See, when I see people being brainwashed, what kind of evil stalk did you come from?

1226
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,130
Well, usually people, you know, I'll give you an example.

1227
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,870
Speaking out in public, they say, oh, they're brainwashed.

1228
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:51,170
I'm like, yeah, you might say they're brainwashed, but I say what kind of evil stalk did they come from?

1229
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,170
Right, right.

1230
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,390
You see?

1231
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:55,950
I don't know.

1232
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,230
Does that make sense?

1233
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:58,290
Yes, it does.

1234
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,870
Does that help?

1235
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:03,470
But you can break that.

1236
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,010
It tells you how to break that in Scripture.

1237
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:08,750
Are you familiar with what I just brought up, Sam, about the brainwashing?

1238
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,950
Does that make sense to you?

1239
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:15,130
The sins of the fathers stuff I know about, but it's been a long time since I looked at it.

1240
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:16,530
But I do know that.

1241
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:26,970
But it does, you know, after the third or fourth generation, I mean, it does get lifted.

1242
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:28,270
Mm-hmm.

1243
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:37,630
But if they've been bred and groomed to do the same thing after the fourth generation, if they're doing the same thing that was done four generations ago, guess what happens?

1244
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:39,930
It starts all over again.

1245
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:40,870
Yeah.

1246
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,010
It's not a vicious cycle.

1247
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:45,230
It tells you how to break it.

1248
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:49,970
If you vow to not be like them, right, you break it right there.

1249
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:51,130
You could be the first generation.

1250
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:52,490
Yeah.

1251
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:56,050
But you don't have any autonomy to do anything anyway, because it's all external.

1252
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:57,690
It's all external.

1253
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:07,670
But remember, there's going to be a big, I'm suggesting, inferring there's going to be a big surprise on how people are going to find out later how much free will they really had.

1254
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:11,730
And others are going to be really disappointed to see how much free will they didn't have.

1255
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,370
So what do you know about the ether?

1256
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,030
Ether meaning, you know, you don't know, like the bear.

1257
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:23,390
We don't know what a bear is, but we know enough about it, right?

1258
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,790
So the point here is this.

1259
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,450
Later on at the resurrection, let me just repeat this.

1260
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:33,650
Some people will be surprised and disappointed to find out how much free will they really had.

1261
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:38,870
And others will be surprised and disappointed to find out how much lack of free will they really had.

1262
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,870
So it depends on the mindset, doesn't it?

1263
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,630
It depends on the spirit.

1264
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:52,910
You know, like your spirit is dwelling in you by it being animated by your body.

1265
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,630
But it's not really in your body, is it?

1266
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,390
No, it really all comes down to that, doesn't it?

1267
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,950
The spirit.

1268
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:03,030
Mm-hmm.

1269
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:03,790
No?

1270
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:07,210
Again, the cruise ship analogy works well.

1271
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,770
Look at some of these modern cruise ships.

1272
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:15,130
You know, some of them have been turned into floating cities for wealthy people who don't know that property taxes, you know, how to deal with that, right?

1273
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:25,790
By the way, if most of these wealthy people have Harvard attorney graduates as their consultants, they don't know that property taxes are only paid on properties that are for profit.

1274
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:27,970
I've said this many times before.

1275
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:34,150
You could look at any code book in the world, except maybe for a subject like England.

1276
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:40,850
But in America, all the cities and states and jurisdictions, it tells you very clearly that non-profits are exempt from property taxes.

1277
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:46,070
So let me ask you, where you sleep, shit, eat, fuck, and do all this other stuff, is that for profit?

1278
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,350
What are you going to do in paying property taxes?

1279
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:53,730
Anyway, because you have Harvard law school attorneys telling you you're feeding you.

1280
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:56,990
All right, so back to the cruise ship analogy.

1281
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,750
I just had to throw that in there because it's pertinent.

1282
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:07,830
When you're on a cruise ship, you know everyone on the ship is going to a certain destination from point A to point B, let's say, but you have a lot of free will on the cruise ship.

1283
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:08,450
But do you?

1284
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:10,990
Well, it depends on what ticket you bought, right?

1285
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:15,170
First class you might have a little bit more, right, than steerage.

1286
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,650
I don't think they have steerage anymore.

1287
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:24,590
Here's the other thing.

1288
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:27,790
Can you jump off the cruise ship and get on a lifeboat?

1289
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:31,950
Here's another concept with the thing.

1290
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:35,750
Can the cruise ship be hijacked or boarded by pirates?

1291
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:38,310
Yeah, true.

1292
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:41,650
Yeah, you see all the possibilities with the cruise ship analogy?

1293
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:53,050
Do you think the Earth, when you read about these demonic spirits or malevolent spirits coming down the Earth with great wrath, does that sound like you're about to be pirated on a planetary level?

1294
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:54,890
It certainly does.

1295
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:56,210
Mm-hmm.

1296
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:58,250
Surprise.

1297
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:04,490
Hmm.

1298
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,020
It's worth contemplating.

1299
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,950
It brings a whole new look at things.

1300
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,710
Did we lose the group?

1301
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,570
No, I'm here.

1302
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:31,370
Well, I just got a message.

1303
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:32,130
I think it was Seth.

1304
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:34,630
He put in, look at Ezekiel 1.8, is it?

1305
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:40,450
I need to put on some reading glasses about bearing, just barely, 18, bearing the sin.

1306
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:45,070
The soul of the sinner doth die and not bear the iniquity of the father.

1307
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:48,090
And he just told the father bear the iniquity of the son.

1308
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:52,070
So that seems to go counter to what I just said.

1309
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:56,030
It shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

1310
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:59,190
I think that might be post this situation.

1311
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:02,750
But anyway, that could be looked at.

1312
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,550
Ezekiel 18, Seth put that in there.

1313
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:08,390
It seems to be contradictory.

1314
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:15,030
But in direct contradiction, if it's viewed in the same temporal space, right, same time.

1315
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,670
You know, here's the interesting thing about the Book of Ezekiel.

1316
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:24,170
Do you know how much of that is really post-millennial kingdom, post-kingdom come?

1317
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:24,990
A lot of it.

1318
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:27,710
A lot of people misinterpret many of the things.

1319
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,550
I'm not saying Seth is here by dropping that in.

1320
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:34,150
But I would suggest that many of the things that are precepts that were given to Moses.

1321
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:38,410
In other words, what you see in the first five books still applies today.

1322
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,510
A lot of the prophetic writings apply.

1323
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:50,450
Many of the prophetic writings contain information that applied to the post-first resurrection period, right?

1324
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:52,790
And they get mixed up.

1325
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:54,710
Or just before it.

1326
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:56,130
Or just before it.

1327
01:37:56,170 --> 01:38:00,470
Yeah, like the very end or the very beginning of the gods being on earth.

1328
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:04,290
I mean, he's looking at Ezekiel.

1329
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:07,970
But the stuff that you're talking about is in Exodus where he's still talking to the Israelites.

1330
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:12,010
You shall not worship these other gods.

1331
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:18,910
Or, you know, for I am a jealous Elohim visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children of the third and fourth generations of those who hate me.

1332
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:20,350
So that's kind of a specific thing.

1333
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:26,570
Well, what I'm suggesting here is up until the next temple is built and desecrated.

1334
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:30,690
I think the abomination of desolation is a form of desecration.

1335
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:33,250
Everything applies still.

1336
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:35,530
That's in the first five books of Moses.

1337
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:43,830
And by the way, throughout history, up until maybe, I'd say, the last 500 years.

1338
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:50,150
If you mention the biblical text, it was just the first five books of Moses.

1339
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:54,450
Especially the past 2,000 years.

1340
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,890
Very few people knew of all the other writings.

1341
01:38:58,030 --> 01:39:04,290
Because they were held, whether canonized or not, they were held by certain people as, you know, occulted writings.

1342
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,890
But the first five books of Moses were not occulted or hidden.

1343
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:12,670
Up until, you know, the later translations.

1344
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,030
You know, 500 years ago.

1345
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:20,110
It's kind of ironic to say it that way.

1346
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:24,390
I mean, they read the scroll of Isaiah in the synagogue and things like this.

1347
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,770
The rabbis had access.

1348
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:27,190
Yeah, they did.

1349
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:27,630
Right.

1350
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,730
But I'm saying the world at large, you know.

1351
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,070
Septuagint was the first five books of Moses.

1352
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:35,630
The other Greek translations were done much later.

1353
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:44,050
You know, to satisfy, quote unquote, Jews living in non, you know, Egypt, Greece, and other places in the world.

1354
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:45,750
Anyway.

1355
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:55,590
So, this, by the way, this concept of the law is a, not from a Christian sense.

1356
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,910
Well, they don't have, I shouldn't bring it up there.

1357
01:39:58,210 --> 01:39:59,810
People think it's arcane.

1358
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:04,590
What's in the law, by the way, I'm just, this is another way of saying it.

1359
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:10,830
In the first five books is the scriptural rationale.

1360
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:13,330
It's the primer.

1361
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:14,510
It's the cipher.

1362
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,930
It's the thing that you stand on.

1363
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:25,030
When you see something in scripture that seems anomalous or just kind of like whacked out compared to the rationale that's used in the world.

1364
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:29,270
That means that it has to do something with the law that you don't know about.

1365
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:34,670
And when you understand the law, you'll say, oh, I see why this comment is brought up this way.

1366
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:36,590
You see?

1367
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,530
Think of it that way.

1368
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:52,980
And the reason why you should do the law, and that, you know, whoever you is, is when it comes to food, you're going to listen to some whacked out scientist that tells you red meat is bad now and then tells you red meat's okay later.

1369
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:57,000
Or tells you you have calories or this and that and the other.

1370
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:57,420
Nah.

1371
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,340
You've got to have a basis of law.

1372
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,780
Some whacked out attorney or something.

1373
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:06,890
Anyway.

1374
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,460
Yeah, we're kind of, this question is nice.

1375
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:20,400
We're kind of far away from Libya and Egypt and stuff like that.

1376
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,300
I'll get back on that.

1377
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,560
But we're not.

1378
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:25,820
But here's the interesting part.

1379
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,620
I mentioned the first five books, right?

1380
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:30,540
Do you know when they left out of Egypt, right?

1381
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,360
We're still on the topic of Egypt.

1382
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,260
You know, it was the whole world that was liberated.

1383
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:47,220
Do you know that I'm suggesting here if you go look at when they left Egypt, right, and the slavery, you know, the exodus, you'll see I think more than once mentioned the whole world left.

1384
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:57,340
Meaning it was a, as if, I'm not going to go out and say that this is how it was, but there was a, as if the whole world was enslaved to Egypt.

1385
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:03,920
There was a time of political subjugation that changed, you know, throughout the whole world, known world.

1386
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:07,360
It says a mixed multitude went up with them.

1387
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,180
Yeah, that's right.

1388
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,020
Yeah.

1389
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:17,880
And it represented a breaking of a certain, what do you call when you have a period of something, you know.

1390
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:18,340
Bondage.

1391
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:19,940
Yeah, yeah.

1392
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,220
It was the thing to do.

1393
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:31,320
I mean, it seems like the Israel side of paradigm were a model for other places, which we don't know much about other than the, you know, the Mycenaeans and the Minoans and all that.

1394
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:42,900
So, and their cultures were devastated during that time period, during that century, if not maybe 20 years of that exodus also with natural disasters and other things.

1395
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,660
And, you know, immigration problems, I should say.

1396
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,140
You know what I mean?

1397
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,200
Yeah, I know that.

1398
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:56,140
Because you have two types of invaders.

1399
01:42:56,140 --> 01:43:04,420
You have an invader that comes to your shores in embattlement gear, you know, battleships, armed soldiers.

1400
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:10,900
Then you have another type of invader that comes to your shores with their wagons and all their belongings and their families and their little children.

1401
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:14,830
You know what I mean?

1402
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:15,930
Yeah.

1403
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:19,330
What you got there, a bag of chips?

1404
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:20,410
Crisps?

1405
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:21,690
Sponge cake.

1406
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:22,590
Oh, okay.

1407
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:25,600
Yeah.

1408
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,520
Okay.

1409
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:27,740
So, all right.

1410
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:39,160
So Egypt and Libya, the way I would sum all that up is within the same degree, other than the specifics mentioned about the interest of Egypt with the Antichrist and the Mycenaeans, the battles.

1411
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:47,020
Because there's a leader of Egypt there that's a woman also, a daughter, right, from what I recall later on in another book.

1412
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:53,240
So we're going to look for prominence of a political leader in Egypt.

1413
01:43:53,240 --> 01:44:02,000
When you see a political leader in Egypt who is a woman, you know the time is nigh, as they say in King Jimmy, right, or in Old English.

1414
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:14,380
But I would suggest the significance of the rest of the continent would be similar to the significance of the satellite nature of the Greek and the Persians.

1415
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:19,660
I shouldn't say the Persians because the Persians are going to have a direct hand, very direct hand in the next seven years.

1416
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:27,860
So, in other words, Turkey, when you – okay, let me just sum it up this way, maybe a little more clarity.

1417
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:49,640
The way I would sum up as far as, you know, temporarily now, Egypt, Libya, you know, the northern half, upper half of Africa, if not the whole continent, would be the way I would sum up a loose union or a loose confederacy of Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey and the Balkans, some of the Balkan states, working in concert with the Middle East.

1418
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,400
Directly and indirectly.

1419
01:44:53,280 --> 01:45:05,840
So, I would almost say that that whole southern Mediterranean rim will loosely and directly be supporting the Middle East Union.

1420
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:10,360
Well, you know, we know the whole world is going to support it, but they will be, you know, tied in.

1421
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,040
So, if you mess with one of them, it's like messing with the rest, right?

1422
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:28,800
In other words, there's going to be a schism between the influence of the West as it is now in, you know, the southern Mediterranean rim or Africa in the future.

1423
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:42,520
In other words, they'll be more tied in being influenced by this Middle East Union, just as Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey will be more influenced by the Middle East Union than they are right now with the West.

1424
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:50,010
It sounds kind of like a lump, but it's not an amorphous lump.

1425
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,350
It could be defined, you know.

1426
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:56,150
But I am lumping it in, yeah, for sanity.

1427
01:45:56,710 --> 01:46:01,730
In other words, to have a healthy perspective on the situation.

1428
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,110
What do I mean by healthy perspective?

1429
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,150
One that is vitality.

1430
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:23,510
In other words, no matter what's going on in Libya or Cyprus or Turkey or Greece or whatever is not as significant as what's going on in Iran, you know, Persia, Israel, Lebanon, Iraq, you know what I mean, Palestine, Philistines.

1431
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:28,950
What's going on in Egypt, let's just bring in Egypt also into the fold here.

1432
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:38,390
What to watch for to have a good sense of vitality and a good-natured sense on what's coming in prophecy and have a handle on prophecy.

1433
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:45,430
Watch Egypt, Israel, Persia, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, right?

1434
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,810
Watch those countries.

1435
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:52,710
That is far more important than what's going on in Libya or Cyprus, right?

1436
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:56,370
Does that help with focus?

1437
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,210
I never said watch anything.

1438
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:02,110
I'm just giving an observation on the nature of the role that they'll play.

1439
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:04,990
Yeah, but I'm saying watch it.

1440
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:07,270
Watch the core countries for sure.

1441
01:47:11,410 --> 01:47:12,890
I'll give you an example.

1442
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:19,150
Back in 2011 when the NATO went in and just shot up Libya and they told everyone it was a revolution, well, there was no revolution at all.

1443
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,750
It was quite the contrary.

1444
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:24,170
Some people were getting in touch with me.

1445
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:25,790
Look, sorry, that's Libya, man.

1446
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:32,650
That's not Persia, Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria.

1447
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:33,270
It's not that.

1448
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:34,530
So it's peripheral.

1449
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,710
Yes, it's important.

1450
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,230
But it's not important scripturally.

1451
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:43,250
Sure.

1452
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:44,650
To have a handle on prophecy.

1453
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:52,150
In other words, if you had a clock on the wall and instead of having numbers on the clock, you know, 1 through 12, you have events, right?

1454
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,790
You know, prophetic events.

1455
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:56,370
And it would be more than a 24-hour clock.

1456
01:47:56,450 --> 01:48:00,570
It would be like a 280-item clock, 300, 400-item clock.

1457
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:05,330
There'd be some African nations on there.

1458
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:09,410
We just said that before things, you know, come to an end.

1459
01:48:09,410 --> 01:48:12,150
They're going to be not the head, they're going to be the tail of Egypt.

1460
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:28,370
If Egypt was a creature and it had a head and a tail, the head of Egypt would be facing, its chin would be on Israel, and its tail and its leg and its butt would be across the southern Mediterranean rim or the northern African continent.

1461
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:30,570
Does that help with a clear picture?

1462
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,040
Sure.

1463
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,600
It's a comical picture.

1464
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:35,860
Yeah.

1465
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:39,700
You could cut off the tail or the leg, it'll live, but you can't cut off the head.

1466
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,640
That's the main receptor.

1467
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:46,970
So its head would be Egypt.

1468
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:56,250
Well, if we were to come to a conclusion right now, I would say the head of the African continent will be Egypt, not Libya, not Morocco.

1469
01:48:57,370 --> 01:48:57,490
Yeah.

1470
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,310
That's what we said.

1471
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:02,670
Yeah, if we were to sum things up.

1472
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:04,310
So watch Egypt.

1473
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:17,070
And just like I interjected earlier, if you see a leadership in Egypt that is grooming a woman, especially a daughter of a current leader, to rise into prominence of power, the time is nigh.

1474
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:17,810
Right?

1475
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,810
That's how you say it, right?

1476
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:20,570
So, yeah.

1477
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:27,250
By the way, I did that when the thing was going on in the Arab Spring.

1478
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:43,180
I was hunting around all these Egyptian political figures and who their families were and if they had any daughters that were definitely post-pubescent but in their 20 range or so that were being groomed for political leadership.

1479
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:44,510
I didn't see any.

1480
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:53,370
Even though they did have daughters, I didn't see any of them that were 20, 25, 30 or so within the age of being taken seriously.

1481
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:58,670
I don't think a 20-year-old woman on the world scene would be taken seriously, but a 30-year-old would, you see.

1482
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,170
And I didn't see anyone like that.

1483
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:08,330
So, again, using scripture rationale, I just said, no, there's no one around to have said.

1484
01:50:08,910 --> 01:50:18,750
None of this Arab Spring stuff that happened seven years ago was set into motion what we deem as prophetic, you know, the dynamics of prophecy taking place.

1485
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:21,310
But is it dynamic for prophecy to take place?

1486
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:21,910
Yes, of course.

1487
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:25,310
All of this stuff, even stuff that happened 500 years ago is involved.

1488
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:29,670
These are shadows.

1489
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:31,710
You know how an object casts a shadow?

1490
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:34,070
We're looking at the shadow without the object.

1491
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:38,470
It's almost like an aberration, what's still happening right now in the world scene.

1492
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:46,510
But it doesn't, I mean, this does not take away about the subject at hand, which is Egypt and northern part of Africa and all the countries involved.

1493
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:59,310
But there's still, the important things to lay down the foundation is the rise of this power in the Middle East around, guess what, a temple in Jerusalem.

1494
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:13,810
So, to give you an example, if you, right now let's say we have a conversation, let's just say arbitrarily, and there's a world figure right now that's influencing the world and there is no temple, he's not the Antichrist.

1495
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:15,130
Even if he's Assyrian.

1496
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:18,330
Because there's no temple yet.

1497
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:19,670
Right.

1498
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:23,960
There's no Assyria yet, you see.

1499
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,240
So I'm sticking with scripture, you know.

1500
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,280
I know you are also.

1501
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:37,440
But, yeah, what of North Africa would be, if I were to title this, would be what of North Africa, right?

1502
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:42,840
No, I'm just pointing to that as being something that can be observed.

1503
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:52,700
And that it is a part of the time markers that when that region gets taken over, we're very close to seeing this guy move into Jerusalem and make that his capital.

1504
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:53,600
Oh, yeah.

1505
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,920
Theoretically it has relevance, yeah.

1506
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:57,200
This is 10 years from now.

1507
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,440
Yeah, I'm not saying that it's something to look at now.

1508
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,940
I'm just saying that it can be observed as having relevance.

1509
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:07,660
Do you want to get into a little bit of what can be looked at right now?

1510
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,490
I haven't really studied anything connected to that right now.

1511
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:17,570
Over the past week, these things kind of go in week by week.

1512
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:21,570
There's three things always when you look at scripture to look at.

1513
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:23,730
One is to look at nature, what nature is doing.

1514
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:30,630
Because one of the things that prophecy, Christ said there will be great earthquakes and great signs in the sky, which is nature, right?

1515
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:33,690
We're not talking about a big LCD plasma TV, right?

1516
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:39,850
So we're looking at a natural phenomenon or the way that nature is going to be behaving, right?

1517
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:41,610
None of that yet.

1518
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:45,430
The other thing to look at is, you know, watch Israel, what's going on there.

1519
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:51,450
And that means also spiritually, because the gods consider that the most important place on earth.

1520
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:56,750
You know, I'm talking about the God of the Bible, not the other religions and stuff.

1521
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:03,050
And the other thing to look at is the people's mindset towards the gods.

1522
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:07,370
Now, each one of those shares a huge study.

1523
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:10,310
We could discuss, you know, things that are happening on earth.

1524
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:13,350
That's many, many hours to discuss.

1525
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:16,250
You know, because that also involves the animal kingdom.

1526
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:21,670
And I think in previous sonic events, I brought up salient points on that.

1527
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,270
The point about Israel and what the gods consider to be a center, watch that, obviously.

1528
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:31,470
And the mindset of humanity, of course, that has to be watched.

1529
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:40,670
And what the mindset of humanity is right now is still, if you go out on the street, and this is important, I know that they don't matter, they really don't, not to me and not to the gods.

1530
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:53,730
And they shouldn't, you know, the public at large is, you know, even if you want to know how to feel, whether you feel good or feel bad about how you view people, take yourself out of it and look at how the leaders of the people view them.

1531
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:59,590
And don't sidetrack yourself and say, well, they're puppets and they're corrupt.

1532
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:00,310
No, no, no, no.

1533
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:02,770
It can't be that way for thousands of years.

1534
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:07,090
The leaders of the people don't care about their own people.

1535
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:08,090
Why should you?

1536
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:12,030
I'm not saying that you should be cruel and nasty and thieving.

1537
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:13,730
You should always be impeccable.

1538
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,610
Forget about the masses.

1539
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:16,170
They're finished.

1540
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:19,170
They're just a blob, like the movie with Steve McQueen, The Blob.

1541
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:24,210
Their own people, their own leaderships don't care about them at all.

1542
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:25,150
So there's not much.

1543
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:28,970
I had to throw that in there because it's very important to what I'm going to say next.

1544
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:34,610
If you go out and speak to these people that no one cares about, they don't even care about their own children.

1545
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,130
But anyway, ask them about the gods.

1546
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:40,770
What reaction do you think you're going to get?

1547
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:48,010
Either some stupid religion or I don't care, I don't know, or maybe one out of 10,000 I really want to know.

1548
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:48,770
This is important.

1549
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:51,750
That attitude will change.

1550
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:53,470
Watch how that attitude changes.

1551
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:56,270
That's what I mean about the mindset of the people.

1552
01:54:56,410 --> 01:55:04,570
In the future, I know it sounds kind of bizarre right now, people are going to take an interest in the quote-unquote gods in a very rational way, not the way they are right now.

1553
01:55:05,490 --> 01:55:06,650
That's part of prophecy.

1554
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11,620
Indirectly, there is no verse.

1555
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:13,840
Greek, show me the verse where it says that.

1556
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,040
The other thing is, of course, watch Israel.

1557
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,080
That's the epicenter.

1558
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,200
Not because of people, because obviously there are people in Russia, they think the epicenter is Moscow, Korea, they think it's Seoul.

1559
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,080
Everyone thinks Tokyo and Japan.

1560
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,500
No, I'm talking about what the gods think.

1561
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:36,120
Watch what's going on in Jerusalem or Israel at large.

1562
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:41,900
You know what else is another thing that we haven't gotten into that you might want to study maybe in the future or whatever, bring this up?

1563
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:45,260
The fate of the Palestinians or the modern-day Philistines.

1564
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,580
Very, very important.

1565
01:55:47,180 --> 01:56:02,520
I think in one of the books, I don't know if it's Jeremiah or Ezekiel or somewhere, that there's a reconciliation between quote-unquote Israel and Judah and the modern-day Philistines to the point where you cannot discern them apart.

1566
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:04,720
They are almost acting as brothers.

1567
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:08,000
It sounds insane when you look at the current situation, right?

1568
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,700
Are you familiar with these verses that I just brought up?

1569
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,400
I haven't studied them, but I know of them.

1570
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:24,920
Okay, so the fate of the modern-day Palestinian or modern-day Philistine is very, very interesting because believe it or not, they are destroyed, by the way, when that kingdom come, right?

1571
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,220
They are destroyed, if you remember the verses about that utterly, right?

1572
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:33,420
But before that time, they act in unison with Israel.
