1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:10,490
There's a reconciliation between quote-unquote Israel and Judah and the modern-day Philistines to the point Where you cannot discern them apart.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,010
They almost almost acting as brothers It sounds insane when you look at the current situation, right?

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,730
Are you familiar with these verses that I just brought up?

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,310
I haven't studied them, but I know of them.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,390
Okay, so the fate of the modern-day Palestinian or modern-day Philistine is very very interesting because believe it or not.

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,910
They are destroyed by the way When what that kingdom come right?

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,190
They are destroyed if you remember the verses about that utterly, right?

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:53,750
But before that time they act in unison with Israel That's another thing to watch and I think in short I've given how that's going to happen the the Gaza Strip is gonna just explode in terms of you know size Back to its older borders.

9
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,670
There will be no Palestinians in the contended West Bank

10
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,250
like there is now and

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,610
If you know if you're Palestinian you live in the West Bank or know anyone there get out

12
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,350
You've got a buffer zone of several years, maybe four to five years seven years tops

13
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,230
You don't want to be there

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,070
so

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,250
But you will have a pretty cushy

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,370
Compared comparatively to now the Gaza Strip will expand all the way to Tel Aviv and beyond

17
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,010
Towards, you know the land inward much much more and south southward

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,790
And you will be considered a state and all this other stuff so

19
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,410
Though that's that's believe it or not

20
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:49,210
Other than the it watching Israel and Judah the Palestinians or the modern-day Philistines are very important to watch in terms of the geopolitical

21
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,250
prophetic position that they're going to have with Israel, so

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,540
Mm-hmm.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,240
And the other thing is you really got to focus on East going West meaning look at Iran Persia.

25
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,580
What's going on there?

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:23,860
Don't take it lightly Of course they've been demonized because what one of the right from a juke from a secular point of view Iran will always be demonized as long as their central bank is state-owned.

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,100
I'm going to repeat that again.

28
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:42,380
I know it's not it's not conspiratorial It's the truth the central bank the fiat currency the credit line that is issued in Iran to their citizens and subjects is Issued by the state not a private bank like everywhere else Like, you know, North Korea same thing the state owns the bank, right?

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,980
Somalia same thing that's why those places are on the hit list

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,100
Because these are really show you the people that run the world are shallow minded idiots in case you didn't get it

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,940
The people that run the world are shallow minded idiots, I didn't say they're stupid

32
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,600
But they do I mean obviously you can say that about most of them so I think Somalia got taken out though

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,040
Yeah, they did yeah, but they still have a feudal I don't think they have a centralized system at all there

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,320
That's feudal lords like the Congo, you know, I think right isn't Congo still the same you're so feudal

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,340
It's a broken up into like 300 different

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,220
Districts or something

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Anyway

38
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,800
well, the reason to watch Persia is because they are going to be

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,100
Let me just not say what they're going to be let me say what they are

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,620
Who are the two superpowers in the Middle East right now?

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,820
Persia and Israel Iran and Israel Right now they're gonna work together.

42
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,000
Actually, they are working together behind the scenes.

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:04:11,620
That sounds a little conspiratorial But Here's the only thing that I admire the Persians or the Iranians for is They have a very subdued way of showing the West they can do and have everything the West has and how do I know that?

44
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,339
When a couple of years ago when they took down there was a fire in Tehran something called the Plasco building a

45
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:27,580
Mine a minute minor fire and the building imploded exactly technically and scientifically the same way the World Trade Center did

46
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,720
Which was using an underground nuclear demolition charge

47
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,040
exactly

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,220
Now most people don't know that but the was a message a clear message from the Iranian government to say

49
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,100
We can do it just like you do it, but we're not going to do, you know

50
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,000
These huge buildings and incinerate 3,000 people were just vaporized 3,000 people

51
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,300
We're just going to do it with this, you know, what was the tallest building in Tehran, you know a while back

52
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,700
We're just gonna do it and just you know, maybe kill 50 or 100

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,200
But we can do it exactly the same way you do it and its scale doesn't matter just that we can do it

54
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,380
you see

55
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,760
So

56
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,230
Yeah, look up the Plasco building it just it just it had you know, it's interesting

57
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,290
Crackling sound and you know, most people don't know anything about even professors that are nuclear physicists

58
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:27,070
Don't know anything about nuclear atoms or or you know atomic energy or anything like that, you know

59
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,330
But if you want to go work in the nuclear field

60
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,510
You you are taking they laugh at you and it doesn't matter if you have 15 PhDs

61
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,550
Which is probably not possible to get it is laugh at you like dude.

62
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,230
Just shut up.

63
00:05:39,550 --> 00:06:06,540
You were gonna this is how it really works Okay so Yeah So what they're doing the Persia is showing that Iran is showing the West that we can do everything you can do What we don't have to do it as big and we're not as spread out But we have the ability and who else who else in the Middle East can do anything just as well as anyone else can do it Israel Right.

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
Israel's got nukes.

65
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,040
Israel's got jets

66
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,920
They've got a mountain that opens up like in Switzerland where the Jets shoot out of you like an aircraft carrier, you know

67
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,980
They've got technology they've got

68
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,180
Where with all the finances all this

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,400
So those two those two are going to be working together and when I say working together predominantly in what

70
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:38,910
The temple being rebuilt there's going to be a strong seal of approval from the current

71
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,230
Government let's just say use it loosely I spell that government G UV MNT

72
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:53,050
Government of Iran assisting the building of the temple or the real estate

73
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:02,550
Because remember when you read in the Himalayan Ezra it was taking control of the real estate with finances and and

74
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,570
protection, right

75
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,910
Because the Persians didn't build the temple

76
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,410
They just provided a the protection or B and B the real estate wherewithal

77
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,670
You see right if you recall in the Himalayan Ezra

78
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,050
We're no Persians building the temple

79
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,310
But without them it couldn't have been done because of they needed protection and they needed the finances

80
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,410
So, do you think right now if a temple were to be built let's say south of the

81
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,770
Where the current dome of the rock is they're going to be Muslims

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,790
Screaming about it.

83
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:50,790
Yeah Do you think that if Persia or Iran steps in and quells that it'll make it easier to build the temple Because they're Muslim Even though it's a different sect.

84
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,930
Let's say yes.

85
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,250
Do you see how this can be rationalized?

86
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,870
Do you see that if you ponder?

87
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,770
How is Israel going to help?

88
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,210
How is your Iran going to help Israel in the next seven years if you really sit down with a fine-toothed comb and look at?

89
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:20,550
All the current geopolitics and look at biblical prophecy You can actually write a pretty detailed scenario That'll be probably plus or minus five or ten percent off from what is going to happen in the next seven years With great detail How it's going to happen using you know?

90
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:29,850
You have to understand human rationale and the way you understand human rationale is just look at what's on the rectangle what people are talking about And their mindset and that's all going to change.

91
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,070
I just gave you one little scenario there How can Iran help modern-day Israel build the temple?

92
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:46,690
Well if they try to do it now Muslim Muslim to the left Muslim to the right and oops we just stepped on a Christian over here, what's that on your shoe and Do you think?

93
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,410
Persia or Iran helping to jump in and quelling that kind of dissent would help of course.

94
00:08:52,630 --> 00:09:15,960
That's just one way I Mean there's other ways to but See if I went to the mailbox and there was a hundred donations of us a significant amount I'd say let's let's get the brightest and the best people around to look at what's going on and look at these things They don't have to try to figure out prophecy.

95
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,660
You just spell it out for them.

96
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,440
This is objective is what it says Let's put something a scenario together on what's coming in you know in the next seven years.

97
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:35,860
Let's do that It takes a lot of time by the way to do that All right to look at all the various happenings and mastinations in the current day world because Believe it or not when this prophecy starts to come in fruition.

98
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:59,440
It's going to happen in line with what we see happening today You know we don't see video games and plasma TVs and iPhones and all this other stuff in Scripture But when the prophecies do take place these things plot You know iPhones and video and plasma TV all this stuff is going to exist so that has to be integrated in also you see You know what I mean?

99
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,640
So this this someone needs to sit down and

100
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,700
Objectify what's written in the prophecies read out of it and start picking up

101
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,400
You ever see those those arcade games where you put a quarter in and you have this hook

102
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,620
Robotic arm moves around you try to pick up a prize and drop it in you know

103
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,160
You know whatever so you understand the prophecy which is the robotic arm now you have to start picking up all the pieces that you

104
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,400
See around you iPhones video games the current central banking situation jet airplane everything that you see in the world today and

105
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,380
rearrange it

106
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,400
To fit prophecy I didn't say rearrange prophecy to fit the world today

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,680
Rearrange all the various appliances in your modern world including the mindset as an appliance of people

108
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,500
How would you move it left or right up or down in and out?

109
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,240
What do you eliminate?

110
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:14,860
What do you add in order for prophecy to take place, and then you will be able to compile that and have a really accurate Forecast of what's coming down the road But I ain't spending eight hours a day for the next six months to do that you know Other people have to do it, and there's no support on something like this by the way As far as I see right now.

111
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,860
Do you see what I mean by that Sam and Bruce yes?

112
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:42,740
You You have no license to rearrange the prophecies to fit what's going on But you have a hundred percent license to rearrange what's happening what you see going on around you to fit prophecy It's the other way around details Yeah, there are a lot of details, and it can be done.

113
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,800
I've done it before with certain things You know Well like I mentioned earlier when the Arab Spring happened in 2011.

114
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,520
I was like oh wow look at Egypt big deal Is there a woman ready to take office?

115
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:54,940
Nope?

116
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,880
Yeah?

117
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:27,220
It's just a a Precursor to the precursor you see I had people say oh look the Middle East Union is gonna form it after the spring thing on that No, no, no, it's not So yeah, it's pretty interesting there's a lot of a lot of work to be done if you want to do it Should it it's these things don't have to be done what I just mentioned piecing all these things together They don't have to be done.

118
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,530
You know why because they're gonna happen whether you do it or not anyway, right?

119
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,810
That's why they don't have to be done You know it's not like organizing the shed.

120
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,290
You know if you don't do it.

121
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:56,930
It's not gonna happen anyway No, you if you don't do it ain't gonna happen This is something that whether you understand it or not whether you piece it all together in parallel to what's going on to make it Work yes, you can do that You don't have any license to change scripture, but you have lots of license to change What's going on in the world around you obviously?

122
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:11,590
I mean, that's why I've come out and said like in the next less than a decade if you know anyone That's invested in pork futures get out because it's ain't gonna ain't gonna be viewed as a food anywhere That doesn't make any sense right?

123
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:31,890
Because they loved that pork So You're seeing more and more hardies closing down lately Yeah So You know why would I say that you know because there?

124
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:53,230
It's very more than implied that the whole world's going to be going under Some form of harsh biblical law and biblical law is very clear on that pork issue But people don't want to hear that because the only time people want to listen is if you're coming to take bacon off day back They know somebody's coming to take bacon off day back.

125
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,910
They'll they'll stop and listen.

126
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,950
They'll scatter

127
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,470
Yeah, am I implying that they're pigs yes, I am so

128
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,270
What I'm going to what I'm going to just say about prophecy is

129
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,050
That again

130
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,290
And I haven't said this this clearly before is you can go ahead and rearrange what's going on right now in front of you on

131
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:18,870
The rectangle news and society mindset and all that but you can't rearrange the prophecies there you see so how do you rearrange the current?

132
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,030
Ephemeral world which changes into to make it fit

133
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,650
You know the like and you know how you pour water into an ice cube tray

134
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,490
If that ice cube tray is full you stick it in the freezer when you take it out

135
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,530
You're gonna get the exact shape

136
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,070
That was in that ice cream ice cube tray no matter what where before you poured it

137
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,750
And it was could have been anything that water any shape

138
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,530
So prophecies like the ice cube tray, and what's what you see going on in the world today everything whether it's your own personal life or

139
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,310
International is the water

140
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,510
Mmm.

141
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,010
Can you pour it in your mind into the ice cube tray?

142
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:04,710
Which is prophecy and see what it looks like after a day in the freezer pop it out you see But you can't take a Dremel to the ice cube tray and start changing it.

143
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:14,630
That's the prop you know what I mean And you can't make things fit you can't take a square peg and say well I'm gonna whittle it down to make it round so it fits in the right hole.

144
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:23,990
No you can't do that Either I'm saying about rearranging things around you know How do you like you know how many times have I said?

145
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,090
The end what you see on the internet is a beta test.

146
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:33,110
How do I know because it's commercially driven But the presence of the Internet offers what?

147
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:40,820
Instant sight and sound to anyone in the world that has a handheld device pretty much doesn't it so

148
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,840
That's what you carry over into the prophecy side

149
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,780
The ability for anyone on the world or in you know by the way to look we were speaking of Africa was watching a cooking

150
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:02,220
documentary recently and they were in Ethiopia and the people lived they had a dirt floor in their house, right and

151
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,700
But through the door I saw a child about eight nine ten with a

152
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,780
Device in their hand you know looking down on it

153
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:20,320
So the people there had so what does that tell you the they're going to get a handheld?

154
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:33,440
Rectangle with internet before they're going to get a tile a finished floor Right yeah Now is it do you think that they got that so they can buy stuff on eBay or?

155
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:47,220
Just the ability for them to have instant audio and visual communication the latter obviously So that's what I mean Yeah, that's what I mean right.

156
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,660
That's what I mean about you can restart rearranging these things around People say you know the Internet's gonna be shut down.

157
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:52,800
No.

158
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:13,180
It's not he's of course not good for two reasons one is you know the Later on it's gonna be necessary necessity later on and also right now If the Internet shut down how our banks gonna do anything right Shuts down the bank, so it's not gonna happen So you could look at various things that people discuss and you're like oh That's never gonna happen and the ever that's left.

159
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:23,839
You know when I say never I mean in the ever that you have So if you if some if you know someone lives till 70 And you'll say you're never gonna be in the Olympics You know because you know let's say walking with crutches all their life.

160
00:17:23,920 --> 00:18:02,500
That's pretty accurate statement You know what I mean right Because you know they are within the ever that when you're discussing this with someone you know they have an ever that's about 70 80 90 And in there's you know see so So when I say never I mean within the ever that you have This kind of talk by the way will piss off your average space heater so Yes, so from my end.

161
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,180
I mean I sort of

162
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,620
The only thing I really have left that I could I guess

163
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,340
Bring to the discussion at this point is the rest of the thoughts that I have on the least matter of the countries

164
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,620
I mean if you're tired because sometimes you know I pour the Greek with my pedantic presentation thing

165
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,840
We don't we would need to be redundant if we're just gonna focus on what we see now

166
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
Well, I you know I I loosely define boredom as being anger, so are you pissing me off?

167
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,740
I wouldn't say you've ever pissed me off, and I don't think you intend to so and you haven't and you are not so

168
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,440
well

169
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,720
Well now to find the last thing

170
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,100
Was them the mountains of a short thing I think

171
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,600
hmm

172
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,920
Either way, I mean if you let's say southern that's a north-south range isn't it or runs north-south

173
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,800
Right I'm not sure what the mountains of a shore are because I think a shore you tie that to a Syria

174
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,300
And once again like I said the

175
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,420
Caucasus mountains see are connected with that because the Empire extended that far

176
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,600
You also have the Zagreb how do you pronounce it the Zagreb or Zagreb mountains?

177
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:29,000
But I think that that's in a completely different place so I Don't really know what it is, but either way when you look at Ezekiel 3535 you have the the Ludd What was it the the kush the put and the Ludd being talked about I think it's a mistranslation That's just oh really really.

178
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:45,620
I'm being sarcastic now Well, it's not New Testament where it's like obvious that shit is not right almost all of it's not right Yeah, so at least I'll tell you what New Testament almost no one's impression of it is right that I've seen So the text itself shouldn't be completely blamed.

179
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,260
I think it's what the New Testament has done is

180
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,080
satisfied the

181
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,520
Fulfillment of utter freakin evil in the world taking hold before these things take place you know

182
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,040
So evil what the gods think is evil you know when you have these idiots running around there

183
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,880
You got to love everybody in peace that that you know the root of that is completely evil you know

184
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,280
Right because they can't define any of it

185
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,340
So it's just as good as them not knowing what you know not saying that and and then if you eliminate that they have nothing

186
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,000
They're just jellyfish so

187
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
But go ahead

188
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,920
Yeah, I think it's a mistranslation load and usher.

189
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,220
I think Ludd is actually Ludden

190
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,340
Because like I said, they're similar, and they seem to get mixed up

191
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,240
It feels like a scribal error because the people of Ludd like I said you tie them more to the Lydians which is

192
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Anatolia and the people of Ludden

193
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,380
Are more that's a son of Mithrim

194
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,680
Son of an Egyptian the Luddite the Luddite people have already been pointed out as being adjacent to Egypt

195
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,660
I don't see how you know Ludd is a shaman is is related to the Africans

196
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
and if you look like

197
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,280
What's it called?

198
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,280
King of the dirge against the king of Tyre and is equal 37

199
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,640
So Tyre is a coastal city in modern Lebanon

200
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,240
And it says Persia and Ludd and put were in your army they were men of war shield and helmet

201
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,180
They hung on you and so on and so forth

202
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,600
So Persia obviously at the time of the neo-babylonians was very far from Tyre

203
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
And put is in North Africa

204
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:32,020
so it sounds like they have these are just mercenary soldiers that are brought in from foreign countries to strengthen Tyre's armies and

205
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,380
That would make Ludd another far-off country

206
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,000
Presumably in Western Anatolia that I see how that how that can work

207
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,880
But if you look at Ludden, you know, Jeremiah 46 verse 1 talks about

208
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,100
Something the word of Yahweh came to the Prophet Jeremiah concerning the Gentiles for Mithrim

209
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,640
Concerning the Pharaoh Naco

210
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,300
Prepare the large and small shield and draw near to battle Mithrim rises like a flood in its water surge abroad the rivers

211
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,660
And let the mighty men go forth cush and put who handle the shield and Ludd who handle

212
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,620
the bend and the bow in this sort of situation

213
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:21,020
You have Yahweh telling Pharaoh to go to war and to take some people with him to Kushites and the putites which wouldn't live

214
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,200
close by and

215
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,280
cushioned Libya and the Ludd who are

216
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:34,520
Archers and so here it makes sense that you have sort of three adjacent African countries that you know, he takes to war with him

217
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,220
and it's the same thing in the book of Nahum Kush and Egypt were her strength and

218
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,180
Put and Lubbom were your helpers talking about the downfall of Nineveh

219
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,420
so here again put and Lubbom are ancient Libya and Kush and

220
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,320
And

221
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,420
Lubbom here is very clearly shown to be in association with that

222
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,580
so

223
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,140
Everyone if you knew you were going to be attacked by the Assyrians and you didn't capitulate.

224
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,440
Who did you go to for help?

225
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:12,860
you always Egypt and their allies Right their allies.

226
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah Yeah, you know when you look at these military things by the way campaigns.

227
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:36,200
No one wants to use their own people Look at the American Army You know, I mean or any army, you know, I mean smaller armies yes that are great, you know, you know Indigenously based are of the people but you know when you're you're in business to do war you have foreigners in your army, right?

228
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:53,380
Yeah, I'm seeing that So moving on from that in the same Ezekiel 35 it goes on to talk about all the mixed people cushion put and load and all the mixed people and the curb and the sons of The land of the Covenant shall fall.

229
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:05,180
This is talking about when the Antichrist invades North Africa But it's um, it puts this all the mixed people phrase in there Followed by the nation of Cooper.

230
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,340
I can't find anything on curb really most commentary say it's close to Egypt, but that's just guesswork

231
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:18,240
But the the mixed people bit is interesting because in English it says all the mixed people but in the Hebrew, it's only one word

232
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,320
which is Arab or

233
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,720
Depending on the vocalization, so it's only three letters

234
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,960
And it's the same word for a bunch of different things

235
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,120
It's the same word depending on the vocalization for the nation of Arabia

236
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,700
It's the same word for the one of the chiefs of the Midianites, which is in Arabia same word for evening

237
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,200
Or dusk what they're calling that same word for the raven

238
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Which is a dark colored bird and then also for mixture, which is why they're rendering it as a mixture

239
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,960
now

240
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,140
Arabia by the way, you know the UAE Saudi Arabia all those

241
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,280
Qatar all those places there.

242
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,340
They're they're not going to go away there They're you know what?

243
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,740
I mean, there's they're very wealthy because of the way they've been dealt from the Balfour Accords and all that later on

244
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,140
You know early 20th century till later

245
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,880
If you study a little bit even cursory

246
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,860
the development

247
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,340
You know the actual real it let's just use the term real estate or building an industry, you know, which is basically there

248
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,800
They have oil and then they they're tourists, you know, and and you know, basically attractions, right?

249
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,640
if you if you study Who is actually building?

250
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,420
That part of the world all the architectural I go go look at some tacos online

251
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,940
They're there from India Asia

252
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
You don't see any

253
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,560
The there are people that are their own people that are working on are wearing the the white hard hats with the engineering badge

254
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,320
But the guys that are actually pouring the cement and

255
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,100
Piecing together the steel and the glass and all that are foreigners

256
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
all of them

257
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,180
And once all these projects are finished these public works or private works.

258
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,140
Do you think these foreigners?

259
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:25,860
All of them go home or do you think a fairly good percentage a little bit more than half but maybe around half stay They stay You know, unless they're actually, you know contracted in Exclusively lots of people to do crunch it How difficult would it be able to throw them in a uniform?

260
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:43,850
And give them a gun pretty pretty easy You know, it's very easy to look at any country that has an immigration population that comes in to do grunt work Well, that's your future army.

261
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,410
Those people stay there and they have children and you need people in the military.

262
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,270
Guess who's gonna go?

263
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,590
Look at America.

264
00:26:52,250 --> 00:27:10,310
Yeah, you got a lot of white trash or whatever it's still enlisted in the military, but most of the military is a good significant portion say most is as foreigners Well, you can go to the to the next level and say well who in America is not a foreigner or the Native America who's Been genocided, you know, I'm not speaking on that.

265
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:33,710
I'm speaking about when you say America you think of a white boy white girl flat booty and Apple pie still and whatever, you know You know, I mean so, you know think about burritos and rice and beans and whatever You know, this reality is harsh folks So You don't have a lot.

266
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:52,990
Yeah, there's still a lot of white boys in the military, but I wouldn't say that that mill It's a white military just like this Yeah, when you look at this Saudis, this would be the same thing you in the future if they're if they're going to take any place in a tribal way or Cultural way or nationalistic way.

267
00:27:53,030 --> 00:28:19,150
It's it's going to be a pretty mixed multitude Looking at the Arab or Arab word That gets used in a bunch of different places I mean It's the word that you have in Genesis 1 5 and the evening came to be in the morning came to be day one That is Arab And then you have other places that it's something else Is the top to emanate from the top of the house?

268
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:53,610
Hmm ERB The letter yeah, yeah So, um As far as trying to put that into context in the Ezekiel verse you kind of have to figure out what's being said There's a list of nations and if it's an Arab if we know that Arab is already used for Arabia Then I think you have a good candidate there and is the similarity between Arab and it's Arab a coincidence.

269
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,390
Not really.

270
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:20,590
I think it would be an olive not an Needs to be investigated Well, there's some you can provide some historical context and things like that I mean you find an interesting intersection between Greek Arabic and Hebrew when it comes to this particular word So it means evening or dark in one sense In the sense in Genesis, it's it was evening.

271
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,330
There was morning.

272
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:35,570
I mean there was morning There was evening and there was morning right that's in reverse almost right So there's a plane a Wall or a plane or a membrane when does morning end and when does evening start?

273
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:48,170
At noon you still see a lot of people used to hear when I used to listen to internet radio more The guy would come on and say good morning.

274
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,470
Oh, no, it's 1203.

275
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:49,930
I'm sorry.

276
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,270
Good afternoon Right.

277
00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:07,450
Mm-hmm people almost have it as a strict application If it's by the wind-up toy within their limited stupidity If it's 1201 if they say good morning, they will catch themselves and say good afternoon.

278
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,830
Are you feeling me on that Bruce?

279
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,010
You ever notice that?

280
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:19,430
Yeah, if it's 12 if they see 1204 and they say good morning, they'll catch themselves up so say no, I'm sorry I meant afternoon

281
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,510
That it

282
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,470
Now there is a noon time when the Sun is absolutely thought had there's another word in Hebrew to describe that

283
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,930
But from a Genesis point of view, it's the point where morning ends evening ends and morning starts and vice versa

284
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:41,890
And that's at noontime for timekeeping purposes cause we're not but we're not saying that evening is the same as noon

285
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,270
No, generally it stretches all the way down till you go to sleep

286
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,690
Exactly from noontime till right before you go to bed

287
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,350
It's it's evening, you know, right because I mean if you go

288
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,730
I mean that word is obviously all over the place if you go to Exodus 16

289
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,310
It says and when they came to be evening, then the quail came and covered up the camp.

290
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:14,500
That's not That's specifically noon Yeah, because for quail to be out In other words, they covered the camp.

291
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:37,640
It's an unusual thing If you know about birds, they they're out between 7 and 10 and then they come out before dusk Hmm if you tell anyone the birds came out at noon and cover this a holy crap, that's a miracle Birds are around between said by the wind up to between 7 and 10 and then they come out again like after 4 or 5 For it till he was Bruce.

292
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,740
So you've ever been a bird you ever gone birding?

293
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:53,320
Oh, yeah Yep Specifics reasons why they do that mostly for food and foraging Yep early in the morning late in the afternoon or towards evening.

294
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:53,920
Yes.

295
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:18,420
Yeah Yeah, if you see him out at noon, it's yeah, it's rare Well, usually depending on the climate if it's very hot they seek to be out of the Sun For preservation kind of thing Yeah, other than the tropics, but I know but you're saying it's a range Temporal range.

296
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:36,260
Yeah, and it includes it includes sunset But here's another thing to consider whenever you're dealing with the first five books You're dealing with a there's a precision in the placement of the meaning and the word It means more than than what you're you know?

297
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:52,740
Oh, yeah I'm not I mean we've already seen especially in the first five different things it's it's not as poetic as the prophets get because you know what I mean poetic is if you have a Someone who likes to read and they've never read the Bible He told me to read the prophets who say what a bunch of whiny bastards.

298
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,100
These guys are you know?

299
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,860
That's what they come back say they don't understand it, right?

300
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,240
But when you have them read the first five books of Moses, they say oh, this is heavy-duty.

301
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,280
I don't understand it

302
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,820
You know, I mean, what does it make a lot of sense the big difference between edib used and in other places

303
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,500
Not a big difference, but the word still needs to be considered as it is in the law

304
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,860
And I'm not trying to divert from that

305
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,960
But I'm trying to draw sort of a general connection between the way that this word is used in one language in another language

306
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,360
So in a general sense

307
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,700
It's used to point to this

308
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:38,020
Range of time which includes say the setting of the Sun since evening extends beyond just your conventional 12

309
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:45,980
Sure, or whatever and then when you go to the Arabic language the word for the evening time or when the sunset is

310
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,960
Magrib, so let's go.

311
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,440
Let's go back in context.

312
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,180
You pull this is what you we've pulled out of Ezekiel, right?

313
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,420
Yeah, it's equal 35 as far as the mixed people.

314
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm trying all right.

315
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:30,030
I'm getting to that But like to identify who they are because who are it says it just says the order or just as order as far as The Kush to put the load order and cope as far as the nations that are gonna fall once Egypt gets conquered and To sort of try to figure out what it's what it means by that Unless of course, it's completely redundant and You know not of any interest.

316
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,469
It's to be investigated Ezekiel's a funny book that way, you know Ezekiel's all over the place, right?

317
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:43,070
temporarily Yeah, it bounces around a little bit Sometimes I can't tell whether it's talking about the end times or talking about something in the past.

318
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:56,340
Yeah, or after the end times Yeah but um The Arab or his or his day I Think the easiest thing is his day Yeah, there's some stuff with that.

319
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,720
There's a lot of stuff in his day

320
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,060
But okay

321
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,640
so yeah, you have the

322
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,000
Like I said the Hebrew aspect of it of a certain time that includes the what they call the evening

323
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,240
You have the Arabic word for dark or evening being the crib which stems from

324
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:31,480
It's the which is where the Maghreb area gets its it's a word from in the Maghreb is the region of North Africa with the

325
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,300
Arab population

326
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,920
Which has itself three sort of interrelated meaning Maghreb means West

327
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,300
So in this case, I guess lands west of Egypt or lands west of the homeland of Arabia

328
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,320
It also means time or place of sunset since the Sun observably sets in the West

329
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,880
And it also means evening since the Sun sets in the evening

330
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
by conventional

331
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,820
Interpretation used to be considered.

332
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,980
Yep moving on from that you get to the Greek and in the ancient Greek the word for

333
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,860
What they used to call in North Africa was

334
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:15,000
Hesperia because of the Hesperides which was a mythological race of nymphs of the evening or of the sunset who lived in a garden that

335
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:23,420
Near the Atlas Mountains, which is a mountain range in the Maghreb in North Africa and Hesperia also means the Western countries

336
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,360
I think they used to call Italy

337
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,460
Hesperia also because it's directly west is west of Greece

338
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,880
So these references keep reoccurring in different languages to something in the West and something that happens around what they call the evening

339
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,420
So

340
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,860
I'm guessing that this Arab people that's being talked about in Ezekiel 30 or presumably either from

341
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:52,520
Indeed in North Africa or Arabia or descendants of Arabians living in North Africa, which is what we see today anyway

342
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,600
So it keeps things tied down to that region

343
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,600
And then after that it goes on to say that the men of the Covenant shall fall

344
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,200
And that's the last group of people

345
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,120
after all these Africans

346
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,720
But I don't know I guess the first thing I thought is whoever who's heard of a covenant people living in North Africa

347
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:20,460
Ezekiel's covenant land would have been Israel is what I initially thought but then I guess there's a two-sided way to go at that

348
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,260
One is that Abraham had children that he fathered with other women and the Midianites were one of their offspring or sort of

349
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,540
Nations later on down the line.

350
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,740
So the Arabs are technically part Shemitic

351
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,020
And also Josephus has given accounts that in

352
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:45,480
That there was a entire Arabic tribes that were converted to Judaism and began to worship as the Jews or the Judeans did

353
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,560
But you know that has me thinking like it's not really lawful if you force them

354
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,580
So I don't really know what was going on in his time that he would say that

355
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,360
He also wrote that there were Edomite

356
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,900
tribes that were

357
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,600
Also converted into Judaism, so

358
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm not exactly sure how

359
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,700
They don't seem to be lawful at that point

360
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,640
Right, right a lot of conversions were you'll read about the conversions.

361
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:25,640
It was their political reasons, you know You know, like you've heard I forgot there's a term for it if you're not if you're conqueror subjected by Muslims Subjects of Muslim government.

362
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,780
There's a tax you pay if you're not Muslim, right?

363
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:51,860
I mean people people would sell their children for food right so If they you know in history or if they would sell Children to be sacrificed just for some coin so they can go and buy things, you know so if they're gonna do that, they'll you know, imagine you have a Jewish influence and they don't treat the non Jews.

364
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,680
Well, let's just say or the Judeans Well, you're going to convert just to be treated better Mm-hmm.

365
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,660
There's that aspect because you know the aspect of there being a genuine

366
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,140
Allegiance to the God of the Judeans is difficult for me to see for two reasons

367
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,120
One is well if if they did that then you know

368
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,740
Where how did they end up not well and also the Judean authorities were very hush-hush and

369
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:24,780
sequestered the general public from any knowledge of scripture and things like that in order to overlay their own laws, you know

370
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,100
Which were non-scriptural right?

371
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:45,420
This was done through history at least post temple, you know So, yeah You did end up with a group of people who called themselves anyway Jews or Israelites living in North Africa But I think yeah, that goes back even to the time of Solomon.

372
00:39:45,480 --> 00:40:00,260
You know, yeah Sure, that was the other disgruntled priests let's say in their families or the families of the priests Because they couldn't leave their posts up until a certain age or whatever unless they've got totally, you know Discussed it by what's?

373
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,740
Solomon was doing which wouldn't be that difficult by the way

374
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,840
But there was a big diaspora scattering even back then always they always I

375
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,320
Think it was after Solomon, you know where there was

376
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,420
You know, they started leaving right Israel

377
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
You know the king and split with his son

378
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,280
Yeah, and all the massinations because they had some pretty cruel times there, you know

379
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,480
That's some pretty bad Kings that were doing some pretty crazy stuff

380
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,520
and

381
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,940
And also they remember they they promoted literacy and the sciences and when I say science

382
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,740
I mean, you know, I'm using modern terms with modern concepts here.

383
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,880
No, I mean, you know knowledge of the natural world medicine

384
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:52,320
Just net nature in general how to organize things engineering math that is, you know

385
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,640
money system economics

386
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,520
So if you left Judea or Israel and you went to another part of the world and you you know

387
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,320
The people that knew that you came from there invited you in usually

388
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,660
Because you were well learned usually

389
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,070
So was it was easy to spread around I

390
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,210
Mean look at for example now like play in India

391
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:23,390
I give it an example in India where they do promote a rigor of education of you know

392
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,070
Advanced math even in science, which even though it's not really

393
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,990
Viewed I don't view.

394
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,810
Well, it shouldn't be viewed.

395
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,670
Well, you'll find people from India going all over the world and getting technical jobs, right?

396
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,930
They're invited in because of their discipline

397
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:46,850
Yeah, the spreading of that culture and that quote-unquote style

398
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:54,510
You know, here's another thing Sam to consider when you say Judaism or we call you know in an inaccurate way Jewish modern-day

399
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,770
You know, we really have no idea what it was

400
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:04,010
Like what it was like back then because there were still so many sects that developed especially around 200 BC

401
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,670
right

402
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,710
Mm-hmm.

403
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:18,890
So all we can we you know was a sect that was known and I don't think they would they they it was easy for Them to travel and be welcomed or spread because of the actual just religious aspect.

404
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:29,110
I think it was because of their literacy in education level So when you see them spreading or Certain people being converted or whatever.

405
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,090
It was for literacy science medicine economics.

406
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,390
Do you see what I mean?

407
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:46,470
It wasn't it wasn't like, you know in America go to you know I believe in this go to church on Sunday or some stupid stuff like that was nothing like that Right, you ever notice with the modern Christian religion.

408
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,290
There's no literacy.

409
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,990
There's no promotion of Of the sciences the natural world economics any knowledge and anything like that.

410
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:12,170
It's just anyway fairies pixie-dust and So, you know, yeah people don't don't understand that because they're looking at the religions or you know, look at any other religions today Buddhism even Judaism today and all that they don't view that they view that solely as a religion.

411
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:27,850
They don't view that there's any attribute They look at the secular attributes now You know what the government, you know, the government demands you get like in India you'll get a by the sixth grade You'll get a math education that in America.

412
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:57,010
You will never get unless you go into advanced, you know college courses So But back in those days it was promoted, you know culturally in tradition through what we call today religion religious practices Right, yeah, so, um, that's kind of it.

413
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,510
I mean the conclusion I guess what's the only thing I have after that is the Ezekiel stuff

414
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,250
But it kind of like it's kind of hard for me to tell what it's happening

415
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,930
Like Ezekiel has prophecies about Egypt's as well as far as is equal 29 and 30

416
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,070
The land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that I am

417
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,470
Yahweh because he is the one who has the power to make the world a better place

418
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:21,790
He has said Pharaoh has said that the river is mine and I have made it and no foot of man shall pass through it for

419
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,450
40 years

420
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,510
so

421
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,710
Ubris, yeah, because yeah bristle their leaders

422
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:33,090
But this was something that Ezekiel was saying specifically at a particular time and most people

423
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,630
Commentators have felt like the 40 years that's being talked about here

424
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,710
Happened in the 6th century when Nebuchadnezzar ran through the place and supposedly destroyed

425
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:49,690
What's the context of that being brought up it sounds more futuristic doesn't it it does

426
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,190
But it appears to be past

427
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:59,990
Here's the thing the canonized Egyptology puts the 26th dynasty of Egypt in power at that time and even the Greek

428
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,370
Herodotus said that the

429
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,830
Egyptian priests and monuments and stuff that the 26th dynasty did

430
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,830
That that stuff was in the indicative of a more prosperous Egypt

431
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,330
And so there's no way that

432
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,770
Nebuchadnezzar could have ran through the place and destroyed it when the 26th dynasty was so prosperous

433
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,470
But the Egyptology records are lies

434
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:25,550
We know that yeah, because they have a timeline wrong and then you have to also add in the flawed calculations of this

435
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:33,270
Greek Greco-Roman historian or astrologer told of me Claudius told of me concerning how to date that

436
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,790
6th century BC 7th century BC

437
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,870
This is what most of the secular historians are using as a reference the work of

438
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,530
Claudius told of me and it's actually wrong when you look at it

439
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,830
So there's no really easy way to nail down the events of that time period

440
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:53,290
Because on one hand it says that Nebuchadnezzar will destroy Egypt like specifically in Nebuchadnezzar in Ezekiel 29

441
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,970
Thus says the Lord God and reading from King James behold

442
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,950
I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and he shall make her

443
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:07,950
Multitude and take her spoil and take her prey right there two separate events.

444
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:20,790
Yeah Right, but you know the third so the third but the the 40 years thing is sandwiched in that prophecy in is equal 29 So then it's like oh so you did that in the past, but I don't get it.

445
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:39,710
I thought it was for the future So I can't really discern that yet or haven't looked at it close enough If you read the whole thing in context and you know, the chapter breaks, let me just say one thing are Generally good Okay, where they where they start in one chapter where another one ended, right?

446
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:50,210
You know the numbers that we have in chapters in the King James in many Actually, all the scriptures follow the same thing Even when you look at the 1998 scriptures, the chapter is the same as the King James, right?

447
00:46:50,410 --> 00:47:08,630
So The problem that I have with chapters is that it has a negative effect on the mind Those books need to be written read I should say like any other book Right, if you picked up Emerson or Melville and you saw chapters and verses numbered you'd be kind of pissed off, right?

448
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,050
But you don't get pissed off when you read it in Scripture.

449
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:32,910
We believe it's easy to communicate that way What if I were to tell you that Certain books in the Bible if you removed all chapter and verses no matter how long the book was and you read it in one Sitting you will walk away with a completely different mindset And if you read it with chapter and verse, does that sound plausible to you?

450
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,190
Sure.

451
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:51,880
So what I'm struggling here thinking is from what I remember from Ezekiel, it's all over the place, but That requires study and unfortunately to study that point Guess what?

452
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,780
You have to do

453
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,300
You're gonna have to sit down

454
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,060
You get a million dollar donation

455
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,040
Yeah

456
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:04,620
and read the whole book of Ezekiel without chapter and verse and walk away and see how that fits and

457
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,920
At the same time guess what else you have to do see how well it harmonizes with the rest of Scripture

458
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,400
What a concept yeah million dollars in donations

459
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,820
I don't even think that would be enough to get a brick-and-mortar building by the way, and I don't know what in America

460
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,400
You need sixty sixty thousand a year salary

461
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,920
You know 1,200 a week if you're not making 1,200 a week your poverty by the way

462
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,980
Considered poverty.

463
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,420
I think poverty is like 35 or less or something.

464
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,700
But anyway So, how do I you know, how do I get two or three people a year?

465
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:53,240
That's a quarter of a million a year salary Plus a building plus all the toys that you need to start putting information together a million ain't gonna do it Why even build why build a tap start was in Scripture say though who builds a tower without the wherewithal to finish it?

466
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,720
Ain't gonna happen it.

467
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,720
I'm I've been snubbed out of this equation.

468
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,040
It's not for me to do I think in terms of this is my own personal study.

469
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,800
Do you know how often we have conversations Sam?

470
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,040
Um, I don't care you'd say I'm doing it for my own knowledge.

471
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,940
Well, of course, that's its own No, having knowledge is its own greatest reward, right?

472
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,220
I'll just say this publicly.

473
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:24,480
This is not for me to do I mean, yeah I've been doing these minor Greek speak events and you know Whatever I could speak to a hundred thousand people and like for understand what I'm saying This is not for me to do.

474
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Am I able to do it?

475
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, yeah

476
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,720
Yeah, I could do it, but I'm not gonna do it alone, you know piece things together and explain things

477
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,580
You know, I already got my reward which isn't I'm quite happy

478
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,580
With what I've discovered if I were to breathe my last breath in the next five minutes

479
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,160
I would feel as one of the richest people who ever lived

480
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,220
Am I naive and stupid for saying that well, that's whoever's deciding to hear what I'm saying

481
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,220
But no, I don't think it's my job to do it

482
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,080
I

483
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Think and you know what?

484
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,760
I think that it may not even happen.

485
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,880
I would like to see it happen I Think we mentioned earlier you did there's with the video games.

486
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:11,760
There's someone in the elite or Whatever Illuminati's or whatever someone of that knows the gig knows what's going up?

487
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,280
I mean, why the hell else would they put an Antichrist looking figure in a video game, right?

488
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,420
Someone knows what's going up up there enough to influence these video games or is it just you know, the ether again, right?

489
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:29,100
I would suggest a combination of both primary the ether But yeah, I mean, let's just divert from the conversation.

490
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,200
What if I Said Sam we got a million dollars in donations.

491
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,000
Let's do something.

492
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,260
What?

493
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:34,800
Oh shit.

494
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,540
What do we do now?

495
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,940
What do we do first?

496
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,820
You want to complicate your life like that?

497
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:54,900
I Welcome that it would do it Yeah, it's not enough by the way a million is not much bullshit just because High net high net worth stuff.

498
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,820
Oh, look.

499
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,840
I'm gonna budget work.

500
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,460
Well, I could I could give you I just gave you the reality.

501
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,260
You need 60 grand a year salary three people.

502
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,920
It's a hundred eighty grand a year

503
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,500
You're gonna have to throw some perks in so a quarter of a million a year take a pay cut

504
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,400
Okay

505
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,260
All right

506
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,620
Cut that in half right or double the amount of people then I'd rather double the amount of people six people a

507
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:21,620
Brick and mortar building with any kind of function and appliance is gonna cost you a million alone

508
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,060
work from the Greeks house

509
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:33,220
Yeah, you see I like how you invite yourself over no, it's your project who's gonna get the million

510
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,100
It's gonna be your account or my account.

511
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,580
It's your

512
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,800
No, no

513
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,200
I'd rather turn it into notes and use it that way

514
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,220
But now I would have to set up a trust and have a someone handle it as a trustee

515
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,680
Because you don't want just the hardware alone is your

516
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,460
100,000 right off the top just for the hardware and resources and you're gonna have to go to load do library research and all that

517
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,600
Look exactly

518
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,380
You could look

519
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,900
University the University of Ohio

520
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,280
Back in 2006 or 2005 or 4 somewhere around there

521
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,240
I don't even have the University of Ohio one of those Nebraska, Ohio

522
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,360
they got a two million dollar grant from the US government to

523
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,900
To write up why water is good for plants.

524
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,120
Oh My goodness.

525
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,480
I know it's it sounds like idiocracy, right?

526
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,000
Remember like we put water on plants.

527
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,660
We put Brondo Gatorade right Brondo on it.

528
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,560
Yeah.

529
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,400
Yeah, so this is going on That's what I'm saying a million.

530
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:46,080
Yeah, that's an insult if I got a million in donations to do this or be insulted It's an insult That's why I'm not getting anything Because I'd rather not be insulted with a million.

531
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,880
Does that make sense?

532
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,600
No, but think about it No, it doesn't.

533
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,460
Yeah, just just because you don't know what to do with a million No, I do know what to do it.

534
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,020
I could stretch that million out to kingdom come but not with a project like this

535
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,580
Project like this to do it, right

536
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,480
To do it, right

537
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,340
Which would be to actually not only put the information together with the time required to put it together

538
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,800
As well as can be done temporarily with our understanding

539
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:22,180
By the way, these little Greek speak things I've been doing the same is probably full with more accurate and

540
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:28,200
Let's say deep bone penetrating information anything you're gonna get on the internet regarding these subjects period

541
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,840
Yeah, I don't even have to speculate on that

542
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,740
And it's not because you know, it's me and Sam.

543
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:44,340
It's just because it is The other thing is to continue this type of work I if I were to tell you 30 to 50 million, that's not a lot.

544
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,720
That would be the best What most comfortable way to do it believe it or not?

545
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,160
I think Bruce will understand that a little more than you Sam

546
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,940
I don't mean to be I'm not berating you Sam

547
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,040
But Bruce if I said we got 30 to 50 million to progress the scriptural study you'd say yeah

548
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,660
That's about right

549
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,380
You know that almost gives you a kind of a time marker of how long you can invest your time into it

550
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,200
It's it sets a precedent

551
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:19,600
Yeah, I think Greek is a you're probably setting aside a large chunk of that money for like bribes and stuff

552
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,360
Speaking of bribes I remember back in days.

553
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,440
I'm not admitting maybe this is let me just say this is a story

554
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,020
I was around a construction white collar

555
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,520
You know the smallest project they did was two million and the bigger projects were ten times twenty times

556
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,860
That amount and a million bucks fits in a suitcase very very comfortably

557
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,260
you know a

558
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,420
handshake and

559
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,340
Yeah, I think you left this at my house and you give them the suitcase is the way the conversation goes.

560
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,060
Yeah It's there's not a lot in yeah million is it?

561
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,480
Yeah, there's as a matter of fact actually ran into somebody wanted to buy a house all cash

562
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,620
And it was a quarter of that, and he didn't know yeah

563
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,780
He thought there was you know whatever he carried it around for a week in a backpack

564
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,300
Even in the shower like right at the you know not in the shower, but and once the deal happened

565
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,640
He was like oh, I'm so glad he's you know it's because I had to carry around this money for a week

566
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,000
You know

567
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,840
It's just it didn't it was like a roll only a few inches

568
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,700
You know thick all around a cube

569
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,960
You know if you dropped it on your foot.

570
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:46,530
It wouldn't hurt your foot quarter of a million in cash so Yeah, I mean I could yeah Think about it You know very frugal with the whole thing you you there's a lot of time that could be had with that And a lot of this kind of a project What is Bruce what I was saying?

571
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:51,330
What is a B movie cost these days ten million twelve million a B movie?

572
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:59,750
Gonna be fair I would say I mean you can they're movies They're movies that are done for a hundred thousand fifty thousand.

573
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,790
I'm not talking about that

574
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:07,650
I'm sorry movies that you can make what's the name of that horror movie paranormal activity wasn't that made like ten grand

575
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,950
Yeah, I was like yeah, right a million three million or a million three three four million

576
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:19,590
Yeah, or the one the witches one of whatever before that that made like five million witches of whatever you know

577
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,110
Yeah

578
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:29,750
Yeah, so if you're resourceful, you know that's on you if you're not resourceful, and you need to pay bribes and splurge

579
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,830
Then I guess you know no not bribes.

580
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,190
Oh, here's the interesting part

581
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:40,130
What once you get the information because let's say let's say I were to say something like the statement

582
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,670
Maybe I know someone who has a lot of information in between their ears right where they have access to it

583
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,790
And it just hasn't there's not enough time and resources to put it all out

584
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,250
Then you're like, okay

585
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:57,890
Well, then how do you get it out of the person's head and their ability to communicate it into the resources?

586
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:58,930
And then what do you do with it?

587
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:59,970
What are the resources?

588
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,270
What are you talking about things in print books websites movies documentaries?

589
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,650
What would how are you going to do it and then yeah?

590
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,050
And then how are you gonna get it out there?

591
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:17,090
Right and and and then the next thing would be Marketing of some sort.

592
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,670
I mean, I don't know.

593
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:35,310
What do you need marketing, but we're not we're not If you're gonna try to get it out to different people You have to have some way to get On a website you mean Are we starting a publishing house or something?

594
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,210
We don't need to do nothing.

595
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,450
No actually right now.

596
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:48,830
You just put up a website I mean, yeah, and and the domain then then it's not the website itself then though Then it's just getting the link to that website out to places just a stupid little link, right?

597
00:57:50,610 --> 00:58:00,590
Right But who are you gonna here's the final point who's gonna who's gonna even uh, yeah, who are you gonna sell it to like five people?

598
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:05,510
It's got a million dollars take the money shut up.

599
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,950
Oh, that's a different story

600
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:14,230
But but here's the thing how many people on the planet you think there could even understand this information even if they you know right

601
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,970
Like a few hundred maybe a few thousand maximum on the whole planet

602
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,770
Yeah, you want to be McDonald's no no no no I never said that

603
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:36,170
We don't it's not a concern I think personally I mean just let's say we're having a private conversation right now

604
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,730
The the greatest reward for knowledge and wisdom is it is it within itself?

605
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:44,210
Yeah Yeah, I can agree with that.

606
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,730
Yeah, that's the greatest prize You know how many people are out there?

607
00:58:47,810 --> 00:59:06,550
You got this guy in a wheelchair cripple and some other guy a physicist They say oh, they're so smart and they make all these theories about things that don't exist Talk about you know pixie particles and black holes and stuff, and you know it's total stupidity the whole world thinks He's wise and smart He has anything he ever wants now, what's the reward in that you know deep down?

608
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:15,550
I'm talking about the guy a little cripple guy in a wheelchair or whatever and some other ghillies people going around with CERN and all that stupid shit Deep down inside.

609
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:27,430
They know what they're doing is bullshit, but they're getting rewarded with all this material stuff and praise How about did you revert that what you know is true wisdom and the truth, but when you go on to the world?

610
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:41,910
They think it's bullshit, so where's the real prize these people that are running the physicist and religious institution Bible Teaching and science and medicine all that they know no matter how much praise they get In the world you get to know them personally.

611
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,970
I assure you deep down inside.

612
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:44,770
They are hollow.

613
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:45,910
They are rank.

614
00:59:46,070 --> 01:00:05,800
They are depressed Right you know the truth Let's say in Scripture, and you're living out of a garbage can you will have a joy that these people will never experience Yeah, I'd rather personally do Personal experience.

615
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:20,160
I know a guy's a billionaire and with a B Not a millionaire 65 his wife leaves him after 40 years of marriage and has conversations with him And he's like what is life about it's just you know it's like dude Fucking stupid you're a billionaire.

616
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:27,080
I mean you could actually go and buy a hundred wives if you want Maybe not in America, but in another country trust me.

617
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:40,020
There's a someone in Saudi Arabia already has an agency that does that You know You want him pretty fat ugly stinky smelly clean, whatever you want What do you mean if it's just the wife that messed you up after 40 years.

618
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:46,190
We're talking about you know you see cuz he didn't

619
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,490
right

620
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:54,190
He's a billionaire come on if you're a billionaire your wife leaves you after 40 years like shit, man

621
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,430
I'll go out and buy me a hundred of them I

622
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,650
Couldn't buy me a hundred of them when I had you yet

623
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,550
Do you see that do you see the wisdom in what I just said Oh God yeah

624
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,450
What it's first of all the whole thing of turn it's not off

625
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,610
It's not lawful what she did because it was no premise of adultery

626
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,670
So the whole thing was a sim so just make up for it a hundred times

627
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:24,290
But anyway, this is not what I'm saying what anyone should do, but I'm just giving you an example

628
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:35,390
What is true knowledge and true wisdom is is its own reward sure and you know what it's very powerful reward

629
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,570
It's kind of like the goose who laid the golden egg every day you get more and more

630
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,370
You know as long as you have that knowledge and wisdom

631
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:48,230
Because it actually has an infinite sense about it if you go, let's say you have knowledge and wisdom and you speak

632
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,910
to people and they reciprocate you know you have a

633
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,050
Active let's say publishing house, and they're actually reciprocating.

634
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:06,570
They're buying the materials right so you can grow the project right And you're putting out knowledge and wisdom you put keep putting it out is that diminish it for you No, it seems like this endless fountain, right?

635
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:12,830
If you have knowledge and wisdom and you speak it no matter how even if you're doing you're speaking at ten hours a day or

636
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:13,410
performing

637
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:19,570
The necessary function to impart that to other people does it diminish your knowledge and wisdom no not it seems like this

638
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,890
It's like an infinite

639
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:22,430
source

640
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:28,170
But these other people let's say we're running CERN or the guy in the wheelchair talks about black holes

641
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,310
Or these other people that are viewed as you know having knowledge or whatever

642
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:38,590
It's the opposite do you know that the more they speak it because it's bullshit eventually someone's gonna call bullshit on it

643
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:39,730
And they're always in fear

644
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:49,370
They're running out yeah, they're gonna keep repeating the same bullshit, and then it starts to run out, and they're like oh, man

645
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,090
I know this stuff.

646
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,470
I can't explain why it's bullshit.

647
01:02:51,530 --> 01:03:15,030
I know it's bullshit, but everyone tells me it's great So I better keep doing it what a way to live Yeah, that's how they are So Yeah, what project and the other thing is what to who's gonna listen, I know it doesn't matter yeah It's only like a few hundred people on the whole planet that are worth even talking to where are they?

648
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,750
That's why that's why people say Greek you you've been here.

649
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,950
You've been talking for 20 minutes You haven't let us speak so who cares what you have to say.

650
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,030
I don't talk with people.

651
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,110
I speak at them.

652
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,190
It's a difference.

653
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:40,760
I Don't care about what you have to say Look at you Anyway, I mean that you know that's not true.

654
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:56,100
I do listen to some people But essentially that's that's the the right attitude for this planet I was having a conversation recently with someone about you know Politics, but in a loose way they I'm not political, but everything came out of their mouth was you know this country?

655
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,520
This is country that meaning America.

656
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,080
I'm like dude.

657
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,860
Let me ask you where's America.

658
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:00,740
What do you mean?

659
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,120
I say is it on planet Earth once you stop looking at what America's doing and start looking at what the

660
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,200
condition of the planet is

661
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,380
So if you really want to put what's happening in perspective

662
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,900
And start looking at the history there you never had they're talking about executive orders

663
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,480
Executive orders are stupid you have a prop you should why aren't there general orders the government should be the president should be issuing

664
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,480
General orders not exact when you have executive orders that means you're going into an executive dictatorship

665
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,460
Anyway, I don't want to get into it

666
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,000
It's just so stupid.

667
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,500
I mean, I don't know we have a new president is Donald duck or someone.

668
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:52,370
I don't know it doesn't matter It's a ridiculous President and why would you why would you have a good president?

669
01:04:52,550 --> 01:05:04,890
We're good presidents rule over good people crappy presidents rule over what kind of people Crappy people what do I see crappy people means you can have a crappy leader?

670
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:12,270
the It's so simple But it's an earth.

671
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,550
It's not a matter of which country now

672
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,790
Here's the other thing Sam in terms of getting a wherewithal to moving this information forward

673
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,070
And if if knowledge and wisdom is its own reward

674
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,310
Then you might as well say that we're let's say in Bruce included here, too

675
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:32,950
we have three very happy people just having a conversation that happens to be streamed and

676
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,830
If you're going to let this happen organically then whoever is listening

677
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,850
It's up to them to tell like the shampoo then they tell two friends

678
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:46,370
He tells a friend and they tell two friends and so on and so on right, but that's not happening.

679
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:47,670
I

680
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:51,690
Remember years ago when I was more social by by now

681
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:56,870
I'm not that social and I'm gonna say I'm not not social bum not that as social out of choice

682
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:03,750
I remember when I found something good whether it was information or shampoo or anything or a place to eat

683
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,850
I've made sure I told people about it

684
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:11,690
Right, yeah, and if you look at for example chat or people listen to Greek speak

685
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,210
I'm not I'm not saying this is definitive, but are they telling anyone?

686
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,150
Nope, not really.

687
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:20,590
Yeah, there's some comments here and there Yeah, I try to talk to someone they didn't get it or whatever.

688
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,130
No, I'm not talking about that They don't get it.

689
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,730
They don't get it.

690
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:27,090
But is it being promoted by those that find worth in it?

691
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:37,290
No, very little if not at all That's your other sign if those that are close to you and I mean in other words close to the emanation are not promoting it Going even further out.

692
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:45,280
It does it means even less It tells you what so badly you got out there Yeah, it's not even a battle.

693
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,280
It's what it is.

694
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:58,540
It's it's a mindset about the people you're trying to converse with it It's appalling Yeah, but even those that are listening can't promote it Yes, you know, so so forget it.

695
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:10,360
It's just the reward But here's the thing those that that I've communicated with whether it's in writing or speech that do get it Do find it as being a reward within itself in the beginning.

696
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:23,480
It's always very frustrating Of course, you try to communicate any truth about anything to anyone you think with resistance But but then it's just better to you know, keep your mind your mouth quiet and enjoy Do know?

697
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:25,360
Right.

698
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:40,300
Well because the knowledge of it a chat with you Yeah, and the knowledge that you gain from it is its own reward Yeah, exactly exactly and like I said earlier Bruce You know if we did get a million or so in donations now, do you think it's gonna complicate things a bit now?

699
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:47,940
It's like okay now I've got to go Together Yeah, I Wouldn't let it.

700
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,240
That's why I said you need three people at a good salary.

701
01:07:50,580 --> 01:08:08,420
Mm-hmm and brick-and-mortar place and and by the way, the brick-and-mortar place will be you know, a decent brick-and-mortar place and You need a I guess Sam would just a web You wouldn't have to do print anymore because if the closest thing to print now is Kindle, which is a little thing That's supposed to be like a book, right?

702
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,660
No, don't worry Yeah All right.

703
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,819
So if print is I don't think print would be considered at all.

704
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,380
Sam Ray would be all digital, right?

705
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:26,420
There's some things don't exist in digital format Right, but then you put them in digital format, right and I can get them out the library Yeah.

706
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:38,340
Yeah, that's true So I found that the like one of the libraries here what they do things that don't come out of library They have for a fee a scanning area and in certain things if they're too fragile, they don't let you handle it at all, right?

707
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:46,960
Because it's just the book basically it's amazing You set it down and he just turned they give you some gloves and you just turn the page in it and it photographs it Right.

708
01:08:47,580 --> 01:09:03,740
Mm-hmm very clearly But I think what's more important now, yeah I think now they have that already done Prior to you wanting to look at the book and handle it Yeah, most places.

709
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,580
Yeah, I'm your draft or something that do have these these older texts

710
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,760
but I think now the way things are is if you can read something and

711
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:14,620
Break it down

712
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:18,880
For someone and you know, if you in other words a 200 page book

713
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:23,340
Which would take 10 hours or 8 hours or 5 hours depending on how fast you read

714
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:31,180
Would be better served if someone did a one-hour let's say audio on it explaining it accurately

715
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,660
So the so the reader or the listener, right?

716
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:46,500
so And that's why very often basics the permers Like I always bring up Gustav Le Bon, you know The crowd mentality.

717
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:57,240
I just give the salient points Yeah, there's an audio book seven eight hours or whatever you can get into it But what you're gonna walk with is is a point there that yeah, basically what the Greek says about it in three minutes It's pretty accurate.

718
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:17,900
I mean I try to leave out the part where he attributes Phenomenon, you know to a source of forces unknown, you know, and there are some good things that come out of the crowd But the reason I use the Le Bon metaphor is to show what happens when information is put out and people are drawn to it Yeah, usually it's not a very good thing.

719
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,740
There are good things that come out of it Of course in some cases very rare.

720
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,240
Mm-hmm and good one if you're familiar with Le Bon's book

721
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:31,300
he does attribute some of it to he can't explain the phenomenon of how you know, there must be a mystical or

722
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:36,660
Godlike or angelic presence that draws people the other he can't objectify that but other things he can't you see

723
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:44,500
And I think I've already objectified that by in one way saying it's all external input anyway and cosmic censorship

724
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,300
So I borrow from him and just give you know

725
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,120
And that's why some people when I started bringing up goes over on Le Bon.

726
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,160
I get emails and messages I just ordered his book.

727
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,720
I'm like why?

728
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,860
Why I never said you should get the book.

729
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:11,330
I never endorsed it Yeah, if you want to read it read it, but don't tell you know Whether you tell me you got or not is irrelevant to me and you can get a free PDF Or an audiobook is better on YouTube or whatever.

730
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:13,750
You could you don't have to sit there, you know

731
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:17,490
You could be doing other things and I basically broke it down

732
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:22,390
I mean that is you know, it's very simple and I just like scripture is really easy to break down

733
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,610
You can have a three-minute conversation

734
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:31,130
With people and about scripture and basically you if they don't know scripture and you're going to explain it to them in three minutes

735
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:36,770
The best way to leave off when you're ending it is just do what you're told and it's better that you don't know

736
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:41,210
But let me just these points that I just gave you in the past three minutes explain all

737
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:45,750
The stupid questions that you're asking why things are the way they are, right?

738
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,210
Someone asked you why is there so much suffering in the world?

739
01:11:51,310 --> 01:12:04,260
Well because the gods have no regard for your physical condition physical condition They have a very high regard for your spiritual condition And the only time they have any regard for your physical condition is when it affects what?

740
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:18,370
Your spiritual condition you see anywhere in any ancient rites is brush your teeth and exercise and eat healthy Nope tells you eat properly.

741
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:33,070
So what this makes you clean this makes you unclean what physically or spiritually you could you can you someone who just had pork or dog or a rabbit Can you tell if they're clean or unclean physically maybe so to a certain degree?

742
01:12:33,190 --> 01:13:08,850
Yeah, because there's trichinella and those other things, but No, typically it's spiritual So anyway Oh you guys you've been reading up on any of the archaeology lately anyway, yes Someone brought toleration a little while back the archaeology over in Israel Yes, so a fascinating Okay, I got an email I think Was Vandy or someone else about it was a tour of the city of David and all that.

743
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:09,710
That's a propaganda.

744
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:10,050
Yes.

745
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,650
That's the one What what was that?

746
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:24,230
It's a propaganda thing don't it's semi-accurate It's Things that you know the stuff that they found I tried I tried to keep Off of what he was saying.

747
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:34,970
It would have been better just to watch and look at the pictures It is there's many levels That's why I mean propaganda was like all the if a bell falls off a priest's robe Come hell or high water.

748
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:35,870
They're gonna find it.

749
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:50,270
Why because it's a set-apart thing Right, you know it won't the only way that would be that way is if There was a chest or a cache of those things around when they were making them and when the temple where the area was Destroyed it got scattered.

750
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,790
Right, right.

751
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,490
That's what I mean.

752
01:13:52,530 --> 01:14:13,230
It's a propaganda thing They're trying to they're doing the reverse of what I said They're they're trying to take what they know and how their behavior is and overlap it and force it into what happened I'm saying look at what happened and then and then rearrange what you see happening now to fit that because that's what's going to happen hmm You see what I mean, right?

753
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:26,810
Give it a loose example you're just some guy watching movies and You'll notice that you've been watching movies the past 20 years and whenever the terrorist is brought up.

754
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:43,870
They're always an Arab or Muslim descent For decades in the movies, right right and then all of a sudden you start seeing in the news There's acts of terrorism that might happen Well, you better start If you're wise you're gonna say oh shit.

755
01:14:43,990 --> 01:15:03,590
We Hollywood has been showing us that Terrorism in the movies and they're always Muslim So when the now in the news are talking about possible terrorist events, we better take that and force it in To what we just heard To come up with in the future when they're going to be talking about terrorists.

756
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:06,110
They're always going to be Muslim How accurate is that going to be?

757
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,130
Pretty freaking accurate.

758
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,270
You see what I mean, right?

759
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:23,890
So if but even though it's all contemporary so Anyway, so you rearrange what's being said?

760
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,210
So will you look historically?

761
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:32,730
Right now that there is no other than archaeology there is no acknowledgment of the truth of history, right?

762
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:42,570
so for example When you look at Israel in Jerusalem, the only acknowledgment you're going to get of anything real as the Gihon spring They can't tell you the Gihon spring.

763
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:43,790
That's not the Gihon spring.

764
01:15:44,130 --> 01:16:01,570
They can't do that But they will never add right now They know they have not and they can't politically add two and two together and tell you well the temple was over the Gihon spring So they haven't done that yet Bizarre because it's the only spring that's there.

765
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,230
That's right.

766
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:10,090
And what they're doing in this video and other videos I've seen they're looking underneath the Fort Antola for for Yeah, Judea.

767
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,230
Yeah the wall thing.

768
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,630
They're not gonna find That's all that's what they're gonna find.

769
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:19,770
The only Judean artifacts are gonna find there is the booths and the commerce that was set up

770
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:24,810
You know on the outside of the city right right to them

771
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:33,330
They're not gonna find the hardcore stuff there and actually the hardcore stuff was either taken away before or it was just literally destroyed

772
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:43,130
So, you know when it's gonna get really hardcore when you go opposite the Gihon spring and up about 50 or 100 meters

773
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:47,850
And you start digging right there and you will find a carbon ash layer

774
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,670
with a tree stump

775
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:51,450
Burned out

776
01:16:51,450 --> 01:17:01,510
Yeah, and that will be the area of several things that happened there so what they call a destruction layer

777
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:07,030
So anyway, the the stuff is really simple

778
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:14,110
I hope you guys and the listeners of the three four people that are able to listen to this are getting a reward by just

779
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,610
knowing on their own

780
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:17,470
Quest of stuff.

781
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:38,930
Also, that is the real reward Well, we have 22 of them on listening right now, yeah Yeah, so sorry 22, yeah They could be sleeping.

782
01:17:39,570 --> 01:18:03,270
Yeah Certainly, it's only three or four really Maximum five but but here's the the the point is When you go on the rectangle there's so much stuff that you can discover on your own and go on the rectangle and not find it at all and But you will find it in libraries Well, I shouldn't say no you won't find in libraries either in a good library.

783
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:06,770
I should say look I've once discovered a library here in town.

784
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:11,010
I didn't even know it was here I was walking around in a mall and it said public library.

785
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:14,310
I was like I walked in I was like Is this a government sanction?

786
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,770
Is this a government public libraries?

787
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:16,350
Yeah, it is.

788
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:20,890
I was like, I didn't even know it was here and The librarian was so proud.

789
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,610
She was like everything on this side is fiction.

790
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,810
Everything on this side is nonfiction

791
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:29,030
I looked at her I said, it's all fiction, baby

792
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:39,070
Not that kind of library because the FBI has a book seizure list and

793
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,220
Most of these public libraries even the main one and and

794
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:46,390
in 42nd and 5th Avenue, New York City

795
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:52,870
There was a policy that started 30 years ago any of the old stuff that had to do with science religious texts or whatever

796
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:55,830
That was hardcore was removed and put in storage

797
01:18:59,050 --> 01:18:59,590
Yeah

798
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:06,710
Or or discarded like the Ben Franklin library in Philadelphia that had a lot of early

799
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:11,790
19th and 18th century texts they started either discarding them or putting them in storage as a guy

800
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:15,070
Who found out this was happening from one of the janitorial staff?

801
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:27,890
He went there and scored 20,000 books that were you know 150 year old on science electricity and all this stuff that are far more accurate on Electrical phenomenon than what's going on today, even though they didn't have a Radio Shack voltmeters and all that shit.

802
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:41,370
Yeah So you don't want that kind of library so anyway look I'm not blaming these libraries because they're accommodating who the general public which is disgusting.

803
01:19:42,070 --> 01:20:01,500
Yeah, I Might have to take off As I have work in six hours Well, I thought it was off time Yeah, it is until the next day.

804
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,820
But um, okay for me.

805
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:12,100
It's Wednesday morning Okay Yeah as the Pope Work schedule goes have you by the way before you go Sam?

806
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:15,840
Have you ever brought up the Pope's work schedule to anyone just in passing?

807
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:23,840
Not not that you need to get into the details of the mechanism of lawful timekeeping But have you ever brought up the Pope's work schedule as a farce?

808
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,660
Yeah once Okay, only once.

809
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,980
Oh, that's fine.

810
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:34,660
You don't have to bring it up more than that Whether you okay, what was the reaction you want to share it with the rest of the class?

811
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:49,400
They found it to be Some kind of I think ponderable material, but you know They they were silent and they were like, oh Yeah, that makes sense.

812
01:20:49,820 --> 01:21:03,480
You know, I didn't bring it up with you any hope or any expectation I just sort of did it because I hadn't done it before and I saw an opening Okay, you know So as well-received it wasn't outwardly rejected or you Right.

813
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,680
Yeah, I mean you can't hold it.

814
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,060
There's nothing to reject Right.

815
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:17,560
Well, sometimes you say stuff like that You know, they either reject it or they give you the same look a baby seal gives you right before it gets clubbed I love something like that.

816
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:46,100
I got the look but you know, it was acknowledged I mean, you can't fight the presentation that the presentation is, you know Done well, and it's pretty simple and ironclad As soon as you say that the animals don't go off that they can't argue with you Nothing goes off even people don't I mean people real people Yeah, well, this is a nice Thank you guys again.

817
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:46,540
Yeah.

818
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,060
Okay.

819
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:47,960
Let's do it again.

820
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,880
Maybe in a snake.
