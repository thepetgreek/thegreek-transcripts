1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,600
Let's see, good evening everybody.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,280
We got Greek, myself, and shortly Sam from the way it sounds.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,280
Greetings Greek.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,160
Greetings.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,900
Okay, yeah, we'll do another sonic event, right?

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,780
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,420
Let's make sure everybody's happy on the board here.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Okay, we're good.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,520
Okay, so we started speaking earlier about maybe any questions or anything like that.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,220
I always have stuff to say if I get started.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,680
So yeah, but either way, let's just get started on a few notions.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,420
It's mid-season.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,520
It's going about mid-season depending on where you are.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,280
We just choose that notion carefully, mid-season.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,700
So whatever season you're in right now, it's you're in the middle, approaching the middle of it.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,680
So it just shows you, you know, if you got a perspective on time, how fast time, you know, events are moving.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,860
The other thing is here for the majority of the people I'm reckoning are in the winter.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:38,940
If anyone this year has done any, excuse me, on an experimental basis, eating seasonally, let's say, right, and found that it to be rewarding, you know, not eating foods that are derived or minimizing the intake of food that comes from or grown and harvested in warm climates, right?

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,100
I have found that personally.

20
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:51,260
And you know what's strange about that Greek is the way that it manifests itself in the individual if they're not eating within their longitude.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:02,160
And you know, the nasal stuff, the flu, is there an actual, is that just the liver not being able to process this stuff?

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,560
You know, in other words, you're full of dung, shall we say?

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,860
Regarding what?

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,020
Well, if you're not eating lawfully, the body obviously reacts.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:23,520
For instance, when I got sicker than a dog and I was guilty as charged on too much sugars and foods that just weren't in this climate.

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,960
So I guess I'm wondering why the human manifests that kind of behavior in itself, the nasal, the flu-like symptoms, all that.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
Is that just us being full of dung?

28
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,560
No, I've gone into that before.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,900
No, no, that's just whenever mucus is developed, that means the body is losing a vacuum condition.

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,840
It's losing a vacuum.

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,140
An analogy would be when you're looking at what they call a car, you see one of the tires are low.

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:06,260
Well, it's low because it's losing atmospheric difference, atmospheric potential, meaning the pressure in that tire should be high, and because it's not, it's sagging.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:18,320
Now, the pressure in the body should be lower than the atmosphere, and when it starts to raise up, the pressure goes up, still in a vacuum, because the only time you lose complete vacuum is when you're dead.

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,560
If you lose vacuum in the body, you go into chemical decomposition.

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:39,900
So, no, that's like an example of that would be when an unborn infant is inside the mother's womb, what prevents it from falling out of the body?

36
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,520
You know, you have obviously a placenta and a lot of other stuff surrounding the development of that human, and it's called a mucus plug.

37
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:58,200
You could go look up the anatomy of a pregnant woman, and the child is, you know, it's all held up at the end of the uterus with what's called a mucus plug.

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,160
Why is it made, why is it mucus?

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,460
You see, no, eating seasonally is very simple.

40
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:22,520
It's just like the automobiles that are designed a certain way, like for a little while now, quite a few years, some of the better European cars and some of the better Japanese cars, the higher-end cars, when you go to tank up or fuel up, and you, what does it say on the thing?

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,260
It says 91 octane only.

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,320
You ever notice that?

43
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,700
Yeah, and the other cars are designed for 87 or 89.

44
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,380
Yeah, you're made from the earth, in case you haven't gotten that memo, right?

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,900
I mean, that's just a general statement.

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,120
Right, so there's a development process there that's involved.

47
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,360
Now, here's the thing.

48
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,880
There's two approaches to this.

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:03,560
One is, do you want to get pedantic into what's called, you know, find out all the science and everything there is to know about it, or do you want to know what just works right now, but more than just a ritual?

50
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,860
You know, like, for example, most people are using a car as a ritual.

51
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,120
They just know if they pull this lever and do this, the thing moves and they get to where they want to go, you know, a little bit more than that.

52
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:27,960
And I tend to save more of these, quote, unquote, deeper knowledge conversations for private, because in private, if anyone's ever had a private discussion with me, like eight hours is normal.

53
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,940
Right.

54
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,640
You know, and it's like, where do you find the time?

55
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,660
Well, I make the time.

56
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,160
So also, whenever you're doing even something like this, or the chatango or the website, you're dealing with the public.

57
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,280
Right.

58
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,640
And fortunately, I've never gotten anything negative really on the chatango.

59
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,820
Sometimes you're in there.

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,200
In person, I do get some negative comments, you know, and maybe off comments and things like that.

61
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,740
But everything's been very positive, not because I'm looking for that.

62
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,720
It's just like working in retail.

63
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,380
If you ask anybody in retail, what's really tough about being retail?

64
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll give you all these reasons.

65
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,200
I look at them as though you're dealing with the public.

66
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm like, yeah, basically, you know, and that means exactly the truth.

67
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:17,960
Yeah.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,480
So this is a so this is still a very powerful.

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,120
And in other words, let's just say it this way.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,620
The cults, CULT, a cult, it could define many ways, but I'm just using a normal definition.

71
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,620
You're being run by a series of cults right now society that have been normalized.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,800
So you know, there was your all of your what you consider to be law is run by a secret cult.

73
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,800
And if you don't know that, so this is not a theory, this is actual fact, you're pretty naive.

74
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,720
Your food and your science and your schools and your medicine is also run by a cult.

75
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:07,700
Now, there's, you know, there's a level to that where you can see how they're not no one is doing what they're supposed to be doing.

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,220
That's according to what's memorialized in their own writings, right.

77
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:29,480
And, of course, you know, no one really cares, because obviously, these, everything is going the way it is, you know, your your spiritualists, you know, in other words, all of your religions, regardless of its Christian, Judaism, Islam, Hindu, Buddhist, and all the denominations therein are all cults, various cults.

78
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,940
In other words, it's there is a secret behind it.

79
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,180
And the secret is very simple.

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:43,580
These people are operating on plausibility, and a level of control that accommodates the masses.

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,100
That's all, it's very simple.

82
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,800
There's no knowledge that's necessary.

83
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,280
There's no technique, there's no law that's necessary.

84
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:17,640
In other words, if the people are partaking in their mechanistic you know, social things, you know, whether whether you're a street sweeper, or an attorney, or working in a bakery, or a mechanic or whatever, all you need to know is right now in this epoch, or this particular society, you're doing a particular thing every day by habit or by ritual or by desire or by necessity.

85
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,000
And you're not making waves, you know, there's not too much friction.

86
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
And you just move along.

87
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,840
And you just do every day do what you do today, you'll do it tomorrow.

88
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,420
You know, you have your little things here and there.

89
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,220
And it's just running that way.

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:48,740
So to have discussions about why things are the way they are, and how you can actually have more control over the things that personally influence you and that you could personally influence also outwardly, is very unpopular, and also misunderstood.

91
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,620
And the I'm going to bring Sam in here in a moment.

92
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:03,980
And the other thing is, there is no room for truth of anything outside of that truth, you see.

93
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,620
And the other thing, there's another thing also, that if stuff like Greek speak now, here's the thing I'm years ago, when I used to speak publicly, I always regretted it.

94
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,080
And now it's not that I like to speak it.

95
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,160
But you know, some time goes back or whatever.

96
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
And I'm like, what the hell is going on with these people on this planet?

97
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,300
What's wrong with you people?

98
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:33,820
You know, the stuff that you everything that you get involved in, no matter how esoteric or whatever sublime you think it is, there's a basic element to it.

99
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:41,640
And it's simple, there's a simple underlying current or a simple underlying principle or archetype to everything and no one is discussing these things.

100
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,660
So it's like, what's wrong with you, you know, inhabitants of the earth.

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,500
So, you know, I mean, there are people that know it.

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,980
They're not speaking.

103
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,180
Right?

104
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,820
And it doesn't mean because you're speaking, you don't know.

105
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,140
And if you don't know, you're not speaking.

106
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
Yes, that's, that's true.

107
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,060
In most cases, that's like a cliche that's used for stupid people.

108
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,500
And, you know, stupid people are very emotional.

109
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:15,980
But the thing is, if you do listen to Greek speak, it's going to take about, let's say three to six months for you to realize what you're hearing.

110
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,960
And anywhere between six months to three years to realize what's being said.

111
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,940
So it's very different to, oh, what happened this week?

112
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,320
You know, you only turn on these browsers and they're, and they're like, Oh, this is all you need to know about this, right?

113
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,940
And then next week you have the next thing.

114
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,700
Yeah, it's just ridiculous society.

115
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,000
But, but yeah, so that's a, that's a far cry from eating seasonally.

116
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,400
And also I've done more informational stuff about eating seasonally and all that with Seth.

117
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,180
I think this is common sense.

118
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:02,700
So if anyone wants to look up these things, and like I said, I think you've been listening to Greek speak for less than a year or so, Bruce?

119
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,420
Yes.

120
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:03,900
Yes.

121
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes.

122
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,040
So you're past that initialization point.

123
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

124
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,980
Past the shock.

125
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,880
The initial.

126
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,600
Hey, Sam.

127
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,560
Hello.

128
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,020
Good evening, Sam.

129
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,860
I can hear your keyboard.

130
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:23,020
Put a towel under your keyboard or your cleanest dirty shirt or something.

131
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Sorry, say that again.

132
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,360
You cut out for me.

133
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,740
Put something under your keyboard to damp it out.

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
Yeah, I don't really know what you mean.

135
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,440
The keyboard's part of the laptop.

136
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,120
Oh, then you got to throw, throw the whole thing away.

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,860
No, I'm just joking.

138
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,560
Yeah, you could dip, dip it out to put something underneath the laptop.

139
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,500
So it doesn't resonate against the hard surface.

140
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
And don't block the fan.

141
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
Anyway, how are you doing?

142
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,780
I'm doing well.

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Just a little tired.

144
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,160
How are you guys?

145
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,560
Same, I guess.

146
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,560
A little tired.

147
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,480
I mean, I know what you want me to say.

148
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,160
We're streaming, so.

149
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,540
No, we're, that's fine.

150
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,280
There's only 10 people that are ever going to listen to this anyway, if that.

151
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:18,380
But no, we're just talking a little bit about here and there and, and the seasonality of things and whatever.

152
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,060
But the reason I announced to bring you in as well is because you messaged that you're available on what they call Tuesdays.

153
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,020
Do you know what day it is?

154
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,500
Anyone know roughly what it's, do you know, are you aware that it's roughly the 10th month?

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,940
You know, that's why it's called December, believe it or not.

156
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,880
And do you know that it's around the 18th day?

157
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,500
It started around noontime, so.

158
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,280
Fascinating.

159
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,080
What's so fascinating about that?

160
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,020
It's called sarcasm.

161
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,540
Oh, okay.

162
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,240
Yeah.

163
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,340
Yeah.

164
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,020
Here's the thing.

165
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,580
It's kind of like, you know, if you're raised in the Christian,

166
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,740
what do you call it, thing and then the Gregorian calendar, even if you were excited about learning

167
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,360
lawful stuff, lawful just means you can measure it versus being told by a bunch of, you know,

168
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,860
psychopaths or whatever, or freaks or cultists, cult members being, in other words, if you have

169
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,140
someone that grew up in a cult from their parents were in a cult and their parents were in a cult,

170
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,220
and you want to get out of that cult, no matter how far you run away or how fast you run,

171
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,020
you can get out of the cult, but you can't get the cult out of the person.

172
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,140
You know, you can take the person out of the cult, but you can't.

173
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,340
Right.

174
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,040
So it takes six months to several years to see what really what's going on.

175
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
So, yeah, thanks for the encouragement.

176
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,020
No, but I think I'm past that stage.

177
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,740
It's just at a 3am in the morning when I haven't learned timekeeping yet.

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,180
I just have to try and be sarcastic to let that brush off.

179
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,620
Yeah, no, the time, it's not important.

180
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,340
Sure it is.

181
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,340
I'll get to that later, though.

182
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,640
But I do look into other things in my free time.

183
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,540
Yeah.

184
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,380
What do you feel like getting into?

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,920
Well, I figured we'd just continue from where we left off the last time.

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,420
I know that you've done a previous stream, but my mind is pretty much at the same place it was before, because I usually go into progression with these topics.

187
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,940
Okay.

188
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,220
So we're talking about the gods and the adversary and gleaning more.

189
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,880
Well, here's one thing.

190
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,080
Let me just start off this way.

191
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:48,800
There's one thing that, you know, you've heard me, one of the things that I like to do is discredit what people have in terms of the presumptiveness, the presumptive things that they have that they presume are facts and real or whatever, right?

192
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,440
Like the King James, King Jimmy, or all their biblical stuff.

193
00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:09,620
And many times I've said that any inquisitive person that looks into, let's say, the biblical text as it's been delivered and handed out in society can invalidate it very rapidly, you know, as being an informational-based thing, right?

194
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Now, the thing is, on what level do you want to look at it?

195
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,540
You have, obviously, to invalidate it, you're going to have to look at what it was supposed to be communicating.

196
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,820
And that's why I always suggest anyone that has an unabridged, which are very few and far in between, version of a Bible, read the introduction.

197
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
Do you have one?

198
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,400
It's about, they have about usually anywhere between 5 to 15 page introduction.

199
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,560
And if you read that introduction, you want to keep reading the rest of that piece of crap, you're an idiot.

200
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,240
You know, I mean, meaning as keeping that thing as a reference material, you know what I mean?

201
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,100
They flat out tell you what they're doing, right?

202
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:57,320
It's kind of like in Hollywood, you know, you ever watch these movies where the villain gets the victim and he's pointing the gun at him, he says, I'm going to shoot you because of this, and he's talking to him for five minutes.

203
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm like, that's not how it happens in real life.

204
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,060
In real life, when someone wants to kill you, they do it quickly and they get out of there, right?

205
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,040
But in Hollywood, they stand there, right?

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,240
You know, like we'll pick any movie, they always do that, right?

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,260
Oh, I got you now, I'm going to make sure that it hurts.

208
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,700
Right.

209
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,400
That's stupid.

210
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,800
That's exactly what's going on with all of the, now because you have such poor text and poor reference material, what does that lead to?

211
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,840
Poor what?

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Doctrine.

213
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,020
You want to know anything about poor doctrine?

214
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,620
You ever heard of Christmas?

215
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,260
Merry Christmas.

216
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,340
Right?

217
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,100
Look at the stuff, right?

218
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,600
It's ridiculous.

219
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,740
I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it.

220
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm just saying you shouldn't do it if you know what's going on.

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,640
So, the interesting thing is, let's just take something really small.

222
00:16:48,460 --> 00:17:04,000
Like, before we get into the text, you were talking about all this stuff about the gods and all this, but what we are talking about is based on what we know, based on what we see, based on this poor crap doctrine that we've been given from the ancient texts also, right?

223
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,660
Let's just take something simple.

224
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,839
If you look up the Strong's word for leprosy, right?

225
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,180
If you look up what they call leprosy, it's more of an old, well, it's actually Old and New Testament.

226
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,859
That word that's being used there, actually, it's one of these difficult words to pronounce.

227
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,920
I have to look it up myself.

228
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,260
I'm not even going to try it right now.

229
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:38,180
If you look it up, that's the same word that's used when something is in a necrotic state, like a stillborn baby, or Moses' errand sister.

230
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,740
Do you remember when she went up and the Elohim, Yahweh said, no, no, I speak to Moses directly.

231
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,840
I don't need you, basically.

232
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,180
And she got leprosy, it says, and she became white as snow.

233
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,120
She became white.

234
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,520
You know, Job talks about, it's mentioned in several places in scripture, this condition is mentioned.

235
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,820
It's not leprosy, as we know it.

236
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:12,460
Leprosy is where you're, you know, it's a condition where you have a flush of phagia, a thing where your limbs are falling off, and all this.

237
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,500
You know, this is a different condition.

238
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:25,600
This particular disease or condition is best rendered as a rapid necrotic state, like a necrosis comes in.

239
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,500
This is something that we're not familiar with today.

240
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,620
Would that be equivalent to the flesh-eating disease?

241
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:42,820
That would be more, no, it's not flesh-eating, because a child that's born stillborn doesn't have a flesh-eating disease, but they are pale gray color.

242
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay.

243
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:55,620
It's as if, if you've ever seen anyone that's gone into shock, they, all of a sudden, they lose all their flesh, flesh tone, and they turn this, this pasty gray look.

244
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,940
Have you seen, have you ever experienced that?

245
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,360
So, I'm talking about the kind of shock that people die from if they're not treated, you know, out of it.

247
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,900
So, yeah, yeah.

248
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:19,920
So this is a condition that in today's society, what's been put out through this bad translations, bad versions, bad doctrine and imagery, there's something different going on here.

249
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,240
You know, that, well, let's say, does it pertain to, you know, that part of the world at that time?

250
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,960
Sure it does.

251
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:37,540
There's several things that pertain, because you notice when the patriarchs were, after the flood, you know, like Abraham's father and father-in-law, what they, they lived till 200 and something.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
Abraham lived till 175.

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,180
So, you know, the life expectancy of man just didn't get cut off immediately after the flood.

254
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,240
There was a half life.

255
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:54,640
So, there was something in nature that was affecting it, that would rapidly withdrew or inflicted itself upon mankind where life span.

256
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,160
So there, in other words, there, there are things, if you're paying attention to the information, the conditions were different.

257
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,680
There are things that existed that were slightly different, you know.

258
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,100
And I'm not talking about, you know, like minor things that we adjust to today, like we say polio and all these other things that are misguided.

259
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,860
You know, we don't have that anymore or whatever.

260
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,620
But it could be something like that.

261
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,380
For example, an example, I brought up polio, because that's something that's completely misguided also.

262
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
There's no such thing.

263
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,660
That is a neurotoxin.

264
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:33,200
There was no polio before or after the spraying of pesticides, the new pesticides in the 20s and 30s and 40s, right?

265
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,800
I remember that when I was young.

266
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,420
Yeah, people were getting with the machines and spraying that big fog that went up and down the streets.

267
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,540
That's what caused polio.

268
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,980
Yeah, neurotoxins.

269
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,780
And then they stopped spraying and the doctor says, we'll take advantage of that and save the vaccine.

270
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,040
And we've isolated the bacteria or the pathogen.

271
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,440
They didn't really use the term virus back then.

272
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,540
That was not invented.

273
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:04,260
First started, they passed out the cubes with the polio vaccine on it.

274
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,880
All the kids.

275
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,980
Yeah, it's all a farce.

276
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,040
Yeah, this is a cult.

277
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,780
Yeah, if you if you ever, let me put it this way.

278
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:19,560
When you go see an attorney, an accountant, a doctor, a priest, a rabbi, a guru, you know, any mom, a psychiatrist, on and on and on and on.

279
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,660
And I'm telling you that these people are part of a cult.

280
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,420
Do you expect anyone to be part of a cult to give you rational activity or rational thinking or anything rational?

281
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,860
Or do you expect bizarre shit?

282
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,460
Right?

283
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,880
You expect bizarre shit.

284
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,020
And this is what they're doing.

285
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah.

286
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,960
And this is normal.

287
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,720
This is the norm.

288
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,880
This is the norm.

289
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,620
You know, this is so.

290
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,300
So what to do?

291
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,320
Very simple.

292
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,660
To go back to the conversation.

293
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,580
It was very simple.

294
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,720
Just set yourself apart with Sam is when we have a conversation like that.

295
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,900
There's so many things to look at.

296
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,320
Let me just do a little more flexing.

297
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,960
Are you there, Sam?

298
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:56,980
Yes.

299
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:57,700
Okay.

300
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:05,920
When you're looking at these entities, let's use that term, you know, and delineating and trying to figure out who they are.

301
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,180
You know how they're really defined, by the way?

302
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,680
They're defined by their activities, just like people define themselves.

303
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Well, I'm a street sweeper.

304
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm a bus driver.

305
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm a painter.

306
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,940
I'm a mechanic.

307
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm a baker.

308
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm a butcher.

309
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,060
You ever notice that people define themselves that way?

310
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,340
But essentially, they're human.

311
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,260
You know, if you cut them open, they're almost interchangeable based on blood type and other things.

312
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,660
These gods are not like that.

313
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,540
They actually are very different.

314
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,420
They're more different than we are.

315
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,760
Because, for example, you know, the difference between a carib and an angel is not the difference between, let's say, a black guy and a Chinaman.

316
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,700
Right?

317
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,540
Yeah.

318
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm using like old Arizona talk here.

319
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,660
You know, if you ever, by the way, if you ever hang out with miners in Arizona or Colorado, Chinese people are called Chinamen.

320
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,480
So anyway, so you see what I mean?

321
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,440
There's a tremendous, but then again, they're also separated by what they do.

322
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,680
Because you can have a benevolent entity all of a sudden become malevolent based on his actions and intent.

323
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,700
All right.

324
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,280
The other thing you have to consider also is what is really going on?

325
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,880
What is really going on?

326
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,860
And I haven't stressed this in years ago, people used to ask me this.

327
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
I said, No, I don't want to talk about it.

328
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,780
But now I do.

329
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,440
Because I think there's at least five or 10 people out there that are beginning to get what's going on, you know, which is enough.

330
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,440
When you start studying the concept of the gods affecting humanity, that is a parallel society.

331
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,060
It's almost another universe, because it's intangible.

332
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,940
Now they can make themselves tangible to us, but we don't have control over that to some most most degrees, let's say.

333
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,340
Okay, there, but you see, and someone this is what I didn't talk about.

334
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,900
People say, Well, do the gods have a God?

335
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes, they do.

336
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,940
And that is the God of the Bible, quote unquote.

337
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,120
That is the most high that is the one that you're reading about.

338
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:21,800
So when you reading about the most high Elohim Yahweh in the Bible, you have to keep in the in the back of your mind somewhere somehow, yes, you do have to do this, is that he is the God of the gods affecting us.

339
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,540
So he's like bypassing through.

340
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,420
So we have this entire society of the gods affecting humanity.

341
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:37,860
And when you read about what this head deity is doing, he's going through as a God, the realm of the gods, to us, you know, affecting things on earth.

342
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,480
Can you imagine that, you see, and this is the perspective.

343
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:51,080
That's why there's so little talk about, you know, General Motors factory in the US in the Bible, you won't find that.

344
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,920
That's why there's so little talk about the lightbulb.

345
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,480
That's either there's no talk about Hammurabi's code in the Bible.

346
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,160
You see that?

347
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,400
I hope that puts it in perspective.

348
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:14,920
What's going on, it's very, very limited, because what we're what that biblical text is supposed to be, is a message related to us from the God of the gods.

349
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,080
Now, unlike men, who, you know, are divided, well, I don't believe in that.

350
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:29,160
Oh, let's mythology or folklore fiction, you know, and they're divided, then you have the, you know, the atheists or the agnostics or whatever.

351
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:38,760
And then you have the idiots and all the various religious cults that believe this and believe that, right, which is, again, you know, whatever, the gods don't have that.

352
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,960
The gods know that they exist.

353
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,760
And they know that we exist.

354
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,580
And they know that they have a God, they don't have that atheistic.

355
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,800
In other words, if they have it, it hasn't been demonstrated in any literary form or intentional form anywhere.

356
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,260
You see?

357
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,660
So these are like, just basic things.

358
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,300
And then, of course, the other basic thing you have to remember is when you're reading the text, there's archetypes there.

359
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:15,840
Like, you know, how one archetype would be, you know, we try to visualize things vertically, and the things that are important in the God's realm, it's lateral, right?

360
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,980
It's left and right, inner circle, outer circle, not up and down within their realm, right?

361
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,940
And they communicate that to us in a certain degree.

362
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:31,460
So if you want to communicate with them, and be within their, like, act like you're in their group, you don't say, I want to go up and down, you say, I want to go in and out.

363
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,500
But when you talk about men, you're like, oh, I want to go, I'll be a high society or low society, right?

364
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,720
So it's different.

365
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:48,700
The other thing is, there's many things about archetypes that use, meaning these are things that result or are important, that repeat themselves.

366
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,100
Like one thing is like cutting something in half.

367
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,040
You know, you remember the sacrifice that Abraham and Yahweh cut in half.

368
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,020
And this is a covenant that he made with Abraham.

369
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,740
And he's, and you know, the whole onus is on the Elohim on this one.

370
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,500
Abraham is just sitting back, he doesn't have to do anything, right?

371
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,420
At that point, because this is after he already, right, brought Isaac and all that.

372
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:23,120
So you notice the cutting in half, and the only one that walks between it is the Elohim, man doesn't go between it.

373
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,860
Now, remember Solomon, with the women dispute over the child, he says, give me a sword so I can cut it in half.

374
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:33,760
Right?

375
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,440
Because there is a, there's a covenant there that was, I mean, shady.

376
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,560
So you're trying to develop a covenant, you know, like one woman saying this, the other woman saying that.

377
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,440
And when the covenant is formed, that decides who gets the child, right?

378
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,080
And that ends up in a backing out, just like the descendants of Abraham backed out.

379
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,360
Anyway, so you have all these parallels, you have the archetype of water, right?

380
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,640
You know, Moses is put in a basket covered with pitch.

381
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,440
Noah covers the ark with pitch.

382
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,480
By the way, that was an ark that Moses was put in, the same word, right?

383
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:18,600
So you have the water metaphor, again, that, you know, these archetypes keep coming up and up and up, right?

384
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,240
The side, the cutting in half, the water, the fire.

385
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:31,420
These are things that keep repeating themselves, and they're very, very little subtle variations that show up every time.

386
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,350
Do you get what I'm saying?

387
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,650
So, and they're happening all the time, you know, everywhere.

388
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,930
In almost every story, there's a recurring archetype, or alludes to one.

389
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,590
You know, it has to do with many of these little archetypes that are within the text.

390
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:59,110
So the problem that I also see is, if you haven't, if you're not familiar with the text, it's very difficult to discuss it.

391
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:10,990
The biggest misgiving that you can consider with any body of work is that it has, if it's not oral, it's literal, it has to be considered literally first.

392
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:19,970
You see, most people, like, for example, the biblical text doesn't get the respect of any other literary text.

393
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:29,450
Like, if you're reading, whether it's work of fiction, or work science, or work of history, the minute someone approaches the biblical text, oh, this is a religious thing.

394
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,870
Oh, this is something very, very important.

395
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,930
Oh, this is something, I know how it ends up, I saw the movie.

396
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,170
Oh, this is something.

397
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,650
See, it's not being viewed objectively at all, still today.

398
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:53,290
And, of course, because of the cultish nature of who people look up to, they don't know what's in the text either, I assure you on that.

399
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:59,110
But they know that it's important that you never find out what's in it.

400
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,390
Do you see my point?

401
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,210
Right.

402
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:16,570
Like, if you go to court, if you're dealing with law people, any law people, whether it's the law enforcement, which is anyway, or the attorneys, or the judges, or the legislature people, they don't know their own laws.

403
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,090
But they know it's important that you never find out what the laws are either.

404
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:36,790
The only thing you need to know is what we tell you, they say, and what's on TV, and obviously, what they don't say is what's on TV, and what they told you in school, and church, and whatever in the newspaper, you know, that's all you need to know.

405
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:48,830
So they actually, like, for example, use the legal cult, for example, and that's the whole thing, the attorney general, the judges, the police, the university professors that teach law, none of them know any law.

406
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,970
That's an assurance.

407
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,670
They have the appearance of knowing it.

408
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,030
But they know it's important that you don't know.

409
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,350
Now, how do you find out what the laws are?

410
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,490
Well, they're memorialized.

411
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,810
Because guess what?

412
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,610
You ever notice when people talk about laws, they're not a problem until they're what?

413
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,110
Passed, right?

414
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,870
Like, is it like passing gas?

415
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,070
Yeah, it seems like that.

416
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,170
No, no, they have to have the body of work memorialized in print.

417
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:20,190
And it's acknowledged as being considered insignificant, and from this date on, it's applied.

418
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,010
What's applied?

419
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,430
The passing of the gas, or the passing of what's memorialized on paper?

420
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,030
How many times have you heard these people pass in legislative bodies, and they don't read it?

421
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,310
They tell you, we don't read it, we don't need to read it, because we're going to go by plausibility, you see.

422
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,410
I'm telling you, there's no one in the legal side that knows any law at all.

423
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:55,830
Now, obviously, if they're putting a case together, and they have to go and try to embezzle funds or harass someone, they're going to look up some things and put it in the case and gives the appearance of it.

424
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,650
You see, this is very different.

425
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,050
This is the same now.

426
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,890
Let's say I'm giving you a mindset here that applies throughout.

427
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,730
The same thing.

428
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:13,730
They know that for X amount of years, if we cut people open and do this, they'll heal, and we could predict the way we're doing it, tell them two or three weeks.

429
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,870
And it works out that way, but they don't know why or what they're doing regarding that.

430
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,310
They just know that it's a ritual.

431
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,890
It's a business.

432
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,530
It's whatever.

433
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,290
Now, the same thing goes with these.

434
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:37,850
When you look at the biblical text, I can't see any other body of work that so much ignorance and inference has been applied to, or inference of ignorance has been applied to.

435
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,450
And it's an extremely difficult thing to speak on.

436
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:54,030
And the thing that's even more difficult is to go out and see how no one else is putting this stuff together in very, very simple terms, so anyone can just grasp it if they're interested.

437
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,910
That's the real sad part.

438
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:08,710
So, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of other researchers and people have done stuff, but it's like, come on, can't you speak about it on a neutral and an objective point of view that actually makes it dynamic for the listener and the user of the information?

439
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,210
You know, I think you and I, Sam, have discussed this.

440
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:16,590
Plenty of people have done good research, and they go back to this Christian cult, or this other cult, or whatever.

441
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:26,050
And it's like, ah, why did, you know, how do I, I have to listen to it, because the next thing they might say might be worth something, you know?

442
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:33,210
So I've learned to abandon all that stuff and use all those points that I just made to you.

443
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:58,070
And just keep in the back of your mind that the planet right now is overrun by these cult-type societies, which are at the top of every aspect of what you see called civilization, whether it's engineering, science, education, religion, legal, medical, these are all cult groups that are running it.

444
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,810
So, you take it, take it or leave it, you know?

445
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,990
No, it's fine.

446
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,989
Things should be that way, should it not?

447
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,790
Well, at this point, yeah.

448
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:20,530
It's the pinnacle of the story line, you know, of the biblical narrative, you know?

449
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,320
I mean, why?

450
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,560
Because it's the end.

451
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,060
It doesn't peak somewhere and then go down.

452
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,880
Right before it goes down, it peaks.

453
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,739
That's the interesting, that's another thing that's never really been discussed.

454
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:46,420
You know, I have an arc in a story line, like usually around the middle, it comes to a peak and many things are revealed or whatever, and you can see how the dynamics of that arc in the story line are going to push the rest of the story, right?

455
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:54,500
The scriptural stuff is all to wrap up this degenerative situation that humanity's in.

456
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,840
That does make sense.

457
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:11,260
However, what you mentioned about the leprosy thing, where do you get that from, that it's not leprosy and that it's something else?

458
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,440
Because I don't see that explicitly.

459
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,940
Yeah, what's the word that's being used?

460
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,620
It's S-H-something, I remember the letters in that.

461
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,180
Start researching that.

462
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,400
I think it's S-A-R-A, S-A-R-A.

463
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,200
S-A-R-A, thank you.

464
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,740
Yeah, S-A-R-A.

465
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,380
But it's pronounced similar to that.

466
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:35,600
But look around and see how that term keeps popping up, where you say, wait a second, that can't be leprosy then.

467
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,060
Look at the descriptions of it.

468
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:47,020
When someone was healed of it, it didn't say they were missing body parts, right?

469
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,450
Or they were disfigured from it, you see?

470
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,970
So look at this.

471
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,750
It's a very interesting...

472
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,390
In other words, is it important?

473
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,390
No, it's not important.

474
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,930
But is it important to see how we've misplaced that term in our minds?

475
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,630
Yes, that's very important.

476
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,710
And also the emotion.

477
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:09,790
Go ahead.

478
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:34,950
You brought up an interesting thing there, the word, and that kind of ties me into my question before about what's a good way to learn the letters, the meanings of each and every letter, so that it can help others, or even myself, just to...

479
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,910
This, this, and this means this, and it gives you another perspective on that particular...

480
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:40,950
Okay.

481
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:41,630
Yeah.

482
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:50,450
Etymology, or the basically root meaning of each letter, not root part of a word, but the letters themselves.

483
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,070
Yes.

484
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,790
Let me just give you a thing before I tell you.

485
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,970
You're on your own with that.

486
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,770
You just do some research on what Hebrew letters mean.

487
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:09,130
Actually, the internet is actually pretty good, because it doesn't get much better than that outside of any other convention, university or otherwise, or in print.

488
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:17,130
The reason why is, when you look up anything called New Testament, you're going to be bombarded with Christian garbage, like it or not.

489
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:17,550
Yeah.

490
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,510
Like it or not.

491
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:27,430
Okay, when you look up Hebrew meaning of words, you're going to be bombarded with Talmudic garbage, like it or not.

492
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,630
You know, occult Kabbalistic stuff, like it or not.

493
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,710
Okay.

494
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,530
You get it?

495
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,430
Yeah.

496
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,570
So you're on your own.

497
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:42,050
So in other words, if you could do research on the New Testament and filter out all the Christian crap...

498
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,490
Right.

499
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:48,990
You'll be able to research anywhere on anything and filter out all the Kabbalistic crap, the mystical.

500
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:56,730
I'm really with you on that, after trying it many different times, and I...

501
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,670
Frustration is the best way I can do it.

502
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,010
Are you familiar with picking edible corn out of poop?

503
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,610
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,730
Okay, good.

505
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,410
You'll get it.

506
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,390
This is planet Earth.

507
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,090
Right.

508
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,410
You know what the term Kopra Faiyia is?

509
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,370
You don't want to do that.

510
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,070
Shit eaters.

511
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,570
Right.

512
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,970
So that's the best you're going to do on Earth right now.

513
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,370
I mean, look, and I always say this, there's still very pleasant things to do.

514
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,530
And if you can actually be around pleasant people, you're extremely fortunate.

515
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,690
I happen to be extremely fortunate in that way.

516
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:46,710
I hope you, whoever's listening is as well, because it doesn't be relevant if they're your relatives, parents, children, friends, neighbors, people are shit.

517
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,450
Right.

518
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,990
And if you don't like that, that's too bad.

519
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,690
That's the truth.

520
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,630
And you're not used to it.

521
00:38:52,550 --> 00:39:03,430
So on the other hand, if you are around people that are genuinely better than that, you are truly in a good situation, right?

522
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,710
Then you have the food, clothing, shelter.

523
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,870
And this time I brought up the people first is because you could have good food, good clothing, good shelter, and guess who's going to mess it up for you?

524
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,250
Other people.

525
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:25,230
Yeah, yeah, you know, there's two types of people in the world, those that want to be left alone and those who won't leave them alone, right?

526
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,990
So and then you've got the other class, which is the majority of people are emotional.

527
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:41,410
They are so much into the censorship and the victim to censorship, which is nothing they can do about it.

528
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,050
And yes, sort of.

529
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:53,670
And they're so unrehabilitated that it has everything has to have some emotion behind it.

530
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,370
It has to be emotionally based.

531
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,210
How I feel, how you make other people feel.

532
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,490
Oh, I like the way it feels.

533
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,150
Oh, you know what I mean?

534
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,610
The garbage.

535
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:10,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, plenty of now, not that emotions or emotions can be very good.

536
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:15,190
And actually, they're necessary for the spirit to to function with ease in the body.

537
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,470
But when it's all emotion, it's rubbish.

538
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:26,670
And that's all you get out there, by the way, and out there, meaning in all of these cult like institutions and on the rectangle, it's it's all emotionally based.

539
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,440
You get you look for information.

540
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,180
It's emotionally based, you know?

541
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,600
Yeah.

542
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:44,900
While working where I work, I get to see my great abundance of of that particular thing.

543
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,440
And thank goodness for showers.

544
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,600
Oh, yeah.

545
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,840
Yeah, it's it's all right.

546
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:05,900
The gods are going to take care of it, but they're going to do it within their their let's say their plan, their capabilities have to be used the way they decide to use them.

547
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,420
You know, the way they do them, the the the cleanup of civilization.

548
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,420
It is interesting to watch.

549
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,520
Oh, yeah, never, never a dull moment.

550
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:32,720
And the interesting thing about it, what makes the gods doing it so plausible is the level of brutality that's going to be put upon humanity will be accepted because most of it will appear to be of natural means.

551
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,830
So that's OK.

552
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,950
Sam, what else?

553
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,010
Do you want to you want to delve into anything else?

554
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,770
Have you woken up?

555
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,130
You know, we can pick up where we left off before.

556
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,050
So I think we stopped talking about this adversary.

557
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,050
We're in the middle of a discussion about that.

558
00:41:53,050 --> 00:42:04,370
And I think one of the thoughts that I had right before we ended was this the actual wording of how we refer to him.

559
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:16,390
So Satan, when you look at the history of that word sort of throughout the English language, which isn't that long, and you try to trace it to earlier terms that they would have used before to refer to that entity.

560
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:24,270
I'm finding that the word Titan pops up a lot and that there seems to be this kind of connection between Titans and the Satan, the Hebrew word Satan.

561
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,350
There's obviously phonetic similarities.

562
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,550
If you look at the fact that Titan at one point was called Teton.

563
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,730
And, you know, there's some books on that.

564
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,370
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.

565
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,690
But obviously, Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons is a pretty famous one.

566
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,150
It gets some things right.

567
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,310
It gets a few things wrong.

568
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,750
But I thought I might just quote shortly from it.

569
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:55,190
The learned reader has no need of examples in proof of this frequent Chaldean transformation of the sh or se into te.

570
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,050
For the common reader, the following may be adduced.

571
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:04,110
You have the Hebrew word shekel, to weigh, which becomes tekel in Chaldean.

572
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,470
The Hebrew word shebar, to break, becomes tebar in Chaldean.

573
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,950
The Hebrew word seraphim in Chaldean becomes teraphim, and so on and so forth.

574
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:18,830
The Teton was actually known by the classic nations of antiquity to be Satan, or the spirit of wickedness.

575
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,350
And he goes on with that.

576
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:35,750
And there's other writers, like Irenaeus, the church father, who says, though the name Teton was originally derived from Chaldean, it became thoroughly naturalized in the Greek language, which is interesting to see that the word Titan doesn't even come from Greek.

577
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,130
Well, let me just interject something.

578
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:50,010
When you look at the bullshit education system on any level, they tell you that the language and alphabet started where?

579
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,690
In Phoenicia, which is just a blanket area in the Levant, you know what I mean?

580
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,410
So where did the Greeks come from?

581
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,730
Well, in other words, before Egypt, who was the sister nationality to the Greeks, if not the origin of the Greeks?

582
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:07,430
Phoenicia.

583
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,300
Cyprus.

584
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,520
Yeah, so it's kind of like the Latin countries in Europe.

585
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,100
But you have the sea, let's just say.

586
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,380
Yeah, but here, let me interject something else for people to mention.

587
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,420
This is important.

588
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:32,840
Just like I mentioned, when you read the God of what they call the Bible, that is not just that.

589
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,600
That is the God of the gods.

590
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:50,320
So you have the gods commissioned as such, and they control the physical reality that we experience at this time, and previous times also, meaning older times, days of old.

591
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,960
And if you were to go into their realm and walk down the street like you would here in any society and say, do you guys have a god?

592
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,900
And they would say, yes.

593
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,820
Their god is the god that we're reading about.

594
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,340
Keep that in mind.

595
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:12,950
It's sort of a difficult thing for people to ingest, meaning to get in, not ingest, meaning to joke about.

596
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,310
But to keep that in mind.

597
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,870
That's why there's so little information.

598
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:24,810
The narrative is almost stripped of detail, even though there's still a lot of detail in it, because of that.

599
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,190
Now, I wouldn't say totally because of that.

600
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:33,730
Because we have this God of the gods going through the society of the gods, and then coming here with this information.

601
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,230
By agency.

602
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,390
Now, let me ask you, this is another thing that people have to keep in mind.

603
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:47,150
When you go on the Stupid Rectangle, or you talk to other people, they talk about Satanists.

604
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,510
That is totally, completely erroneous.

605
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,130
What most people on the internet are referring to as Satanism is not.

606
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:02,750
What they're referring to in reality, and you could dissect this on your own, is the revival.

607
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:12,010
When you read about all these Satanic cults, all they are really is revived ancient balls or deities from ancient cultures, like Egypt and so on.

608
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,970
That's not Satanism.

609
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:23,490
Because if you look at the narrative, this entire realm was given to Satan.

610
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:30,210
Why do you start off in Genesis always reading, or throughout scripture, that man is in a really piss poor state?

611
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,070
Who would create something and deliberately put it in a piss poor state?

612
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,690
No, that's not what's going on.

613
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:53,790
What's going on is that there is a creation, and there is a deliberate handing over of consent and power and control to this adversary to do almost like I'm suggesting here, presumptually like in the book of Job.

614
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,210
He says, go do whatever to him, just don't kill him.

615
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:58,190
Right?

616
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,910
Kind of a parallel to that.

617
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,670
So don't take it personally, folks.

618
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:11,470
What's going on here is this adversary is following marching orders from his God, the Most High, or the God of Gods.

619
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,270
And this is his time period to do what he does.

620
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:24,830
By the way, is he given that authority prior to Genesis 2, or is it after when the fall comes that he takes over?

621
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,690
Because that's never...

622
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,290
Well, it's...

623
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,850
No, it is and it isn't.

624
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,450
It seems to be oscillating back and forth.

625
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:40,650
It seems to be just like a play where you have several acts, and there is the curtain drawn in between, and you have another, you know, and then it opens and there's a new act.

626
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,810
It seems to be done in a series of acts, if that makes sense.

627
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,610
Yeah, I guess.

628
00:47:47,110 --> 00:48:02,410
I mean, I think you could somewhat conclusively say that he's in the picture by Genesis 1, 2, because they're in the garden, and the garden seems to have something to do with the Nakash as far as him having authority there.

629
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,450
Well, having authority and he...

630
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:11,610
We don't know if he was brought there, right, or sent there, or just happened to be there and commissioned.

631
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,450
Or, you know, I don't...

632
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,890
I'm not going to say this is by chance.

633
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,830
It's all by design, I'm going to say.

634
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,790
I'll venture to say that, even though it doesn't say I designed this for it to happen, but you do see that.

635
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:27,630
He's in...

636
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:36,210
The God of the gods, that we read about as the God of the Bible, seems to have, be in control of all things.

637
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,270
So, yeah, it's just, you know, here's the interesting thing that's very difficult.

638
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,070
Let me just interject this, and you heard me say it a lot of times, and it sounds futile.

639
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:56,670
Once you start to get a firm grip on anything, whether it's law, the Bible, health, how things work, real science, you know, real observation of nature, you know what I tell people?

640
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,310
I said, okay, good, you're getting a grasp.

641
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,970
Now, who are you going to go talk to about this?

642
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:01,530
Huh?

643
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,550
Can you tell me?

644
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,510
Who are you going to go tell this to?

645
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:06,770
Some moron?

646
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,070
You're on your own.

647
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,500
Yeah, tell it to yourself.

648
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,440
I mean, it's for your own sake that you don't...

649
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,340
No, it's a rhetorical question.

650
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,000
There's no answer.

651
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,620
There's no direct answer to it, because, obviously, you could already have established...

652
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,700
You know, the easiest thing is, for example, if you have children, and you're homeschooling them, well, you can...

653
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,760
You know, but then you put them in that same position, right?

654
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,760
They're going to go out in the world and talk to who?

655
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,300
Who are they going to talk to?

656
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,480
Huh?

657
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,440
Can you answer that?

658
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,540
No, you can't, because it's just a condition.

659
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,060
And the reason I brought that up, because it interjects exactly with what we're discussing with the adversary.

660
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,740
You know, these idiots on this planet going around saying, oh, these guys are Satanists.

661
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,600
Oh, really?

662
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,480
So Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism is not?

663
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,920
All of your colleges are not?

664
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,300
All of your governments are not?

665
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,420
Is that what you're trying to say?

666
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:03,740
Idiot?

667
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,240
This whole thing is under his auspices, right?

668
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,100
So I'm playing the devil's advocate, no pun intended.

669
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,360
It ain't that bad, is it?

670
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,880
Is it?

671
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,520
Or it is?

672
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,780
Think about it for a minute.

673
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,070
Well, you could still go out and take a windy walk in a rose garden.

674
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,950
You could still get good food if you really, really try.

675
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,150
By the way, I'll just interject something.

676
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,590
I was in a conversation with someone yesterday about acquiring food.

677
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,450
So you ever notice when you go into a conventional store, there's no smell or it doesn't smell good?

678
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:43,590
But when you go into like what they call organic or markets, whatever, there's a beautiful fragrance in the air.

679
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,450
You know, you ever notice that?

680
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,150
When you go into a health food store, it smells good.

681
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:55,630
And when you go into like a conventional, you know, I call white people market in America, if you go in the Midwest or anywhere like that, you know, there's no life there.

682
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,410
But it's still not that you could still make best choices.

683
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,310
So this is, I've given the analogy before with Ocelli.

684
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:05,050
Like I was traveling on the road for weeks at a time.

685
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:10,310
And, you know, on the road food, you get, you know, in America, it's terrible roadside food.

686
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,450
You got to make, you know, the big fast food chain.

687
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,790
So it's like McDonald's, McDonald's or McDonald's or McDonald's, right?

688
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:19,330
Well, you go in there and you try to make the best choice.

689
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,070
You know, I'll get some French fries and apple pie and a coffee maybe, right?

690
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,250
You don't go, oh, it's McDonald's.

691
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,250
I have to eat a Big Mac or a cheeseburger or something, you know, no.

692
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,670
Maybe I'll get a fish sandwich or something.

693
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,390
So no matter what situation you're put in, you could always make the best choice.

694
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,590
And sometimes the best choice is the way you behave.

695
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:39,550
So.

696
00:51:42,070 --> 00:52:05,170
Pertaining to what you said about the Most High God, I think it's worth pointing out, that perhaps, well, not perhaps, but most likely why there's such an antagonism or disaffection for most people when it comes to understanding his place in the hierarchy, as far as being the God of the gods, is because he really doesn't seem to make any concrete appearances in the text itself.

697
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,430
He's always using a proxy.

698
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:13,650
So you can say that, well, he's creating a family and he's doing this, that and the third, but he really doesn't show up at all.

699
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:14,590
Why should he?

700
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,270
Why should he?

701
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:16,750
He's smart.

702
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,390
Look at it.

703
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,010
Look at everything.

704
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:31,130
You ever read about the things, there's certain rituals in scripture regarding the law and the priesthood that, you know, if a garment touches a piece of, you know, dead flesh, doesn't matter what it is, is that garment clean or unclean?

705
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,450
It's unclean, right?

706
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,710
So this is beyond, he's very, he's very smart and he's very specific.

707
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,750
And he sees things that the other gods don't see, by the way.

708
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,520
Right.

709
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,180
So there's archetypes there.

710
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,320
When you say that, did he see the division in the higher realm then?

711
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,540
So, okay, so that...

713
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,220
The gods are, okay, the world of the gods is in a mess.

714
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,660
Simple.

715
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,760
You want to make it rhetorical?

716
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,360
Don't ask me how and why.

717
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,740
I'm just saying it rhetorical.

718
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,580
The heavenly realm, where all the gods are, is a total mess.

719
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,740
And they have a god that they look up to for order and design and power.

720
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,100
And that god that they look up to is the one that we're reading about in what they call the Bible.

721
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,400
And, but you can't mix this with the stupidity that's in the world again.

722
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,620
I mean, like, for example, you go to Christianity.

723
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,020
Oh, yeah, we got this rebellious son.

724
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,580
He's a total rebel.

725
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,800
And he comes over here and he says all of his father's laws are undone.

726
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,380
And, you know, but he's like his father, you know, schizophrenic, you know, son.

727
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:52,900
You know, if you listen to the religions of the world, especially Christianity, this J-E-S-U-S guy, you know, you got to lock him up, shoot him up with some Prozac because he's insane.

728
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
He's schizophrenic, you know?

729
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:54,760
Yeah.

730
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,960
So, I mean, this is what's being put in front of you.

731
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,560
The opposite.

732
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:09,380
I think I've talked about any situation in any condition of any field that man engages in is just absurd at this point, right?

733
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,220
You want to look at psychiatry, medicine, legal, science.

734
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,860
It's just absurd across the board.

735
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,080
So, why wouldn't your religious doctrines be absurd?

736
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,100
You see, so it's normal to be absurd.

737
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,040
So, again, of course he's going to do this all by proxy.

738
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:38,540
That's why, for example, when you read about the biblical Christ, which has nothing to do with the Christian and their 20,000 denominations or anything like that.

739
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,120
He came and he did everything in secret.

740
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,760
As a matter of fact, his identity is still secret today.

741
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,480
Everything about him is still a secret today.

742
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:56,020
But as time goes on, a certain group of people, which his physical stock came from, will be more and more interested in it.

743
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,460
And they're the ones that are holders of better records, you see?

744
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:05,680
And you will actually learn more about the biblical characters from the people of that lineage.

745
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:19,560
So, and you're only going to learn enough that when the kill shots come, you have enough that the kill shots are lawful, because they're not going to do the kill shots now, because no one knows anything.

746
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:26,620
So, later on, the gods don't want to say, well, look, you know, all these sniveling humans will say, we didn't know what was going on.

747
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,680
We were lied to by the attorneys, the doctors, the preachers, the professors.

748
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,760
They lied to us.

749
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,220
You know, so why did you come and take us out?

750
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,820
We were right there.

751
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,100
We had a chance to do it.

752
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,840
No, no, no, no, no.

753
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,720
They don't want to hear that.

754
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:52,280
So you're going to get enough correct and true information that when they do clean this situation up, and after the resurrection, no one will be able to say, well, we didn't have a chance.

755
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,860
You see how simple this is?

756
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:02,720
They have a last minute chance with getting better corn out of the poop.

757
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,440
Well, you're going to get enough corn, so you could say you didn't go hungry, right?

758
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,940
But some of it's actually going to be very fresh as well.

759
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,640
The analogy is like someone on death row.

760
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,760
If you go on death row anywhere in the world, and you ask everyone there, why are they there?

761
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,600
They'll tell you why.

762
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:28,540
But if you run into someone, and they don't know why they're on death row, they're going to take them off and run them through court all over again, and they have to acknowledge everything all along the way.

763
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,700
That's why when you go to anything lawful or legal, you have to acknowledge it.

764
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,280
You ever see some contracts where they make you initial on each page that you read it?

765
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:36,960
Oh, yeah.

766
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,060
So later on, you can't argue and say, well, I didn't read that page.

767
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,460
See?

768
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,160
So yeah, this is a very short thing.

769
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:52,160
All you have to know is certain key aspects of what, you know, certain lawful aspects of the gods, and that's it.

770
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:59,980
And all you really have to acknowledge is what you've been told that came before you actually really happened.

771
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,240
That's all.

772
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,900
And then you're actually, now it's time then after to, the mouth poop crew can come in.

773
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:18,100
So is there any of that information that exists out here now that it's so, what you're saying is it's just buried with so much poop.

774
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,820
But the truth is...

775
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,460
No, no, it exists.

776
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:28,080
You could, here, just pick up the King Jimmy or NIV or anything, and ask yourself, read an underbridged version.

777
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,400
They tell you everything that they're going to do to you in your mind in the introduction, right?

778
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,080
And then you're going to say, okay, this is no good.

779
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,480
So I better go find where they got it from.

780
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,780
And now it's easily accessible because of the electronic convention.

781
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:42,940
Very simple.

782
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,460
Look, let me give you another metaphor.

783
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:52,200
How many people are being arrested right now every minute or every hour for drug possession in the US?

784
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,140
It could be 5, 10 already since we brought it up.

785
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,180
How many people are sitting in jail?

786
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,980
Do you know that, and when you ask them, why am I being arrested or thrown in prison?

787
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,020
Because it's a criminal act, right?

788
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,640
To possess, you know, 20 tons of heroin or joint, anything in between, right?

789
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:09,880
Right.

790
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,140
It's a criminal act.

791
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,920
Well, haven't I given the code and the public law that shows that that's been decriminalized?

792
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,860
Yes, you have.

793
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,880
It's only civil now?

794
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,420
Yeah.

795
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,620
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,920
Okay, so...

797
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,340
I'm going to hold up.

798
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,240
Do you think, go ahead.

799
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:30,420
What exactly is the thing in that law, Public Law 98-473?

800
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,320
Is it that Section 1 is declassified because that offers up all the definitions?

801
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,280
So that's gone, or is it because the...

802
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:45,000
No, US, what it did was it repealed Title 184201, which is criminal...

803
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,620
No, what it did was it repealed criminal procedures.

804
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,480
And those criminal...

805
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,000
Hold on.

806
00:58:53,700 --> 00:59:00,960
Those criminal procedures were applied to various titles, and one of them being Title 21, which is food, drugs, and narcotics.

807
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,480
But Title...

808
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,620
The repealed 4201 deals with the probation office.

809
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,460
It deals with Title 18 crimes and prosecution, yes.

810
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,340
No, but I mean, specifically, it's the...

811
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,220
That's the probation office, though.

812
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,240
Like the procedure for how to get somebody that's in jail on probation.

813
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,440
Right, right.

814
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,060
So if that's repealed, what does that have to do with food and drugs?

815
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,660
Because if you go read the public law, I gave the website on that, it applies to all of those other titles below it.

816
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,060
Scroll down.

817
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:38,980
And what is...

818
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,400
How do you...

819
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,120
If it repeals...

820
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,940
What is probation?

821
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,100
Probative...

822
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,420
Prohibitive activities, based on what?

823
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,620
There's no probation...

824
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,600
It's to prohibit.

825
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,020
You engage in prohibitive activities, it's criminal.

826
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,980
That's all been repealed.

827
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,680
Go read...

828
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,860
You see, it's very interesting.

829
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:09,260
You know, what's interesting with the link that I've dropped in before, it's the government publishing office, and their motto is informing America, right?

830
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,020
Go read...

831
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,580
Go read that it's the decriminalization of that.

832
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,540
It's the repealing of that.

833
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,690
Yeah, I'll just go read it again, because when I look at it...

834
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,690
You know, you guys called it 24, right?

835
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,690
Title 24?

836
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,710
No, no, 18.

837
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:32,010
Yeah, in other words, that has to do with prosecution and criminal acts.

838
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,330
And it applies to all those other titles as well.

839
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,090
Go ahead.

840
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:44,110
So there's a bunch of sections that have been repealed, and section one is one of them, and then section 4201 up to 4218.

841
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,370
Section one of title 18.

842
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,530
But what you're talking about is 4201 to 4218.

843
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,250
What I'm talking about is title 21.

844
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:01,390
There are various titles underneath that have also been repealed, according to that being repealed.

845
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,030
Okay.

846
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,170
Title 21 has to do with food, drugs, and narcotics.

847
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,950
And there's many other things in there too.

848
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,710
There's title 18 stuff.

849
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,550
There's title 30 stuff.

850
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,730
I mean, it goes all the way down through.

851
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:17,810
So what I'm trying to say here is they're going to give you the information, but is it clear?

852
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,350
Obviously not too clear, is it?

853
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,270
Because you have to go into the definition side of it, right?

854
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:24,710
Right.

855
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,970
And that's what we're talking about tonight.

856
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:27,590
You're trying to...

857
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,570
I think what you're...

858
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:32,850
The last time we spoke also, what we're speaking about tonight, is trying to define who this adversary is.

859
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,130
And that's a good thing.

860
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:42,670
I like that when we get into discussions about defining things, because you can't really use it unless it's defined.

861
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:46,890
Yeah.

862
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,110
Let's put the title, whatever it is.

863
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,250
I'll look into that again, because I had some trouble.

864
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:51,850
No, no, you should.

865
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:52,190
You should.

866
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:58,350
Did you ever pick up the link that I dropped in from the GPO, Government Publics, the Government Printing Office?

867
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:00,550
Yeah, I went to that site.

868
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,530
I looked through that stuff.

869
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:02,250
Yeah, that's right.

870
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,430
They do it very clearly.

871
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:08,190
I mean, it's not very clear, but they list all the titles that it affects underneath it.

872
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,740
But I was just trying to find a specific line that references that, or says that.

873
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,020
I dropped it into Skype.

874
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,240
Go ahead and find a specific line.

875
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,680
You know the concept of something being holographic, right?

876
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:35,200
If you put it in one specific line in scripture, for example, bounce back to that, all you have to do is redact that line, and you lost all the information.

877
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:43,180
But if you don't make it specific, and you put it throughout the entire context, you see it keeps showing up again, you see?

878
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,860
So the idea is that Title 18 is partly repealed, and that repeals Title 21.

879
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,860
The criminality of it.

880
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,460
Yeah, you could still be prosecuted civilly, though.

881
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,680
But civil prosecution is different.

882
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,820
Civil prosecution would be like a neighbor's dog bites you.

883
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,500
You go to the neighbor, and he doesn't want to do anything to make it right.

884
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,260
Now that's a civil action.

885
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,900
You don't go to jail for that, you know?

886
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,260
So the entirety of 21 is repealed?

887
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
You're dealing with out there.

888
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,860
All right, so let's say someone has a boat, and they're going from South America to the US, and it's full of white powder.

889
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,980
And here come the authorities, and they stop it.

890
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,980
And they're going to charge you with criminal.

891
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,380
No, no, no, no, it's civil.

892
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,960
So the people that stop them have to put a civil case.

893
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,520
Well, I'm upset.

894
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,960
You've done, you know, the Coast Guard official has to say, well, I got mental damage because he had this white powder.

895
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,480
So he has to go to, you see, it doesn't make any sense now.

896
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,140
The whole thing shows you what's going on.

897
01:03:47,140 --> 01:04:03,400
You see, what they're actually doing, when it comes to narcotics and drugs, and all the other codes that you'll see there, is they're using libel, and admiralty, and seizure laws that have been in place for thousands of years, or really codified since the 1500s, you see?

898
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,600
So they'll probably take every, see, let me give you an example.

899
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,240
And you'll find this in older court cases.

900
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,660
When any authority or someone else comes and takes your stuff, right, what makes it your stuff?

901
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,860
Well, it's in your possession.

902
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,920
That's under admiralty.

903
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,900
The taking of stuff is admiralty.

904
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:25,340
Like, it could be, or maritime if it's in the ocean.

905
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,320
Like it or not.

906
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,280
Now, I don't like to get into that too much because it's been muddied up.

907
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:36,380
You know, when you go online, all these patriots, you know, we gotta, you know, restore the republic.

908
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,420
Really, if the republic was so good, why did you end up being a democracy?

909
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,520
You see, none of that stuff is worthwhile.

910
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,120
But the point here is very simple.

911
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:56,740
Everything is so muddied up right now that you just go along with it, you know, waste your time because you are gonna just, you take up your time until you don't have any more left.

912
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,260
Or figure out what's really going on and learn to set yourself apart from it.

913
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,740
And maybe figure out what the right thing to do is on the way.

914
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,500
Because let me just go back to one more thing.

915
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,800
This is what, this is the cult mentality that's really screwed humanity.

916
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,940
And there are various cults, like I mentioned earlier, every aspect of society.

917
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:25,260
When it comes to lawfulness or law, the concept of law, meaning morality, what you do and how you act, that comes from your God.

918
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,600
Your, I didn't say God, did I?

919
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,220
So, your God.

920
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:35,720
Yeah.

921
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,120
That's fine.

922
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,800
Let's get back to the Satan stuff.

923
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:48,160
So, just to quickly quote from Hislop again, because he has another interesting thing here.

924
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:55,540
Teton is just a Chaldean form of Shaitan, the very name by which the Satan has been called by time immemorial by devil worshippers in Kurdistan.

925
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,900
Which is also interesting, because you look into the Yazidi religion and they actually do worship the devil.

926
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:04,340
But they try to fudge with that and say, no, they don't, but they actually do.

927
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,500
The history of the Teton and his brethren is given by...

928
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,820
Go back under the Yazidis, the ones that worship the peacock.

929
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,900
Is that what you're talking about?

930
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,160
Yeah.

931
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,880
And they know that they're referring to that as Satan, a form of Satan.

932
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:25,320
But then when you try to talk to them about it, I just think it's funny that these try to fudge or try to divert the conversation.

933
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,280
Right.

934
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,920
But yeah, he's meant to represent Satan to them.

935
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:33,660
The history of Teton and his brethren as given by Homer and Hesiod.

936
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:40,420
Homer says that all of the gods of Tartarus were called Tetons in his Iliad book.

937
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,660
And Hesiod tells us that these Tetons have their dwelling in Tartarus also.

938
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,340
As in future tense.

939
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:56,460
Yeah, but they're equating the Tetons with the Satan in this case.

940
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:03,180
It's plausible, but it's rhetorically very different than the scriptural text.

941
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,820
But should it be denied?

942
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:05,380
No.

943
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,460
Should it be considered?

944
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,040
Yes.

945
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:21,760
How well or not it meshes with the biblical text, I would just say that the universal being that manages and controls and affects everything that we've ever come in touch with is this being, the adversary.

946
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,640
With intervention, of course.

947
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,100
There's a form of policing that is done also.

948
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,980
You ever heard of people have a guardian angel or they were saved from something that was malicious?

949
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,420
So there's an intertwining here of that.

950
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:39,500
Right.

951
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:45,800
And I'm just trying to point to that intertwining, not to say that there's a one-to-one ratio of correlation between the Titans and the Satan.

952
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,240
They're obviously different things.

953
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,100
Oh, yeah, there's many of them.

954
01:07:50,220 --> 01:08:00,460
I would suggest to go back and consider that all the national borders were defined by these entities known of the sons of gods or the gods in basic form.

955
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,800
Basic form meaning from that society, right?

956
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:10,600
Not their god, not the most high god, but under their direction, under his direction.

957
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,780
I mean, yeah.

958
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:25,819
Also, interestingly, when you look at Etsy online, if you Google Titan for Etsy online, it says the name is perhaps from Tito, sun or day as in S-U-N, which probably is a loan word from a language of Asia minor.

959
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,060
So that sort of hammers to that point a bit.

960
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,500
So here we see that the word Titan could have originally been a way of designating the sun god.

961
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,560
Whoever the sun god is, he's obviously a key character in the spiritual hierarchy someplace.

962
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:52,020
Most major religions worship him in some form and there's a book called Christian Iconography by Adolf Hitler, which describes three different 10th century statues of Satan with a nimbus around his head.

963
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:56,680
So apparently that was an emphasis at one point in time that you could equate Satan with the sun god.

964
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:03,520
Though I wouldn't say that they're the same entity, but we don't really get much exposition about the sun.

965
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,500
No, there's a mixture.

966
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,819
There's a lot of mixing there.

967
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:13,819
There's a film, I forgot what it's called, the first lie Satan propagated was that he doesn't exist.

968
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:23,140
So I would suggest that's an interesting thing to lean on because true power is never really known.

969
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:31,779
And this is a dichotomy statement, meaning the true power on this planet is the adversary to mankind and the natural world.

970
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,939
And then there are other forces because there are other gods.

971
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,800
There are gods that come and bring sickness.

972
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,000
There are gods that bring death.

973
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,760
They each have their specific purpose.

974
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:47,319
But then you have the most high god that is allowing all of this by design of some kind that we are not given.

975
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:50,000
And it's fine.

976
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,660
It doesn't mean that because we don't know exactly, we shouldn't discuss it.

977
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:03,340
But I think that we know enough to lead what we can consider a more proper life.

978
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,680
And there's nothing wrong with waking up every day crying that you're on this planet.

979
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,540
Because that's actually a thing in scripture.

980
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,680
Also, not that you wake up every day crying that you're here.

981
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,160
But you know what I mean?

982
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:28,300
You and everyone you've ever heard of has been born, raised, and died in a battle zone, a spiritual battle zone.

983
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,720
So get over it.

984
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,080
And of course, there's the aspect of maturity.

985
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:45,940
Obviously, man is still, man as a whole, meaning woman also, is in an immature state spiritually.

986
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:54,120
But there are still people out there, believe it or not, in the world that have a woe-is-me attitude because of what's going on in their head.

987
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,100
And one of the first things that I did with Ocelli was called external input.

988
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:11,680
And I gave maybe a half a dozen examples on how if you're, let's say, out in the park or the beach and someone's playing jazz, on a radio, do you expect to open that radio and find a little jazz band in there?

989
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:18,840
Or are you going to see a whole bunch of circuitry that doesn't make any sense when you reference it directly to what you're hearing as being jazz music?

990
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,080
It would be the latter.

991
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:31,580
If you crack someone's head open or an animal that has a personality or anything, all you're going to see is all this quote unquote gray matter, right?

992
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:36,200
Because you're receiving and transmitting all external input.

993
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:41,040
And there's still people out there, believe it or not, they could listen to Greek-speak for the rest of their lives.

994
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:49,020
If I started speaking in 1940, which I wasn't around by, they'd still be thinking, woe-is-me because of what's going on in my P-brain.

995
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,200
That's part of the censorship.

996
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,260
They can't grasp.

997
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:02,120
Wilhelm Reich talked about the emotional armoring, that everything is coming from somewhere else and going to somewhere else, out.

998
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,060
There's nothing in you.

999
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,780
And that's another thing of the bad doctrine.

1000
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,500
And the New Agers love it.

1001
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:16,140
By the way, if you want to know something is really dumb, listen to the New Agers.

1002
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,540
They borrow a lot of stuff from Christian doctrine.

1003
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,540
You know, God is within you and all this other stuff that's not in the text.

1004
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,840
That's very bad translation.

1005
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,140
So, there's nothing in you.

1006
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,660
It's all receiving and broadcasting.

1007
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,940
That's very interesting.

1008
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,880
When it comes to the subject of, say, possession, we can perhaps get into that later.

1009
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,040
The vessel.

1010
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,860
It's very simple.

1011
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,000
Let's just say it real quick.

1012
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,740
Most people are spiritually oppressed.

1013
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,380
It's very rare to be spiritually possessed.

1014
01:12:52,020 --> 01:13:03,460
When a being possesses someone, what they do is they take over the metabolism and the body, which means the voice and everything else, and they put in dormancy the spirit.

1015
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,640
They just turn it off.

1016
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,920
So, when someone comes out of being possessed, they don't remember anything.

1017
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,980
It's just as if they were churned off, like a fuse went off.

1018
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,880
You know, when a fuse breaker goes off or something, everything that it was powering is off.

1019
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,240
So, basically what happens is they throw the switch on your spirit.

1020
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:29,020
Your spirit goes into complete unconsciousness, and then they hit another switch in real time.

1021
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,680
You might pass out and come to with the other spirit now animating you.

1022
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,520
Right.

1023
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:43,500
I mean, since we're on this point of intersection, we might as well look at how these two different things interact with Satan on one hand, and then this possession thing.

1024
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:51,160
So, you've stated multiple times that Satan will possess a certain human being for the first time in the form of the Antichrist.

1025
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,780
Hold on.

1026
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,520
Let me just interject.

1027
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,720
He's about 20 years old right now.

1028
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,340
So, go ahead.

1029
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:11,600
I don't know if that's accurate at all, because, I mean, in Luke 22, we clearly see a statement to the effect that Satan possesses Judas, yet Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, being of the number of the 12.

1030
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,760
And then he goes and talks to the chief priests and so on.

1031
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:20,480
So, are we saying that Judas was unconscious during this, if it was a possession as it says?

1032
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,600
I'm just giving as a rudimentary functional perspective.

1033
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,720
No, in other words, I'm giving them the mechanism.

1034
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:38,020
It can happen so fast that someone observing this will not see any unconsciousness, but the being that's being possessed is not conscious of it.

1035
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:38,320
No.

1036
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:39,560
Right.

1037
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,200
So, then Judas is unconscious as he goes and talks to the chief priests.

1038
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:50,740
Well, he had to be, because otherwise it would be both Satan and Judas together, both spirits in one body.

1039
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:54,610
That's an interesting thing.

1040
01:14:54,750 --> 01:15:03,790
I mean, I don't see any part of the text where he kind of has any sort of self-reflection over what he's doing as if, well, I don't remember doing that.

1041
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:08,970
It's, we're not really giving any insight into what his personal thoughts are.

1042
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:25,230
Isn't it interesting how the entire biblical narrative, the entire thing is like that, where we find from our own human current perspective to lack the detail that we might think about as being important, lacking in the narrative.

1043
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,610
And I'm telling you, there's several reasons for it being lacking.

1044
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,750
And one of them was, it's a message coming from the gods of the gods.

1045
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:40,750
And the other thing is, it's also we have a lot of social declinations that we're experiencing now.

1046
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:55,070
A lot of the things that are what we consider to be normal, that we want to know now, are actually quite abnormal back then, or things that are not known anymore.

1047
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,950
And for good reason, believe it or not.

1048
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:01,810
Yeah.

1049
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:18,170
But this possession, what's interesting about this Antichrist, or instead of Christ figure, is it seems to be perpetual after a certain time, you know, that when he gets possessed by, he remains in him, right?

1050
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:23,310
That's why, you know, it states that Satan is also thrown in the lake of fire.

1051
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,150
You see, because he's still there with the Antichrist.

1052
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:27,990
Hmm.

1053
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:38,290
So there's an interesting point on all this, regarding the psyche, which is the spirit.

1054
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,830
And how do you say it?

1055
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,710
You know, you know, the concept of biogenesis, life makes more life, you know, right?

1056
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,510
You can't make life out of inorganic soup.

1057
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:59,990
So the interesting thing of the mechanisms of the spirit, no matter how high up you go in the technological sense, also, let me give you an example.

1058
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:12,650
If you're in a room right now with like, what they call Black Ops Lab, you know, a mile underground, and these guys get all the black budget funding, and they want to be able to take a spirit and play with it, you know, using, they're not going to use technology.

1059
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:21,950
They're going to pull out a bunch of manuals and grimoires and things that are written on human skin, or parchment, or whatever that are centuries old.

1060
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:24,250
I'm serious, even today.

1061
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:33,710
Because you work with the spirit, the spirit is controlled by the spirit, just like life is controlled by life, or generated by life.

1062
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:42,710
So don't believe that they're going to take someone's mind or spirit and put it in a machine, or take a machine and make it a spirit, unless a spirit wants to go into it, right?

1063
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,690
Let me give you another example.

1064
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,770
This is around the topic, it's sort of like bouncing around, maybe sounds like trivia.

1065
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:55,410
There was a guy a while back, I heard of this before it got on The Rectangle, it got on The Rectangle for a little while.

1066
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:59,310
He was a consultant to a pharmaceutical company, one of these big ones on the East Coast.

1067
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:07,550
And he walked in one day real early in the morning, it was before dawn or so, and to get some start on some work.

1068
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:22,850
And he noticed a light in one of the rooms, it might've been another floor or the same floor, and he went in there and he found all the high, you know, the high level people of the company doing like one of these dark magical seance type things, to evoke power.

1069
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,670
No, I'm serious.

1070
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:25,310
Yeah, yeah.

1071
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,450
Why would they be doing that?

1072
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:27,070
Yeah, why?

1073
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:34,570
Because, you know, there's a very deep attachment to quote unquote pharmaceuticals and the spiritual reality, right?

1074
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,990
And vice versa.

1075
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,630
So, and it's right in front of everyone, they just don't see it.

1076
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:44,990
And there's also references in biblical text about it, directly and indirectly.

1077
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:55,270
So, I would suggest that matters of the spirit are controlled by the spirit and of the spirit, you see.

1078
01:18:56,530 --> 01:19:03,030
And good science in that realm, it will never be done in the current society because of that.

1079
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:18,370
A perfect example is go to any psychologist or shrink, or psychologist or psychiatrist, and, you know, initialize the conversation, say, oh, so you're a spiritualist, you know, once they claim the profession.

1080
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,770
They'll look at you and they're like, I don't know what that means.

1081
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:21,630
I don't know what you're saying.

1082
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:25,330
They don't even know what their own, the label of their own profession means.

1083
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:27,530
Do you think you're going to get anything beyond that?

1084
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:28,410
Oh my.

1085
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:32,110
Do you know what one of the, because that's what psyche means, spirit.

1086
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:42,770
Do you know that the, I think Freud, what a joker, talk about bizarre individual, just like most of them are, if you look at what they put in front of you.

1087
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:55,750
When he was making his trip to the states to lecture on psychology, you know, one of the informal comments he made to people is we're going to America to bring this plague known as psychotherapy to them.

1088
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:06,410
That's how naive, I mean, that's why, you know, if you've got great ideas, you'll find yourself wrestling a counter current in this society.

1089
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:16,450
It doesn't matter if it's your own family, neighbor or the institutions, you know, like let's say you can figure out how to do magnetic and copper windings, you turn the motor on and it just keeps running, doesn't turn off.

1090
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,470
That's a great thing, is it?

1091
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:23,250
No, you're in a world of hurt now, because it goes contrary to what everyone believes and thinks how things should be.

1092
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:32,190
But if you try to figure out something that'll cheat people, embezzle from people and hurt them, oh yeah, a lot of doors will open for you right away.

1093
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:48,350
You know, Greek, I was just wondering here, it seems that we're coming up about an hour and a half, if we wouldn't mind taking a little pause, get ourself a beverage or so, give the throat a rest and let's see.

1094
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,450
Five minutes or so.

1095
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,350
Yeah, we'll come back at about 10 o'clock at my time here.

1096
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,290
Okay, perfect, thanks.

1097
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:55,290
Alrighty.

1098
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,970
See you in a bit.

1099
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:56,930
See you guys in a bit.

1100
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:57,870
Bye-bye.

1101
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,210
Okay, bye.
