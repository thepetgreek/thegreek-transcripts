1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,880
Okay, so let's see.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,660
Do you have Sam's contact?

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,220
Drag him back in or just go on.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,200
I think he was still hooked.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,800
Oh no, he is parted.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,220
Okay.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,160
Let's see if we can get him in here.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,420
Let me bring him in.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,300
Yeah, I just tried dragging him in.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,220
I had a request from someone who wanted to call in and I mentioned Skype.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,060
Oh my, I don't have Sam in my contact.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,520
Oh, there he is.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:41,860
Okay.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,500
Got him?

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:42,980
Alrighty.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,940
Hey Sam.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,660
Hello.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,420
So you had somebody in your contacts you say are Greek?

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,080
No, no.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,020
I had a few people message that, actually one specifically a while back that wanted to call in.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,440
Here's the interesting commentary on that also.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,480
Most people have smart phones and if you have one, you can always download Skype and use that.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,420
Now we have no preference for it.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,340
You know, here's the interesting thing.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:27,940
How many times do you hear about all these people complaining about the establishment and yet they pride themselves through their social media?

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,180
You know, you ever notice that?

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,700
Oh yeah.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:43,940
Yeah, they'll get me on Twitter or Fecesbook or whatever, you know, and these are the people that are against talking New World Order, all this crap how, you know, we're being subjugated somehow.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,000
Right, right.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,340
You know, yeah, talk about morons, right?

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,660
I mean, anyway.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,500
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,560
So who are you going to call in?

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,420
I ought to consider setting up on this end and get a telephone number hooked on Skype.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,440
It isn't that costly.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,220
Very simple to do.

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,740
Yeah, someone wanted to call in and join us, Sam, but they haven't.

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,700
So it's not much of an effort there because I'm presuming that person has a smart phone.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
See, I don't have a smart phone.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,940
I had one for a short time and I realized it was too subjective.

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,000
Like you can't use it without being subject to a certain mindset, believe it or not.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,120
And if you're used to it, more power to you, but I can't get used to crap like that.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,040
It's just like I can't get used to emotional garbage.

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:45,520
You ever get in a situation with someone and they're telling you it's all feeling, feeling, feeling, you don't get any background or anything that you could reference?

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,060
It's just like, you know, walk away, go see a shrink, go take some pills, you know?

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,540
So, I, I, me, me.

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah, they can't think beyond, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,840
And also, don't be fooled, there's a lot of training that has been done by the establishment through academia.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,620
So you, that's why you have dictionaries, how to pronounce words.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,540
They don't know what any of the words mean.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,180
But just to pronounce them, and they speak very, they sound smart.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,860
You know, how many times I've heard a lot of morons say, oh, this person's smart.

53
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm like, no, they sound smart.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,940
There's a big difference.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You know, so they're presented very well.

56
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
It's just stupidity.

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,440
It's sad, but it's not sad.

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,280
I mean, the sadness has prevailed for thousands of years, but you still have wonderful access to wonderful things.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,140
Let me give you an example.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,740
I got, you know, the owners of a bakery, a high-end bakery that's gluten free, right, which is a joke, right?

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,620
And we got a box of cookies, and these cookies are like a dollar something each.

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,300
They're small cookies, and there's like 20-some-odd cookies in this little box.

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,500
All different flavors, very well prepared.

64
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,200
But there are people that still believe in that.

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,660
They don't even know what gluten is, first of all.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,820
You know, it's like an elastic fiber in grain, right, in wheat.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,080
And these idiots have told them, you know, the reason, they're the people that have, they bought into the wheat allergies.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,900
It's a big thing.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
Remember, it used to be other things before that?

70
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:27,060
And no one is raising their hand and saying, could it be that the quality of the food is so low now that they can't acknowledge it, so they have to tell you it's a specific part of the food that's making you sick only?

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,880
I mean, this is how stupid people are.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Like, I think someone put a song in the people or shit.

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,980
They really are.

75
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:44,080
And then, by the way, just to bring it up even further, there's verses in scripture that talks about their bodies lying like shit, dung.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,900
And when you see destruction happening, don't even pray for them.

77
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,940
How many times do you hear these morons saying pray for these people?

78
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,500
Like, why?

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,660
You know, why?

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,820
You know?

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,480
So anyway, that's not being mean-spirited or anything like that.

82
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,600
That's just actually being real about what's going on.

83
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,180
I mean, have you ever heard me discuss that there shouldn't be any organic food available?

84
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,300
Yeah, how that makes sense.

85
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:26,060
What kind of a sick society at large would accept that some of the food is being intentionally toxified and the other one is not, and you have to pay a premium for the one that's not?

86
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,060
What kind of a sick – well, I'll tell you.

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,620
Well, yeah, I don't have to tell you.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,900
Yeah, just look around you.

89
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,560
The chances of anyone listening to my voice running into anyone that is of quality is so slim, you see?

90
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:44,620
Yeah.

91
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,100
This is the reality, but no one wants reality.

92
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,600
They just want to feel good about something.

93
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,420
Yeah, you want to feel good, just touch yourself.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,660
Reach down there, grab it, and whatever, whatever you've got to do to make yourself feel better, because that's all you've got.

95
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,580
So, anyway, what else are we going to talk about?

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, we were on the subject of Judas.

97
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:20,820
What I was saying was that I don't – I mean, there's nothing in the text that indicates that he's not acting of his own self-government other than that little possession bit, and I'm wondering how could he fulfill the prophecies about his betrayal unless he acted on his own free will?

98
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:38,720
To say that Satan made him do it in a literal sense and not even in this sort of Judeo-Christian figurative sense, I feel like that's really – I don't want to say underhanded, because it's not my place to have any which way opinion about it, but I'm trying to understand why the guy isn't doing it on his own then.

99
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:51,290
Well, there's several layers to that, but also if you remember in the piss-poor text that we get, that Christ basically addresses Satan to go do what he has to do.

100
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,030
Was it directed to Satan?

101
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,850
I don't know if it was Satan or Judas.

102
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,800
Have you ever heard me say that the rest of the entire Bible explains the Book of Revelation versus the other way around?

103
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,980
The entire Bible, yeah, I've heard you say that.

104
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,960
Because the Book of Revelation has primacy based on the first verse, right?

105
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,370
You ever notice how there's an outcry of certain beings in the Book of Revelation against those doing bad?

107
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,490
You ever notice how there's an outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah, remember?

108
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,970
You see how these things come up in Genesis that seem to have been directly taken out of Revelation?

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm not suggesting anyone go read the Book of Revelation for the simple reason – I'm not saying don't read the Book of Revelation.

110
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm not suggesting you read it, and the answer to that is why?

111
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,060
Because you're not going to understand anything in it.

112
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,020
Everyone?

113
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,820
No, not everyone, but just about everyone, no, you won't understand it.

114
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,900
I've not found anything that's true and correct on the rectangle about the Book of Revelation yet.

115
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,450
Other than, you know, the, or whatever.

116
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,230
I think you're right, it is Satan that he talks to, which is interesting.

117
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:56,760
Well, the interesting part, you know what the real interesting part is, that I strongly presume, if not more than that even, in the next seven years we might even have a real, in other words, a more factual text of what was memorialized in the New Testament.

118
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,160
Yeah, that might very well be so.

119
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:11,160
But what's it, I mean, usually what you find is that demon possession takes place in conjunction with some kind of physical trauma that gives some kind of a gateway of some sort.

120
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,680
Yeah, that's just typical.

121
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
But here, we're not seeing that with Judah at all.

122
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,500
He just, you know, dips his, what's the bread thing?

123
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,740
He puts his hand in the bread basket to pull out bread and then Satan enters into him.

124
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Unleavened bread, yeah.

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,080
It's not like, you know what, I still have to interject, Sam.

126
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,200
Most people have the visuals from that, who's the guy who painted the Last Supper?

127
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
I forget the dude.

128
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,340
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,820
You know, I had, there was one of these alternative media guys, quite a few years ago, he got me on Skype.

130
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,800
He was doing this really long video to explain astrotheology on that painting of Da Vinci.

131
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,860
And I let him talk and talk and talk, and I said, he's been talking for 45 minutes, and I'm going to interject something.

132
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,840
I said, dude, you know, there is no Last Supper in the Bible, right?

133
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,900
You know, none of that stuff is biblical.

134
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,680
It's made up.

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,380
It's Christian, right?

136
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,060
He's like, oh, but I made the video already.

137
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,080
These are the people that you guys are looking to for information.

138
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,220
Oh, boy.

139
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,940
None of it is, yeah, so.

140
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,860
Yeah, it's quite interesting.

141
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,080
That was the Passach that they were doing, and it was a very interrupted way.

142
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,360
You know, the Passach is interruptive, you know, right?

143
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,060
You know what I mean?

144
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,540
Right?

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,460
So there's two levels to it.

146
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,560
For example, one level is, well, the bread is unleavened because they were ready to leave Egypt.

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,880
They didn't have time.

148
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,320
But the other thing is, doesn't leaven represent falling short or sin?

149
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,600
I don't even like to use the word sin because people don't even know what it means.

150
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,240
Missing the mark, right?

151
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,460
Okay, so which one is it?

152
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,980
Well, it's both.

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,940
Did Satan possess?

154
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,600
In other words, was Satan intervening in this situation for something to be done because of just that?

155
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,600
Or was it meant to go that way?

156
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:23,900
Remember, Abraham told his son on the way, the three-day walk to the sacrificial, right, with Abraham and Isaac.

157
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,580
It took him three days to get there.

158
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,740
Remember, he said, where's the site?

159
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,340
He says, well, you said the Elohim will provide one for us.

160
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,660
Remember?

161
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
The lamb for us, right?

162
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,660
Right?

163
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Okay, so are we able to put all this together?

164
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,260
Some of it, for sure.

165
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,960
Other things are a bit harder.

166
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,540
Or it takes a bit more time.

167
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,420
Well, because, you know, here's the thing.

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,020
Most people have the desire to get as much detail about something that they're interested in as possible, right?

169
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,120
If you're interested in something, you want as much detail as you can get, humanly possible, let's say.

170
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
You know, not without the level of pain, but, you know.

171
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,540
And then there's other aspects of human desire to want to know about things that are important.

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:16,660
And that's kind of a joke, because if you look at most people that have careers, ask them about what their career or their profession is based on, they know very little.

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:29,580
So, but anyway, for let's say rational humans, which there's only a handful left on the planet, if you want to know more about something, the way you know more about it is by gleaning more detail.

174
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:39,740
And what I would broach to say to anyone is that the detail is there, it's just not in the way that you're used to seeing it.

175
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,300
Does that help?

176
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,520
Yeah.

177
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,870
But I mean, once you abandon that sort of viewpoint, you're on a completely different endeavor altogether anyway, so.

178
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,990
Well, that's with anything.

179
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,310
Once you find out anything about any subject, who are you going to go tell it to?

180
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,110
Look, if you really learn about electricity, you think you're going to go to some physics lab, even CERN, and talk to them about it?

181
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,590
Those guys are idiots.

182
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,840
You're finished.

183
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,400
You're stuck.

184
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
It doesn't matter what subject it is.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
Once you start learning how the human body works, you think you're going to go talk to a medical technician?

186
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,940
You've got to be out of your mind.

187
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,080
No way.

188
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:44,440
So this is basically the discussions that we've been having, and 99% of Greek speak is a deep personal message for people to kind of say, hey, look, this is something you could prove on your own, any subject.

189
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,040
But you're kind of on your own with it, so make the best of it.

190
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Can you imagine going into a church, right?

191
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
Let me give you an example.

192
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,500
Like I think the last sonic event we did, I brought up there's a ridiculous Bible museum.

193
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,180
They opened in Washington, D.C., some billionaire idiot, right?

194
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,720
How come he didn't invite the pope?

195
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Well, two reasons.

196
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,380
One, because that whole Christian religion is so divided.

197
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,420
The other reason is the pope has nothing to do with the Bible, right?

198
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,200
And the Bible museum has nothing to do with the Bible.

199
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,060
It has to do with the American versions and the Gutenberg press.

200
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,740
Do you see how many levels of ridiculousness are here through the entire thing?

201
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,780
And he invested millions.

202
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,460
It doesn't matter.

203
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,360
Of credits, yeah.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,720
Great, great.

205
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,860
Well, that's what I said earlier.

206
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:52,680
If you come out with a way to make a motor, which is not difficult to do, that just perpetually runs, not perpetually because there are other systems that break down within it, you're in big trouble.

207
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,980
If you figure out how the body works and you go around getting people out of ICU in 24 hours, you're in big trouble.

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,500
You see?

209
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,220
If you take cars and make them run pollution-free, you're in big trouble.

210
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,940
All the things that all these idiots on this planet are saying that they want with one side of their mouth, the other side of their mouth, they're ready to punish you for doing it.

211
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,660
That's called schizophrenia, isn't it?

212
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,020
Yes.

213
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,780
Torn mind.

214
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,820
Dual-minded.

215
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,100
Yeah.

216
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
So, one.

217
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,300
Yeah.

218
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,360
Go ahead.

219
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:36,260
No, when you read about all the destruction that's going to be brought on mankind because there's no other way to deal with mankind, the gods are, who's doing all that destruction?

220
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,660
The good guys or the bad guys?

221
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,210
Good guys.

222
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,530
Yeah.

223
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,890
And you're stuck down here with these idiots.

224
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,970
Yes, the most powerful guys.

225
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,170
Look, right now, if you get entangled in the legal society, they don't care about law.

226
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,730
They basically tell you, we have the guns, so we got you.

227
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,610
Right?

228
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,930
But I'll tell you what, the most powerful guys in the other realm does care about the law and does care about the right thing.

229
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,730
They're not some cult like you have over here.

230
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,850
You know what I mean?

231
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:22,450
I think it's interesting that what we're seeing is that it's lawful to make somebody do something that they don't want to do by putting another spirit into them and taking away their free will.

232
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,810
In order for something to be accomplished, yes.

233
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Because that comes up constantly about the something needing to be accomplished.

234
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,740
Are you familiar with that in what they call the New Testament narrative?

235
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah, sure.

236
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah.

237
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,180
And why was it so important?

238
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,320
Do you know that there's an archetype to it in the lamp stand?

239
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,760
It was so important that it was done within that time period.

240
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,380
Right?

241
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,220
Because it's the center.

242
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,740
Right?

243
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,300
Number four.

244
00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:06,920
And it's also important because we have, through agency and through unity, you know, like the concept of monotheism is ridiculous because that means there's only one God.

245
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:18,900
You could say ikhad or enatheism, which is ikhad means one, or enatheism, which means you only believe or you only have faith in one God.

246
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,099
Right?

247
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,020
So this is the manifestation of that coming on Earth.

248
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:34,220
He's taking a physical human body for this purpose, you know, of showing that to mankind what happens after you die.

249
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,600
That was the purpose, the sole purpose of the Christ coming here, by the way, as he did.

250
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,320
And, of course, when you're here doing that, you're going to do all the other things that were recorded.

251
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,500
And the whole thing is done in what?

252
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,160
Secret.

253
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,680
And it's a secret today.

254
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:07,890
And you have people, you have a billion plus people that are so sick and bizarre to say that they believe in a particular figure like that and they know nothing about it, you know, the situation or the figure themselves.

255
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:23,950
So anyway, you're on a planet with seven and a half, almost eight billion now, bizarre and sick individuals, minus a very tiny, tiny portion that could easily be gleaned and rendered as not being a part of that mentality.

256
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:40,450
So connected to what you said before about there being chaos on the other side, Christianity does sort of make the story of scripture all about individual self exceptionalism and, you know, the tribe of that religion.

257
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,250
But when you start to look at certain things about the Elohim and their society, certain things get uncovered that are interesting.

258
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:58,830
So in Revelation 12, there's this verse that talks about what's going on as far as the great dragon getting thrown out and such and the great dragon was thrown out that serpent of old called the devil and Satan who leaves all the world astray.

259
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:13,050
He was thrown to the earth and his messengers were thrown out with him and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now have come the deliverance and the power and the reign of our Elohim and the authority of his Messiah for the accuser of our brothers who accused them before our Elohim day and night has been thrown out.

260
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:20,110
So often at times this is used to explain some kind of tribulation of the church, blah, blah, blah.

261
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,470
Satan was accusing the saints, yada, yada, assembly.

262
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,430
Yeah, right.

263
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,390
No circus in there.

264
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,010
Yeah, good.

265
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:37,270
But since we know that human spirits are disanimated when they die, the voice from heaven, which is that of an Elohim, it's not a human being because there are no human beings in heaven.

266
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,910
So the brethren that Satan has been accusing are not human beings at all.

267
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,710
There are other Elohim.

268
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,010
Yeah, I prefer not to get into the details of Revelation publicly at the moment.

269
00:19:49,410 --> 00:20:00,910
I'll be glad to do that with you in the future in private, not now in the future, maybe a year or two from now if I'm still around for that.

270
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,030
Itchy.

271
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,610
It's an interesting thing for other people to think about.

272
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,290
He's accusing other Elohim, which means that they are fighting.

273
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,870
Here's an interesting thing that I've noticed, that just because someone looks adult doesn't mean that they necessarily are.

274
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:37,450
And one thing you'll find out when you're an adult raising children, I have not, but I should say that anyone could find this out, it's pretty obvious, is that one of the things that you always tell the immature is you're going to have to wait a few years for that.

275
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,430
That comes all the time, doesn't it?

276
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,450
Daddy, I want to ride a fire truck, I want to drive a car.

277
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,530
Well, you're going to have to wait a few years for that one.

278
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,990
And how fast do those years go by when you're in an immature mind state?

279
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,990
Really fast or really slow?

280
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,750
Actually, when you're younger, time seems to go by much slower, doesn't it, than when you're older?

281
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:11,870
And when you're older, like now I've been a few years past half a century, and I've realized that I wouldn't say the years go by like months or weeks or anything, but 15 years has gone by so fast, it went by only like a few seasons.

282
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,670
I can't say it was like weeks or months, because obviously I can count the months in between, there are many.

283
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,790
But it seems only like a few seasons, not many years.

284
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,910
So as you get older, what happens is you're no longer impressed by things.

285
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,770
See, when you're younger, time seems to go by slower, because you're still impressionable.

286
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,170
You're recording all of these events that are happening around you, and you're rationalizing them.

287
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,370
When you get older, you don't have to re-rationalize everything so much.

288
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,470
It depends on what you're trying to rationalize.

289
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:57,590
Because I've suggested that past the age of 12, most people are already completely shut down and fully indoctrinated, like automatons within the society.

290
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:08,010
They've even set up a subculture now, since maybe 50 or 60 years ago, maybe 50, I should say.

291
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,250
There is a subculture now set up within the culture called the kids' culture.

292
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,610
They have their own TV, their own movies, their own clothing, their own food, their own drink, their own schools.

293
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,010
Have you heard of that, Bruce, the kids' stuff?

294
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,170
Oh, yeah.

295
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,130
I remember when it started.

296
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,830
Yeah, in the 70s, I think.

297
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,710
Yeah, maybe late.

299
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,450
There was a little bit of that in the 50s, but I didn't really have that growing up, and I don't think you did.

300
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,370
No, no, no, no.

301
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,570
It's a subculture.

302
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,010
Late 60s, maybe?

303
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,730
Yeah, maybe.

304
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,610
Yeah.

305
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,730
Yeah, it's a subculture.

306
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,630
Like, when did McDonald's have their Happy Meals come out, right?

307
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,630
In the same run, Ronald McDonald really started coming and taking more precedence.

308
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,050
Yeah, and Sesame Street.

309
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:57,770
Yes.

310
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,050
Sesame Street and all that stuff.

311
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,170
The whole world is on.

312
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:07,070
So I'll tell you that right now, the subcultures are a big aspect.

313
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,150
For example, if you look at what's called social media, those are all subcultures, but are they really?

314
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:22,670
I mean, I don't think you're going to be counted as a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant here in the near future unless you have a social media account.

315
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,190
It's very possible.

316
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,070
Very, very possible.

317
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,030
Yeah, these are all subcultures.

318
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,570
So the subculture now, it's kind of like where the child becomes the parent.

319
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,090
Like Monsanto was from DuPont, and Monsanto is bigger than DuPont now.

320
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:47,760
So everything made was good, but now that everything that exists seems to be embarked with evil.

321
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,060
So there's more evil than good, right?

322
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,760
And in order to pass off evil, it has to appear as good, right?

323
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,100
Because like counterfeit money, you can't just get a crayon and write it on a paper towel.

324
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:07,840
They go through great pains and efforts to make something that's fake look like a fake Rolex or a fake Gucci bag, right?

325
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:16,020
Yeah, the manufacturer of these fake items go through great efforts, like the news, right?

326
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,140
The university, fake education.

327
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,840
It's the same buildings, but now all of a sudden it's all fake stuff.

328
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,360
I had a college professor once in a physics lab tell me there's no such thing as energy, it's electrons moving down the wire.

329
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,390
Yeah, this is pranking on a major, major level.

330
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,150
You know, on the last Sonic event, from what I remember, Sam, in closing, I think I was bringing up the book of Genesis.

331
00:24:50,430 --> 00:25:04,170
And as time goes on, not out of desire, but just out of rhetorically saying it, I don't think I'm the one to get into explaining scripture on a consistent basis, even though people have that interest, I'll do it.

332
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:14,910
But I think what my forte is explaining on how people are being pranked and how to see through the cosmic censorship.

333
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:22,830
Not eliminate the cosmic censorship and being censorship free, but in essence the censorship as a fog.

334
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:31,550
You know, like navigating maritime vessels put a lot of effort into navigating the fog, don't they?

335
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:37,390
They have radar, fog lamps, lights, thorns, and they're aware of meteorological effects and things.

336
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,550
And that doesn't apply, because if I was in that situation, I could clear the fog using what I know about weather control.

337
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:52,190
But I'm just putting that in as a footnote, because I've had many people, even Ocelli before, who said, so Greek, you're not censored?

338
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,210
I mean, you know, it's like, oh boy, you know, how do you answer that, you know?

339
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,350
Is anybody home?

340
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:13,450
But anyway, the thing is, if you remember Bruce on the last, I don't know if I'm really the one to explain, I mean, doing the Genesis talks and all that and the biblical talks is fine.

341
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,290
And that is the subject, biblical stuff is really what I think about mostly.

342
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:25,290
But I don't really think I'm the one to go forward explaining that stuff.

343
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,350
Someone else has to rise to that occasion.

344
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,420
Or people can just study it themselves.

345
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,760
Yeah, that's exactly right.

346
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,300
You know, here's the interesting thing, thanks for saying that.

347
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:55,240
If you just clear the mind, and I've said this emphatically many times already, there is nothing that you know about anything biblical that you could bring to the text that will help you directly, only indirectly.

348
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:10,320
If you just approach the biblical text as any literary work that you would be quizzed on, tested on, or known for proficiency on, you'll get more than you've expected out of it, just by reading it.

349
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,780
But the minute you open up Exodus and say, oh, I saw this part in the movie with Cecil B.

350
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,620
DeMille, no, you just screwed yourself.

351
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,940
See?

352
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,520
Yeah.

353
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,780
And you have to read it several times, because there's clues that are given.

354
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,880
There's things that are seemingly open-ended that are tied and closed in other places.

355
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,020
So you're going to have to go through it once, just like when you download a computer program.

356
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
You download it, then you use it.

357
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,760
So you're going to have to download it by being familiar, reading it through.

358
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,780
And then you'll get to certain parts and say, oh, I see where these things need to be pieced together.

359
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,660
Eventually you'll see why it was done that way.

360
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,170
And then I also give the metaphor.

361
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,430
There used to be – well, for example, if you go – I use the metaphor of the waiting room, right?

362
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:09,090
And when you ever notice people in a waiting room, when they sit around and read magazines, they flip back to the front naturally?

363
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,130
They flip from the back to the front, yeah?

364
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:25,190
Now, I'm wondering in countries where they read from right to left, where the back would be the front, do they flip from the front to the back, from the left to the right?

365
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,450
I've never investigated that.

366
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:27,890
That might be interesting to know.

367
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,350
Yeah.

368
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,530
But in this case, that's a good advice.

369
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:56,390
Also, given the fact that Satan is shown to be an accuser not just here but on the other side, and probably primarily on the other side, that very much does line him up with the attorney function that we see paralleled in the legal society, if he spends his time calling out people for stuff that they may or may not have done.

370
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:09,010
Right, and using some lawful precedent, Scripture, and putting them in a situation where they have to get out of using some kind of tactic.

371
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,450
That's why the redemption is an important thing, where you don't have to go through that tactical mess.

372
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,270
Because literally, if you follow the text, we are being ransomed and redeemed.

373
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:30,150
Now, if you weren't held hostage or taken possession or ownership over by another, why would that be necessary?

374
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,820
I just want to throw this in.

375
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:55,660
Anyone who's listening to me, I'm really sorry for the conditions, not because I have anything to do with it really, but directly or indirectly, I would suggest even, of the conditions of the information that you guys have or humanity has through the rectangle and the academia.

376
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,090
It's just piss poor.

377
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:08,630
You're going to have to raise your inquisitiveness and discernment to really get the truth.

378
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,110
And the level of moroncy or idiocy is the norm.

379
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:32,470
Go anywhere, listen to anything, and it sounds good for a little while, and if you really know how to discern, you're going to say, oh boy, oh boy, I could see right through the bullshit and the stupidity and the plausibility.

380
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:59,450
Another thing that's interesting with this revelation bit, even though we haven't dug into it particularly deeply, but what can be seen is that if the adversary is clearly shown to be opposed to high-level entities on the other side to the point that when he's kicked out, they're all rejoicing that he's gone, then maybe you could say more incisively that he is the adversary of the Elohim and not necessarily humankind.

381
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:06,390
Because if things are primary on the other side, then they have an issue with him before we have an issue with him.

382
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,250
Yeah.

383
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:18,710
One thing that I like to give as an example is, given though it's an angelic being, the fighting over the body of the burial location of Moses being secret.

384
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,290
The answer was, you know, Yahweh rebuke you.

385
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,950
Not me rebuke you, but may the God of gods rebuke you.

386
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,970
You see.

387
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:41,210
But yet, in other conditions, in the book of Daniel, the angel comes and says, I may have had such a delay because I'm fighting the prince of Persia.

388
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,450
So, and one thing, he doesn't fight Satan.

389
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,430
He calls upon the higher power to do it as a form of rebuke.

390
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:59,550
But in another part, the same, I would suggest, angel is actually engaged in battle with another one of equal parity, let's say.

391
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:06,430
So, in this case, it seems like this adversary, Satan, is very powerful.

392
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,130
Or, it's best not to fight him.

393
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,890
It's just like the natural kingdom.

394
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,770
Aren't there some small venomous animals that are smaller in size than others that, you know, cower in their presence, right?

395
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,530
Right.

396
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,410
Like cobras.

397
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,750
I mean, how much does a cobra weigh at max?

398
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,530
You know, like three kilos, maybe?

399
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,650
A big one, four?

400
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:38,730
You know, any other, I mean, there's plenty of animals out there in the wilderness that could stomp on it, but they don't because of certain attributes.

401
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,080
And I'm not using that as a pun or a metaphor on the serpent thing either.

402
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm just suggesting, you know, there's many animals like that.

403
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,660
Porcupine, skunks.

404
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:02,130
Pertaining to the archetype conversation of before, when you look through the text and you see these various templates or signifiers that are coming up,

405
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,750
like with the pitch and the arc and the pitch in the Moses basket thing,

406
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:17,070
I'm looking at the Moses and Aaron situation as seemingly being indicative of something because you had a function that was in one office

407
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,990
and then Moses and Aaron comes along and they split it into the king function with Moses and the priestly function with Aaron,

408
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,050
because Moses doesn't want to take on that task on his own.

409
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,650
Might the adversary in the Christ be a split of some kind of function?

410
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,990
Because they do seem to be tied to one another.

411
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,750
They're tied metaphorically through these events of the 7,000 years.

412
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,690
But other than that, I don't see them being tied, no.

413
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:50,070
Because one is begotten, the only begotten, meaning coming from by intent, and the other one is not.

414
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:59,610
And the other one is given a higher power than the other one.

415
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,670
One is considered to have primacy over the other.

416
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,730
Yeah, I don't see that connection.

417
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,870
But definitely I would say there is.

418
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,350
I think you and I once had a discussion.

419
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:21,730
Yes, there is a connection there, because if you look at it from a common denominator point of view, who sits on the throne of the earth right now?

420
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,469
Satan.

421
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,190
Who's going to sit on the same throne later?

422
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,110
Right?

423
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:27,870
You see?

424
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,270
So in other words, he's almost equal in that capacity in many ways, right?

425
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,550
Right.

426
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,580
You have said in the past that Satan lives in the atmosphere.

427
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,960
But where do you get that, apart from the prince of the powers of the air thing?

428
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,460
Well, the atmosphere, okay.

429
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,260
That's in boundary layer.

430
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,780
Well, look, you know, there are physical attributes to the spiritual realm on the earth.

431
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,420
Like underneath the Euphrates, there's angelic beings, right?

432
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,480
There's the prince of power of the sky, meaning, you know, our skies here.

433
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,320
There's attributes to water, you know, that are spiritual and physical, that go both ways.

434
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:22,020
You know, why would the demons be cast out of a jurisdiction and they go out and they come back to where there's water?

435
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,920
You know, remember reading that?

436
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,280
There are physical connections here, archetypes in the earth that retain and contain these beings.

437
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:32,880
Right.

438
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,080
I don't know why.

439
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,460
I mean, would he be, you know, and then there's also the rock.

440
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,140
You ever notice, for example, there's a rock metaphor is given through scripture as well, in a positive sense.

441
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,770
By the way, the capital punishment the spiritual world uses is what?

442
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,130
You know, stoning, lapidation.

443
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,550
I try to avoid those technical terms.

444
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,110
I try to keep it simple.

445
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,030
If you say lapidation, most people get lost.

446
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,250
Stoning.

447
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,190
What do you think a meteorite is?

448
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,330
A stone is?

449
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,390
Yeah.

450
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,870
I mean, duh.

451
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,170
Now, which one came first, the stoning commandment or the meteorite?

452
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,170
You know, I mean, I don't know.

453
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,770
Does it matter?

454
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,010
No, it's just that representation of the same thing.

455
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,730
It's a form of capital punishment.

456
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:36,680
There is this interesting bit in 1 Timothy 3, 5, where it says, For if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he look after the assembly of Elohim?

457
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,660
Not a new convert, lest he become puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment of the devil.

458
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:49,540
So, is that an implication that Satan needs to be given specific jurisdiction over the Holy Ones through character flaws?

459
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Like, if you're proud, then he can…

460
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,400
That sounds very Judeo-Christian.

461
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,740
It is, but hold on.

462
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:07,280
You know, I think historically, the New Testament has probably suffered the most out-of-context realization than anything else ever.

463
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,920
Well, you know, science and the rest of the stuff, too, is like that, too.

464
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,900
But if you look at what it really was intended for, it's not how it's being used.

465
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,540
You know what I mean?

466
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,280
Yeah.

467
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,200
And actually what's being put out and how it's being explained is totally fake.

468
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,700
One thing that people don't understand, and they won't until the near future, this is a fact.

469
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,420
You can take it or leave it.

470
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,060
But, you know, if you don't like it, most people are not going to like what I'm about to say.

471
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:51,280
The whole commission, everything that you read about in the New Testament, I'm not talking Christian or biblical, ended in that first century, A.D. There's nothing left of it.

472
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,620
You're going to say, Greek, that sounds ridiculous because look at all these churches and religions.

473
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,780
Yeah, that has nothing to do with it.

474
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Because the intent and the meaning of the purpose of what's called the New Testament and the Christ is lost by then.

475
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:15,880
What happened was there were enough people through oral tradition and knowledge of Scripture, mostly in the east of Israel.

476
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,200
Some had gone to Rome and Greece as well.

477
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
There was the Hellenic and the Roman aspect.

478
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,740
One of the primal things on their mind is what happens to you when you die and will we ever get proof of that?

479
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,380
And the Christ came to show what happens after you die, which is the resurrection.

480
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:58,400
Instead of depriving them of that knowledge, certain apostles or people were tasked to go out throughout the world and seek those that knew about this concept and let them know that it had been performed.

481
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't see anything Christian about that.

482
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,620
I don't see any religious about it.

483
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,340
There's no church involved in that.

484
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
But now hold on a second.

485
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:33,540
Once you go out into public and you want to inform groups of people, whether small or large in various jurisdictions and geographic locations, isn't it best to set up a location where you do that in, like a meeting house or a group, where you start rehashing the evidence and all that, right?

486
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,640
Isn't that called an assembly to do that?

487
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,920
That's what went on then.

488
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,860
It's finished.

489
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,280
It's gone.

490
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:50,840
Everything that people have in their minds about the New Testament has nothing to do with what is really in the text itself at all.

491
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,400
None of that has been brought forward.

492
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,840
Now what happened is you have the fullness of the Gentiles.

493
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,000
And because they're all doing the same, there's no one to cry out against them.

494
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,100
Like years ago you heard about people being so God-awful that the surrounding people cried out against them.

495
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, right now the entire society on the planet is God-awful.

496
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,300
Who's going to cry out against them?

497
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:15,920
You see?

498
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,760
Right.

499
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,800
When are the crazy people in the nuthouse going to cry out, get me out of this nuthouse?

500
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,820
These people are crazy.

501
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,660
They're all crazy, let's say.

502
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm just saying as a generic metaphor.

503
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:44,560
So the character aspect, though, seems to give Satan an inroad into affecting these people.

504
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,620
As far as if you're proud, then he gets some kind of acclaim on you.

505
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,900
I'm not really understanding the technical side of that.

506
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,800
Well, the technical side, I explain, is very simple.

507
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,420
You can listen to it again on the recording.

508
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,100
The purposeful side of it is two sides of it.

509
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,640
For a high-level character like that to get involved, it's a fate element.

510
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,980
It's a prophetic element.

511
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,500
From a low-level intimate, it still is because, remember, you're on a cruise ship.

512
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,320
The ship is going from A to B, and what you do on that ship is limited.

513
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,760
But, yes, that's your free will.

514
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,200
You hear about people, let's say, let's go out extra-biblical or outside of the Bible for a moment.

515
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,240
People dabbling in the occulted, dark magic stuff.

516
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,600
Some of them come down with a possession thing or severe oppression.

517
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,780
You're not going to see that in Scripture.

518
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:43,880
Scripture just tells you don't dabble in magic, not because it doesn't work, but because it does work.

519
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,400
Because if magic was bunk, Scripture would tell you because it's bunk.

520
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,540
Very often it tells you the religions of man are bunk.

521
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,080
It's garbage.

522
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,780
It's worthless.

523
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,080
They'll tell you.

524
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,120
You notice that in Scripture?

525
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,520
Don't do this.

526
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,020
It's worthless.

527
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,620
The customs of the people are worthless.

528
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,220
It tells you why.

529
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,900
But in certain cases, don't do this.

530
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,800
Not because it's bunk, but because, you know, just don't do it.

531
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,170
Okay.

532
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,050
Let's move away from the Satan stuff.

533
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,350
It feels like perhaps we're putting too much emphasis on that.

534
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,790
Well, it's a very difficult thing to discuss because it's discussing the forest, right?

535
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,990
Where are you going to go within the society?

536
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,590
No, I'm not talking about nature now.

537
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,310
Man's society.

538
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,570
Where are you going to be Satan-free?

539
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,810
If I give you a minute to think about it or ten years, you're going to come back with the same answer.

540
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,810
You know what that answer is?

541
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:37,730
Nowhere.

542
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:47,310
The only time that you could probably get something like that is if they rebuild a temple or have a sanctuary dedicated to a specific God only.

543
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,730
You feeling me on that?

544
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:52,830
Yeah.

545
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,290
Sure.

546
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:03,550
I'll just bring up one more thing, and then I think I'll call it a day because I have my limits, too.

547
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:16,490
So the Zodiac is by no stretch, I think, an unimportant part of man's physical existence since it outlines the story of man's progression by marking the ages and events that have been pre-orchestrated.

548
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:25,870
And ancient civilizations, whether they were pagan or not, they kind of knew that, and they constructed monuments and artifacts that marked important time periods.

549
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:36,490
For example, if you look at the 10,500 BC marker where the recreation started, you can see certain things were constructed at that time, like Gobekli Tepli in Turkey.

550
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,030
And I could probably make a case that the Sphinx is actually from that period.

551
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:45,410
Also, I think we've talked about that, whether it was made before the recreation or after.

552
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,970
I could make a case that it was before or at that period.

553
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,430
So it was buried.

554
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,390
Yeah, it was buried.

555
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,250
By the way, just to interject something, you and I once had a discussion.

556
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:11,690
I started looking at some old notes about which pharaoh was for Moses, and it was Totonmos IV, the chariot pharaoh.

557
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:17,530
He's the one that also had a dream about uncovering the Sphinx because it was hidden under the sand.

558
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,590
And he was the one, and after him Egypt changed.

559
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:31,710
So it would be Totonmos IV that was the pharaoh during the Exodus.

560
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,070
He was the Exodus pharaoh in terms of history and dynastic.

561
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,590
If you're going to sift through all that, I just want to throw that out.

562
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,770
I put it in the chat once before, and there's not much about him, but yeah.

563
00:44:47,530 --> 00:45:03,090
Right, so as I understand it, the ages, the change of the ages is visible from the Earth because of an astronomical phenomenon known as the precession, which is a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of the planet.

564
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:12,310
So the axis completes one revolution about 26,000 years at a rate of one degree every 72 years or so.

565
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,470
Allegedly.

566
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,050
Until it's knocked off its axis temporarily, radically, and then brought back.

567
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,510
And the Earth stops moving.

568
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,250
That's in the future though.

569
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,370
In the past, but go ahead.

570
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,390
When in the past?

571
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,190
Well, how does he hang the Earth?

572
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,150
It's in Job, if you look at it carefully.

573
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,170
Because there's a start.

574
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,230
It's not perpetual that the Earth hangs from nothing, right?

575
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,750
It was put there.

576
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,630
Well, before it was hanging from nothing, what was it hanging on?

577
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,110
The conditions were different.

578
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,540
Okay, that makes sense.

579
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,860
But can we nail down a time period for that?

580
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,700
No, yeah.

581
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,280
This is what I have to say about all time periods.

582
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,740
Other than the time period of your own pathetic life, I tell people, nothing else matters.

583
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:19,080
What really matters, if you want to go beyond your own pathetic life, 60, 70, 20 years, 50 years, 100 years, whatever it is, is get good, sound information that's been memorialized from the past.

584
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,480
You're going to go to scientists, you think they have good, sound information, or are they a bunch of liars and frauds?

585
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,900
Yeah, the entire group is liars and frauds, with some minimal exception.

586
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:44,580
Now, astrology has been relegated to junk by the people, just like the biblical stuff has been relegated to junk by the people.

587
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:51,120
Any field of study is good, but when people get their hands on it, they turn it into garbage.

588
00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:16,120
So, I would stay away from the very large procession of time things, but I would not deny that there is a procession of symbolism in the sky, in the stars, via the constellations and other things, things that are dynamic, alignments and so on, and actual occurrences.

589
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,700
Those are good time keepers, but not in terms of time, but as event keepers.

590
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:32,940
Because scripture, by the way, does chronology through events, someone dying, someone being born, or just events.

591
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,060
And that's the main thing that is being censored by mankind.

592
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:52,800
One of the big agendas, even though they don't know it, the people that are in control, banking interests, because everyone is a suzerain to the bankers, right?

593
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,720
They're under control by the financial interests.

594
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,420
They don't know the truth, but they know that the truth can't get out.

595
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,300
This is the third time I'm saying this tonight.

596
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:12,120
The people that have power in this world don't know the truth as much as they could.

597
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,980
Scripture says they do know the truth and deny it.

598
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,040
That's why they're given up to certain ways.

599
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,880
But I would suggest that they don't look into it and study it enough to really know it, but they know it exists.

600
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,800
But what they do know even more is that it's important for you not to know it.

601
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,020
Do you get that?

602
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:31,900
Yeah.

603
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,200
Simple enough.

604
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:44,200
Yeah, it's like someone who doesn't know how to operate a chainsaw to cut down a tree, but he wants to make sure that someone who does, or could, doesn't cut down the tree either.

605
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:46,630
Right.

606
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,670
And the doctors are the same way.

607
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,650
Doctors don't want you to know about the body.

608
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,810
It's called job security.

609
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,350
How many times have you heard, mechanics don't want you to work at a car?

610
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,970
Yeah, it's a vicious, you're in a really bad vicious cycle, but you've been this way for a long time.

611
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:14,390
The thing to say about events is, I think I mentioned on the last Sonic event, is get used to searching archaeology.

612
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:21,770
You'll be, just put in archaeology in a search and hit past 24 hours or past week, because archaeologists are kind of slow in posting stuff.

613
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,690
You'll get a handle on it.

614
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,710
And do me a favor, right, because I've done this and I don't talk about it much.

615
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,230
Once you start finding interesting tidbits in archaeology, bookmark it.

616
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,690
Do me a favor, bookmark it.

617
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:42,050
And then do me another favor, when time goes by, a few months or more, maybe half a year, why don't you go back and click on that bookmark and tell me if it's still there.

618
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,650
I'm laughing facetiously.

619
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,530
Wow.

620
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,910
You know what a 404 is?

621
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:52,750
Yeah.

622
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:52,890
Yeah.

623
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:10,150
But what we can say about the current order of things is that the Zodiac is in the place that it's been for presumably quite some time, and that it's obviously relevant to the current dynamic.

624
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,690
And the Maserat also, yeah.

625
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:30,680
So as I understand it, the changes of the ages is something that we can observe, and the movement of the Earth's axis affects the position and the rising time of the constellations on what they call the spring equinox.

626
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,580
I'm not going to say that that's what it is, but what they call that.

627
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:43,200
So for about two millennia, each Zodiac constellation houses the rising of the sun on the so-called spring equinox, which signifies the age.

628
00:50:45,160 --> 00:51:00,360
So I guess a simplistic and approximate breakdown of the ages since the period of around 11,000 B.C. or the Great Flood would be 10,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C. is the age of Leo, which is pre-atomite destruction phase.

629
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,940
8,000 to 6,000 is the age of Cancer.

630
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,140
6,000 to 4,000 is the age of Gemini.

631
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,960
4,000 to 2,000 is the age of Taurus, which is pre-flood society.

632
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,400
2,000 to 1,000 B.C. is the age of Aries, which is Old Testament period.

633
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,540
And 1,000 to 2,000 is obviously the age of Pisces that we just went through.

634
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,980
And from 2,000 onwards is the age of Aquarius.

635
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,000
But Gemini would also be Old Testament also.

636
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:29,200
That's why you have so many twins in the Old Testament dualities, brotherly pairs.

637
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:45,700
I wouldn't say I've done this maybe in eight years, but I've gone out during the first month, the first moon, which is one thing that people are listening to lawful timekeeping.

638
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,520
You'll notice that the first and the seventh moons are the largest, but they're in different parts of the sky, right?

639
00:51:51,160 --> 00:52:03,880
If you go out during that spring, which is the first moon when the cycle starts again, the morning prior to that moon rising, look in the east slightly to the south, you'll see Aquarius.

640
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,040
You'll see about 75 percent of it.

641
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,220
And you'll see Pisces also.

642
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,860
You'll see about 75 percent of Pisces.

643
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,380
In the east, yeah, and it's been more than 10 years.

644
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:27,860
You know like a child when he gets a new toy, it's like everything in his life revolves around that.

645
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,480
I've gone through phases where I was like, okay, now I'm doing lawful timekeeping.

646
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,860
I'm going to hammer that and get as much out of it as possible.

647
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,360
There's nothing wrong with that.

648
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,320
You do that when you do training in any field, right?

649
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,120
You do training.

650
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,360
It's a discipline.

651
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,540
You get it.

652
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:56,600
In other words, in the reason I said 10 years ago or more or roughly, you know, 06, 07, 08, let's say, if anyone's got any news on that, please share it.

653
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,260
But don't come around.

654
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,280
I mean, you can, but fortunately not much.

655
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,340
Look at this website.

656
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,080
Look at this link.

657
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,580
Look at this.

658
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,380
No, I want to hear from you.

659
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,800
Do a little bit of work.

660
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,240
I'd rather have genuine stuff.

661
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,640
I'm not saying that everything is crap, but you know how you're guilty until proven innocent, right?

662
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,180
You've heard of that?

663
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,680
Well, it's all crap until proven not to be.

664
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,760
So, no, but what you're bringing up, Sam, is extremely valid.

665
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:35,540
And yeah, it's one hell of a coincidence, isn't it, that the story of mankind is written in the stars?

666
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,940
And there's been a lot of research, by the way, on the parallax of stars.

667
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:52,340
You know, when you measure a star location in the winter, you know, since the Earth tilts its axis, let's say, for the summer, the star should also correspondingly have a different angle of parallax, right, because now the Earth has moved, right?

668
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,320
But when you do that, the stars don't change their angle, even though their position in the sky seems to.

669
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,040
There's a phenomenon that people just can't – the scientists just don't want to talk about it.

670
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,900
Just like if you look up on the Internet, I dare anyone, oh, why do your fingers and toes shrivel when you're putting water?

671
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:17,100
They have hundreds of links and people and scientists saying no one knows why that happens, right?

672
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,500
They tell you that all the time.

673
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,920
Or you ever notice whenever they bring up dinosaurs 60 million years ago, they make sure to say that every time.

674
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,100
That's propaganda.

675
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,700
It's like with 9-11.

676
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,920
Remember how they had a show that, you know, the Arab hijackers, Arab hijackers constantly.

677
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,660
It's propaganda.

678
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:50,330
So you can spot that when you see the – you know, there's this disingenuine thing that – I find that what most people have accepted to be true is disingenuous and of poor quality and of low quality and poor character.

679
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,010
So, you know, you're going to have to weed through all that stuff to get some really good corn.

680
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:07,700
But anyway, but if you want to study the parallax – So I'm going to go back to that.

681
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,000
So you know what?

682
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:15,260
As the Earth is moving, the entire universe is moving in unison with it as if there is no movement.

683
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,400
But you do see movement.

684
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,260
It's like a planetary scenario.

685
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:28,980
It's in unison, but it's not unitary per se because we know that the pole star or the load star changes.

686
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:36,840
So where the axis, the Earth's northbound axis is pointing now isn't where it was pointing, you know, thousands of years ago.

687
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,300
I forget the actual star that it's pointing at right now.

688
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,120
I'd have to look it up.

689
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,240
I think it's Polaris.

690
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,220
It's the north star right now.

691
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,640
And 3,000 BC, I think it was Thuban in the constellation of Draco.

692
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,860
So that does change.

693
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:53,820
Yeah.

694
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,420
You know, by the way, I'll just say this even though that's against better judgment.

695
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,300
You know, there is the first two chapters of Revelation is a star map.

696
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,100
I think you and I have spoken about it in private a little bit, regrettably so.

697
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,620
That's something that you can't just discuss a little bit and then run away from, you know what I mean?

698
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:17,640
But…

699
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,280
It's not that hidden, though.

700
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,400
Well, it ties into many other things, and it evolves, you know.

701
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:29,580
The word evolve means to open, unravel into many other aspects, you know.

702
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,580
By the way, this is a little hint.

703
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,280
Whenever there's a reference to the stars in Scripture, it's about an event.

704
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,080
It's not just the stars themselves, you know.

705
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,440
It's event-based.

706
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,040
Calendrical, it's a poor choice, but people understand that term.

707
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
You know…

708
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,600
You mentioned one time about how the stars unravel like a…

709
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,300
Scroll.

710
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah, like a scroll, yes.

711
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,560
Well, that just…

712
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,940
Well, that means that…

713
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,320
Well, okay, that's in code.

714
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,960
It's in the Book of Isaiah.

715
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,380
That's a code for a certain event, and I'll get into that in the future.

716
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,560
That has to do with…

717
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,600
You've heard of the pole shift?

718
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,920
Yes, yes.

719
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:29,080
Yeah, it has to do with where and how the pole shift is going to be with great specificity, and I'll get into that in the future.

720
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,520
Oh, my.

721
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,140
Okay.

722
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,060
That's why…

723
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:43,280
One thing, if you've listened to Greek speak before, and sadly to say I'm the only one saying these things like this, is that I've…

724
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,780
You know, on any interview, whatever I do, just to bring up…

725
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,120
You know, I like to bring up the…

726
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,940
How many times did the world was supposed to end in the past three years?

727
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,280
Financial collapse, meteors, government crackdowns, shutdowns.

728
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,640
How many times was it supposed to end?

729
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,840
Last year wasn't too bad.

730
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,300
I think twice last year, but the year before, it was like five times.

731
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,440
Right, right.

732
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,100
Yeah, and what do I always say?

733
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,480
Nah.

734
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,080
Nah.

735
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,160
That ain't going to happen.

736
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:08,840
Why?

737
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,480
And I'll tell you why.

738
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,260
It's not like throwing dice.

739
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,640
And very often I say, well, we'll discuss this in the future.

740
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,440
Because why?

741
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,720
It'll make more sense then.

742
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,520
Right now it won't make any sense.

743
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:29,140
I'm still getting emails here and there about stuff that I said that I didn't say or stuff that I didn't say that I said, and it's like, what?

744
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,880
You know, so it's not too bad, though.

745
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:43,280
I mean, fortunately, the people that are communicating through email and Skype and even the chat tango are fairly rational and reasonable in the majority sense.

746
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,680
So, yeah.

747
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:53,480
But even then, there's more time that more water has to pass for other things to be discussed.

748
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:02,680
But I do want to thank and also thank, in a general sense, no one specific, about the timekeeping.

749
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:17,080
In the chat tango, when I do drop in from time to time, I look at it, and I would say the great majority of the people that do bring up timekeeping are in conjunction with what I'm able to perceive here.

750
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,440
So that's, you know, it's interesting.

751
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:37,480
You know, let's just put it this way, from an objective point of view, there are five or six or ten more people on the planet now than there were in the past that know how to do lawful timekeeping, which, by the way, is also taught in university astronomy, timekeeping.

752
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,440
But I think they get neuralized or, you know, any astronomical…

753
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,480
I think you dropped a link in one a few times about that one.

754
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:55,300
Yeah, and they do admit, but they do throw you off, just like attorneys and academics and doctors, they always throw you off.

755
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:03,940
They'll give you some, about, you know, sometimes 70% good information and then 30% poison to throw you off, you know, neuralize you.

756
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,220
You know, they'll tell you in all the academic stuff, the day is solar noon, right?

757
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,140
You remember reading that?

758
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,960
Oh, yes.

759
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,280
Solar noon, and they'll tell you that the moon rules the month, right?

760
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,040
They tell you that.

761
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:15,840
Yes, they do.

762
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,400
But they tell you there's no astronomical feature for the week.

763
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,020
Bullshit.

764
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:27,980
And then you go on to their stuff, and it's all academic horse crap.

765
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,600
It is, yeah.

766
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,820
Well, of course there's an astronomical feature for the week.

767
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,480
You have four quadrant-type phases for the moon.

768
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,400
You have full moon, half waning, dark moon, half waxing, full again.

769
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,720
So anyway, yeah, it's just a screwed up mess.

770
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,680
But look, enjoy good food, enjoy good drink, good conversation.

771
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,160
I hope we've indulged in some of it.

772
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:07,600
And keep yourself warm when it's cold and keep yourself cool when it's hot.

773
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:16,280
Cool head and warm feet, remember, because in nature the cold is rarefied and it rises, and the heat is densified and it descends.

774
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,440
Huh, what did he just say?

775
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,240
Yeah.

776
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:30,400
Keep your fluids or precious fluids, oils, liquids, in the dark and avoid as possible.

777
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,480
And make sure that you're drinking enough of it, too.

778
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,080
It's one thing to make the stuff, but it's another to get it into your body.

779
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:46,040
Yes, and if you don't have a good water source, getting it from fruit and vegetable is the best way.

780
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:56,640
You know, I dare anyone to take, if you eat fruits and vegetables as your diet, juice all of it, and look at how much juice, you know, a day's worth of fruit and vegetables.

781
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,580
Run it through a juicer, look how many glasses of liquid you get.

782
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:06,460
You see, that's already pre-filtered and it's charged, you see.

783
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,520
So, there's another aspect, if you can't get good water.

784
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,940
That's why if anyone, I remember if you're traveling internationally, oh, this water didn't affect me too bad.

785
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:28,620
And then you get like the worst sore throat you can imagine three days later, you know, because you're not used to the bugs there, you know, your body reproducing them, because they don't go into the body, your body reproduces them.

786
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,100
Right.

787
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:35,460
But you get into the habit of eating fruits and veggie, you know, so when you're traveling, don't drink the water like they say.

788
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,480
Eat lots of fruits and veg, because there's plenty of water in it that way.

789
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,720
But again, back to the fluids.

790
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:52,680
You know, I haven't gotten much response on it lately, but, you know, of course there's a quandary and a rarity and shortage of finding the proper shapes for water.

791
01:02:52,680 --> 01:03:06,220
But, you know, you can go any secondhand store, whatever, furniture outlet or housewares outlet, and they have plant vases that generally are formed in that ovoid shape, you know.

792
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:12,720
And what you want to be is savvy enough to get a plant vase that is glass lined, you know, not the junk lined inside.

793
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:19,320
Don't get an unglazed one that says not for food use either and that has a narrow neck.

794
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,100
You know, not the vases that are really wide mouthed.

795
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,400
Those are fine too, because you might want to put a stopper or a cover on it.

796
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,740
And those are good home storage vessels, you know.

797
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:38,660
So they're not all that – there's not much of a shortage of it, I mean, if you look at it from that perspective, ovoid shaped vessels, right.

798
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,500
But strictly for water that has a good stopper and all that, yeah, of course there's a shortage.

799
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,620
Why would you want to provide people with the right geometry?

800
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,620
They're all blockheads anyway, square headed or square whatever.

801
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:08,570
So, well, look, in the future if there is memory of this, which I believe there is, you'll say that you lived during this time period and someone will pat you on the back.

802
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,490
Sure, that would be nice.

803
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,730
Well, it would be better than nice, I hope, yeah.

804
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:22,190
Well, they'll say what a nice – you'll say what a nice time it was.

805
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,150
Yeah.

806
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,030
Anyway, I think I'm good for this conversation.

807
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:37,130
I'll bring up the Zodiac stuff on a continuation tip next time.

808
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,410
Yeah, there's actually more to look into that.

809
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:48,030
And one thing about the Zodiac stuff, the Maserat has a different view on it, but it still has the same movement.

810
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,970
And it is lawful to look at the stars.

811
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:53,630
You know why?

812
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:03,790
Because anyone can reference it, and you'll find that all of the ancient information that's been memorialized on the stars is in unison.

813
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,190
What are you going to do, lie about where the moon is, lie about where the sun is?

814
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:10,470
You know what I mean?

815
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,790
So it is a good lawful reference point.

816
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:19,970
Another thing – well, we'll get into geography in the future.

817
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:28,050
I'll tell you a little thing that I've been looking at lately because it sparks back memories from doing the geophysics stuff.

818
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:36,190
You're aware how they use satellite geoimagery to look for minerals and things on the surface, right?

819
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:45,450
And what they do is they tweak the spectrum so it looks real funky, and as the spectrum changes, you know, it's unrealistic color.

820
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,530
It looks almost like rainbow colors on the Earth, but it's not.

821
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:58,390
That shows you where there's a preponderance of a certain mineral, you know, just by simply – you know, they'll look at Saudi Arabia, and they'll say, well, why is this bright blue band turquoise color here?

822
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,510
And, well, they'll dig around and find, well, there's this mineral over here.

823
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,410
You see there's like an emission spectrum, right?

824
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:09,030
But what they've – and I'm not – well, I'll just give a little spoiler of what I'm looking into.

825
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,930
I may not be successful as I've got to reach out and get some more critical information on it.

826
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:28,950
There is evidence – you know how we had discussion of the garden and how the river came out from the garden that divided into other rivers and the Gihong and the Euphrates, right?

827
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:52,490
Well, there's – through these geo-satellites, there is evidence of there was a main drop of water or a pool-type recession on the Earth where there are four branches and the Euphrates is still connected to it or part of the Euphrates because now the source of the Euphrates is a spring near Turkey and also runoff from certain mountain ranges.

828
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,950
But these are just things in the future.

829
01:06:55,170 --> 01:07:05,770
I may not be successful in it, but we'll see if I could reach out and get some more critical information about – this would be the location of where the Garden of Eden was in relation to the Earth.

830
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,230
Do you see what I mean by this?

831
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:15,650
Through geophysical features where old rivers used to run.

832
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:16,750
And they know it.

833
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:25,110
A geophysicist will tell you there used to be a river here and now it's filled in through alluvial fill, which is decomposing of land that filled it in.

834
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,630
They could see that.

835
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,710
And zeolites are sources from deep river.

836
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,590
So anyway, that's an interesting study.

837
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,390
And I've been looking on the rectangle and there's nothing on there really.

838
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:43,190
But, I mean, who are you going to go tell to?

839
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,250
Oh, look, let's say we found where Noah's Ark is.

840
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,370
Who are you going to go tell?

841
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:49,770
Who are you going to talk to?

842
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:50,210
Who cares?

843
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,130
Yeah, exactly.

844
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:53,950
Well, that's the attitude.

845
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:54,590
Who cares?

846
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,490
Most of this stuff could be surmised.

847
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:02,250
Well, let's say you find where these rivers are flowing geophysically where they were at one point.

848
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,010
Who cares, right?

849
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:07,030
No, I mean, who cares about the other people that you supposedly want to talk to?

850
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,190
I don't want to talk to anybody.

851
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,450
Yeah, well, I don't either.

852
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,770
That's why I'm doing it electronically.

853
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,850
But here's the interesting thing.

854
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,830
But you know what this all means.

855
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:19,710
This is what I'm saying.

856
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,310
That's now.

857
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,910
It's temporal.

858
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,729
What I'm saying, it's not time yet.

859
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:23,810
Yeah, sure.

860
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:24,569
Right.

861
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:25,350
It's not time yet.

862
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:26,870
I mean, just look around.

863
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,630
These guys, these idiots are doing some kind of holiday right now.

864
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:31,950
Go talk to these savages what it means.

865
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:35,090
You want to talk about demonic oppression?

866
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:37,189
You know?

867
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,390
Well, look at their faces.

868
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,710
You want to see what evil looks like and worthlessness?

869
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:55,189
Speaking of that, when I was at the Yom, I had some lady come up to me, mid-60s, rather pepper pot kind.

870
01:08:55,189 --> 01:09:03,330
And she comes up and she says, do you have an, what did she say?

871
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:11,310
I think Eastern Santa Claus or Western Santa, you know, from a different location.

872
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,550
Right, the non-fat one, yeah.

873
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:14,229
Right.

874
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:19,029
And I looked at her and I says, well, I'm really not familiar with any of that.

875
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,729
And could you be a little more specific?

876
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:25,910
And she had this dazed look in her eye, Greek.

877
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:38,870
I'm telling you, the emptiness of the stare, like she was dumbfounded and didn't know how to describe what it was that she was trying to come there for, or even if she had a purpose.

878
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:47,710
But it was actually, it kind of raised a hair on the back of my neck like, whoa, this is seriously screwed up.

879
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:56,930
Well, I'm glad that you can notice that, but I'm also sad that you noticed that, because I'm at the point where I can go anywhere and I see that.

880
01:09:56,970 --> 01:10:01,310
If I go to the auto parts store, I see both the people behind the counter and the clients.

881
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:06,910
I agree, but this one was probably the most profound that just struck me so odd.

882
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,730
And I was like, wow, this is deep.

883
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,790
Yeah, humanity is, let's just leave it off like this.

884
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:24,810
If you don't believe what I'm saying, if you have a keen eye for biology and you're familiar with anthropomorphs, let me just be indirect like that.

885
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:33,250
Go watch some old black and white films of how people looked then, and then go look at the people that you see now, whether it's in television or not.

886
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,970
Look at the difference, and you tell me there's no degeneration there.

887
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,550
The old black and whites, you know?

888
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,910
Well, it's not even that they're black and white.

889
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,170
Go back even further.

890
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,770
That's a good marker.

891
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,350
Go look at photography and look at how robust.

892
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:55,550
The people had better displacement within this reality.

893
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:09,450
I have great difficulty with getting into deep observation or coinciding and relating with people, not because I have a difficulty with doing that.

894
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,630
It's just when I start examining their condition.

895
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:16,530
It's not that I'm much better, but I just wish I was around something better than what I see.

896
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:19,570
And I'm not talking about dregs and Walmart and all that.

897
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:23,710
I can navigate through all levels of society, and I see it throughout.

898
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,630
It's really sad.

899
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,430
And again, I just always bring it up.

900
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:38,130
If you look at even science fiction, when you go look for sages and masters, do you find them right there in the city, or do you have to go somewhere out in the cave in the mountain because they don't want to be around anybody?

901
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:48,180
And they're typically embittered, not because of their character as being as such, because they are able to perceive really what's going on.

902
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,300
And here's another interesting thing.

903
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:07,300
Humanity deserves the most compassion because we are the prize of creation.

904
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,660
But you know who I really feel bad for?

905
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,420
The animals.

906
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:16,020
Because they're extremely subjugated to humans.

907
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,080
They're not complaining, though.

908
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:21,640
Yeah, right.

909
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,460
Actually, thank you.

910
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,800
Someone sent me an email years ago.

911
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:39,040
I used to say beware of animal attacks being on the rise, not just as a coincidental thing, but an infliction of the natural kingdom kicking back to mankind.

912
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:43,860
And someone today sent me an email about some normal activities, things that were normal.

913
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:49,860
I think it was something with sea animals that were always around people, and all of a sudden they're starting to attack people now.

914
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,760
And someone could try to rationalize that and say, well, it's because their food is shortage.

915
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,100
Well, no, they don't see people as food or as territorial because the food shortages come and go on a seasonal level anyway.

916
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:03,740
So, yeah.

917
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:14,720
Even the animals, the spirits that are guiding them are like, yeah, these humans now, the mop-up crew is coming, so let's eke out.

918
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,360
Don't you want to kick them in the shins before you go anyway, Mr. Wolf?

919
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,640
Or Mr. B?

920
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,760
Or Mr. Whale?

921
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,300
Or Mr. Sea Lion?

922
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,950
Okay, guys, I think we've done okay.

923
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:33,450
People getting an earful, I think they're going to get more than a nickel's worth on this one also.

924
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,390
Oh, definitely, definitely.

925
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,450
Another wealth of information again.

926
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,730
Oh, yeah, yeah.

927
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:47,490
And not to brag, but I still haven't shared more than 10% of what I found out in the past decade and a half.

928
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:54,030
I know I sound like an arrogant ass by saying that, but maybe a little bit of time goes on, I'll get to the 11%.

929
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,410
I look forward to it.

930
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:59,610
I look forward.

931
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,670
Yes, Greek, please bless us.

932
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,230
Yeah, right.

933
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,610
More information.

934
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,150
Yeah.

935
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:06,930
Definitely.

936
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,350
I don't know about that, but yeah.

937
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:11,670
Okay, well, we'll just keep it going somehow, and we'll see what develops, all right?

938
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:12,530
We certainly will.

939
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,770
You guys keep in touch.

940
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:15,690
I will.

941
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:18,770
Thanks again, Bruce, for doing all this, and thanks again, Sam.

942
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:19,670
No worries.

943
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:21,130
See you guys.

944
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,850
Be well, folks.

945
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,610
Talk to you guys later.

946
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,630
Good night.
