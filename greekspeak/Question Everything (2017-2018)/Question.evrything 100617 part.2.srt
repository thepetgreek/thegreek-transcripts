1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay, how are we doing?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,800
Yep, we're here.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,600
Alright.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,120
Taking out the box, and we're on.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,980
Yeah, so about light, I think we went over it a little bit.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,160
It's very simple.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:28,920
It's one of the least understood things because we're so sensitive to it, especially people that can see, of course, just like we don't think about most things.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,340
But I don't know, I mean, it's a perception.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,440
You know, you could not be perceiving light and still be alive and perceiving other things.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,040
Is that interesting?

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,140
You know, the blind, for example, right?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,540
And I think someone put internal or external light.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,500
You know, in the future, people will discover that darkness is also a form of light.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,040
They're both, I would say, work with each other.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
That's how you get color, okay?

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,740
Color is not in white light, like the rock and roll album that shows a prism.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,640
If anyone has a prism and puts white light through it, you're not going to get what they're showing.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:28,880
And even MIT morons in training, textbooks and things like that, you're going to see dark bands and light bands and certain colors emerging on upper bands and lower bands, meaning where the light and dark interact, you know, through the refraction and diffraction of the prism.

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:45,920
So what's interesting in the ancient writ, scripture, it states that the darkness was bara, or created, and the light was formed, or yitzar or asar, formed.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,800
There's a big difference between creating and forming.

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,040
There's a big difference between creating wheat or making bread and cookies and crackers and pancakes.

22
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:07,419
So the bread and the crackers and the pancakes and the cupcakes and all that is forming the wheat into something, where actually creating the wheat, let's say, is something else entirely.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,960
There's a big difference in the practice.

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah.

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:19,800
And also light doesn't travel, and the notion of a photon is ridiculous, because any light bulb is in a vacuum condition, right?

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,780
Remember years ago, even with the old incandescence, when they started getting really bright, that means the vacuum was lost and it was literally combusting and then it went out, right?

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,280
Right.

28
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,420
Yeah.

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,380
So if it's in a sealed vacuum, how does the photon go through the glass?

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,140
Right.

31
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,880
There's no mass.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,760
Nothing.

33
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,220
Yeah, there's nothing there, really.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,420
It's a wave.

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,960
Again, it goes back to magnetism.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:54,160
If you comprehend magnetism, one thing we used to do is take two same poles.

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,440
If you take two magnets, the opposite poles attract and the like poles repel.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,600
But if you rotate them a certain way, you can get the like poles to stick to each other.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,360
It's very sensitive.

40
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,840
If you just breathe on it, they'll pop apart, right?

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,980
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,500
Yeah, because the magnets are not made perfectly.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,420
There's a weaker spot and you just put the two.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,800
So if you put two norths together, they're going to repel.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,600
But within that magnet, there's a weaker north and a stronger north.

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,820
So you just keep rotating the like poles and you'll feel they repel more in one aspect of the rotation than the other.

47
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:45,520
So if you could sort of like wind them in together and get that vortex to start locking and screwing into it, just like a nut and a bolt, you'll get them to lean together and they won't repel.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,020
And this might sound like an oxymoron, but the stronger the magnet, the better it works, right?

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,060
So you're like, that doesn't sound right because the stronger magnets seem to repel more.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about.

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,100
I'm talking about screwing them together, literally screwing them together.

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,720
You ever try to put a nut right on a bolt?

53
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,140
You can't.

54
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,500
You could force it.

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,740
It seems like the bolt is repelling the nut, but once you start threading it, they wind in, right?

56
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,680
So you wind them up.

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:36,440
Okay, well, once you do this and you lean them against a table or a book or something, walk away about 50 feet or more and take another magnet in your hand and start aiming either side of the magnet towards those two magnets, and all of a sudden they fly apart at 50 feet or 100 feet.

58
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,160
So what does that tell you?

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,700
You can influence from that far away.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,700
But if you did that, let's say you had shavings like they show you on a piece of paper, that's not the magnetic field.

61
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,420
No.

62
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,620
When you put shavings on a paper plate and put the magnet on it, you see that figure eight or whatever, you're just turning those other shavings into little magnets.

63
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,800
That's not what the field really looks like.

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,360
I mean, yes, it is when you affect it that way, but you can't say that is the magnetic field.

65
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,540
Right, because there's other forces at play.

66
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,080
Right, so imagine at such a distance, light being able to reproduce that field through various materials.

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,500
That's why in the fog, light doesn't reproduce that well.

68
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,040
But through a vacuum, light reproduces very well, but there's nothing there.

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,020
It's a vacuum, yeah.

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,980
And also, light reproduces well through most gases and translucent, transparent objects.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,400
But what light doesn't seem to want to reproduce when it hits a brick wall, does it?

72
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,120
Right.

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,780
Yeah, so what do you get on the opposite side?

74
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,260
A shadow.

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,500
Is that absence of light?

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,180
But I thought the shadow was dark, but I thought the darkness was created and the light was formed.

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Right.

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,960
So what you go back to is where the light comes from.

79
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,440
And there's got to be other forces that are moving along with that particular light.

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,960
Well, yeah, the light itself is the waste product of the ether.

81
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,060
The heat that you feel is a waste product.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,880
I shouldn't say waste product, but it's way down the line meant to interact with the physical world.

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,140
Light, heat, electricity is way down the line of this ether.

84
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,200
So it's a bottom of the scale.

85
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,700
In the material world, yeah.

86
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:32,360
It's descending, yeah, that's why, you know, descending into materialism and ascending into non-materialism, right, where the things are.

87
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,020
It's always better to control...

88
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,300
When it's formed, one is created.

89
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
Sure, well, right.

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:46,400
The stuff that's created is the raw material, and the stuff that's formed is the working of that raw material.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,460
So one can say that light is the working of raw material of darkness.

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,320
Now, there is a spiritual side to this.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,800
When you're bound to the material world, as we are, meaning we can only be animated through material.

94
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,880
In other words, if you remove the material, you go into disanimation, no consciousness at this point.

95
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
The darkness tends to be a bad thing.

96
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:21,340
That's why the forces of evil tend to be associated with darkness, because it will put you into basically a death state.

97
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,640
Right.

98
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,660
And death is to be avoided, right?

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Right.

100
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,280
Yeah.

101
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:37,400
Until you can manifest the light on your own later, and understand how these things really work, and then you're no longer subject to that death state.

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:45,040
So what happens when you're no longer subject to death, you also won't be subject to darkness, unless you want it.

103
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,460
So these are interesting.

104
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,600
Now, that starts to get into more, sounds like more philosophical stuff.

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,540
Right.

106
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,640
But I call them counter-spatial issues.

107
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Like the most basic counter-spatial issue that can be explained in tradition is, you know, the thousand angels dancing on the head of a pin, but yet each angel is 30 feet tall.

108
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,760
How can you do that, right?

109
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,200
You know, so because it's a counter-spatial relationship.

110
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,920
Understanding dielectrics is a counter-spatial relationship, too.

111
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Right.

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,880
Electricity.

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,180
That's always been a weird one.

114
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,120
Well, you know, Tesla, I'll give you an example of simple bounce around with light.

115
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:40,000
Light is not much to talk about, other than it reproduces through whatever medium, and if you aim light at something, and you can't see light, by the way, if you aim light at something and don't see any other side, it's because it can't reproduce through that material.

116
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,679
It's very simple.

117
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,220
It's a wave.

118
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,820
You can never see light.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,620
You know, if you point a flashlight in pitch black, you're not going to see it.

120
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,100
You're only going to see where it lands on or, you know, where it stops to, you know, be reproduced.

121
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,500
Right.

122
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,980
I'm not talking about the dust particles and all that, because that's still a gas.

123
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:09,820
But to give a little bit of the counter-space and make it more tangible would be considering what Tesla's comments were regarding nuclear devices.

124
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,380
He says those nuclear devices they're making are but an infant's consumptive breath compared to a capacitive discharge.

125
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,980
And what he meant by that is, you know, the concept of work, you know, watt.

126
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,860
When you say watts, right, or whatever, you have, you know, slew rates and you have power factors and things like that.

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,120
But essentially, it's when you say a watt of power or energy or joules, it's versus time.

128
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,640
Correct.

129
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,640
So if I say we're going to use one watt of energy per second, well, that might be like your headphones or so, you know.

130
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,300
Or a very, very tiny speaker or a very dim light.

131
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Right.

132
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,280
Released into the environment at one watt, at a rate of one watt per second, right?

133
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,040
Right.

134
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:16,240
But what Tesla was discussing, that a capacitive discharge makes a nuclear device look like an infant's consumptive breath, is that a properly constructed capacitor, when it's fully discharged in a very short period of time, if you can get that time to go to infinity, zero, right, nanoseconds, is how you get that energy release.

135
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,600
For example, you know, we mentioned the one watt per second, right?

136
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,400
Right.

137
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,660
Well, if you can release one watt in a billionth of a second, it does the same work as a billion watts.

138
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,320
Right.

139
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:41,320
If you can release one watt in a trillionth of a second, you see, because what will happen is when it's released so fast, it creates a shock in the ambient environment.

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,840
And then you have a thermal stress or whatever, photoelectric stress.

141
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,640
And that's the basis.

142
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,860
Or is it moving into one of those situations of create and form?

143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,400
Say that again?

144
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Or is this a technique in using creation or form?

145
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,060
No, that is the counter-spatial side of things.

146
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay, right.

147
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:12,360
The counter-space, because if you say someone, I have one watt of energy, that doesn't seem like a lot, but most people would say that's not a lot of energy.

148
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:23,270
But from Tesla's point of view, if you could release that one watt in a trillion trillionth of a second, that would be like releasing an H-bomb, you see?

149
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,890
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,010
Yeah, so that's what he mentioned.

151
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,830
That's a lot of energy.

152
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,290
Well, it's not.

153
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,890
It's still that same watt.

154
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,590
Right.

155
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,130
It's just how it's being released into the environment.

156
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,030
How it's being released, right.

157
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,410
Into the environment, yeah.

158
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:36,890
Huh.

159
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:46,450
Yeah, that's why, you know, when I hear about all the crap, you know, about guns, bullets, weapons, I'm like, ah, that stuff is so primitive, you know.

160
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,250
Right.

161
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:59,670
And fortunately, the primitives or the savages on the planet rely on that, and they don't rely on more advanced thinking and application of things.

162
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,570
Like, I remember they were saying they were going to take all the guns away a few years ago.

163
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,950
Well, it's kind of stupid, because you want to just take the ammunition away.

164
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,770
Right.

165
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,250
Then they become peashooters.

166
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,610
But even if they took the guns and the ammunition away, what are they?

167
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,790
They're just high-speed chemistry projectiles, aren't they?

168
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,390
Right.

169
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,730
Powder is a chemical reaction you're relying on.

170
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,210
Mm-hmm.

171
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,870
And a high-speed chemical reaction to send a projectile.

172
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:34,790
Well, prior to that, they were launching projectiles many different ways, you know, from slings to arrows to crossbows to catapults.

173
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,670
Right.

174
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:35,990
Right.

175
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,930
And chemically, there's something called Greek fire that they still don't know what it is.

176
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,110
Right.

177
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,890
The Greeks would launch firebombs on their opponents, you know.

178
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,430
And it was chemical-based, but they say it's been lost.

179
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,590
And to a degree, it has.

180
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:02,590
But, like, for example, in the American context, they're so proud of having their arms, and they call them firearms, which they're not firearms, by the way.

181
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,210
Right.

182
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:14,030
You know, the legal definition of a firearm is a shotgun sawed off to an overall length less than 18 inches, a machine gun, chemical weapons, or a grenade.

183
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,070
Right.

184
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:21,410
So do you know how many people are sitting in jail for illegal possession of a firearm and it was just a pistol or a handgun, which doesn't qualify?

185
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,250
Oh.

186
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh, yeah.

187
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,470
It's ridiculous what's going on.

188
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:34,510
Just like I mentioned, you know, Title 21 in the U.S. Code is narcotics and all that.

189
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,350
You know how many people are in jail over possession and all that stuff?

190
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,970
Millions, right?

191
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:44,910
But what they fail to tell you, under public law 9843 or something, Title 21 has no criminal effect.

192
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,990
It's been repealed.

193
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,330
But they don't bring that up when they charge.

194
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,990
See, most people watch too much TV.

195
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,030
Right.

196
00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:00,850
So in order for you to go to jail with possession of any amount of drugs or whatever, legal or illegal, is it has to be only civil.

197
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,010
In order for it to be civil, you have to have a pretty strong sworn affidavit that you hurt someone doing that.

198
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,850
Right.

199
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,690
How does the local police put someone in jail for a joint or even a kilo of powder of some sort?

200
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,450
Because of their ignorance.

201
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,950
Now, the police don't know, obviously.

202
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,930
They don't know either.

203
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,190
The Attorney General knows and the big judges know, but they're just, you know, they're so apathetic.

204
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:35,090
Well, and that begs the question that at the point of contact, they always claim you're all, at that point, in their jurisdiction.

205
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,230
Yeah, jurisdiction is fine.

206
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,510
You can give a frog jurisdiction if you're in a pond.

207
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,970
The point is they're not doing the process.

208
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,990
First of all, it's not a judicial issue.

209
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,810
None of it is.

210
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,910
No one is in prison legally or lawfully.

211
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,770
Not even close.

212
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,830
None of this stuff is really judicial.

213
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,030
The judicial process would be, it's very easy to look up.

214
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,810
You know, people get a traffic ticket and they have to go to court.

215
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,990
That's completely illegal.

216
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,890
In order to go to court, the cop has to have a probable cause and an affidavit filed into the court before he gives you a ticket.

217
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,430
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,870
And nobody discusses this.

219
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,530
And if you do, they kind of let go, mom.

220
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,270
These things are just based on ignorance.

221
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,090
Just like, you know, the guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper in church.

222
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:23,730
Right, right.

223
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,390
That's got nothing to do with Santa Claus and all that.

224
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,070
I mean, it's got nothing.

225
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,530
They say a guy nailed to a diaper?

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,110
A guy, whatever.

227
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,330
You get the point.

228
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,950
So all this stuff is just ridiculous.

229
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,170
That's why I never, ever, ever, ever, ever get involved in current events.

230
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,750
Never discuss those things.

231
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,990
It's just the people are so far away.

232
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,590
They're going to have to take 50 steps just to go to zero.

233
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,810
Well, you know, and you and I kind of come from the same time period.

234
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,790
And you remember watching the destruction of the families.

235
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,150
You know, mom going to work and all that stuff.

236
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,410
And then you got the stupid rectangle presented on the people.

237
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,450
Before that, it was radio.

238
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,050
You used to sit around and listen to the radio.

239
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,870
Sure.

240
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,910
But I want to address one thing about the destruction of the family.

241
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:16,610
Okay.

242
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,950
From a traditional cultural point of view, it's viewed as a negative.

243
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,790
But from more of a higher point of view, it is not a negative.

244
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,910
Because what kept those families together were traditions like Christmas, Easter, and their basic religions.

245
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,450
And the gods are not having that anymore.

246
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:40,690
So you want to keep your families together, abandon all that pagan crap or the demonic crap.

247
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,710
But people would rather not.

248
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,710
So their families are being destroyed by the gods, by the way.

249
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,090
And the women's lib.

250
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,970
See, before women's lib, they didn't have to work.

251
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,070
And a man could work at the post office and make more than enough for everyone.

252
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:57,870
Well, certainly.

253
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,010
So it took it away.

254
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,970
So that's why I bring up the thing with the same-sex marriage and the LGBTQ whatever.

255
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,170
This is going to be their downfall, them coming out like this.

256
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,530
Now, people don't see it now.

257
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,329
But it's like heavy artillery, right?

258
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,030
Yeah.

259
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,890
So all of these things I don't view.

260
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,849
I try to view.

261
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,030
I don't view them personally.

262
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,750
I don't view them.

263
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:29,370
I try to view what I've experienced from how it can be seen, not how I saw it.

264
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,130
Right.

265
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,110
Like when I spoke to Ocelli at one point, I said there's a big difference.

266
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:43,610
Recently, there's a big difference discussing what you would like to know versus discussing what can be known.

267
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,950
Right.

268
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:57,270
Because once you start getting into the habit of discussing what you would like to know, you go Gustave Le Bon all the way, and then you have people like yourself around you, and then it becomes incestuous, right?

269
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,190
I mean, you know, mentally or spiritually incestuous.

270
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,390
It's like all interbreeding thoughts that are low to begin with.

271
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,870
But how about discussing what can be known and start prioritizing?

272
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,670
Food, clothing, shelter.

273
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:27,090
Yeah, you don't have to talk directly about food, clothing, and shelter, but if you look at what's discussed regarding the authorities imposing things on the people in any country, people don't take any mind to it unless it does affect food, clothing, shelter.

274
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,250
Like shelter would be banking rates for mortgages of houses and furniture and things.

275
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:46,430
Clothing perhaps would be, you know, look at how come there are more uniforms with deadly weapons, and food would be obvious, you know, the price of food to the chemicals in the food or whatever.

276
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,930
But speaking of clothing, there's a less obvious point.

277
00:18:51,130 --> 00:19:01,030
You know, if you want lawful clothing, which is non-mixed fiber, for women it's almost impossible to get undergarments these days, right?

278
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,890
And socks are another thing that are very difficult to get that are not mixed fiber.

279
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:21,070
And there's people that work with, here a little bit of an echo, people that have agreed to work in a position that wear uniform or corporate garb, they tend to be of mixed fiber as well.

280
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:28,010
So, you know, these things don't have to be, and mixed fiber doesn't mean that synthetic fiber is bad.

281
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,970
If it's synthetic fiber, it should be just synthetic fiber, right?

282
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,350
Right.

283
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:38,690
There's got to be a whole scientific premise behind all those lawful…

284
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:38,970
There is.

285
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:39,670
Yeah.

286
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,530
There is.

287
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,470
Well, the foods are pretty clear.

288
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,510
Very clear.

289
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,730
Across the board.

290
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:56,150
And vegetation is something I've never got into, but it should be with vegetables, it should be green at some point and bear fruit with seed or seed.

291
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,390
Right.

292
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,230
And seed won't come until it has a fruit around it.

293
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,570
You know, some even the thinnest membrane.

294
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:01,830
Right.

295
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,670
So, for example, mushrooms are not green.

296
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,470
They don't have seeds.

297
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,570
They don't have fruit, you know, so those are out, right?

298
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,070
Like spirulina is green.

299
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,010
They call it a superfood algae, but that doesn't bear a seed.

300
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,290
It goes through mitosis, so I don't eat that, right?

301
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,210
So the thing, just like the four-legged animal is clove and hoof, chew the cud.

302
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,950
Right.

303
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,970
It just chews the cud and it doesn't have a clove and hoof, it's out.

304
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,150
If it just has a clove and hoof, right, it has to do both, right, to a degree.

305
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,930
And it's about discernment.

306
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,590
That's what you won't find in any other ancient rites.

307
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,170
Like if you look at other things like the Koran, they don't give you discernment.

308
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,650
They don't, other things, you know, other ancient rites don't give you discernment.

309
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,190
But regarding the…

310
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:50,270
It's almost like it keeps you trained to keeping your eyes open and, like you say, always with discernment.

311
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:58,410
And there's a whole working practice of mindset in the principles.

312
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,210
Now, fibers tend to have an ethereal value.

313
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:12,010
Certain fibers are hollow, like cotton, and certain other natural fibers, and other fibers like silk are not hollow, right?

314
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:22,390
You have, for example, garments in certain priestly functions had to be of a certain full coverage, right?

315
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,670
And they give very…

316
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,150
These things affect the very subtle fields and energies.

317
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:43,070
But essentially, if you just want to break it down into layman's terms, and you can go around the universe seeing the positives and negatives of being lawful, but the bottom line is when you do these things, you do them to show allegiance.

318
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,970
Because your father told you to do that.

319
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,690
Right.

320
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,910
Like let's say you're a child and you are…

321
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,870
In other words, you get your law from your God.

322
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,090
You're invulnerable or not.

323
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,710
Right.

324
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:03,690
If your father says, let's say you're eight years old, if I was to be home at quarter to five and everyone else is at five, and all the children say, well, why can't you stay until five?

325
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,470
My dad said, I have to be in at a quarter to five.

326
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,230
And you're like, why?

327
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,030
He says, well, I don't know.

328
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,930
It's good enough for me.

329
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,790
All he has to do is say it.

330
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,610
Exactly.

331
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,710
So one way to…

332
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:26,510
Once you go around the blocks, in the beginning when you get turned on to certain information, you're like, oh, there's got to be a good scientific or plausible reason beyond just it being stated in a writ from 3,000 years ago.

333
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,590
And you can still explore all that, but the bottom line is it shows allegiance, right?

334
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,390
Right.

335
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,110
Yes, it's divided.

336
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,510
There's a lot of division, and that will not change, but you always want to be on the winning side.

337
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:50,970
Like if I said to you, you're going to play a game and there are two teams, and Team A is going to win and Team B is going to lose.

338
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,090
Which team do you want to join?

339
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,570
You'd have to be a terrible tactician to join Team B, right?

340
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,490
Correct.

341
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,770
Or other things.

342
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,050
And there are people that say, yes, I'll join Team B.

343
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,650
So it's up to you again.

344
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,470
One thing you'll notice in the ancient writ known as the scriptures, it's all based on free will.

345
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,830
If you look at what's called the lawful sections, it must be a free will offering.

346
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,410
You must bring it on your free will.

347
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,750
There's no conversion.

348
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,770
There's no convincing.

349
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,070
There's no selling of an idea.

350
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,650
That's one thing you'll notice in the ancient writ.

351
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,750
There's no racism or prejudicing.

352
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:41,870
It's if whoever comes in, let's say a foreigner, a sojourner, a stranger, a different color or race or whatever, it doesn't matter what they look like or what they did in the past.

353
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:48,690
If they are aware of what you do that is lawful and they pledge to do that, you accept them as one of your own.

354
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,010
You won't find that.

355
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,810
Like in a lot of the Western cultures that had strong Christian ethic, they had segregation and all that.

356
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,870
Oh, usually, yeah.

357
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:06,270
But it was only for that reason because of the color of your skin or whatever or your race, let's say.

358
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,050
You were bad just because of that.

359
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:16,470
In those other cultures, the visitor or whoever was always welcome.

360
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,670
Well, they were welcome once they agreed to understand what was lawful in your culture and they would do it.

361
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,330
Right.

362
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:35,470
So it doesn't matter if you went into ancient Israel as a China man or a black man or an American Indian or whatever different shade of Eastern Indian or a different shade of Asian.

363
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,870
There's like seven or eight different types of Asian people you could say easily.

364
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:48,950
Wherever you look like or came from, if you were aware of what was lawful in this society and you agreed to do it, you were integrated.

365
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,330
You were welcomed amongst them.

366
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:59,070
But when it came time to, let's say, intermarrying, they would suggest that you find one of your own so your child ends up being like you.

367
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,930
That was really something where they kept that bloodline.

368
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,790
Yes, to keep your bloodline.

369
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:12,990
And the reason why they did it more back then, believe it or not, is because intuitively they knew it was a long way to go still.

370
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,410
Right now it doesn't matter because you don't have a long way to go.

371
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,530
I mean it always matters.

372
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:27,330
But as the way things are in society, only 5% of you are going to be around in less than 14 and a half years or let's say 10% on the outside, right?

373
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,050
Right.

374
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,210
So it's quite a hit on the population.

375
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:38,030
And really when 90% of the population is wiped out, it's going to look like everyone's gone in some places, right?

376
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,770
Right.

377
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,130
So in a big city especially, right?

378
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,130
It'll look like you ever go to New York City on a Sunday afternoon and it's raining.

379
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,470
It looks empty.

380
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,430
Or Chicago, right?

381
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,590
It's like where did everybody go?

382
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,910
That's what it'll be like.

383
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:04,770
So these things are interesting to ponder and think about but I always like to bring it back home to something simple.

384
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:14,350
And the simplest way for anything or any subject, even quote unquote scientific or objectivity, is how can you use that information now?

385
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:29,630
The bottom line is if you do a three-hour discussion or let's say write a long paper on something, why do you have to – there should be something along the way, each chapter, each whatever.

386
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,370
So whoever puts the book down or stops listening at that point already has something they could use practically, right?

387
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,150
Right.

388
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,930
That's the point of I think communicating at this point.

389
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:51,410
I should say otherwise I would just go away and not say anything and part of it – I actually have done that since the last thing on AFR.

390
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,490
I was thinking, oh, man, I put out so much stuff, not just information but points of view and all that.

391
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,030
There's going to be plenty of people who are going to pick this up and run with it, right?

392
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,870
And it just hasn't happened.

393
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:12,250
I touched on a lot of different subjects for possible future times and a lot of them sound pretty good.

394
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,250
Oh, yeah.

395
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,150
Just scratching the surface.

396
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,590
Yeah, but the whole thing is, again, the two whole things is this.

397
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,450
Like I mentioned earlier,

398
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,850
I don't talk about what's going on right now in current events

399
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,130
or anything like that unless it actually leads to what I've discussed in the past

400
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,790
sort of in a subjective way, meaning how the society is going to change

401
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,650
because it's just such a dummy load, right, everything that's out there

402
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,950
and pretty much everyone that's speaking out there

403
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,550
is pretty much just dummy loading the public.

404
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:48,870
There might be occasionally some information that's sort of valid, but then it's like trying to eat corn out of somebody's poop.

405
00:27:50,750 --> 00:28:00,290
And then there's the aspect of why aren't the most obvious things being discussed?

406
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:09,790
And then the other aspect of that is why is what people use as a reference is not within that reference itself?

407
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,350
Just like I say, there's no religion that knows anything in the text that they allege to subscribe to.

408
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,570
You see?

409
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,550
There's no proper use of references, I should say.

410
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,070
So that needs to be sort of discerned.

411
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,590
It's like their whole vocabulary was dumbed down right along with everything else.

412
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:55,410
Well, yeah, there's the way words are being used and then there was what they really mean, but the people are so casual and indifferent that at this point one of the major ways to get any change of mindset is to capture proper and have command over the definition of words, not just the words themselves, you know, speaking them, but the definitions.

413
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,530
I'll give you an example.

414
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:11,310
I recently got someone reached out with an email and he said, I looked up the etymology of the word version and it shows how it's used in different languages, but actually the meaning of it as you get to the bottom of the etymological definition means to destroy something.

415
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,830
So the King James Version actually destroys the scriptures.

416
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,230
So I found that to be a very interesting definition.

417
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:34,890
So if anyone wants to go to the etymology, Etymonline, look up the word version, V-E-R-S-I-O-N, read through the uses in various English and French cultures, and then as you get to the bottom it says means to destroy or destruction of.

418
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,910
And that was a really good, I'm glad that was brought forward.

419
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,490
So there's more to go.

420
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:59,370
And I've been saying that indirectly to some capacity, but I would say that if you, let's say a comprehender, can command the definition of the word version as being a form of destruction, you can emphasize it.

421
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,330
And it is.

422
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,970
So many times you hear when someone doesn't like what someone else is saying, you say, well that's your version.

423
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,950
It's a whole different spin on it.

424
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,780
What's your version of the truth, right?

425
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,700
Right.

426
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,540
That would be the most twisted.

427
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,900
That would be perfect for all the alternative or independent media.

428
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,900
That would be great.

429
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:43,180
That's exactly what they, no reason to harp on the morons out there in the world, but because they don't like it when you call them moronic or their listeners moronic or any researcher is a moronic, but that's why they go into the oxymoronic stage.

430
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,140
There's another interesting thing.

431
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,560
It's really difficult to also glean objectivity from, quote, unquote, researchers.

432
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:06,480
You've got researchers doing all kinds of stuff out there on mainstream and alternative, and when you read their stuff, it's quite far from being objective, you know, in most cases.

433
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,340
So that's another pitiful thing to look at.

434
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,120
But it's actually all quite simple once you start.

435
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:27,080
In other words, you don't have to do a lot of work in a particular field or direction to discover what can be objectified just by having command of the definition of words.

436
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,140
We had a question when we were talking about the Title 20, what was it, Title 21?

437
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah, not near the notes.

438
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,680
Do you want me to look through some notes and pull that up?

439
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,420
Yeah, yeah, please.

440
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,280
Okay.

441
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,300
Yeah, that's a goodie, because how many people are wrongfully imprisoned?

442
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,440
Well, ultimately, if you make a point of this, the prosecutor, attorney general, judge says, well, they agreed to it.

443
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
Right, and there's entrapment, yes.

444
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,220
Yeah, and they all do that, yeah.

445
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:16,980
Well, you know, they're part of the justice religion, and also they represent the adversary boots on the ground.

446
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,440
Right, right.

447
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,300
Just like, for example, the Pope represents ball boots on the ground, right, and various other.

448
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:34,760
All of the majority of the religious figures represent some form of ball, you know, lord.

449
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,700
And they tell you, they tell you, we represent or worship the lord.

450
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,360
They tell you.

451
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,660
Here we go.

452
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:51,100
It's 18 U.S.C. 4201 is repealed, public law, it's public law 98-473, Title 2.

453
00:32:51,520 --> 00:33:07,900
So it's public law 98-473, Title 2, subsection 218A5, which is October 12, 1984, 98stat.2027. And if it sounds like they're hiding it, yes.

454
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:17,780
And it's actually, you will find this on the U.S. Government Publishing Office, and it says in their motto, Keeping America Informed.

455
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:32,920
And they passed this in 1984 to take effect in three years, so anyone that's gone to prison for criminal violation on anything narcotics, which is Title 21, is illegal and unlawful, and it's against public law.

456
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,660
I'll drop this into the...

457
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,960
The notes that we're going to create for your...

458
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
Yeah, maybe later.

459
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:47,620
Because if you scroll down, it says everything that's been affected is Title 21, and I just clicked Title 21, and when you go down...

460
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,420
Now, this is not as clear as it might seem.

461
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,120
You're going to have to do some researching, because remember, what...

462
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,460
Could you imagine figuring out how this works?

463
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,340
Right.

464
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:06,020
Could you imagine the kind of reparations they're going to have to pay to all the millions of people that are in jail for, you know, 100 tons of cocaine or a joint and everything in between?

465
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,500
Yeah.

466
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,400
Yeah, they're not going to take that too well.

467
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,199
No, they'd rather blow themselves...

468
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,239
They'd rather blow the country up before doing this, you know.

469
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:15,760
Yeah.

470
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,760
It's funny, it says on the top, U.S. Government Publishing, or Keeping America Informed, and yes, they are.

471
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,820
Oh, yes, they are.

472
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,480
And if you scroll down to Chapter...

473
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,860
If you go down to Title 21, it's got all the sections, Chapter 1 all the way to Chapter 24.

474
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,880
It's got all of that.

475
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,020
All the way down to International Narcotics and Trafficking has been repealed.

476
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,540
Biomaterial...

477
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,620
Actually, I enabled...

478
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,679
I clicked on 21 before I put in the link.

479
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:50,300
You scroll down, and all of Title 21 has been repealed as being criminal, because 18 U.S.C. is sentencing, basically.

480
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:50,840
Right.

481
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah, which is, you know, what...

482
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,400
So anyway, go ahead and wrap your head around...

483
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,240
There's a guy named Rod Class who made a point.

484
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,660
He hasn't really made much of a point.

485
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,900
He's another good guy to look up.

486
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,560
I said another good...

487
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,840
But Rod Class, he's a...

488
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:09,540
You know, I wouldn't say take it with a grain of salt, but you have to sift through a lot of his stuff to get the good stuff also.

489
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,380
But lately, a couple of years ago, he did put out some good things.

490
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,120
But no one else is really discussing it.

491
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
There's a few other people.

492
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,360
A guy up in Washington discussed this for a while.

493
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,780
There's a story I could tell you where...

494
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,460
This is before all the medical marijuana and all that.

495
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,000
This was more than 15 years ago.

496
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,820
Someone was growing 100 plants, and they came and busted the house and took all the plants and all that.

497
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,520
He was like, you can't do that according to law, you know, using this statute and other things, right?

498
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,680
They ignored him.

499
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,600
But finally, he pushed back, and they said, yeah, you can.

500
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,960
And he's growing them for medicinal purposes.

501
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,600
But he gets a traffic ticket or something later on, and he goes back into court, same judge, and he starts rolling a joint in the courtroom.

502
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,320
And the judge is like, what are you doing?

503
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,120
And he says, I'm going to take my medicine.

504
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,680
This was in Washington State about a decade and a half ago.

505
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,140
And the judge says, you can't do that here.

506
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,360
Go smoke that in the bathroom.

507
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,860
So he does it.

508
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
He goes to the bathroom, and he's smoking the joint in the bathroom.

509
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
And in walks just the bailiff.

510
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,220
He can use the bathroom.

511
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,200
And he says, what are you doing?

512
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,580
And before he answers, he throws the guy in handcuffs, brings him into the courtroom.

513
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,440
And he says, this guy is smoking a joint in the bathroom in a courthouse.

514
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,020
And the judge says, yeah, because I told him to.

515
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,720
So, I mean, this is like a skit out of – this is true, by the way.

516
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,420
Yeah, or Cheech and Chong or something.

517
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,620
But I'm telling you, if you understand how these things work, and you push it a little bit.

518
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,140
But nowadays, the people are so savage, you know, from the people little grandma.

519
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,340
I could prove to you any little grandma generally is savage.

520
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:57,820
All the way to the attorneys, to the doctors, to the judges, to all the lawyers, your parents, whatever, they're operating on a savage level.

521
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,460
In other words, they have ingrained in their minds that it is illegal and awful.

522
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,220
You'll go to jail.

523
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:15,380
And when they beat you up for trying to push the issue that it's not, the people that you know will not sympathize, back you up, because they already have decided that it's illegal in their own minds, right?

524
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,560
And I get into that with the old people.

525
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,480
Why do they throw them in nursing homes with diapers, bad food, and they die in a pool of shit, basically, with drugs?

526
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,660
It's because if you look at the American family and the Western family, it's grandma that wants to get everybody together for Christmas, right?

527
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,200
And if you don't travel across the country, you're bad.

528
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,220
She guilt trips you, right?

529
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,120
Because guess who's the pillar of this stuff?

530
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,060
So, this is really harsh.

531
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:46,800
This goes against what people think is – that's why when you look at Scripture, it says what you think is good is really evil.

532
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,460
So, that's why they're being thrown into nursing homes and treated the way they are.

533
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:58,180
It's not because of bad on the children being neglectful.

534
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,600
No, it's because of the sign of the times.

535
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,140
The gods are not having it anymore.

536
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,880
Destroy that family.

537
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:13,280
Yeah, and they're doing it because the family, if they don't – there's enough information for the family to realize that what they're doing is downright satanic or ball worship.

538
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,780
I mean, that's not a secret.

539
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,920
It never really was.

540
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,900
All they have to do is ask, like, three questions in five minutes, and then now they're on the path to figure it out.

541
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,000
But because they're not doing it, now these events have to slow down and stop.

542
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:33,320
Well, what you do is destroy the family because if you destroy the family, these events start to become less frequent.

543
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,300
But they haven't yet because they still do Black Friday and all that and all the people line up at Walmart and all that.

544
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,720
But that will still prevail to a certain degree.

545
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,760
But go after the family first is what the gods are doing.

546
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,960
We're talking about the benevolent gods now.

547
00:38:49,720 --> 00:39:02,860
That's why if you look at Scripture, especially I don't like to recommend the Book of Revelation, but all that destruction on man's society, not the earth, on man's society, because remember the earth is going to be helping it out, is done by the good guys, not the bad guys.

548
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,360
The bad guys don't do that kind of stuff because they want you to keep doing what you're doing.

549
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,080
You see?

550
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,560
So anyway, yeah, it's an interesting thing.

551
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,520
A whole different look on it.

552
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,700
Well, it is.

553
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,180
I don't know any other way to do it.

554
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,320
There is none.

555
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,060
There really is none.

556
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,840
Yeah.

557
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,380
Oh, actually there are, but they're just not objective.

558
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,160
Right, right.

559
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:32,720
I believe last night's conversation on if you were put in charge.

560
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,400
We'll leave that alone.

561
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,220
Oh, yeah.

562
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,080
Well, it's very easy to fix any country.

563
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,520
I think you could fix any country and bring it almost to a perfect society within a month.

564
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,440
Yeah.

565
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,900
If it's a rural society, it might take six months because you can't really get to everyone as quickly.

566
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,980
Yeah, but we'll get into that in a few.

567
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,180
It's a little harsh for people.

568
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:57,880
It is.

569
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,260
But to put it this way, a lot of Disclaimer and warning on that.

570
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,960
Yeah, 10% to 30% of the population will not survive it.

571
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,700
But at least it'll be overt.

572
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:16,040
It won't be covert like it is now because right now you're losing 10% to 20% of the population every 10 years anyway through that negligence system, right?

573
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,220
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,600
A million from the doctors and another quarter of a million or so from the other.

575
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,020
Yeah, so just in America alone.

576
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,860
So what they call the states.

577
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,520
Yeah, it's pretty harsh.

578
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
But right now you're at a time where you're in the credits.

579
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,760
The gods are going to do it.

580
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:34,900
Yep.

581
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,320
Which is going to be something to behold.

582
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,380
Worse than what you would have done.

583
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,840
Oh, yeah.

584
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,940
Oh, yeah, much worse.

585
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,040
Actually, no, I think they're going to be better at it.

586
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh, yeah.

587
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,500
Yeah.

588
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,620
Yeah.

589
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,660
Technically.

590
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,920
Yeah, what I've suggested, by the way, to clean up society is not for this society.

591
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,880
It wouldn't go over very well.

592
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,540
No.

593
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,720
But it will be the norm for the next society, by the way, of mankind.

594
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,160
So, yeah.

595
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,720
You won't have doctors and lawyers and things like that in the next society.

596
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,480
And you won't have these entitled classes.

597
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:31,200
And you will have certain entitlements, certain people of authority, but they're going to be working for the benevolent side of mankind.

598
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,080
So they'll be representing the benevolent, not the malevolent.

599
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,840
Right now all of you are entitled.

600
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,300
You're professors, you're priests, you're rabbis, you're doctors, you're lawyers.

601
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,380
You're psychiatrists.

602
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,260
All these people that are viewed as high.

603
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,720
They all are representing the adversary at this point.

604
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,440
They don't know it, which sometimes might make it worse, right?

605
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:06,040
Because that means there's no way they can control it or have a feeling or a sense of what they're doing to change it.

606
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,840
They think it's okay.

607
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,660
Now, of course, the ones that do know it might be a little worse.

608
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,420
Actually, they're going to be held to a much higher standard.

609
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah.

610
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:25,440
But at least the ones that do know it can be confronted on it and there could be a rational exchange dialogue.

611
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,180
But if you go to a priest and say, well, you're really working for the devil, let's say, and using those simple terms.

612
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,140
Or an attorney, you know you're working for Satan, right?

613
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,560
And he's like, no, I don't see it.

614
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,180
But if you go to a high-up attorney, like an old guy, he knows that.

615
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,880
Like a high-up, if you go to the Vatican, you know that they have allegiance to certain ancient deities.

616
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:53,380
That's why when you hear a lot of the child molestation, what they're doing is they're emulating the bishops.

617
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:07,620
The bishops have allegiance to an ancient deity, which the way you evoke this entity is by inflicting pain on a child through sexual means.

618
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:08,940
Wow.

619
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:09,880
Yeah.

620
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,560
And this has gotten around.

621
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,020
It's not because they're horny because they can't marry to whatever celibacy.

622
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,660
It's because they're being inspired and influenced by this.

623
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,760
This is the norm in what they call the Catholic religion.

624
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,900
And, of course, they have a lot of followers and all that.

625
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,860
And it's also the norm in many other older sort of sequestered places, like in Afghanistan.

626
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,880
It's very normal to have little boys raped in rural places of Afghanistan.

627
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,520
People don't know this.

628
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,080
And if you ask, why is this being done, it's because of a particular religious right.

629
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,300
But it's gotten to the point where they don't know.

630
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,280
They can't give you specifics.

631
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,680
And Saudi Arabia.

632
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah.

633
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,920
Saudis are an interesting mix.

634
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
And the camel thing, you know.

635
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,960
Well, that's what you mean, like bestiality?

636
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:04,740
Or eating?

637
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,160
No, the jockeys.

638
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,260
Usually they're a very exploited group.

639
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,140
Okay.

640
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,980
Give us a little more.

641
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,140
You want to present that?

642
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,120
I've just said they are first picked, let's say, for sexual exploitation.

643
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,700
The jockey or the camel?

644
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,600
The jockey.

645
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,640
Oh, I see.

646
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:27,900
Yeah.

647
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,780
I haven't heard anything about the camel.

648
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,000
I'll keep you apprised, though.

649
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,820
Yeah, that's one entity.

650
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,840
Another lord is insisting allegiance and evocation by people cutting on themselves.

651
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
And you'll notice that in the Book of Kings.

652
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,080
That's weird.

653
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,660
Yeah, that's why if you see some people from the continent of Africa, they immigrate here.

654
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:57,460
In some places in the Caribbean, you'll see very fine cuts on their cheeks in geometric patterns, like a keloid scar in a geometric pattern.

655
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,700
And the genital mutilation and all that other stuff.

656
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,440
Sure, that's all inspired.

657
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,280
A lot of what they call homosexuality is also part of the religion.

658
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,620
And the way that it inspires people is through the way you're inspired, through a dream.

659
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,320
So people can be inspired.

660
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,700
Inspired means to be affected by the gods while they're awake.

661
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:32,120
These social, cultural things that you see coming around are not, by happenstance or random or Gustave Le Bon crowd mentality.

662
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,980
And even if you get into the book with Gustave Le Bon, he discusses it.

663
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,500
And Gustave Le Bon was censored also, but he did a bang-up job on most of that book.

664
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,020
And I'm not recommending the book.

665
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,100
I'm just saying it's a place to go see something more objectively or clearly on the matter.

666
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,700
But he even suggests…

667
00:45:48,740 --> 00:46:00,660
Yeah, but he'll bring up the point also several times, or at least one time I remember, that there is a supernatural element that brings crowds together that can't be explained.

668
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,380
He was not aware because he has that Christian-Judeo ethic.

669
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,200
That kind of hampered him in his writings.

670
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,800
Someone put in chat, scripture, numerology, and how to approach as a novice.

671
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,360
There's numerics.

672
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,560
There's many levels of numerology and numerics and what they might call gematria.

673
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,040
But that is more like looking at fingerprints to prove that there's a complex system.

674
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:41,120
There's another level of it where you look at numbers and numerology like that to understand a communication because numbers are the most rational way to communicate something.

675
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,380
So like seven has always been viewed as something fortunate or they say lucky.

676
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,540
It's also the number of the divine.

677
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,340
I think I've gone through the number four and one and seven and how to break up seven.

678
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,200
Six is the number of man.

679
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,720
Five comes before man, man system, or what man has been into.

680
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,700
So that's pretty much a simple thing.

681
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,360
There are numbers that keep adding up and presenting rational communication.

682
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,760
But as a novice, the only suggestion I would make there is understand when you see the number seven, the number four is the first position.

683
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,740
It's considered four as the head of it.

684
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,320
Imagine the number four in the center, three on the left, three on the right, and that's the number seven.

685
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,880
And the first one is last and the last is first.

686
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,760
So the seventh one and the first one are interchangeable.

687
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,720
And this is from a cardinal point of view, not an ordinal point of view.

688
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,580
Where ordinal would be I have seven items, here's one item, here's a second item, here's a third item.

689
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:46,200
That doesn't mean that's ordinal, meaning ordinary or whatever way of counting.

690
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:53,040
But cardinal is we say this is the first one, this is the second one that I've got, this is the third one, this is the fourth.

691
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,960
That's more cardinal where they come in sequence.

692
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:10,500
So you can view the number seven in both ways where the fourth position is first, whether it's ordinal or cardinal, whether it was the fourth one in sequence or whether it's the fourth one that was given to you which could have been, let's say, the first one.

693
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:18,500
And what happens very often when you look at ordinal sequences of seven, the fourth item that was presented is the one that gets prominence.

694
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:27,940
And later on you'll find that got that prominence because it really was the first one in position in time or it just later on adds up to be that way.

695
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,480
So there's no real novice way to look at it.

696
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:40,260
The novice thing is just be conscious of seven and three because three comes right before four, right?

697
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,080
And then be conscious of five, six, and seven.

698
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,580
All right?

699
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,980
But really, yeah, there's ordinal.

700
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,640
A lot of things in scripture you have to think of as being ordinal or cardinal.

701
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,340
A simple way to do that is ordinal will be I've got six eggs in a basket.

702
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,020
Actually, eggs are not eggs.

703
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,280
Let's say things we get through time.

704
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,580
Let's say cars.

705
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,920
I've got three cars outside.

706
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:15,800
An ordinal way to describe the cars would be, hey, here's a car, here's a second car, and here's a third car.

707
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:26,180
A cardinal way would be this is the first car I got, all right, and this is the second car I acquired, and this is the third car I acquired.

708
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,060
So that's cardinal.

709
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,380
You have the first car, second car, third car versus a car.

710
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,340
Here's a second car and here's a third car.

711
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,140
The first car in the ordinal could have been the third one that I've got.

712
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,940
You see there's no sequence here being shown.

713
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,380
You'll have to sort that out.

714
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,780
In the King James, you don't get that, by the way.

715
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:52,600
In your English versions, you don't get a difference between cardinal and sequential ordinal.

716
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,060
I don't know.

717
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,620
Did I preface that okay?

718
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,960
I think you did.

719
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,980
I think you did well.

720
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,120
Even the last time when we were talking about it, it took a bit.

721
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,040
You did well.

722
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:10,940
All right.

723
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,660
Keeping that attitude going through things.

724
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:22,600
The whole thing on numerology to begin with, that's a whole different world, but it has the potential for opening things.

725
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,660
It does.

726
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:29,420
But numerology itself and the gematria and all that transcends the ordinal and cardinal usually.

727
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,920
Yeah, and there's got to be a lot more at play still to be discovered.

728
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,660
Sure, sure, sure.

729
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,460
But I'd like to maybe bring things up to speed as time goes on.

730
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,860
Stuff that has been bouncing around in the head for the past decade that I haven't brought up at all would be interesting to see what else people can do with it.

731
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,420
But it's not a TV sitcom.

732
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:05,260
Believe it or not, most of the stuff I've been doing over the years to address the TV sitcom mentality is where you have it all neatly wrapped up in 30 minutes or an hour and the world is saved in the end, right?

733
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,400
You don't want to do that.

734
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,280
You can't.

735
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,520
Most things are not like that.

736
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:18,760
There is going to be a level of introduction to the introduction to the introduction, and then you get to the meat of the matter, and then you have to show how it all ties together.

737
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:32,440
So essentially, I would say to anyone, I get a lot of commentary and communications privately in e-mails and even comments about newcomers to scripture.

738
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:53,140
And for the people that are new to it and they have zeal, meaning they want to put extra time and make more of an effort than normal to learn it or see what's in there, keep in mind there are biblical scholars going back even 1,000 years or 2,000 years that have devoted their entire lives, entire lives.

739
00:51:53,540 --> 00:52:06,540
I've met some of them recently, some 70- or 80-year-old heads that started studying scripture at 12, and they went to all the universities and taught at university, Bible colleges, theology, and all that, and they couldn't grasp the communication.

740
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,600
They memorized it and could tell you where things were, but they couldn't string it all together.

741
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,600
It was just like having a box of beads and not a necklace, you know?

742
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,080
They didn't know how to string this thing, this whole communication together.

743
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:32,040
So whether you're new or old at it, and that's why when I see people that are new at it, I'm like, how do you just tell them, just try to get what's being communicated out of it communicated to you.

744
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,120
Are you getting the communication, right?

745
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,000
And the answer to that is no when you look at most historical aspects of it.

746
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,960
You can go on the stupid rectangle, and there's websites I haven't done any

747
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,220
searches on, but I'm sure it hasn't changed in over a decade,

748
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,820
on any subject scriptural, and there might be a little nugget in there,

749
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,020
or something that's true, and then they spin off into some crazy

750
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,480
churchianity or crazy Christianity or Judaism and stuff that's not in

751
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,180
scripture, and they try to, you know, read into it, right?

752
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:22,140
But again, remember when you were talking last night, and you mentioned that about one of the guys, one of the priests, or people who studied scripture all their life, and they gave you a little nugget, and it was like, you know, you guys have been going at this for 25 years or 30 years, and this guy just gave it away for free.

753
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,780
Oh, yeah, exactly.

754
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,620
Like I'd bring up, I'd run into, I figured, you know, if I want to learn about scripture, go to people that say they're learned in it.

755
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,980
And I realized from the little that I had studied, what they were saying was not in there.

756
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,420
It was religious stuff.

757
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:45,740
And when I would bring up how things were not, what they were believing or saying was, you know, part of the doctrine, it was not in scripture, they got rubbed the wrong way.

758
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,060
But occasionally they would bring up, when I would bear them enough, and I figured I'd have to disconnect from that.

759
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,980
I would ask a question, and they'd say, hey, listen, this is not really known, but check it out.

760
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
They'd ask me the question.

761
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,940
I said, no, I don't know the answer to that, but look right here.

762
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,640
And they'd point to it, and I said, wow, I read that, and I didn't see that.

763
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,320
And they're like, wow, thanks for pointing that out and how that connects to the other side.

764
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,400
But they just had one little nugget like that.

765
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:08,880
Yeah.

766
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:16,160
If you brought up timekeeping or there is no crucifixion or, you know, what's going on, they said, no, no, no, we don't want to get into that.

767
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:21,160
We've heard of something like that, but we don't want to get into that because that divides people and all that.

768
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,800
And I'm like, what?

769
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,800
Okay, I'm out of here, you know.

770
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,720
But at least I thanked them.

771
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,740
In the beginning I said, oh, he's a dirty-ass pagan, you know, and walk away.

772
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,700
But after a while I was like, you know, this guy spent his whole life studying this to discover this nugget, and he just gave it to me, right?

773
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,140
And I'm like, I've got to thank him for it and walk away.

774
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:39,920
Exactly.

775
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:48,120
Just because he thinks church is a good thing or whatever, and Christmas, you know, I'm not going to mock him for it, I mean, even though he deserves it.

776
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,260
And that shouldn't be done either.

777
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,000
No, it shouldn't.

778
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:02,840
As you mature in this, you'll see that what that is is getting – that's why I came up with the analogy of eating undigested corn out of somebody's poop.

779
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,700
That's tasteless.

780
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,740
But, you know, if you find a gold nugget in someone's poop, you could actually wash it off and make it clean.

781
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,940
So these were actual real nuggets I was getting from certain people here and there.

782
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:22,100
And then I walked away, and I realized this is not really that good because these people have dedicated their lives to this, and I haven't gotten much.

783
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,800
So guess what?

784
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,440
If I want to get more, I have to do it on my own.

785
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:40,080
And my point was always don't get wrapped around the axle, as they say, on what everyone else and everything else that you've heard about it.

786
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:53,000
When you go into subject matter, try to view it with clear eyes, as if you're seeing it for the first time objectively, and then comprehend that it also can connect to another part of the Scripture, right?

787
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,180
Metaphorically, to show you that there's a repeat of an event or an influence.

788
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,920
And always bear that in mind.

789
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,980
It's called harmonization.

790
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:09,740
And just to go back to those that study Scripture, I've read Usher and Newton's work and these great minds, whatever, and they were censored.

791
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,900
They didn't know.

792
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,200
And so why am I so encouraged to speak on this now?

793
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:22,760
Because the time that these men are considered greats in this field, even the 70- or 80-year-old heads that I met, it was not time yet.

794
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,180
One of the promises of being in this time is that everything will be opened up.

795
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,760
So you can see it.

796
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,720
It's right in front of you.

797
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,240
Do you remember a film called It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?

798
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:34,680
Yeah.

799
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,160
With the treasure.

800
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:46,660
And they had to find the big W, and they couldn't find the W, and one guy's leaning against the location of the treasure was the W, and they're all looking on the ground, buildings.

801
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:53,860
Finally, a bunch of people are leaning against a car, and they're tired, and they see some palm trees in the distance and W, remember that?

802
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,540
Yeah.

803
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,560
And they're like, there's the W.

804
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,500
And they're like, wow, was that easy, huh?

805
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,500
It was just sticking out of the ground in front of everyone all the time.

806
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:03,800
Right?

807
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,780
Something like that.

808
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
I think I caught it right there.

809
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,520
That's a spoiler.

810
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,570
The communication of Scripture is very simple.

811
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:25,670
I always used to pride myself I can explain Scripture in 30 seconds or 100 words or less or 50 words or less, all of it, even though people are just trying to say it can't be comprehended.

812
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,870
You've got to be mocking the gods.

813
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:42,570
You mean if the gods are all-knowing, and especially the Most High, and they give you a communication that everyone thinks cannot be communicated or comprehended, wouldn't you say that's an act of futility?

814
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:43,750
Right.

815
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,490
Right?

816
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,910
They don't act in futility.

817
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:59,970
So once you understand their timing and all that, but generally even in 10 seconds to describe Scripture, you have an unseen intangible society that has a leader, and that leader is making a personal family of new beings.

818
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,150
And right now we are not in that society.

819
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,450
We're in a little tank known as materialism.

820
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:11,710
And we're getting the harshest treatment in order to go to the next level.

821
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,490
It's very simple.

822
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,550
And the rest, that's all it is.

823
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,010
It's like a video game.

824
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,450
You're on stage one for people to use that.

825
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,610
Or if you're reading a novel or something, it's the beginning of the adventure.

826
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:26,870
Right?

827
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:27,730
Right.

828
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:40,470
And it was interesting that because we are in matter manifested, that was one of the big battles and divided a whole bunch.

829
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:42,610
Yeah.

830
00:58:42,790 --> 00:59:02,470
Essentially what you'll get out of it is it's a race to make the most out of us being so limited and showing that us being limited through material, that we'll never pursue and grasp the higher things that are immaterial, but at the same time we're supposed to grasp the best of what we have in material.

831
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:15,070
Being able to create spirits on that side is one thing, but making a spirit that is only animated through material was very objectionable.

832
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,770
That's how we are.

833
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,190
Almost like the prosecutor, you know?

834
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,430
Showing his defense and here's the example.

835
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,490
Perhaps.

836
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,190
Yeah.

837
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,210
Kind of an interesting flow in a lot of the reading.

838
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,580
Okay, I'm back.

839
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,020
I just had to plug something in.

840
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,980
How are we doing on time?

841
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,480
Let's see.

842
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:49,340
We are currently at 2 hours, 8 minutes, 58 seconds.

843
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,860
Why don't we just call it a whatever for now?

844
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,920
This is just a beta test.

845
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,740
Maybe we'll do one more and we'll start scheduling.

846
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,060
Nicely done, by the way.

847
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,060
Okay, good.

848
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,140
Nicely done.

849
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,120
Yeah, nothing planned, just throwing stuff out, seeing the audio and all that.

850
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,660
Let's see how it comes out on archive.

851
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,780
You could also edit it.

852
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:10,760
Correct.

853
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:21,280
I'm going to probably break this down into two separate hours, fade in and out with the Bach music when we come back to chat and all that.

854
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:22,540
Okay.

855
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,780
It's just a beta.

856
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,740
We'll nice it out and this will be the test 2 of the beta.

857
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,060
Okay, yeah, the test 2, I mean test 2.

858
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,160
Yeah, test 2 or the part 2 with the archive.

859
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,340
Yeah, we'll see how it works.

860
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,140
Yeah.

861
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,020
Okay, thanks, sir.

862
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:50,120
We'll get those links in your folder and get that set up tonight and look forward to many new treats as always.

863
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:55,760
Same here, and I'll redo the Uncommon Radio site to reflect that there's some events coming.

864
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,040
Yeah, maybe there's a simulcasting we can do.

865
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,100
There's all sorts of tricks of the trade, I guess, as they say.

866
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:07,360
Yep, and I think I'm going to be also experimenting with electronic credit transfers.

867
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,760
I think we discussed it and I might do a discussion on that.

868
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:11,660
That's right.

869
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:21,260
I might actually do, believe it or not, a PayPal, only because I discovered that a way to do it lawfully, even though they don't provide a way to do it lawfully.

870
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:32,920
So I think it's going to be quite an interesting thing, because one of the things about you're never going to get lawful money, but Title 12, Section 411 just shows that you have to have evidence that you're demanding it.

871
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:33,580
Right.

872
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:33,900
Right?

873
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:34,820
Right.

874
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:48,100
I think I've come around and figured a way to do it, and it might be a way for anyone who wants to contribute to the cause and show some gratitude that can be done that way.

875
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,440
I have pretty much everything that I need.

876
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,020
In other words, if I needed shelter, a cardboard box would do fine, right?

877
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,420
You just said you need shelter.

878
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:08,020
But the thing is, if anyone wants to contribute or do exchange or whatever or show appreciation, it can be done.

879
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:31,240
If I was on the other end, one thing I'd like to say is, not regretfully, but not at all really, because I see it as a sense of accomplishment, but when I started a decade and a half ago, almost full-time researching things all the way from worldview down to whatever, I had no one laying stuff out to me objectively at all.

880
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,580
It was very, very difficult to find.

881
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:44,600
There's a lot of self-help gurus and reference manuals and history to look up, and you get lost in the sauce, and I found the whole thing was mindset.

882
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:48,640
You've just got to keep asking yourself the same questions.

883
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,860
What is it based on?

884
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,140
Is this a bunch or is this a version?

885
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,260
What is the reference to this?

886
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,440
Are they saying what they mean and mean what they say?

887
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,420
What do words mean?

888
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,440
How to keep time?

889
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:16,500
All these things I had pretty much on my own, so if I had discovered someone like myself 15 years ago, I would want to give them back something for gratitude to say, hey, thanks for laying this stuff out.

890
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,460
So there's an interesting aspect to it.

891
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,500
Yeah.

892
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,280
And you feel good doing it, you know?

893
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:33,320
Bottom line, the person who gives should be out of the heart and with no questions asked, period.

894
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,580
Okay, yeah.

895
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,380
Because you do.

896
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,480
I do, but I should just be doing this, communicating,

897
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,460
because really humanity is in bad shape,

898
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,120
but not communicate it because it will make humanity better,

899
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,780
but because there's some heads out there,

900
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,600
that's an old ghetto term for people,

901
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,660
I think they use it in the navies also,

902
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:02,560
that are ready for it and really would like something that's simple

903
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:08,580
and almost oversimplified and yet enriching, and to continue it.

904
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:23,180
Because really I'm not going to be, I think for the rest of the life that I have left over a century now, it wouldn't make sense for me to start going down other roads of an industry and things that I've done in the past.

905
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:35,120
I think it's best to retire from making things and doing things and consulting captains of industry, because it gets you, it wears you out after a while, because remember I've wholeheartedly…

906
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,160
It's a burnout, I think, you know?

907
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:50,140
Well, I've also wholeheartedly told you, I've been around high-level leadership in the world and captains of industry, and they are just as moronic as anyone would be classified as a moron, and I'm realizing…

908
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,580
Surprisingly.

909
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,600
Yeah, more and more so, that you are not in control, people.

910
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,120
The gods are full on in control.

911
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:11,040
But in essence, at this point, to be able to maybe just speak to people and get information out is probably what the Greek's purpose is left.

912
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:24,000
Because, you know, why go consult a billionaire for a petrochemical company that is totally blind to anything, that he just knows that if he does what you say, it'll work out better than he thought?

913
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,620
He's drank too great.

914
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:37,220
Why do that when you can just do something like this that just gets put out, and you don't know who's going to hear it, and it really might affect someone's life, so their lives are better, or more…

915
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,620
They don't have to wonder why things are the way they are.

916
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,240
And they've done it on their own.

917
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:49,940
And they do it on their own, and not on a social level, because that ain't going to happen, but it is going to happen when the setup gets in.

918
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,360
You are going to have a perfect society, and I discussed that.

919
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,180
Right?

920
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,620
So, but at least, you know, we'll see how this…

921
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:03,400
Yeah, and maybe mulling over stuff, getting deeper into subjects, and communicating.

922
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:11,680
And there'll be, again, I'll try to figure out an electronic conveyance, because I think people do like to show appreciation, and I like to receive it.

923
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:12,920
Yes, they do.

924
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,600
And who knows?

925
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,540
And here's the thing.

926
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:26,460
If it does grow, let's say, through a credit-worthy financial way, then that could be invested in and have more infrastructure put together.

927
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:26,840
Who knows?

928
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:32,940
But never to make the society or world a better place, but to perhaps multiply, a multiplying factor.

929
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:47,380
Because, you know, I would say, we joke around, you know, but I would say .00001% of the population might be ready for this kind of information, and that leaves several million, that's several million people.

930
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,320
That's a lot of people.

931
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,260
Yeah.

932
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:57,280
And instead of going to bed and figuratively saying, you know, there are still people being plagued by dreams.

933
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:58,480
Yeah.

934
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,640
I mean, that is totally unnecessary, or hauntings.

935
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:09,260
Now, hauntings can get a little more devastating, but, you know, they don't understand the spiritual influence on humanity, and all you have to do is acknowledge it, and these things are remedied.

936
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:09,820
Yeah.

937
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,140
Very interesting.

938
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,080
We'll get into quite a few things, and we'll see how it pans out.

939
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,760
Yes, yes.

940
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,200
Well, as always, Greg, a pleasure of talking to you, and a pleasure with all mine.

941
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,180
Okay, that's right.

942
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:25,780
Thank you.

943
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,760
Yeah, it was a pleasure on this end also.

944
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,780
And I wasn't even touching myself, and that was for the most obvious comment I like to throw in every time.

945
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,580
All right, folks, we'll see you again.

946
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,700
Yeah, have a good night, Greg.

947
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:40,620
Thanks, you too.

948
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,420
Bye-bye.
