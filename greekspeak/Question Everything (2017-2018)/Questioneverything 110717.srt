1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
And how does it sound in Greek?

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,470
Sounding good?

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,290
Yeah, it just sounds like you're a little bit in a very reflective echoey environment.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,930
I don't think there's there's no duplexing that I could hear.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,150
Okay.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,750
Well, that's good.

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,550
That's good.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,310
Yeah, it's just it sounds pretty close to what we sound like right now.

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,290
So, okay good.

10
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,010
I think they just posted It's there it's on their end.

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,370
I think they were maybe having too many things on at the time, but okay.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:23,850
Yep.

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,050
That's always a possibility.

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,950
So yeah, so there's always lots of stuff.

15
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,790
Yeah, yeah, why not?

16
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,090
Wow, very cool.

17
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:45,050
Yeah, so not much has been going on and a lot has been going on again seasonally It's the end of fall almost and going into winter Watch the Middle East news.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:01:02,910
It's sort of sublime But you still have another seven years at least three and a half before things really start Becoming evident that there will be a Middle East Union In place not like any other Union you've ever seen before it's going to be extremely dynamic Looking at what they call the news.

19
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:12,150
There was a little bit of unrest in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia You know, the the Americans have been playing second fiddle for the past 50 years.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,410
They really don't know that Europe also has got its own problems.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,270
So you're going to see an emergence of

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,670
power and

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:29,310
Meaning power it would be just not just focusing on the Middle East, but you're going to see the power base moving there

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,730
There's another like minor giving an example how minor it can be but things to watch for

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,770
European Airbus jetliner manufacturer

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,870
Says that you know

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,610
they're the Middle East is going to be doubling and their purchase orders on airplanes and doubling the

28
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,650
amount of planes that are home there or

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,910
You know fly in and out of their base in the Middle East.

30
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,710
That was an article.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,950
I think yesterday or today so In the in the American news, what's interesting?

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,450
What's what's and you've been getting a lot of these

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,790
What they call unfortunate events, you know, like the shooter incidents, right and

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:18,030
Looking around and seeing what how people are describing them and they and it's just not I got a throat

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,070
I got to throw in some critical observation objectivity and what's going on with that

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,970
Three things well, actually two major things actually just make it the well, the third thing is let's do it backwards

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,990
It's false so you got breaking down period right and

38
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,570
Also, you have to let's say make it four things.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:51,070
There's something if you'll notice Even in local events, they try to brand something terrorism Because there's something called terrorism insurance fund Right.

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,070
So if someone shoots someone it's just murder.

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,910
Well, how do you tap into the terrorist insurance fund?

42
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:06,050
Can't so everything now is terrorism because of that insurance fund that's been set up And by the way insurance companies don't have any money to cover anything.

43
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:25,650
They create it, you know with on the spot using Federal Reserve mechanics All right now the other thing that's going on is the the staging of these things and the actual action Of these things being acted out like on one of them.

44
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,430
There was a what they call an active shooter This is done.

45
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,950
I shouldn't I don't know I was debating whether I should say this in public, but I'm gonna say it Okay, mostly mostly by the FBI.

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,870
They have what's called a SOG team SOG

47
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,810
Which is called a special operations group and these are usually

48
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,810
Like imagine in society you have young people that are look like they're going to be really psychopathic and crazy

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,110
So that the idea is well instead of leaving these guys at large and then you'll end up reading about them in the paper

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,570
Like they killed a bunch of people on their own or became serial killers

51
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,270
The the FBI hires them and they put them on SOG teams

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,130
Special

53
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,470
Operations groups and they're completely brutal

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,310
They got them all over the world all over the country and when it comes time in their language to do what's called a turkey

55
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,690
shoot

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,029
They gather these guys around it doesn't matter who it is and they'll just you know

57
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,950
Have a plan and they'll act through it.

58
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,950
They're just the most cold-blooded people, you know, you can imagine times ten, right?

59
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,930
Unimaginable.

60
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,930
So this is so when you hear about this kind of stuff physically taking action this that's who they're using

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,490
The other thing that they're doing

62
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,650
The other thing that they're doing is in case you haven't noticed

63
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,370
the what they call the stupid rectangle and beyond that the Internet is going to be the governance of information and

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,450
communication and

65
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,270
Banking and whatever else everything has to be on the Internet, right?

66
00:04:51,250 --> 00:05:06,090
So what what's what they're able to do see years ago when media and stories spread around me They had to refer back to the newspaper companies or you know How many newspapers they sold regarding that cover story or something called like the Gallup poll?

67
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,990
You know how many people watched and what they watched on TV?

68
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,570
Well now they're able to monitor the various apparatus that are put into the system

69
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,870
and social networking a social

70
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,410
What do they call it networking websites, you know PC's book and twit heads and all that other stuff

71
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,990
They're able to monitor all the comments

72
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,390
What they do is they're deliberately setting up scenarios and to see how people comment back to structure

73
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,110
Information flow and things like that.

74
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:51,490
It's like, you know, how we were talking about doing beta testing These are all beta tests for future communication and apparatus things So so it's basically there these things are made public so they could see what kind of reaction they get from Through the Internet via their systems, right?

75
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,250
They could read and monitor everything that's on there and listen The other thing that's being done.

76
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,330
If anything is live.

77
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,750
It's a saw group special operations group and Also, there's terrorism insurance.

78
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,470
So I mean who's to gain?

79
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,210
I mean, there's so much to gain on many levels That's why it's going on and also you have to keep in mind.

80
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,510
You're seeing a concentration of these events What what season is it?

81
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,190
It's the fall.

82
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,370
It's a breaking down period.

83
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,470
So something is being broken down right now.

84
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:39,290
All right, so So that's in essence what's going on and listen you would say you'd be seeing a much more increase in this kind of activity then No, well, yes and no If you if you just review the purposes that I state, it's just a more objective critical point of view, right?

85
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,890
Yeah, not an increase.

86
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,290
No, no, I didn't say that at all

87
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,690
I just basically gave an observation that you don't hear anywhere on the stupid rectangle not say anywhere

88
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,770
I don't spend a lot of time dwelling on what these idiots put on the internet, but just doing a cursory 15-minute thing

89
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,150
You know all the major alternative idiots

90
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,770
Independent media on whatever and the mainstream you look at like no one's really speaking of anything real here

91
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,870
Other than they're all looking at each other, you know, and and what they're going to say

92
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,170
I mean, it's it's it's pretty pathetic this human situation, you know when it comes to any any media

93
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,770
There's no one out there and I mean no one with a capital Oh

94
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,190
That is discussing anything objectively

95
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,890
From many points or at least you know, they all have their own little

96
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,910
Specialty myopia, you know, they don't I mean look all I have to say is they don't even know what day it is

97
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,530
You know, I'm just leave it at that, you know

98
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,810
So it's kind of funny to see that and if there's an opportunity to bring it up might as well

99
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,370
And I just did so I gave a few points there that you will not hear anywhere else only for the reason that

100
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,830
Planet full of idiots.

101
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,550
So

102
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,590
from that point of view

103
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,510
What else do you want to continue on we I have the the chat tango open

104
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,270
That popped up in there

105
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,270
when reading about the gods and mythology seems to be

106
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,550
Many seem to share similarities, but have different names in different ages

107
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,010
Different ones are Sumerian biblical Greek Roman

108
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,130
Interesting topic in itself

109
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,090
There was another one

110
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,010
See, oh about the knowledge of the next seven years

111
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,770
The setup so to speak

112
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,970
Yeah, this is the setup.

113
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,990
Well, let's do that one because the mythology

114
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,070
Let's just we could just do the mythology real quick

115
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:43,290
If you're looking at Western stuff Roman Greco drew it that that comes from cultures that were based on intellectual ism

116
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,250
philosophy seeking of knowledge only

117
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,570
So they they started devising

118
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,530
Taking things and devising them into the gods even though there were spiritual interactions

119
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,790
the majority of the interaction that you hear about it was great power would be more in

120
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,570
The Middle East part of the world in the center the naval part of the world, right?

121
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:13,770
When you hear about the Israelites and these other ones, but even then it would be minor So the I mean minor in comparison to let's say the gods in the Bible, right?

122
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,450
great, so

123
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,330
There's a lot of intellectual ism that has to be weeded out or gone through with many of the mythology

124
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:28,150
But you have to realize that when you look at I should say the current society for the past 4,500 years

125
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,550
Came from you know, a group of people that expanded out into the world again, right post-flood

126
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,610
And whatever knowledge they had they gave through oral tradition and written in other ways.

127
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:49,030
So that's why you have a lot of similarities Because there is a general story that mankind goes through Right from beginning to end and this was taught and it changes, right?

128
00:09:49,090 --> 00:10:03,190
that's why you see pyramids all over the world and that's why there's always a Messiah or Christ figure all over the world and that's why there's a flood story all over the world It's because everyone came from the same that just proves that you had a central point that everything came out from right?

129
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:22,830
And it's being influenced as it as it expands from that point Just like water is influenced as it expands out of a fountain running down the river or you know expanding When you expand any body it changes as it interacts with the expand the environment that it's expanding into In terms of the next seven years.

130
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,230
This is another period that's going to start in the Let's say springtime summer.

131
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:48,890
It'll be evident that we're going into another period and It's going to be a transition period that it makes it plausible in everyone's mind that when there are moves and movements and announcements and machinations and dynamics Going towards the Middle East and favoring the Middle East as a power base in many ways.

132
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,590
It'll be accepted So what has to change in people's minds?

133
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:00,270
Well one thing that you're going to see is a decrease in nationalism You know Here in America.

134
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,310
They had a recent election like make America great again Well first of all America was never great second of all make great at what?

135
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,770
Right, you know, you know, you're not going to have a culture that's based on hot dogs and hamburgers be great.

136
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,430
That's sorry

137
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,390
I mean, that's a prop and that's like the propaganda they give

138
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,530
In Russia, you know, you're in a you know

139
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,810
This is a great society and you see 3,000 people standing in knee-deep snow get waiting for toilet paper

140
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,030
You're not doing here, but you're you know here you're maybe you know, you have your other stupidity

141
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,870
But but you know and also if you look at the history just a short dig on the Americans

142
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,150
You can't trust the Americans not I'm not talking about the people

143
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:45,670
I mean, they're too dumb, but you know the actual policies and treaties because from the beginning they're telling you

144
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,170
there are a bunch of you they can't be trusted because the country was based on a group of

145
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,430
or a sub leadership or a leadership that rebelled against its

146
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,050
Its king that it had allegiance to

147
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,550
So if they rebelled against their own king as subjects, how can you trust them on anything else?

148
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,130
Right.

149
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:23,550
Anyway, that's why when you look across through history like in World War one They did a cash-and-carry policy, you know the ally it I mean, it's just it's just a ridiculous Situation so that's why you know from an international level if you're an ally with the Americans You better have more than one or two things up on them because they will screw you right?

150
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,630
That's just how they roll.

151
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,750
So did not to be trusted.

152
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,830
So I mean, you know, so the nationalism everything else based on that

153
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,050
I mean

154
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,650
It's just it's just too bad, but it's not too bad because on another sense

155
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,250
This is also the epitome of the Western culture, you know, you know the concept of a standing wave

156
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,870
It goes out and then it comes back almost the same thing, but it's detrimental

157
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,170
Yeah, so, you know like, you know

158
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,370
There's a lot of fads that started in in what they call America or the States and have moved out to other parts of the world

159
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,150
And it's you know, like that's like the standing wave, you know, yeah

160
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,150
It's just a big marketplace.

161
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,770
It's it's pretty pathetic as a culture.

162
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,310
At least this is now I'm being subjective Other people think it's a great culture.

163
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,130
They don't have a clue.

164
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,150
So we've we've Americanized so many countries.

165
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:35,250
It's it's it's appalling Yeah to a certain degree you have to realize that you know people Left where they were because justice was destroying them right God is religion whether you want to call it form of Catholicism and its evil daughters Protestantism Lutheranism Quakerism, whatever else and And going forward, you know from there You know, they had to get away and they brought it with them.

166
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,630
So whose fault is that?

167
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,750
You know, so here you are and now if you keep going west you could end up starting at east again

168
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,310
So it just shows you global saturation, you know, you're saturating the entire planet with crap

169
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,050
Yeah, that's why I keep referring to the gods as the mop-up crew because when you get a lot of crap

170
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,950
You need a good mopping

171
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,310
But what you're going to see again just to go back to the seven years

172
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,190
I gave a little dig on the Americans well-deserved

173
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,010
I think and going back is saying that you're going to see a focus on the Middle East like never before

174
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,930
You're still going to have a lot of turmoil there because there still is a level of nationalism

175
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,250
That's retained and maintained by many nations

176
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,530
What what you're also going to see on another perspective

177
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,950
Outside of geopolitics is a desire to learn about things that have people have heard about but know nothing about

178
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,510
One of them is the gods the Society of the gods and the things attached to them and and not necessarily

179
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,290
Again, I've been saying this for over a decade

180
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:43,050
You you will see more interest in these things, but it won't be accurate, but it'll be more discussed than it has in the past

181
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:49,950
You know just because there'll be let's say you'll see a couple of more Bible movies coming out or idiots on YouTube

182
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,930
You know talking about stuff or whatever.

183
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,750
It doesn't mean that it's going to be accurate.

184
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:14,770
I doubt it will be at all What it will be though is a revival of the subject matter in a way that it hasn't been done before especially by younger people hmm, you know so more of a more of a saturation of the information and What no no Just more interest in it not saturation.

185
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:23,750
Okay saturation will come till so maybe ten or twelve years from now But it'll be in the wrong direction Okay, yeah.

186
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,370
Yeah, this is more acceptable of things old.

187
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:38,210
Let's say because You you still have a lot of paradigms that are based on this You know last 20th century or 19th century that are going to be readjusted.

188
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:46,270
You know you You know a very easy way to to judge What's going on in society as you go around a neighborhood and if you see people still enrolling in these schools?

189
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,430
Yeah, you're not gonna much change You know if you still see people watching TV.

190
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,030
You're not gonna.

191
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,690
You've got churches mosques synagogues in your neighborhood

192
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,730
Nah, you're not gonna get much change because the real change happens when the people say okay enough of this garbage

193
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,850
You know and recognize it for the that it is so but they can't at this point

194
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,490
I don't think they ever will I think what will happen is the interest in those things will diminish

195
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,230
so

196
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,970
Yeah, but this is necessarily

197
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,310
You know the wrap-up of a story.

198
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,790
That's 6,000 years old.

199
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:26,070
This is roughly You know the 6,000 and 20th year since Adam Right was this like new new for newly formed?

200
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,770
Guy one day.

201
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,450
We'll do I saw a small comment perhaps about discussing Genesis.

202
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,710
It's really a wide

203
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,750
Subject and I think the best way to to at least do it is without

204
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,750
Just like I'm doing this right now

205
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,810
Just standing what either pacing through the room making some coffee or whatever not looking at any notes because it'll get pedantic and too deep

206
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,550
I mean I have in some places over 30 pages of note on just the first 28 words

207
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,890
Wow, so there's no reason to really get into something like that and getting into things

208
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,849
But but I can give it the general mindset that can be viewed, but you know here's the intro interesting

209
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,250
Sort of revelatory thought that I've had something that was just brought out to me my into you know

210
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,470
External input is there is no progress in a serious way.

211
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,810
Let's say in a serious way where you really have Mmm.

212
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:26,069
A lot of tangible effort done unless you have something like a school or an organization or an assembly right?

213
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:32,970
So I was kind of thinking I was kind of shocked that the thought it just came in it was like Greek you have to Form some sort of a group.

214
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:33,850
Oh, no.

215
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,790
No, not like a crowd right like Gustavo

216
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,870
but something's structured where there is something every day going on and

217
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,690
backups and all that because you know doing all the sonic events and all the

218
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:52,350
Instruction on a cursory level or on an introductory level and some things deeper than others has helped many believe it or not

219
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,150
Oh, yes

220
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,790
But to go to the next level where you have

221
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,990
Something more dynamic going on and more clear and even more improvement.

222
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:21,410
Let's say because yes, it is about improving quality A structure needs to be put together and with that said I just wanted you know when I put on the website getting donations I only still do it by the mail I want to thank anyone and everyone who has sent I've received anything and everything that's been sent through the mail It's about maybe 30 or 40 or so envelopes or so.

223
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:41,270
I really appreciate that to to everyone but That has done that but I investigated also doing electronic contributions, and they really don't like it when you do Meaning like for example an American Express type deal You know if you do any situation, it's always credit.

224
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,050
It's always credit

225
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,390
You know so they're really coming out and telling you there's no money because it's all credit anyway

226
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,510
And they don't and in order to redeem something lawfully as raffle lawful money

227
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,030
You can't you need to do some kind of

228
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,650
not in

229
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,670
Some kind of conditional endorsement all you have to do is somewhere within each

230
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:06,210
Transaction each transaction state a demand for lawful money as per title 12 4 1 1 and they really make it difficult

231
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,150
I thought I had it

232
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,830
Down at one point.

233
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,830
I noticed there were some open holes there So I mean it's still it's not about making it lawful money.

234
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:23,830
There's some people out there I've seen on the internet someone's oh I don't do that the banks don't like I said I know but I went and looked at some of the things that people do And they actually go to the bank demanding lawful money.

235
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,790
That's really stupid because you're not gonna get it

236
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,070
This is you're too far gone for that

237
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:35,150
You know that's like going to someone who's in critical condition and asking them to run the you know an Olympic track

238
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,290
It's really it's it's not their fault that they're not doing it's your fault for asking that it's capable so

239
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,670
So again, I don't see how this is going to really go to any other level

240
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,510
That's why I haven't really been putting much of an effort in creating structure behind the scenes with the streams and the pod being in

241
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,370
All that because there's just too much that can be done

242
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,350
Otherwise just showing up and satisfying some

243
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:04,310
Esoteric interest because here's this guy called the Greek who says things no one else does and it sounds interesting and it works

244
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,030
But whatever you know there's another level that can be

245
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:14,010
Examined on this and I'm still just you know hanging out waiting to see if anything will come around in that more dynamic point

246
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,530
but again your idea of the

247
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,790
Modules was a very good idea I believe

248
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,310
Yeah, yeah, they are like doing module.

249
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,990
You know lessons and things like that right right?

250
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,690
Yeah You know so it'll somehow come together.

251
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:46,010
We'll see I'll just state this right now that if there's any way that I can help you just let me know Sure well you know the easiest way I always tell you if you read Even the ancient writs the purpose of money is it's portable.

252
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,470
It's portable land.

253
00:20:47,570 --> 00:21:03,810
You know that's why for example You know now that you know people don't have rights you see your wealth is based on your land So if you want to know if a country is wealthy It's how much access do the people that live there or born there have to what the land can give right in America?

254
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:15,650
It's virtually nothing because they you know there's no value is the value in America is given to by fiat You know you have to work and get Paper signatured stuff you know you know it's frowned upon to do gardening.

255
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,530
It's frowned upon to you know dig wells

256
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,690
It's frowned upon to get minerals and all that other stuff so so either way so

257
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,630
Again I don't see myself doing conventional banking as most people would imagine

258
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:36,790
So the only the only really just to say truthfully as truthful as I could be the only way that I could see anything like this

259
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,410
Developing is by having some one individual or group multinational corporation

260
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,030
Or a monarchy step forward and say yeah, let's fund something like this

261
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,750
You know in the tune of you know seven or seven figures plus

262
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,650
It's not going to happen by people mailing in donations

263
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,430
Even though it's much appreciated that the donations that I get are very helpful.

264
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:04,650
I have a cigarette and coffee habit I really like really good coffee good cigarettes, and it gets expensive Right the one day.

265
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:11,790
I just penciled it in I spend about three or four hundred bucks a month on cigarettes and coffee So the donations don't cover that but it's it's it's okay.

266
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,530
It's not a while.

267
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,250
That's what it costs

268
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,730
For fun we're being gouged, but nonetheless so so you know maybe 10% or 20% of the coffee habit

269
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,810
Or all that is being taken care of so I pre I'm you know appreciate it, but

270
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,230
Yeah, there's not you know here's the other thing

271
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:28,950
I'm

272
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,050
Checking out of this reality is totally a cool thing to do by the way

273
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,530
But you you want to do it gracefully meaning like you know having the spaceship

274
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,350
You know where a company car come pick you up and get you away from what's going on here, but on the other hand

275
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,210
You know people have all these aspirations.

276
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,190
Oh, we've got to get this done in my lifetime.

277
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:56,370
We're either forget it You know the thing is everything is so close right now Meaning a decade and a half to you know Well, there's more discussion.

278
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:14,650
I've never really gotten into what will happen actually at that point But but there's so much going on that you know yeah before this time comes a lot of things will be exposed I don't think I'm going to be the one to do it By the looks of it, but on the other hand it's really kind of a conundrum to think like man.

279
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,490
You know There's so much to share, and how do you do it right?

280
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,330
Right so so that's just where it's at right now, so

281
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:30,050
Okay, any any other questions that you want to think we gave it up about the next seven years any anything else

282
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,970
I believe so that see is America perhaps to Babylon referred to know in revelations

283
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,870
Now when you read here's the problem with most people have with scripture, and they don't know it any writ

284
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,530
Any ancient writ, it's always about the area that it came out of or it's referring to

285
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,230
Always and it's always about the authors

286
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,340
No, there's bloodline play effectiveness.

287
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,260
It's only bloodline.

288
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:12,280
Yeah, Babylon There's a spiritual Babylon which refers to the spiritual America or a spiritual England Spiritual Israel or whatever each nation has a spirit behind it hmm and also angelic presences, right?

289
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:25,760
Malevolent mostly on this planet mm-hmm Towards man right right But the problem That's why I think you know the problem that most people have is this thing called the Judeo-christian ethic and religion, right?

290
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,940
That's why earlier.

291
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,460
I mentioned.

292
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:36,100
You know the Catholicism and its evil daughters You know which is the rest of Christianity, and it all came out of Simon Magus with a magician, right?

293
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:53,320
So imagine if what Christianity basically is is imagine Bill Gates and David Copperfield and Houdini got together and had a baby Ouch All three of them yeah, it sounds like a freak show yeah, so yeah, it's ridiculous That's why you know for example.

294
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:03,240
I'm going to harp on the Christians a little bit In a proper way you know they you know you know how I used to say you know or much I still do if someone asked you do you believe in God?

295
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:15,140
That's a ridiculous question walk away because you won't find evidence of anything like that in any writ other than the King Jimmy and The nouveau international versions and all that other crap right now.

296
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,160
It's God's plural, right?

297
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:25,460
I always like to call it new vogue Yeah, so it's it's God someone asked you to believe in God you walk away, right?

298
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:37,160
So there's no such thing right was Lewis Was Zeus a real living God is he different from the Creator God of other cultures?

299
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,320
Is he still alive?

300
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,700
No, of course.

301
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,300
He's different.

302
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:50,320
He never he never claimed to be if you study a little bit on the Those questions will be answered with a cursory study on the subject, okay, okay?

303
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:58,120
Let's see who is he was on it in terms of he was an Olympian right and before the Titans and all that that was a

304
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:05,520
Into intellectualism from the Greeks they there are entities there that would like to be called Zeus

305
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,100
so

306
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,140
Yeah, but essentially there's there's a lot of strong historical work done that Zeus was actually a Minoan King

307
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,960
You don't hear much about the Minoan

308
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,080
Civilization they were around the early dynasty of Egypt.

309
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,600
They were probably the most powerful civilizations on the planet

310
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,740
This is like the during the time let's say 2,500 BC or so

311
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,840
They were there if they're like the palace of Knossos

312
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,500
Knossos and the island of Crete very few people

313
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Hey, yeah, okay interesting

314
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,580
Yes, so we get a translation of the scriptures

315
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:55,240
It seems like you will but it'll probably be more an attitude than an actual translation

316
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,880
Because you hear either why I mean by that the attitude will change

317
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,760
Because it doesn't matter if you have a real translation or not

318
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
What can you understand it how many times have you ever heard?

319
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:17,120
Me speak publicly or privately and tell people they have to study the scriptures never why no no Because you're not gonna understand anything in it anyway, so why would I recommend it great?

320
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,240
So even if you had people have still asked me.

321
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,260
What's the best interlinear?

322
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm like none of them and all of them you have to be familiar with everything

323
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
But you have to know where to spend time and what should take precedence

324
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,840
Over another like something like you see Lord and God

325
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,520
I mean that's like you know a doorstop

326
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,980
But you still have to know it because you're gonna be communicating with morons who that's all a they have they're actually

327
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,980
People in America they have their own form of Christianity

328
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,720
They think the King James Bible is this holy relic you could put your hand on it's got a man powers

329
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,740
I mean, I I mean how I mean this is about as bad as it gets the talisman, you know

330
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,680
Yeah, but here's the other thing I wanted to get on earlier

331
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,000
But someone asks you do believe in God walk away because there's no such thing.

332
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:19,080
It's a plurality right, but the other thing that I Don't really say It's very simple, why do you need to believe let's say it was just God So, let's say someone says do you believe in the gods?

333
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,200
Well, even then so what you know why because they know who they are.

334
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:33,060
They don't need for you to believe in them The thing is the proper more proper definition of that question would be do you believe them?

335
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:46,400
in other words, if you acknowledge their writ, do you believe what they are saying and The answer to that is no most people don't believe the gods because they don't even know what the gods are trying to Communicate.

336
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,700
Let me give a small little dig against is we're gonna dig on Christianity a little bit That they taught they have all this crap born again.

337
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,700
This that you know blooded Jesus.

338
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:21,940
I don't even like saying that name And I don't think anyone should but You know many levels like that now if you read the New Testament I can give 30 examples in five minutes off the top of my head, but I won't you know scripture if you read the New Testament objectively without the Christianity what you will walk away with if you're halfway sane Not fully sane is in someone asked you.

339
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,860
What is that about?

340
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,940
Right, right

341
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:33,060
It has nothing it will you won't say anything that even resembles what Christians say say this thing called the New Testament is

342
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,980
unequivocally positively absolutely and entirely about a new form of government that's coming to the earth the

343
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,060
government of the gods and

344
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,100
It was ushered in

345
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:52,400
Not ushered in it was announced by this Christ type figure Messiah who also did as this blood sacrifice

346
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,440
It has nothing to do about religion.

347
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:21,320
It has nothing to do about Anything being done away with or anything coming in nothing to do with a circus or a church absolutely nothing You could if you look at let's say the first book of Matthew in the Beatitudes all of that is about a coming You know blessed be the peacemakers for they shall write blessed be the meek they will inherit the blessed You know the right the poor and spirit.

348
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,760
They will it right all this stuff.

349
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:44,400
It's about a coming time period Okay, it's all about a coming I am announcing to you the kingdom of God right if you read in the King Jimmy, right You know, it's not like you're going anywhere It's coming here because it doesn't say, you know, when you look at the better blessed be, you know, you'll you'll inherit You're not going to you're not going to inherit the kingdom in heaven.

350
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,800
You're going to be kingdom of heaven meaning It's it's of that right?

351
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,660
It's coming here.

352
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,020
In other words.

353
00:30:50,140 --> 00:31:01,660
These people think that you die you go somewhere It's just you're talking about a sick group of people we're talking about a billion, you know, very ill mentally ill people So is this part of that perfect society?

354
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,080
Thing that you were alluding to no, no, it will it will attempt to be no

355
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,980
The perfect society thing is what it mankind will be sold in the by the mid 2020s

356
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,480
That'll be ushered in

357
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,240
Which I can give I give more details in private, but there's a group of ten people that are like a worldwide leadership group

358
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,720
And one of them is a very charismatic young man of a Syrian a Syrian descent

359
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,540
And one thing I'll just put out look when you read about this instead of Christ or anti Christ figure

360
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,000
That's going to be coming on the scene.

361
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,200
He'll be on the scene in roughly nine or ten years, right?

362
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,420
You know how you hear a lot of people saying oh this guy's the end of crisis guys the end of Christ, right?

363
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,660
This is stupid stuff.

364
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:54,480
I Would wager to say that the majority of the possibility of this man's identity being complete secret is very high why?

365
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,100
Because he's a model of the Christ that was in the biblical text and he is his identity was a secret

366
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,560
That's another thing when you read the New Testament, you will find out objectively now

367
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,740
You'll find out that the main character there is this Christ figure and it seems to be his identity is a secret

368
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,660
But yet you have a billion people professing 400 denominations of the religion

369
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,940
With iconography everything from a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper to everything else you can see

370
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,540
Like they know like they have some idea

371
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,420
We're talking about the ridiculous

372
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,780
you know

373
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,780
Conjecturism here in presumption

374
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,960
So if you read what's called the New Testament by the way

375
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,160
You don't even have anything close to the New Testament in English or in your Greek interlinear

376
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,260
That's why I rarely get into it also

377
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,560
So as the Greek I think

378
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:53,280
Is a copy of a Latin which is a copy of another Greek which is a copy of the original Aramaic?

379
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,500
And what was around by the way for the first?

380
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,280
until about

381
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,800
The 50 AD was just the book of Matthew and I'll give a little secret here

382
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,180
That's why when you read even the writings of Shaul or Paul

383
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,340
He's he will say things like as it is written, and he's quoting the book of Matthew

384
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,440
So the only thing they had was the book of Matthew

385
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,460
And it was about announcing this kingdom of the gods on earth ruling mankind it has nothing to do about starting a religion

386
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,220
nothing to do about

387
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,980
the circus or the church or or anything and

388
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,560
No one knows who the Christ is because no one really reads the text objectively

389
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,900
Right the the the Quran is wrong about it, and that gives that's one of the giveaways on who really wrote the Quran

390
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,720
But if you just want to see the you know how the they categorize the yashu guy

391
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,940
You know so it's really an interesting

392
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:55,420
Situation I think more information will be given in that direction that it will be distracted.

393
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:16,070
I believe that there is a Possible in secret translations being put out, but it's really hard to do as a book as a large collection Right right because the people are going to be bringing the very reason why you're not going to get a good translation Or an excellent one is because the very P.

394
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,389
Where are you going to find the people to do that?

395
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,449
Right where right who has not been corrupted by the satanic religious?

396
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:31,389
Moral ethical thing that's been put on mankind based on the Judeo-christian who who's going to do it.

397
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:41,570
Yeah to find anyone very rare and Yeah, so and also the amount of Funding wherewithal and resources to do behind it.

398
00:34:41,690 --> 00:35:01,150
Yeah, it just does not an easy undertaking But what will happen just like anything it doesn't matter if you had the good translation or not because you won't understand it anyway Why because you meaning you were raised in in this particular society thinking that you know?

399
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:17,890
you're going to Take what you've been told about it with some slight corrections and figure out what's being said now I'm telling you that's not going to happen unless you approach it with the most Objective mind you're not going to really understand it or you're just going to run into stuff.

400
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:34,730
So yeah, I understand It's just like I was told but maybe a little more detail no no sorry Yep, so it's quite interesting and of a predicament We got another question about what can be discussed about Paul being a trap?

401
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,280
Even if you well you can read it's in the book of Shimon Kepha or Peter wrote about that

402
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,840
He says Paul is difficult to understand right now

403
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,520
Continue reading about that continue reading what the Isaiah said many will come to it, and it'll be a stumbling block

404
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:59,080
Here's a little bit about Paul Paul is definitely if you look at one of the most vile institutions in humanity

405
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,160
It's any modern religion right and then of course it's the legal society in every society because if you want to know

406
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
for example

407
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,520
who

408
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,740
What God a society has allegiance to just look at where and how they get their law?

409
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,120
Right so the Western culture majority of the culture in the world right now gets it from the female goddess justice, right?

410
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:45,260
Okay, so let me just tie that in then you and then you look at Then you go look at where they get their academic or their knowledge base from and it's not necessarily Academia doesn't necessarily have a god or a goddess over it directly It sort of does a little bit here and there smattens right, but it's in full agreement With this goddess religion known as justice, right?

411
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,880
Okay, so when you go back to the times of Paul.

412
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:57,680
Let's say or show He was appealing to two groups of people one was the Greeks and one was the the Hebrews or the Judeans, right?

413
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:19,500
Because you got to realize Israel had broken off a hundred years or more before that even within the the occupation that took place and by the Romans so Well, they were actually broken off many years before that But it was a big division is the northern part was pretty much gone They were mixed up with the Samaritans of your like term good Samaritan.

414
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,820
They were nothing but good

415
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,620
That's why they tell you they're good

416
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,060
so many

417
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
aspects of that

418
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,880
But I would suggest that when you're reading Paul

419
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
you're going to be confused because he's trying to appeal to people that knew the law and

420
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,800
also and knew that the law was more a spiritual law and spiritual knowledge was higher than man-made knowledge and

421
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,440
Also appeal which were the Hebrews let's say and then the Judeans and then he was also trying to appeal to the intellectual little

422
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,460
Based culture, which were the Greeks which thought that knowledge was, you know superseded any spiritual law, right?

423
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,720
So he's trying to appeal to both.

424
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:04,740
So he's saying one basically You know one group knew the law what the right way to do things the other one didn't know the right way But try to figure it out.

425
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,740
So he's trying to reckon to both of them

426
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,880
because

427
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,740
What you have to realize he's driving right down the middle of the road

428
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:21,320
right and also this was a time the first century especially after 33 or 35 AD was a time of turmoil and

429
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,280
There were a lot of supernatural things going on

430
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:32,040
I say a lot meaning there were some supernatural quote-unquote powerful dynamic events going on and people needed explanations, right?

431
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:43,740
It's kind of like, you know When they nuked the towers down the residual that was still a news story a year later, right And and and you have all these idiots online trying to figure out what happened.

432
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:53,360
They're all making stuff up This is exactly what you see going on at the time That's why when you read a lot of the commentary about Paul is to be careful because you know We're trying to do something good.

433
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:59,460
But already we got people they're gonna flip this thing around and Turn it into a lie, you know, even right now, right?

434
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,620
Hey, so so the trap with Paul is

435
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,940
I've given on many levels is

436
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:13,320
Imagine a scripture being from kindergarten what they call the 8th is the Old Testament from kindergarten to high school

437
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:22,320
K through 12 the New Testament would be like a unit college bachelor's degree to master's degree and Paul would be a doctorate

438
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,260
So yeah, we have people now who don't even just barely going into an interlinear figuring out

439
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,780
You know, there's you know that are not even kindergarten just figuring out what spiritual laws are, you know how to live on this earth

440
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,220
Let's say right food or loathing all this stuff time

441
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,660
You're basically in the third grade and you're trying to ponder something in PhD

442
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Level ain't not gonna happen.

443
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:57,160
It could happen I'm not gonna say not gonna happen because occasionally there is you know, you read occasionally there's a 13 year old, you know A 12 year old that's a professor could you know, whatever is capable of doing that?

444
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,260
Yes, yeah, but it's not going to happen until you master the rest of it and I'm and I'm I don't think anyone really is

445
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,580
Going to master it including myself

446
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,760
But at least you have a masterful grip on what is being said there outside of what you've been told

447
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,580
Now, I don't mean to be contrary

448
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,540
I mean sometimes I'd go on roundtables and people say Greek you we say this you say that you know

449
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,160
You see the opposite as well.

450
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm not trying to be adversarial It just so happens to be that everything is so adversarial.

451
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,060
It is that way?

452
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,580
That's why I always say take anything turn it upside down.

453
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,980
And once you turn it upside down, guess what now?

454
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,180
It's really right side up

455
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,280
right, so Paul is a trap in the sense that it's a mind trap and

456
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,660
And also you it can't be that good

457
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,860
Initially if one of the most vile institutions ever known to man is using is basing

458
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,320
All of its doctrine on writings of Paul if you look at Christianity, it's basing all of its

459
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,980
doctrine on

460
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,080
Misinterpretations and isolated verses out of context out of Paul, so it can't be good.

461
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:10,360
I Mean if it's just a very simple, you know You know broad stroke pretty accurate analogy, right?

462
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:35,680
so so there's many levels to it and then within what Paul is writing you could see the traps within it too and the distortion but that's again on a high level you and Unfortunately and any time you have a gradient this is not too great, but when you have a gradient progression in whether it's a knowledge of something or physical Exercise, you know, we're actually physically developing.

463
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,680
There's a gradient

464
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,040
You know

465
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,880
There's a time where as you spend more time doing it properly

466
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,720
You develop and then things can be done more as you're more developed versus in the beginning great

467
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,960
so

468
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,580
Let's see

469
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,620
We have another question is the right direction to study society in those days

470
00:41:54,620 --> 00:42:01,060
To get a better context of where the authors come from their view is not ours regarding scripture

471
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,980
Yes, you could say that but you also have to realize

472
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,180
That's a lot of history

473
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,200
Well, yes, you can but you also have to realize that it was these were messages that

474
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,360
Okay, let me just put it this way

475
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,740
If it was truly a

476
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,140
Inspired more than inspired but a dictation from the gods it bypasses history, right?

477
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,120
Because it's not it's not an author like Melville or Emerson or someone writing a creative writing.

478
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,840
This is not creative writing This is an actual transmission, right?

479
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,720
Right, right

480
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,640
But on but on the other hand you the history helps you put things in order and understand little

481
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,560
Details a little bit more because you can expand them on on what you know about history

482
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,280
given another example

483
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,760
Like if you look at all of the prophets and other things like that in the book of in the Old Testament

484
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:59,120
Up until maybe a thousand years ago or even the first century or actually a thousand years ago

485
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,620
It would be more accurate, which is a thousand nine hundred years after the first century

486
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,100
Most people were not aware of book of Isaiah Jeremiah

487
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,260
Micah any of these prophets like you can't access today

488
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,220
They didn't have access to that or even know about it

489
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,540
Because they were already the people that this was given to were already in captivity

490
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,040
They were in really piss-poor shape when these prophets were writing

491
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,020
Taking dictation to write what we call the book of Isaiah book of Jeremiah

492
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,220
That was not though as you see the script compiled now was not really done up until a thousand years ago

493
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,680
So really everything that you see in Scripture the people then didn't really have access to

494
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,200
In other words when Isaiah was writing Isaiah that people there didn't even know it was going on till a thousand years later.

495
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,600
Oh Think about it.

496
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:54,520
Yeah, so yeah, so these are discussions on you know, when you look at your history You have to keep in mind.

497
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,520
Why are you studying history also?

498
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,060
I was gonna ask how does Marlito or what does Marlito of Sardis play into to this?

499
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,980
Don't know who that is.

500
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,980
I might have come across basically.

501
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,660
Yeah, there's tons of people.

502
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
Yeah, he was one of the people who

503
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,780
again wrote a

504
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,580
Actually the separation between Old Testament New Testament kind of fell in his lap

505
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,380
Back in that time, you know, and I guess I was kind of curious on your take on that

506
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,920
But I'm not fully briefed on it myself at this point still digging

507
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,760
Yeah, there was a lot of what happened was there was okay, whatever there's funding you develop an institution or institutions

508
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,760
okay, developing around this because people that had a lot of access and wherewithal like to fund these things and

509
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,140
Most of the things that they are talking the Vatican here

510
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,700
Sure, and when these things were funded at the time

511
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,960
They were all spread apart across the world and they wanted clear concise ways to communicate

512
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,360
So they start putting verses and chapters on things right so they could make a catalog of

513
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
reference points

514
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,040
Right.

515
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,900
Yeah and discuss it but but they see at this point.

516
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:18,520
Yeah It's money talks BS walks Yeah, how would you describe if you understand the the timeline of mankind, you know the first?

517
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:38,980
Thousand years very dynamic two thousand years also very dynamic most everyone's wiped out brought back You have a very dynamic time period at the center of the earth You know the part of the Levant and the Christ comes and you have nothing for 2,000 years But how can you you know and within that nothing you have all the stuff that you've seen for the past 2,000 years, right?

518
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:49,520
Wow amazing So it's kind of hard to swallow that when you just live 70 or 80 years to say well Nothing has really happened in a thousand years No, not really.

519
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,600
No not along these lines, but a lot has happened along the low-level stuff Level crap.

520
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,380
Yep.

521
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,200
Yeah, you get to see a pretty interesting picture of all that kind of

522
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,320
Just manifest itself out of nothing

523
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:11,060
Yeah, because this is the time period for it's a curing time period, you know, no one could say

524
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:18,260
Well, we didn't have enough time to to test out these theories and these other things, you know, we've had two thousand years flusted

525
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,480
Yeah, exactly

526
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,660
It's not it's not a it's not a here

527
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,940
I would suggest that later on when everyone's brought back and all that, you know

528
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,160
If you mentioned to some because people will be born again

529
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,280
I mean born then also if you tell them you lived in the earth on this period they're gonna be like wow

530
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,900
Man, that was like a horrible time, you know

531
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,100
I

532
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,000
Read about there heard about that

533
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,700
That's like, you know

534
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,540
You're running someone especially when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s that grew up during World War two in Europe and they're

535
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,980
Oh, man, you're like, oh, you know

536
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,580
You heard so many stories that after a while you're like when you found out someone was growing up during that time period in Europe

537
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,840
During World War two you're like, oh what a horrible life.

538
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,000
It must have been in most cases and it was right

539
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,240
So the strife and the war and all that so

540
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:11,140
So this is but picture that on a 6,000 year, you know scope or 4,500 year scope because we haven't yet had much

541
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,300
Information to commune or communicate with anyone or information from pre-flood

542
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,020
Which was an incredible time period where people lived to a thousand technology abound

543
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,340
Incredible spiritual contact with angelic beings and gods and things like that.

544
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,140
So we have very little information.

545
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,100
Thankfully so To a degree because it would be so much of a distraction.

546
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,180
You wouldn't be looking at the smartphone or the stupid rectangle, right?

547
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,680
Be trying to achieve that again.

548
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,600
So the gods are pretty smart on that end, you know about censoring

549
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,460
Certain well actually censoring the majority of the people on this planet to the point where they are just

550
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,400
Focusing on what's been given to them, you know at the moment along the time period

551
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:58,440
And the whole thing essentially this is basically very short way to describe everything that you read in

552
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,420
Scripture forget about everything that you've been told.

553
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,520
This is good advice, by the way, not just advice but good advice

554
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,200
it's a story about forming mankind as part of the creators family and

555
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,540
Anything you see about the future or anything forming in there it's about the gods ruling on earth again

556
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,080
It's not about starting a religion or you know, a lot of people say love they don't even know what love is

557
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,360
Forget, you know, I mean they could say it all they want

558
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,740
It doesn't mean anything because they don't even know what it is.

559
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:37,540
It's not this esoteric emotion dry emotional drive That they have you know, and you know, it's a it's complete selflessness like someone someone once said motherly love All right.

560
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,660
Well motherly love fine.

561
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:45,380
Well, first of all, I don't know how much she really loves her child Objectively by all the pranking that she's doing number one number two.

562
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,360
She's this is the you know, they're confusing the carnal physical part

563
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:57,160
Number three the other part would be is sort of selfish again because she will love her child more than her neighbor's child

564
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,200
right

565
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,220
So motherly love again, you know, I'm not saying to poke fun at it or break break it apart

566
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:09,460
But it does it doesn't hold up very well either but there is a very good condition with motherly love because there are

567
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,420
Actually a physical etherical aspects to it, you know

568
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:21,000
That because you're connected through the umbilical cord even when it's cut there's still a presence there, right, right?

569
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:30,460
So but other than that it stops has nothing to do With the gods at all what what the gods are saying about love in that respect, right?

570
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:53,380
so So there's very little understanding if anyone were to take any subject that that is very much needed It's all through history and expand on it on many ways properly would be the subject of love All right, and that that's one of the things I touched on on one of the previous sonic events with Ocelli And I kind of froze up.

571
00:49:53,460 --> 00:50:08,360
I was like, you know, I'm kind of like just mentioning these things They need to be expanded so people can see really what's going on and how little love there really is in the world Yeah, you know and I misinterpreted a lot of it now it does, you know, so There's a whole other level too.

572
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:31,370
I think that one statement you made one time of more people die Prematurely of just being alone Yeah, that's that's a little bit different, but there's also what how about how about dying prematurely if you're alone But might be even worse is dying prematurely when you're around other people The worst thing is to be around other people and feel alone.

573
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,630
Yeah, because you can't definitely You can't justify it, right?

574
00:50:35,670 --> 00:51:04,770
If you're locked up in solitude well, you can justify that because you're physically but When you start gaining certain knowledge about the reality of being on this earth It doesn't matter if you're in a crowd of people or whatever or you're alone Yeah, yeah, but the irony of that is you're never really alone because you always don't want so Go ahead and give me about 15 seconds.

575
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,230
I need to go out make some adjustments.

576
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:18,110
I'm gonna I'll be right I was just I was just gonna say well if we want we can hold over and just mute out and come back maybe in 10-15 minutes or so that way we can both give ourself a little breather You got it.

577
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:18,410
Okay.

578
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,030
Okay, sir.

579
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,730
See you soon Oh So we're gonna just kick a little music back at you.

580
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:43,330
We're gonna mute out and we'll be back in about 15 And there we are.

581
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:51,670
We are back Okay So, where were we Let's going anywhere at all.

582
00:51:51,970 --> 00:52:07,210
We were just kind of roaming around I believe on many different levels and topics All of them quite good mind you Okay So anything else in the chat, I'll make it my way back into the office here.

583
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:16,630
I'll see what you've got Otherwise there just maybe A question from sticks.

584
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,690
Do you?

585
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:25,270
Do you do anything in particular to mitigate the negative effects risk of cigarettes?

586
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:34,870
No, I Don't have any negative effects now other than Engaging in the smoke of it or a tar or nicotine or whatever, correct?

587
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:35,170
Right?

588
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:52,610
No, I generally a pretty healthful healthful into you know a body so It's just one of those things that I enjoy people call it a habit or whatever, you know, it's fine, you know Yeah, I understand totally.

589
00:52:52,850 --> 00:53:17,160
I'm one of them Mm-hmm, although I've been thinking of rolling my own which probably wouldn't be a bad thing Yeah, we're growing and you know, here's the thing try growing it and then consuming it It's really harsh and you'll appreciate what they do package for you Yeah, the amount of choice that has to go through to figure out what actually smokes.

590
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,760
Well, yeah, so

591
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:27,760
Most tobacco I would say more than 90% of it is for commercial industrial purposes other than you know

592
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,440
You smoked as a tobacco product

593
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,680
So pretty it's it's I wouldn't say like honey

594
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,160
but there are certain things that have been quote-unquote domesticated to a point where they're

595
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,600
Think of it as the opposite of what's going on with food what's going on with food right now is a

596
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,160
Most of the products or types of foods that were grown and

597
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,280
We're very healthful now or not and they went more towards the animal strain variety versus human grade

598
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,440
because like with wheat, you know you hear about

599
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,220
Gluten and all this and peanut allergies and all that.

600
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:15,880
It's not because all of a sudden you've got allergies It's because they examine the various Species of seeds for wheat and peanut and whatever and they said well look at this one here requires less water And it's more resistant to bugs.

601
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,400
Why don't we plant that one instead?

602
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:23,180
Right, and it was not necessarily as good of a strain or a good of a breed of seed.

603
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:38,560
Let's say So they're downgrade are deliberately same with soy deliberately planting inferior Species, you know or types of that species and they make better cost less to grow Exactly all of all profit.

604
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,700
Well, there is no profit because there's no money.

605
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,420
It's all right Even well that makes it that just reminds you where you're at, you know, what?

606
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,840
What a shit what a shit society it is

607
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,420
They can't even see what's in front of them, you know, you know one

608
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:03,320
No one that's active in society can can deny him and be with with excuse later that I didn't know was a credit-based economy

609
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,720
You know, you can you know, well, you know if you want to just take it a little bit

610
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:15,180
Well, I think by the 1950s and 90% of the country's the nationalities

611
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,640
Let's just say the sovereign governments were in bankruptcy to the central banks

612
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,500
now, I'm not an anti Federal Reserve guy or an

613
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,120
anti-credit guy or

614
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,340
Whatever.

615
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:31,940
It's just it's it's not lawful Great, so, you know am I anti lawful?

616
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:38,140
Yeah, you could say that indirectly I like things to be lawful, but you know, they're none of your religions are lawful.

617
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,940
Not a one None of your money is lawful.

618
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,860
None of your Legal people are lawful.

619
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,040
None of your doctors are lawful

620
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,290
You know, none of your professors are lawful

621
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,910
If they try to be they won't be in those positions for very long

622
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,450
That's why I say none there might be

623
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,530
Might be some that are figuring it out

624
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,870
I've met quite a few and not a few more than well

625
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:06,150
On one hand doctors lawyers those types of people said I found out what it was about and I quit

626
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,970
How to do something else like wow, okay

627
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,950
So it's like one out of you know

628
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,590
It's usually like one out of maybe five hundred thousand or a hundred thousand that have any moral fiber in their body.

629
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:36,760
Mm-hmm Go look at the man on the street Yeah Everybody cover your ears, but the average person you run into is a complete and utter scumbag Right now you could uncover your ears now What I mean, you know, so, what do you know?

630
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,520
What do you expect?

631
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,240
how can you have a lawful medical legal religious and government when the

632
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,280
Ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent of population are scumbags and psychopaths

633
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah, not a lot of good odds there

634
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,100
No, it's that's what I mean

635
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,780
The only there is you know, you're not gonna be able to separate yourself so very successfully from these idiots

636
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,160
And there is as well, so I mean this is the reality of it, you know

637
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,530
It's very that's a very accurate and safe statement, by the way

638
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,150
Mm-hmm

639
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,390
Well, I don't see any other things in Chad

640
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,010
Is there anything that you had on your mind that you wanted to just get across?

641
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,850
other than Not really.

642
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,570
I have a lot on the mind all the time, right?

643
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,790
But for public consumption and archive now other than just getting yeah

644
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:33,790
Yeah, there's I mean there's a lot to do there's a you know, like I said earlier starting off

645
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:39,510
I started kind of got hit the past few days like oh, no, I wouldn't say that what I'm doing is wrong

646
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,130
But I wouldn't say it's really right

647
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:48,210
Because this I've spent almost 15 years looking at this stuff and just doing sonic events is not the way to go, right?

648
00:57:48,570 --> 00:58:01,990
It needs to be done a little bit more form formally and it has to have a backing and So far that hasn't happened, so that's why I'm kind of like very lax about doing anything formal I have everything in place.

649
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,710
We have a stream.

650
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:12,670
We have a pod bean and you have a website Me no big deal to do like before a sonic event Every week or two times a week or what have you?

651
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:35,310
You know people do it almost every day and just keep plugging away at it I mean then it's just you know, I think like you said earlier a module a little I think that's a great idea You know, maybe like an eight hours on Genesis, right for for two-hour things on just Genesis And not even getting into the patriarchs just covering to the flood.

652
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:44,170
Really really a good mindset to have and then of course covering You can't and it's not just Genesis.

653
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:59,990
You'll be going into what's called Job New Testament believe it or not also you going into but a proper New Testament and you'll be going into the Psalms and a lot of the prophets also, so Yeah, and also giving a little bit of the history on it.

654
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:18,650
Believe it or not because there is a history in Genesis that's given even before the patriarchs that can be matched to a lot of geodesic geological records and finds and archaeology Remember a really good liar has to sound like he's telling you the truth.

655
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:33,710
So the academics who are lying Have some truth in there and they sat and the reason see you can't be completely contrary to the truth and sound like the truth Because then that just doesn't buy it just doesn't the frequency then is completely completely off, right?

656
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:43,170
What they do is they have a carrier frequency like a submarine the extra-long Wavelength that what they do is have a carrier frequency and then they ride the other frequency on top of that one, right?

657
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,450
like sideband Like side bending, right?

658
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,830
Okay, so or maybe not really but similar to yes

659
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:55,230
And I would say that what they do is they put out an air of truth that grabs the confidence

660
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:00,070
Just like the bait on a hook and then now you're hooked and now you can't get it out of your jaw

661
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:06,650
So I'll show you how much of what's called scientific data, but real scientific data the stuff

662
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:12,790
that's not plugged in university textbooks anymore, but anyone could still access it correlates with many of the

663
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,570
Archaeological and anthropological finds because it's not what you think.

664
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:24,910
I always say it's not what you think Yeah, and other thing is the problem is it's two Two sides there one thing.

665
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:36,930
It's not well, the other thing is what you think Let me just address the second part if you're thinking you're gonna get in trouble So it's not to do so much of it But when it comes time to think you should be able to do it.

666
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,990
You see what I mean, right, right?

667
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:43,090
Yeah, I don't suggest anyone go off and become a thinker

668
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:49,790
you will find yourself eating out of a garbage can unless you have people that love you around you and you have a

669
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,750
Very narrow, but very, you know

670
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,770
You can get what you need in life

671
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,250
Because if you start becoming a thinker, you're not able to function properly in this world

672
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:05,010
But when you the will come times in everyone's life where you do have to do some serious thinking

673
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,210
So if you don't have that skill, how are you going to see?

674
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:21,310
so So it is important to Be able to think Well, as I said before if there's any way that I can help you all with the mods Any kind of support that I can help?

675
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:32,710
Sure But as it is right now in terms of putting out a lot more stuff It's it's not I don't see it other than getting into detail.

676
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:54,370
I mean, I think the cursory approach I know that for myself included doing on other Platforms or the once-a-week thing the sonic events, you know the past couple of years was actually refreshing for myself and I knew in the background that Someone might have heard something that kind of like, you know Gave them the wake-up call just for a minute, right?

677
01:01:54,510 --> 01:02:09,150
Or some other people more than that for a few days or other people actually implemented it in their lives But I believe that there is a point that I've crossed just in the past few days that this thing needs Tremendous back backing.

678
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:29,750
Yeah, and until that happens, it's not I can't see myself really delving into even Many subjects and in depth like how I would enjoy to know because also be taking time away from what I need to do So But but you know on the other hand, you know, this is and we're not a one-armed person, right?

679
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,350
We've got two hands.

680
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:33,930
The thing is doing these regular little sonic things is fine.

681
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:48,750
I mean, okay, I think it because I've realized that the the spiritual landscape meaning mental Landscape in the world and including people who listen is an utter wasteland So I might take for granted.

682
01:02:48,910 --> 01:03:06,050
Yeah, I've learned this and I've been doing this Let's say for 30 years or 20 years or 15 years There are other people out there that don't even have a clue of what I'm Let's say contemplating that even just the slightest Bit of impart impartation or imparting is going to help them tremendously, right?

683
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,650
Right, so you don't know what you're gonna say and when you're gonna say in what depth or not

684
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:15,990
That is really going to affect other people and I have seen privately through emails and messages and you know

685
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,930
Even this real minor chat or whatever

686
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,430
there are

687
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,070
there it has made a

688
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:22,410
positive

689
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,130
qualitative difference

690
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,410
So, you know that I think should keep going on but

691
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:34,070
There's there's many levels to it and also the time period

692
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,430
This is a an interesting time period, you know

693
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:42,910
I should say that if you asked me five years ago, would I be speaking now?

694
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,390
Right now, you know five years in the future about these things.

695
01:03:46,410 --> 01:04:06,470
I would say no I would have probably either waited till much later, you know, or just done a bunch of stuff and then stop So it's a very interesting way to predict one's own behavior is to think where I'm set was five years ago I mean very often there are things I have in private conversations Oh, I'm never gonna say this publicly and then six months later.

696
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:17,870
I do or a year later I do and I noticed that if you say it It's like as if you didn't say it or as soon as you get this a lot not push back in a bad way But a lot of response like wow, man, you know, that's really cool.

697
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:27,470
You see so it's it's kind of Let's just let's just say it this way Back to why people are here why we're here.

698
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,590
It's for character building

699
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:35,690
It's for the development of the spirit through that you see what the gods do is they give you everything in life

700
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:42,450
They also influence basically your your mind is is is like a cloud on the computer or server remote server

701
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:46,810
Right, but when you put all of these things together in the material sense

702
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:50,490
You are going to have within the exercise of where you want to be on the cruise ship

703
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,870
You know free will versus the whole ship where it's going

704
01:04:53,550 --> 01:05:00,830
How we do these little minute things and you go about based on what you've been given as part of your development you see

705
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,550
So tying it back to doing sonic events and all that

706
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:11,910
I believe that as I put out things and see what kind of feedback there is or interest or whatever again develops

707
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,950
The information itself than if it wouldn't have been

708
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:16,030
spoken

709
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:23,350
But but essentially I've been mulling over like there's been requests about discussing Genesis for example, let's go back to that and

710
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,010
I looked at it

711
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:29,730
I said there's no way I'm gonna be able to refer to notes and do a sonic event on this because like I said

712
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,750
It's just four hours on the first verse

713
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,110
Great, right easy easy.

714
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,950
That's just not it's just gonna kind of really well, is it gonna help people?

715
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:43,910
Yeah, but we're talking about most people don't even you know, right after the word the they get lost great, right?

716
01:05:44,350 --> 01:06:00,670
Mindset isn't there So the mindset needs to be put together and one way to do it is to just discuss it openly as if we're at the bar You know or in the parking lot some of the best discussions I've ever had Business or otherwise was after a meeting at the parking lot.

717
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:01,670
No one-hour meeting

718
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:07,310
We all decide to leave and I'm at the parking lot still speaking three hours later and after three hours like, you know

719
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,210
We should just go sit down at a bar somewhere

720
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:14,510
Then do another three hours there, so I mean that was some of the best

721
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,510
developmental efforts I've seen

722
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,490
so I was thinking, you know, there's many levels to it, but

723
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:26,650
You know one is of course doing the modules in a semi pedantic way

724
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:31,290
And the other way is just doing so throwing several sonic events at Genesis to get the mindset

725
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:36,390
But again, you know, I'm not considering the audience at all

726
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,010
Very often you see any successful persistent venture.

727
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,330
That's why people say what does it take to be wealthy?

728
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:43,650
What does it take to be successful?

729
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:48,630
You just have to be persistent I mean just look at the the let's just use the internet as an example.

730
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:58,330
It's just rubbish throughout 99.99% of its garbage You know other than having a watch or a clock on it You know the wind-up toy the calendar and a telephone book and reference.

731
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,090
Let's say a telephone book is like your hardware What am I looking for?

732
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:06,230
So instead of just finding the store now you can see if they have a website what they have on their shelves It's just more in-depth.

733
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:07,590
It's just otherwise other than that.

734
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,050
It's garbage, right?

735
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:15,030
so when you look at What makes it so successful its persistence?

736
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:28,650
It's always there, you know, they put it on the phone deliberately so it could be persistently around you Yeah, look at something like McDonald's what made them is they're persistent you know the It's persistent.

737
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:34,710
So I don't see I'm not looking to see in order to be persistent.

738
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:42,310
Also, you have to be able to focus on the audience I I really don't look at the audience that I'm addressing other than I keep reminding myself.

739
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,110
This is planet Earth They're all morons.

740
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,530
I'm meaning all statistically.

741
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,750
There's a few that are not very few, right?

742
01:07:47,790 --> 01:08:01,890
But it doesn't mean it doesn't mean you shouldn't impart because of that you just impart and disqualify it say look When you give a piece of information, you also have to show the contrast This is very contrasting to what's going on.

743
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:02,650
And here's the other thing.

744
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,610
I've said many times before in the past

745
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,450
Back to the internet or movies or fiction or whatever

746
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,170
Most people it's best that they don't know some things

747
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,529
The reason I say this is because you can take the most outrageous

748
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:21,330
Conspiracy theory the most horrific scenario you've seen in film or the deepest darkest

749
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:28,290
Craziest shit you've seen on the internet and reality is ten times worse than that worse than that not better worse

750
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:34,229
The last thing you want to do is just figure out how bad it really is you see

751
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:40,649
What what it really what is really going on is like you're you're asleep on a bunk bed on a tightrope and you don't know

752
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:40,850
it

753
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,729
All right

754
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:49,010
So but fortunately the people's lives are so short that they can't grasp it even

755
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:53,090
And of course, there's also a remoteness aspect to it

756
01:08:53,090 --> 01:09:00,390
Like fortunately, it's not directly happening to you directly you are being affected indirectly, but directly, you know, you've heard me

757
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:06,470
Give the metaphor you'd be thankful that no one came through the window last night ate your liver out of your body while you're sleeping

758
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,069
Yeah

759
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:10,990
That's very direct, but that is going on but not to you.

760
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:15,630
Obviously you wouldn't be here most likely so it is that bad

761
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:19,850
But you don't want to focus on that because most people are so weak-minded

762
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:25,729
They're gonna say oh, I don't want to be around the negativity and you shouldn't but there's a level of objectivity that once you attain

763
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:27,970
In any field you will see it is really that bad

764
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:35,670
But again tie it back to how short your lifespan is the you don't see that as affecting you in within the short lifespan

765
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,010
So there's many aspects to it.

766
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:51,010
That's why like when I bring up religions on how vile and disgusting they are It's not because I find them to be that way It's because anyone can find them to be that way when they look at them objectively There's a difference there, right?

767
01:09:51,689 --> 01:10:04,070
Unless you're totally into coprophagia You know and which most people I would say not most but quite a few enough for the population is That the worse off the worse.

768
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:09,130
It is the more that they like it So that part I don't want to go down that line of understanding.

769
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:34,390
So yeah, there's a you see the balancing of information mean so You know, there's there's many levels to it and the level I think that could be discussed is objectifying it showing the contrast and And then just walking away but you know, there is a You know, there's several like we discussed the modules earlier, right?

770
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:39,830
Right, which sets for more on a personal note even to develop the Genesis module to do it, right?

771
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,810
It's going to be at least four two-hour sonic events.

772
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:50,630
That's going to take me at least two weeks full time to do Wow, so I'm You know, where's the inspiration on that?

773
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:50,990
Right?

774
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:51,950
No, I follow you.

775
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:58,070
There is nothing Yeah, you know and at this point if it came if it went with me to the grave, I'd be totally fine Screw everybody, right?

776
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,290
But then but then that's one side.

777
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:08,110
The other thing is well, you know, you've got to make an effort to do it anyway right, so You see how it works.

778
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:22,790
Oh, yes Yeah a little while back you dropped something about the first five Books of general of the Bible and the words be beside them and What it means?

779
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:27,490
Yeah, every book should be done that way Everything every name a year for years.

780
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:51,590
I've been saying when you read scripture Let's say the book of Zechariah, which means Yahweh remembers when every time you see Zechariah in the script itself Look at the paraphrase the phrase and insert that into the verse Yeah, and then read the verse and then you're like, oh what a change Yeah, same with Danielle the same with the names of the books, right?

781
01:11:51,690 --> 01:12:17,950
So yeah, if you look at better sheath, right you you look at Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers Deuteronomy Right, it would be better sheath, which is beginnings Exodus the names Leviticus pronouncing numbers Bambi Bambi did our desert and Deuteronomy means the words So in the beginning the names are pronouncing in the desert the words is what's the first?

782
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:22,950
Yeah, it's right and then you go on and then there's another level to it within the names

783
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,030
You know like the names of the first seven

784
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:32,970
Patriarchs actually tell you story the the the the first letters of the first word in

785
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:35,450
Genesis tells you the whole story

786
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:37,170
better sheath

787
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,850
the bat rush

788
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,390
Aleph shin tough those letters

789
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:48,110
They give you the whole story of the scripture the 28 letters in the first verse of Genesis

790
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:53,470
They're their numeric position and the meaning of the letters give you the entire story of the entire book.

791
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:55,110
Oh my god, right?

792
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:02,870
yeah, so I mean, you know and then you have a Directional aspect to it where the book of Leviticus?

793
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:13,790
Well, you see the book of Exodus and the book of Numbers every seventh letter in Exodus and book of Numbers Spells out the father's name YHWH every seventh letter in Exodus.

794
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:19,850
It doesn't have to write In numbers, it does it right left, but it's not in Leviticus.

795
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:24,470
So it's as if there are two arrows Pointing at Leviticus if you want to know who why?

796
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:35,850
Hwh is you better read Leviticus That's why his name is used more in that book than any other directly than any other see when you read his name in the book Of Leviticus, it's consolidated.

797
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,410
It's not spread out

798
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:43,210
So it's as if you have two brackets or parentheses as the book of Exodus and the book of Numbers around the book of Leviticus

799
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,310
Yeah, right

800
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,510
You'd see, you know

801
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:50,350
If you could just do it if you look at the interlinear you see every seventh letter starts to begin to spell his name

802
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:54,710
So there's many levels to that but that's not what I want to get into Genesis in Genesis

803
01:13:54,710 --> 01:14:02,310
You can include make that knowledge inclusive, but just discuss, you know when it discusses mankind

804
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,470
How many types of mankind are there?

805
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:05,570
That's right in front of you.

806
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,950
Yeah, and when was it done?

807
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:23,690
No, and when and it's there's no discussion on this I mean there is a little bit there's some rabbinical circles that have discussed it a while back and maybe even now There's a lot of people fighting this it really turns a lot of people But but the thing is then do we take is it metaphor?

808
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,410
Is it literal?

809
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,050
But you what if we take both?

810
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:32,690
Yeah, you see what if we take both if we look at it as metaphor and we look at it as literal and they match Well, guess what?

811
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:55,770
We've got it If we take it as metaphor and then we look at it as being literal and they contradict Well, then you have to make a choice like a four in the road Both or you can in a counter spatial way and I always refer to counter space Counter space going on in Genesis because if each day of creation is a thousand years Why does it matter if it's evening and then morning one day great?

812
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:14,650
That matter where is where does the 24-hour day or the rotation of the earth come into play and it does Even in a thousand year period and discuss that see so and also you when you look at Genesis Is it the first day or a first day a second day or the second day?

813
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,030
Are you aware of that concept?

814
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:31,590
Yeah, there's a big you know ordinal versus cardinal let's say or numeric, you know, or in order of time and in just a Given number or select of many Right to say that I have three cars outside.

815
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,810
Here's here's a first car.

816
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,590
Here's a second car.

817
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:39,430
Here's a third car Well, the third car might have been the first car I bought right?

818
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,710
I Didn't tell you which car I got first.

819
01:15:43,850 --> 01:16:06,510
I just said here's you see So this is an interesting concept that needs to be looked at and we we can do that But you know, so and here's the thing I've given believe it or not I've given enough hints so far through the years on Scripture that you can do I've gave all the hints So if there's someone who's fastidious Diligent and really has the interest you could have done this already, right?

820
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:19,330
Yeah on the other hand I Suggested earlier the only way to really do this properly is with a group or that some kind of an administrative body That has like a collective to it, you know, right?

821
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:22,890
So and it's all sonic events isn't really going to do it

822
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:27,370
But it can like I said, maybe we'll do a module of four two-hour deals

823
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:32,310
Maybe it could be done in just two two-hour deals, you know with Genesis and see how that goes

824
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,370
You know, so like the bullets week or two full-time putting it together

825
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:43,910
But there's another you know, there's another level also, which I always bring up which is is a time yet if it's not time yet

826
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:44,790
It's not going to happen.

827
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:53,570
You'll be met with natural resistance natural meaning the natural world around you'll prevent you from doing it so Let's just let's just see on that.

828
01:16:53,630 --> 01:17:12,350
I think Pursuit of food clothing and shelter is the most important still because if you don't have a body you don't have a consciousness You go unconscious So, you know pursuit of good food good clothing, you know comfortable clothing That's because clothing can affect the health and also the shelter the health in your mindset.

829
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:30,690
So Those things are going to just go very well There was a couple questions in the chat, would you say mystery Babylon would be Jerusalem in the end Of one of yeah, that's a good question.

830
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,330
Uh-huh.

831
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,030
Mm-hmm.

832
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,430
It'll be placed there.

833
01:17:33,470 --> 01:18:01,930
Uh-huh at one point Especially after this new edit a new old edifice is revived there That's one thing I brought up in one of the sonic events You should look out for what's called actually not would say rebuilding but the building of a temple building In in Jerusalem, and it's not going to be on that ridiculous Mount Moriah Platform So it's going to be The temple Mount, right?

834
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:03,830
Yeah, that's not the temple Mount.

835
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:09,970
That's a that's a that's like going That's like going to a soccer stadium and saying that's the Vatican.

836
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,350
Oh Okay.

837
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:23,150
Okay You know, it's not it's a military base what they're These religious quote-unquote Jews are banging their heads against the wall over there Yeah, it's a prank.

838
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:30,450
Yeah, but the rabbis you have to realize I have discussions with people that were born and raised in Israel and

839
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:33,750
Most of people that are in that part of the world are either atheists or secular

840
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:41,270
They're non-religious the majority and the reason why I mean they they are aware of the days that they do on the Babylonia

841
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:43,170
Because remember the modern-day Jews are on the Babylonian

842
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:50,030
Dark moon and their festivals are in line with the Babylonian stuff Egyptian Babylonian not scriptural

843
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:56,890
You know, there's no such thing as a Saturday Sabbath actually or the day starts at sundown only, you know

844
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,230
They never started at sundown

845
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,730
But Babylonians did it for several reasons.

846
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:06,330
I've gone into before and the dark moon came out of Egypt in Egypt in Babylon

847
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,370
we're sister cities, but

848
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:14,170
going back to why most quote-unquote people in Israel are secular is because the rabbis are like little

849
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,710
despots like little

850
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,530
Gestapo's once once you

851
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:26,070
It's a have a pun there right once you decide to be religious the rabbi comes into your life and runs your life

852
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,650
Based on his opinion, of course, you don't want that.

853
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,950
Nobody wants that right?

854
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:36,050
You don't want like a scout master Whatever a little Nazi kind of attitude.

855
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:50,130
That's what they don't have there Wow, you know so these guys got to go those rabbis got to go their attitudes got to change and they're not that smart They sound smart, you know, they're into the tradition, you know Kind of thing.

856
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,110
So that's that's there that watch that.

857
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:57,450
I haven't really got into when I do have discussions with people from Hot it's it is odd.

858
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,250
It's Israel, which is the land of Israel

859
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,970
There a lot of very often

860
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:07,210
They're quite pleased to discuss these things with me because there's a we discuss things that they can't discuss with anyone else

861
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:13,150
But on the other hand those people are going to be going through a drastic change and to go back to mystery

862
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,130
Babylons, which is secret Babylon

863
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:22,310
There is no word is sick secret Babylon, which are the secret Babylonian rituals that were developed after the flood

864
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:28,230
Will be revived there, which is one of the secret Babylon things.

865
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,370
Are you familiar with Zaro isms arrow is?

866
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:45,230
thruster ism It's sort of parallel to Mithra ism It's the religion of the Persians that you have a super like your society will be saved by a special individual That's endowed with superhuman powers that will come out of your society.

867
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:55,090
That's where you get all of That's where you get all of the comic book heroes for you know, they put on a cape and they save the day You know, oh, yeah, one dog mighty dog Batman all Superman.

868
01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:00,730
That's a Zara Zara thruster ism zero ism out of Persia.

869
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:07,970
That's one of the things Mithra is is Another which is the you're here of the holidays in the winter.

870
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,110
That's Mithra ism.

871
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:12,290
Oh, okay Holidays in the winter.

872
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:22,190
Yeah so These things are minor but there are going to be revived Abominations so to speak and that's an accurate term for that.

873
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:35,470
That will be coming in the mid 2020s a Revival of things you see a precursor to it now just like I've given too many examples You know, it's like some people say Greek why so relaxed?

874
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,250
There's no privacy.

875
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:51,850
You're being bat-bugged and it's a police state Because this is a precursor of what the future is going to be like but not in a Malevolent way like it is now in the future, you know, you will know you have no privacy But it will be okay because it'll be good.

876
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,030
You'll have nothing to hide, right?

877
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,210
You'll be lawful right now.

878
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:01,610
You're unlawful That's why you need passwords and all this other stupid stuff and whatever And terrorism insurance, right?

879
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:02,270
Right

880
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:10,170
The police state is it's obviously it's run by the Attorney General's, you know, there's of course, it's unlawful

881
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:16,050
right, but in the future you're going to have police state that makes this one look like but

882
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:20,250
Not even Boy Scouts Cub Scouts, but it's going to be lawful

883
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,330
You see

884
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,290
So so you're being sure

885
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:28,390
Yeah, it'll be lawful

886
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:36,170
People don't know what lawful is it's really and anyone I think I'm the only one around really that's discussing it on an ongoing basis

887
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,790
regarding all things, you know, you have a lawful and unlawful side and

888
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,930
Anyone that hears this kind of discussion?

889
01:22:43,150 --> 01:23:05,090
I assure you it takes you a minimum of three months to a year For that concept to just settle in forget about realizing what lawful and unlawful is just the concept Because that's how far removed this society is So, so when you tell someone you won't have any privacy, but you don't have any privacy now to those that matter anyway Who matters?

890
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:06,910
God's the gods matter.

891
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:18,090
You think you're gonna hide you can't so that you see so there's many aspects to that The only thing that'll be more overt is when you have Enforcement of a lawful society, right?

892
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:22,890
You say we well, I can't do what I want Well, you will be doing what you want, but you'll want lawfulness.

893
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:32,630
So it'll be fine You see right, even though these these demon attorneys they say well you shouldn't even the people say they got people trained Well, you shouldn't worry about it.

894
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:33,730
If you're not doing anything wrong

895
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:36,770
They forget to leave out the part that they're predatory

896
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:44,810
Right and parasitical the legal society is and the police and all that everything comes around the clerks the courts the judges the police

897
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:48,110
The grandma's the people that say, you know all this stuff, you know

898
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:51,270
Well, it's not completely unlawful crap

899
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:58,110
But this is the time period for it so you should be at peace with it, you're not going to change it and

900
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:04,070
Fortunately, you don't hear that anymore as time goes on you notice people saying we have to do the world better

901
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,950
You don't hear that at all anymore almost

902
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:10,130
Still was a little it's still a little bit was around five years ago.

903
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:29,190
Thankfully that stupid shits gone away They people are getting an idea like you're giving an example, you know how I discussed the The amount of time left you could look at architecturally a thousand years ago structures were built to last a thousand years a hundred years ago Both to last a hundred now Especially starting in the past decade or so.

904
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:35,890
All these big structures are designed to last just ten years I mean, I'm sorry 20 25 40 tops, right?

905
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:59,050
Now the other thing that's interesting is about two weeks ago the Bureau of Standards which revises and upgrades Every I think five years or every decade or even every year is an international convention that last month or so They announced that they will no longer ever be meeting to upgrade the standards anymore Why they've been downgrading them for the past hundred years.

906
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:03,250
They had national international convention now all of a sudden They don't need to do it anymore.

907
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:04,230
Oh

908
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:08,810
Maybe they think they're starting if their heart is letting them know that there's no reason to

909
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:13,350
You see so you be aware of the short

910
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:16,510
temporal nature of things that are proclaimed

911
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,170
right, I mean

912
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:27,430
this is the the aspect of and I like for example in America, you know, like the best thing the administration to do is devise a

913
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,910
Distraction about something about North Korea

914
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,370
Shooting missiles and going to war with them

915
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:38,310
How is the US how is the US going to go to war with North Korea when they can't even find it on the map?

916
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:47,530
Yeah Can you can you answer that first and if you can if they have made it there or nearby there It's totally by accident.

917
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:50,170
I'm sure I mean, that's a that's a state.

918
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:53,650
Yeah, that's a matter Yeah, it's a statement an analogy on the intelligence level, right?

919
01:25:53,970 --> 01:26:10,290
Yeah, so I mean there is no discussion about anything I mean how many people are saying this country has been bankrupt and insolvent and in receivership under a credit-based Economy for the past 80 years and we should maybe start addressing revising that How many people are discussing?

920
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:10,690
Yeah.

921
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:21,630
Yeah, I haven't heard a peep Finished that's why I keep saying they're Unrehabilitable unrehabilitable means you can't fix it like Humpty Dumpty.

922
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,250
They teach you that as a young child

923
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,170
Yeah, you can't fix it

924
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:29,210
It has to just run its course just like when you take a shower and you you know

925
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:33,830
You turn off the water and you look down at the drain and they're just a limited amount of water

926
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,830
You're not gonna you're not going to capture that

927
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:40,350
It's going to go down the drain there all the soap scum and all the hair and all that's going down the drain

928
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:41,770
There's nothing you could do to stop it

929
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:47,610
And if you stop try to stop it someone else is going to come and pull the plug because it needs to be drained away

930
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:52,870
Yeah, this is human society at this point and it's been this way for a very long time

931
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,430
the interesting part is that you're you're going to be

932
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:03,070
coalesced spiritually mentally in a in into a state of

933
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,590
Let's say the final state where you will be given a false idea that

934
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:11,210
You'll you're going to be fine, right?

935
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:19,390
It's kind of like have you ever heard of anyone getting a dislocated soul if you know anyone who used to let's say race bicycles Gets into a bike crash most common thing.

936
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:22,910
It's a broken collarbone or clavicle or dislocated shoulder, right?

937
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:42,570
Yeah What they do is they you know, you're in pain and they they have you sit outside and an orderly comes up to you and he says we're gonna go see the doctor now and there's two big guys one guy grabs You one guy holds the arm says but I'm gonna move your arm on three You're ready and they go to one two, and they pull it on two not on three, right?

938
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:46,450
Because if you know because you're gonna flinch you're gonna tighten up on three.

939
01:27:46,530 --> 01:28:07,050
This isn't what humanity is going into Right in the mid-2020 you're gonna be told that this is gonna be a perfect society for the next thousand years and Then you have a little few years of that and then the kill shots start coming Yeah, and you're not gonna and everyone's gonna be good What kind of a mindset does society have to have what kind of a fervor?

940
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:12,690
Where you read on the news or whatever that a billion people were killed last night and it's okay.

941
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,770
We're gonna clean up Right.

942
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:18,230
Could you imagine that kind of a that mindset does not exist now?

943
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:36,550
Does not exist as we stand right now So what kind of a mindset change are you going to have in the next seven years plus to accept that Well, you're also you're also gonna have other events is gonna be two three billion overnight And you're gonna be like, okay, what so we'll just get back on track.

944
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:40,470
It's alright I mean, yeah, it's sad or whatever, but we'll fix it.

945
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,450
Could you imagine that what kind of a mindset?

946
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:51,030
You're gonna be set up for in the next seven years So when someone asks, what is this next seven year like think about the how radical of a change of mindset.

947
01:28:51,970 --> 01:29:08,270
I Mean right now as it is what you people are accepting across the board whether it's food Social scientific education religious across the board that if he was presented 52 people from 50 or 70 years ago There would be an ultimate shock Very them would be the ultimate shock to them.

948
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:16,310
They'd say we have to stop everything we're doing so this doesn't happen But right now what I'm telling you is as a screwed up as it is today Or as it was yesterday.

949
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:23,510
Well, I think about what kind of a mindset change how drastic it's going to be that a billion or more Over dead overnight.

950
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,890
It's going to be acceptable in the next seven years.

951
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:30,370
So watch out for that Watch what you what how people's morality?

952
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:37,150
Well, what's what what warped morality they have is going to be stretched to its elastic limit Watch for that.

953
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:45,010
Oh Okay think about yeah, oh, yeah, it's a lot All right.

954
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,770
Yeah, you guys are getting a lot you get more than a nickel's worth that's for sure.

955
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:50,270
Oh god.

956
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:55,110
Yes, so Anything else or we should maybe start wrapping it up.

957
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,130
Let's see here.

958
01:29:56,290 --> 01:30:20,170
We got anybody else Are the scholarly article stating Yahweh was just a low-level storm God at one point true No, no, not at all Here here's the the aspect to scholar scholars, they'd never really go direct It's very rare that scholars go direct to source documents.

959
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:23,130
They always like to read what someone else wrote

960
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,830
They'll spend their entire career on what someone else wrote

961
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:31,010
Hmm, I'll use names like these morons like Jordan Maxwell

962
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,350
I mean, I don't like to put out names

963
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:38,350
But I will pray and who's the before him was the he based his work on whatever these guys are total moronic

964
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,090
And I know it's funny how

965
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,130
It's like the magician

966
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:43,570
idea

967
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:51,230
You like or the the Gnostics which was based on magic and you know, even Tyson's still support them

968
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:56,010
what makes them nervous is for example, if you're a magician on stage and

969
01:30:56,930 --> 01:31:01,910
You're performing what makes you nervous is another magician comes and sits down in the audience

970
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:06,750
Because you don't know if he's gonna open his mouth and tell the people in the audience how you're pulling this illusion over them

971
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:12,210
and the illusion that most of the people that have been on this stupid rectangle like I mentioned Maxwell and I mean

972
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,810
There's thousands of others, but he just jumped out.

973
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:15,670
Someone sent me a link.

974
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,330
There's always stuff is great What do you mean?

975
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,550
Oh boy, you know forget it.

976
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:20,210
You don't get it

977
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,470
If you see, you know, he is counting on your ignorance

978
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:27,750
University is counting on your ignorance scholarly documents are counting on your ignorance

979
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:31,750
The people on the rectangle are counting on your ignorance

980
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:39,350
And if you they're very very superficial and they're basically liars and frauds basically at the root of it

981
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:45,710
Now I'm not saying this has to do you should go and be naive and

982
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:49,990
Go around and say well, this is a source document.

983
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:50,450
It's good.

984
01:31:50,550 --> 01:32:12,970
No, that's being naive Crazy, so there's another level to you have to do what's called proofing so and You know, fortunately, I don't get it as much lately as I have in the past people just throwing stuff at me for approval You know, okay, right But you know on one hand it's like oh no No, this is it does several things when people ask for approval one.

985
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:15,250
It shows well the person is looking for approval They're not sure.

986
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:23,430
The other thing is showing that how bombarded and how Would have a sad shape, you know the information stratum of society is right?

987
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:30,570
There's so much stuff out there That how is any how can anyone humanly possibly go through all of it and figure out what's correct, right?

988
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:38,370
Yes, and the other the other level as well There's a level of discernment is it is the person who's asking the question really listening to what I'm saying?

989
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:44,730
Because I'll tell you the majority of the time already answered it Yeah, black already answered it.

990
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:50,890
So, you know, there's many combinations to it all to be Again, you know, this is a gorilla.

991
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:53,410
I'm a gorilla informist I come out.

992
01:32:53,530 --> 01:33:02,630
I just do a hit and I run right, you know, there's not that's why you go to the website There's not much up there You know and whatever there's no reason to at this point.

993
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:12,690
Mm-hmm You know if there's three people on the planet that got what I'm saying That's three times more than I thought I would have get gotten, you know, correct.

994
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,250
