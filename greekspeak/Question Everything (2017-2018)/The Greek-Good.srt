1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,380
Greetings folks, we're live with the Greek.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,120
How are you doing tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,440
Greetings, okay, fair to Midland, almost the same as I was last week.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,060
Yeah, cool.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,320
There doesn't look like there's much going on other than an email that I got about seaweed.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:43,320
And that's a tricky one because when seaweed is harvested, you know, as food, lots of crustaceans, barnacles, seahorses, things like that stick to it, so those are unclean animals.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,400
So the quality of the preparation, and then of course, is it a fungus?

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,620
No, it's not a fungus.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,820
Is it a plant?

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,020
Yes it is, an aquatic plant.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,140
And does it bear seed?

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,580
Typically the kelp varieties do.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,019
So you're going to have to do your own research on, you know, particular seaweeds in that respect.

14
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,280
But there are some that obviously don't have seeds and some that are not so obvious that they do.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,340
If you've ever swung kelp around, you'll notice there are little seeds that pop out that look like cherry pits, you know, or smaller.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,220
So that's the answer on that.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:27,140
It's basically harvest, you know, are you eating, you know, certain hamburger places say 100% beef?

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:35,920
Well, you know, in Spain, if you order a hamburger, it's 100% horse meat, unless you specifically order a beef one.

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,440
If anyone in Spain wants to validate that, please do.

20
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,940
So, you know, they would mix it with other animals, just like the original hot dogs were pork, or no, were beef and lamb.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,100
The original hot dogs, yeah, there were beef and lamb and then they went to beef.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,540
So, you know, is it 100% seaweed, you know?

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,240
I guess the question brings up unclean things.

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,440
You know, it was interesting, I was doing a little bit of research on clean and unclean.

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
You could go look up the words in Greek are very different.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,280
They interchange several things.

27
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:21,280
But essentially, the essence is, you know, the intent of translating it to unclean is fairly accurate, which is not unclean, as your normal idiot uses it, it's just spiritually unclean, right?

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,480
And it's spiritually unclean depending on which deity you profess to have allegiance to and laws to follow.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Right.

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,740
Right, because there are certain deities that demand children to be eaten, so you see what I mean?

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,540
Right.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:55,680
But anyway, the interesting part is there are verses that you'll find, like, in what they call the New Testament, I believe there is, you know, and there'll be no unclean thing on the earth and unclean spirits and, you know, if you examine what that really means, meaning it's things that fall out of the lawful ways, basically.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Permissible or not permissible, in Arabic it would be haram and halal.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,100
You know, halal is permissible and haram is impermissible.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:04,820
Right.

36
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,820
Not necessarily to you, but to the way the order created by the most high deity.

37
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,800
So, you know, these things need to be explained in terms of what they are when there's interest.

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,620
And like I said, I think, last week, the only thing left to do, and I've been watching now for about a decade,

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:37,000
actually I've been speaking publicly since what they call 2003, 2004, on the pagan work schedule, so it's more than a decade,

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,240
and I've noticed that initially people get interest because it's different, and then you become a moron magnet,

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:54,960
you know, you attract people that are morons, which is not difficult to, it's difficult to work as planet earth,

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,280
I mean, generally most humans are morons, and then it just becomes like, oh yeah, this is way too out there, you know.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,840
So, in essence, the only thing left to do because of that established condition with anything is to warn people,

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,540
but not the boy who cried wolf, and not the dyke is going to burst, but just basically people are not interested in learning,

45
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,120
the general group, and they're not even interested in hearing or seeing,

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,440
but the warnings should come in a way that they can also handle it, otherwise if they can't handle it,

47
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,720
then it's not really, you know, the communication hasn't been established, that's why you have international symbols, right?

48
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,480
Right.

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,940
It transcends language and things like that.

50
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:50,940
So that's, I think, the communication technology from, you know, it's been for a while and for the future, is how do you give these idiots the warning?

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,220
Now remember, the warning is two-fold.

52
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:09,100
One is that that's all that you can basically communicate to these idiots because they can't comprehend anything else beyond that because they're so stuck and censored, but on the other hand, it also makes it easier for the spiritual side because now their guilt is on them, you see?

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Right.

54
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,520
So you have to comprehend the guilt, right?

55
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:22,480
You ever see someone being executed, hung, or they read the charges again, and they understand, you know, in a court, they ask you, do you understand?

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
And you say, yes.

57
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,320
Well, okay, well, that's it, you know?

58
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,160
That's that, yeah.

59
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,080
So the technology, the communication technology, is how do you give the warning message to these morons?

60
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,920
You know, the 7 billion plus, whatever.

61
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
By the way, in terms of human population, just to bounce around a little bit.

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,540
Sure.

63
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,020
If you add up, you know how they say there's 7.5 billion people on the planet?

64
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,700
I was having a discussion with someone about a year ago.

65
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,920
They're a number, they're a bean counter.

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
I mean, you could, they have a mathematical mind.

67
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
You could say, like, what's 462 divided by 56?

68
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,080
They'll give you the answer to two decimal places almost instantly.

69
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,520
By the time you even reach a calculator, they've got it, right?

70
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,080
Right.

71
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,460
And there's simple techniques on how to do that, right?

72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,280
Mm-hmm.

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:13,020
But anyway, what they did was they did some research, every country in the world, and they added up the given population.

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,440
It was way short, even than 7 billion.

75
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,020
So it seems to be almost three-quarter of a billion or a billion people missing from that 7.5 billion statistic.

76
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,740
In other words, the aggregate doesn't make up the whole.

77
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,500
Right.

78
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,960
You see?

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,980
So anyway, when I say 7 billion or 7, that's suspect.

80
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,300
I'm seeing the population on the surface right now.

81
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,300
We don't know much about those below the surface.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,500
Mm-hmm.

83
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,620
So, yeah, that's pretty much the message that I have to give.

84
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,620
And also, by the way, it's what they call the pagan new year, I believe.

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,500
Yes.

86
00:06:46,500 --> 00:07:02,900
And I believe that if you've got more than two brain cells together or one in the mirror, so it looks you think you have two, you've noticed all the idiots in the past couple of weeks, what they get caught up in, and not only of the Judeo-Christian ethic, but other religions as well.

87
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Mm-hmm.

88
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,560
So let that be your warning on how to structure the way you communicate with these morons.

89
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,480
Because remember, a small percentage, given maybe single or I'd say double-digit percentage, are dangerous as well.

90
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,240
So beware.

91
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,540
Yeah.

92
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah, so I don't see – I haven't really been in chat much.

93
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,940
I haven't been looking at the chat.

94
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,360
Not that I ever expected anything.

95
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,040
I think the chat is more of a courtesy.

96
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,180
I think there's more people than meets the eye on the chat.

97
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,840
Because I remember when we moved over to this chat, I got over 70 or 80 emails.

98
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,880
But there seems to be always the same three or four people.

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,800
So I think people just come to see what else is new.

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,460
They prefer to be silent, which is good.

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
And Jeremiah says, in times of evil, the wise will be silent.

102
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,520
But I don't think the chat serves anything.

103
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,040
So I don't really spend time – You're just typing in and saying hi or looking to see if anything's new.

104
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
But other than that, yeah.

105
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,840
Yeah, but in terms of the chat, it's better to get hi than to say hi.

106
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,000
But anyway, I would say, yeah, there's not much just going on with Greek-speak.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,340
I think I've done my job, I should say.

108
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,080
Or job, in this case.

109
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:35,380
So I know that Sam, who was on last week, has the – If you haven't figured it out, he's got a little Greek-speak project, right?

110
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,179
Right, yes.

111
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,380
And he might be doing a podcast or something.

112
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,260
So I might be doing that.

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,380
But otherwise, I don't really see continuing in any public way, even though this is a very small venue.

114
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't think there's – I mean, believe it or not, this is probably the first time in several thousand years that everything and everything under the sun could have been discussed and brought to mind.

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:06,760
No one else – pat my own back – no one else in history has ever done that from a secular or spiritual perspective outside of scripture or anything extraordinary.

116
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm not saying I'm extraordinary.

117
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,020
I'm saying what's been brought up is truly extraordinary.

118
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:22,020
So I think just going back to not necessarily visiting sonics like we do on a – it doesn't take much to do it, you know, to come around and do it.

119
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,720
But I don't think there's any need for it.

120
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
I don't need to hear myself.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,820
And I don't think people need to hear anymore.

122
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,460
There's not much going on.

123
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,540
No one's coming forward to move it in a productive way other than Sam and yourself.

124
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,260
And even then, it's just minuscule.

125
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,860
I mean, some people in the past have heard me say, oh, this is going to be really great.

126
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,440
It will go worldwide.

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,160
No, it's not.

128
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,420
Not in this world.

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,280
In another world, maybe.

130
00:09:46,520 --> 00:10:03,760
So I'm pretty happy with, you know, accomplished – I could say myself as a vessel of put forward more than anyone else has in the history – known history in terms of every subject known to man brought up, not in depth because it can be.

131
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
Researching it together is good.

132
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,380
We've covered everything above the earth, below the earth, on the earth, the human body, the mind, everything.

133
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:23,540
And I don't think it's either the right time to move forward with anything substantial or it's probably not going to be done public just like anything else.

134
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,020
But I think I can retire from these sonic events, and you could free up what you call your Tuesdays and all that as well.

135
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,180
And I think this might be just a farewell message to the chat and the sonics and all that.

136
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,380
The e-mail will still be up.

137
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't have any plans on doing anything on the website, so there's no reason to go to it unless you don't know how to – you know, you forgot the e-mail.

138
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,760
So pretty much I just – yeah.

139
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,440
So, yeah, I think we'll just go on, take each heartbeat, each breath on this wretched planet right now.

140
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,740
It is wretched, by the way.

141
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,840
It's beautiful, but what's been, you know, habitating is horrid and make the best of it, right?

142
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,760
Correct, yeah.

143
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,520
So I don't see any purpose to continue on sonics or development.

144
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,560
And like I said, you know, Sam might be doing some podcasts or whatever.

145
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,360
I said I'd jump on that.

146
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,600
Sure.

147
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,600
And it'll probably be more structured than anything done before.

148
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,020
He'll – you know, Sam will sit back and ponder subjects and all that, and we'll go over it, and there'll be an hour or 55 minutes.

149
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,380
But I don't think there's much – this is the wrong planet for this.

150
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,560
They're in the wrong time, so let's not be foolish.

151
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,520
Which is a shame, yes.

152
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,320
Hmm.

153
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,100
What's been shameful from the beginning?

154
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
Look at Adam and Eve.

155
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,660
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,180
They screwed up big time.

157
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,060
Now, the people before, I think they were caught in a dynamic that they really had very little control over.

158
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,400
But we measure time from Adam and Eve in that group.

159
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,460
Right.

160
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,100
So it's still a pathetic situation.

161
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,560
But in essence, I would say there's not much to – I mean, there's tremendous things to discuss.

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:23,840
Like lately I've been doing a lot of experiments, both thought and practical experiments with sound, electrodynamics, magnetism, food stuff, biological stuff.

163
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,000
And there's no – I mean, I just look at what the response – not that I – you know, what was me or anything.

164
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:39,840
It's just that there is – first of all, the response is not there, and I don't think it will be even if it was – more in-depth information was put out.

165
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,060
And secondly, if you put out too much information with proof, so you'll have a knock at the door in the middle of the night and they'll drag you out, literally.

166
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:55,040
At this point, the stuff that I'm working on is to that point where you don't want to be public.

167
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,320
You know, about health stuff or energy stuff or anything.

168
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:14,940
I mean, it'll be dangerous if you – in other words, I could bring stuff in passing about health and things, but actually to sit down and do a three- or four-hour on how to build things and make things and apply them, that'll get you in trouble.

169
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,740
Yeah, we don't need that.

170
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,380
We don't need that.

171
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:35,960
Yeah, so I think, you know, it's too bad the conditions are the way they are, but, you know, again, like recently I had a discussion with someone about all the misery and how people still ask, well, you know, God is an asshole because look at all the misery and suffering.

172
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,220
They don't even know what they're talking about, you know, which there's never a singular God, right?

173
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,120
Correct.

174
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:57,760
But the thing is, what we're promised is what comes after is so great and so rich and so abundant that all this stuff that people question and are involved in, including myself, you know, just looking at how idiotic everything is, will be compensated for, you know.

175
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,080
It's like tripping on a sidewalk and breaking a toenail and you're given $100 billion for compensation.

176
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:03,860
Correct.

177
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,700
And it's not that you need the $100 billion, but that much extra, you see.

178
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,060
So that's what's coming.

179
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,740
And in the meantime, I don't see, because I've been coming around for about a year now on the, you know,

180
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,240
we've been doing the Tuesday and I thank you for the effort, but I look at it and I'm like,

181
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,240
there's no inspiration, there's no need, there's no, I mean,

182
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,300
and I look at the people that I've interacted with in the past decade and it's like,

183
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,140
this is a pretty fucked up situation, so just, you know, keep it to yourself unless it's necessary.

184
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Right.

185
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,160
Yeah.

186
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,880
And I don't see any need anywhere.

187
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:53,780
I think just everybody needs to live out their life day by day or however you think you want to plan it, week by week, year by year, however, and whatever delusion you enjoy, and that's it, pretty much.

188
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:03,440
And the only thing that really deserves seriousness and apologetics, meaning to defend, is the warning on humanity.

189
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:26,900
And it can be as subtle as a young parent telling them there's no need to save for college for their child in ten years, it's stupid, because there are going to be no colleges, you know, but all the way to letting people know the existence of the spiritual world.

190
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:36,900
Now the problem with that is, not to harp on anyone directly, but indirectly I could say generally, I haven't met anyone who can at this point even articulate the basics.

191
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,360
So again, there's no need to continue.

192
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,400
It's just a really bad situation.

193
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,500
I don't see any questions.

194
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,620
Let me see if I have the email open.

195
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,820
But it's kind of good for me as well.

196
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:17,520
I could just consciously put the idea of speaking and doing streaming and all that stuff out of my mind and be more focused on other things, even though, like I said, it doesn't take away much of the focus, but it's just an odd thing that you want to come and share and there's no venue to share.

197
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,800
There's no interest.

198
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,760
Is a room a room if there's nobody in it?

199
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,080
That's right.

200
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,020
Well, I myself have got to say I'm deeply grateful.

201
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,380
Oh good, so am I.

202
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:54,240
It's been quite the eye-opener and it's forced me to take some very hard looks at things and career and all that and I'll be always eternally grateful for that.

203
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,480
Okay, great.

204
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,620
I appreciate it.

205
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,300
But remember, it's evil.

206
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:11,720
Remember, you tell children, go to college so you can make fake money, so it's going to be a fake education at a fake job with fake science and fake medicine and fake food and fake love.

207
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,839
It's all fake.

208
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,420
It's evil.

209
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:28,660
So if you could go through a universal mindset, you scan the universe and see what's happening on earth, you would never speak a word to anyone.

210
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,000
You'd be like, what the fuck?

211
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,740
Get me out of here.

212
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:42,580
So the aspect of existing and all this other stuff is simply that, food, clothing and shelter.

213
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:59,660
You've been given a fleshy body for a reason that you'll find out later because it's the best vehicle at the moment and the condition of everything being fake and delusional and deception is so the time period passes.

214
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,600
Because if you overtly show people the evil behind it, they'll all check out.

215
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
They'll flip out.

216
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,100
You won't be able to have anything function.

217
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,600
So it's basically the waiting room.

218
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,920
You can't have people waiting in a hallway in a dentist's office or a doctor's office or whatever.

219
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,700
They get too fidgety.

220
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,320
You have to make it comfortable enough, but not so much that they forget that they're in the waiting room.

221
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,840
But now people are in the waiting room and they forgot that they're in the waiting room.

222
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,600
So it's too fucked up to address.

223
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,600
Okay, cool.

224
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,680
So just do your things, everybody.

225
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,420
The Uncommon site, Uncommon Radio, which is a kickass site in terms of URL.

226
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,800
I have no plans on putting anything up there or doing anything with it.

227
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
The only thing is just a courtesy for the email.

228
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,940
And that's pretty much it.

229
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:09,980
And I've been, I created a stream, web streaming, rebroadcasting old events.

230
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,440
Okay.

231
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,860
And that's been going well.

232
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,100
That's been going well.

233
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,620
Yeah, good.

234
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,480
Again, this is out of time, out of place stuff.

235
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,400
And if you feel like you're out of time and out of place, I don't just leave people hanging.

236
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:37,120
If you understand even 5% or 10% of Greek-speak, you'll see how things are just too fucked up to do anything.

237
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,000
So the only thing to do is food, clothing, shelter, live a basic life.

238
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,320
Check your desires at the door.

239
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,420
Heck yeah.

240
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,700
And be very, what do you call it, even.

241
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Key on set apart.

242
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
What I mean even is don't get, be efficient.

243
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
Don't get caught up in all the bullshit.

244
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,820
Because it's been, not just now, like people think, it's always been bullshit.

245
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,000
And it will manifest.

246
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,460
Oh yeah.

247
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,420
So with that said, I don't think any...

248
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,560
Well, thank you.

249
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,200
Like I say, I've been very grateful for everything you've given.

250
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,160
Yeah, right.

251
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,920
And I very much appreciate it.

252
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,080
Well, here's the thing, not to be sarcastic or anything, but it's nothing you couldn't have figured out on your own.

253
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,400
You just needed a little hint.

254
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,500
That's all.

255
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,160
If you tell someone, you know, a dog took a poop in the room, well, it's not that they couldn't have figured it out on their own.

256
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,880
You just give them a heads up, right?

257
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,820
Right.

258
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,240
You'll smell it in a second, right?

259
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,680
Yeah.

260
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,660
Oh, yeah, okay, thanks.

261
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,540
But after a while, then it's like, it doesn't matter who told you, it's just that now you know, right?

262
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,200
Right.

263
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah.

264
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,120
And remember, the gods are about knowledge.

265
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,760
They couldn't give a rat's ass about belief.

266
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,760
So, you know, that's the first thing you're going to find out at the resurrection, by the way.

267
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,940
So belief has nothing to do with it.

268
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:21,840
The only time belief comes into play is if you're given information and the way you view it as being speculative, reliable, or unreliable.

269
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,040
And when the gods give information, especially the most high, it's reliable.

270
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,620
And that's the only factor for belief.

271
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,500
So the rest of it is a waste of time.

272
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,720
Not a waste of time, just taking up the time.

273
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,640
I mean, can anybody be in a waiting room and say you're wasting your time?

274
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,880
Well, isn't the waiting room set up for that?

275
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Right.

276
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,260
It's not going to be wasting your time in a waiting room.

277
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:55,380
What is a waste of time is the manifestation of the evil or the unclean or the deception for so long to us.

278
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,200
Yeah.

279
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,500
Yeah.

280
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,920
Let's see, one last question.

281
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,360
Will it be reunited with family and friends at resurrection?

282
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,680
Who the fuck would want to?

283
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,860
I think you're going to run the other way at that point.

284
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,760
There's so much money.

285
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,280
No, you won't.

286
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,900
You'll be given a choice on that, and you'll be surprised.

287
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,940
And that's actually, Christ is very clear about that, by the way.

288
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
He's very clear.

289
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,020
And no, the answer to that is no, you won't be reunited.

290
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,460
It's inconsequential.

291
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,680
There's no irrelevant.

292
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,200
Irrelevant.

293
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,700
It's like if you have puppies, are they ever going to be reunited with the bitch that bore them?

294
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
That's a proper term, by the way.

295
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,760
People use it as if they think it's...

296
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,560
Or is the egg you had for breakfast going to be reunited with the hen that laid it?

297
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,120
Or siblings?

298
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,860
No, the answer is no to that.

299
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
It doesn't mean you'll be barred or banned from it.

300
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,220
No, but it's irrelevant at that point.

301
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:22,580
I think if anyone who has looked at even cursory examination of what they call the New Testament, or even prior, you'll see that there's actually a dissemblance or dissimilarness of what a spiritual family is and an earthly family is.

302
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:34,800
And I'll give the example when Christ runs out of the house saying, you are my brother, you are my mother, you are my sister, to the apostles.

303
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,380
So...

304
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,080
You see?

305
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:50,000
And my first thing is, when you really find out what your friends and family are, why the hell would you want to be reunited with them?

306
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,520
I mean earthly ones, you know, the ones that are earthly.

307
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,980
And that kind of question is always posed in a secular manner.

308
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,080
Right?

309
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,280
And I'm taking it as a secular point of view.

310
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah.

311
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:16,420
70% or 80% of all homicides or murders are friends or family, and 90% of the time they take place in the kitchen or the bedroom.

312
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,100
Yeah.

313
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,500
You take that and figure out what I'm trying to say.

314
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,000
Right?

315
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,280
Yeah.

316
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,700
You talk about relationships with people.

317
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,140
How negative does a relationship have to be before you actually are driven to kill someone?

318
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,420
And why is it that more than three quarters of the time it's a friend or family close, and it's always in the kitchen or the bedroom?

319
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,260
90% of the time.

320
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,880
You think the old Ford motor light would have came on and said, time to leave.

321
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:50,720
Right.

322
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,120
So why the hell would you want to reconnect back to them later to do it all over again?

323
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,780
Anyway, yeah.

324
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,380
Okay.

325
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Study people, and it's not what you think.

326
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,400
That's what I always tell you.

327
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:09,080
But how can you understand it's not what you think when you don't even know what it is, or you don't even see it?

328
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah.

329
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,060
Right.

330
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,940
You can't even see it.

331
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,260
All right.

332
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,940
And if there's ever a need for a sonic event, but don't rehash stuff and loose general stuff.

333
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,420
If there's anything specific or a project anyone wants to do, I'm up for it.

334
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:38,560
And, by the way, I've been asked to do, I've turned down, more like indirectly, like, oh, I'm doing interviews and stuff.

335
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,160
I think the Ocelli and the Greek was good.

336
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:48,200
I think 90% of the people on the chat are from Freeman, which Freeman doesn't fly, and Ocelli has no effect, by the way.

337
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,580
So doing that kind of, consider that filler and just getting out there.

338
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,180
Yeah.

339
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,080
And that's why I did it, by the way.

340
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,680
I mean, neither Ocelli nor Freeman, after I said the, I lost them.

341
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,940
Maybe Ocelli got a little bit because he still uses a little bit of the time.

342
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,700
He got the time part a little bit.

343
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,120
But he doesn't understand how significant it is.

344
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:22,440
But, yeah, I mean, I look at people that want to do an interview or a show, and I'm like, I'm going to lose them and their audience after I say the word the.

345
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,580
And that's like, do I really want to keep, you know, like, for what?

346
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,460
You know, I'm not a public-type person.

347
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,240
There's a room in the room and nobody's in it.

348
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,760
Yeah, so it's like, oh, shit.

349
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,900
So, yeah, it's just like a light bulb.

350
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:39,440
Yeah.

351
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,320
Okay.

352
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,980
All very well understood.

353
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,400
Very well.

354
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,160
Hoorah.

355
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,180
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

356
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,700
And I don't want to be a moron magnet.

357
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,860
And, you know, as you get older, as you get older, you have fewer and fewer people.

358
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:06,700
You know, when you're young, you want to, you know, you start bringing out more and more, you know, relationships and acquaintanceships, I should say.

359
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,220
And as you get older, you start finding yourself with fewer and fewer people.

360
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,640
You know, not always, but, you know, if you become more discerning.

361
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,740
I can attest to that.

362
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,480
Yeah, so this is a type of world where if you are trying to do the right thing, you will die alone, by the way.

363
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,000
I won't guarantee you, but I assure you, but you're never really alone.

364
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,720
No.

365
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,260
So that's just the essence of it.

366
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,340
Yeah, I think more can be discussed, more can be said or not said.

367
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,780
So I think the not saying it wins out.

368
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:51,060
But, again, if anyone is looking for advice, which I do give, is learn how to warn these idiots.

369
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,760
Not only for their sake, they have no sake.

370
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,620
It's to make it easier for the angelic realm, right, because it's going to be known.

371
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:10,920
Like, for example, if you read in scripture, there is no way Israel would have been deported or ousted from the land unless the prophets had told them they would be.

372
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:25,220
So, yeah, the best way to get back to these idiots is not to get back to them in a bad way, but just to relay back is, you know, how do you warn them?

373
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:26,960
Right.

374
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,220
Not inform them.

375
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,940
They have no interest in your dumb animals.

376
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:39,160
I think as you've proved here, that's going to be quite the uphill challenge.

377
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,520
Well, you can work on it.

378
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,560
Of course.

379
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,180
Yeah, and see if the moment comes up.

380
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,320
But you've still got quite a ways, not quite a ways, years before it's more evident.

381
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,360
You know, the Middle East Union is your sign, by the way.

382
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,700
Right, exactly.

383
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:13,540
But the whole world being homogeneously infected is, in essence, you will see parallel things happening in your household, neighborhood, country, when those parallel things are, you know, the implementation of the goddess religion.

384
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,440
I think I've discussed that at length, but not at great length.

385
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,740
And also the, you know, the deception, the evil.

386
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,980
But within that, you're going to be exposed to what is lawful and what is, you know, who the true, who the high, I say true God.

387
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,500
No, even the lesser gods are true gods, but not the gods of truth, meaning the boss.

388
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,220
Right.

389
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,160
So there's no knowledge of that yet.

390
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,770
So there you go.

391
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,910
Yeah, I don't think there's anything else.

392
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,530
Let's see.

393
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,770
Ocelli in the Greek is set out very well, like an index in the book.

394
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,250
Yeah, it is.

395
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,530
I'd say it was a good project and thankful to that.

396
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,550
But, you know, if you look at like Ocelli or Fremont, that's a good example.

397
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:12,290
You just go on about, you know, the goats, not in a bad way, but, you know, you eat at the moment.

398
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,690
Wherever you're with is what's the best.

399
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,110
You know, there's no discernment.

400
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,770
Right.

401
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,910
Unless they personally piss you off, then that's the only time you discern when it's a personal matter.

402
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,410
And then you, that's common.

403
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,170
That's the nature.

404
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,930
And then always alone or never alone.

405
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,190
Yeah.

406
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,190
Being alone by oneself is not easy for everybody.

407
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,630
Having three young children, I miss them when they're not around.

408
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,190
Depends on how young.

409
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,270
Yeah.

410
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,270
If they can speak and watch television, they're fucked.

411
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,270
So, I don't know.

412
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,590
The new modern nanny.

413
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,650
Yeah, they're just demon food.

414
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,190
But, yeah.

415
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,570
Okay, 15-year-old.

416
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,570
Yeah.

417
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,550
Yeah, okay.

418
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,810
Well, a 15-year-old is pretty much on their way.

419
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,270
They know they're an adult more than they're a child at that point.

420
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:10,990
Yeah.

421
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,070
But if they're interested, yeah, that's fine.

422
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,950
It's not a Greek speak.

423
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,630
It's just, you know, are they interested in doing the right thing.

424
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:17,730
Right.

425
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,890
So, yeah, I think it's meant to be.

426
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,570
It is meant to be, because it's the waiting room.

427
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,310
And it's an interesting.

428
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,890
There's so much more to talk about.

429
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,010
Maybe in the future.

430
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,630
Who knows?

431
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,330
Yeah.

432
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:36,230
But right now, I don't think it's conducive or popular or necessary to come around the chat.

433
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,230
Not that I'm going to be avoiding it.

434
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:44,030
But if there's anything anyone needs, like an e-mail, if you want to do a sonic on anything, we can do it.

435
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,610
I think Bruce will contact TXB29B.

436
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,130
What is it?

437
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:50,530
TXB29B.

438
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,030
Yeah.

439
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,330
Yeah.

440
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,810
On the chat.

441
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,670
And you guys know how to get in touch with me.

442
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,570
It's easy on Skype.

443
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,710
It's the same as the e-mail.

444
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,990
But, you know, coming around, it's just like, yeah.

445
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,770
Like today, I was like, I would do a sonic today.

446
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,250
Like, why?

447
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,510
You know, last week, I was like, why?

448
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,510
And the week before, why?

449
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,130
Why bother?

450
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,450
You know, it's like nothing going on.

451
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,150
I mean, there's so much to do.

452
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,150
There is so much to do.

453
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,930
You know, like the remediation of toxicity and things like that in the body.

454
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,910
I mean, there's just so much to do.

455
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,590
You know, it's like, never mind.

456
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:34,890
Well, as I always have said, I extend my services anytime.

457
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,030
Oh, you've done great on that.

458
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:46,250
You know, I don't think I've ever maybe a little bit tried to come on and access what you've done.

459
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,570
But I think most people can.

460
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,110
And I really don't know what you've done with it.

461
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,350
I haven't been around it to look or monitor it or critique it or, you know, pat you on the back.

462
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,630
But I'll just give you a veritable pat on the back.

463
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,490
Thanks for doing that for other people.

464
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,270
You're welcome.

465
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:04,910
All right.

466
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,330
Well, with that said, I don't see much going on.

467
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,710
Like I said, Sam is going to – I think it's the Greekspeak.com thing.

468
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,970
And we might be doing podcasts and all that.

469
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,910
But, you know, why bother?

470
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,250
So in the meantime, enjoy.

471
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,370
I think you've got several hundred hours or a couple of hundred hours at least.

472
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,650
It's in the high 200s, I know that.

473
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,010
Yeah.

474
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:26,930
Good.

475
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,090
That's more than enough.

476
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,270
So that's always rebroadcasting 24 hours a day.

477
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,810
Mm-hmm.

478
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,750
And there's people taking advantage of it, which is good.

479
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,790
And then, of course, we've got the archives up there.

480
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,830
That'll stay.

481
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,190
Cool.

482
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,550
Just leave it alone.

483
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,770
No effort to running it.

484
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,710
It does it by itself, actually.

485
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,990
I have no need for it.

486
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,330
Oh, yeah.

487
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,530
Yeah, the server or the program sorts it, right?

488
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,810
Mm-hmm.

489
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,370
Yeah.

490
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,010
So it's pretty easy that way.

491
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,970
Occasionally I come across a few things here and there and I pop them up there.

492
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,610
Yeah, good.

493
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,389
Yeah.

494
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,449
Yeah, it's all about mindset.

495
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,389
It is.

496
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,070
It is.

497
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:11,870
Mm-hmm.

498
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:13,889
All right.

499
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:14,889
Well, with that.

500
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,750
Well, thanks, everyone.

501
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,270
Thank you very much, Greek.

502
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,270
And you be well in all your endeavors.

503
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,070
You as well.

504
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,989
And thanks for all the archives and stuff.

505
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,870
All right, guys.

506
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:25,650
Thanks.

507
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,250
Thanks, Bruce.

508
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:26,850
Yeah.

509
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,570
Bye-bye.

510
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,389
Bye.

511
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,489
Bye.

512
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,050
Bye.

513
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:30,670
Bye.

514
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:30,929
Bye.

515
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:31,550
Bye.

516
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,340
Bye.
