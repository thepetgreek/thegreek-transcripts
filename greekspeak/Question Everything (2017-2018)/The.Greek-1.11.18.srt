1
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,080
And greetings folks, and we're live on the air again and got the Greek here.

2
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,020
Greetings.

3
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,760
And, yeah, let's just do a little another impromptu stream.

4
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,300
Right.

5
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,560
Yeah.

6
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:31,000
So, yeah, let's say anything you want to bring up right off the top of my head.

7
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,080
I was a little concerned about getting everything up proper and everything.

8
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,360
But we do have the call in lines available.

9
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,800
And I'll put that in the chat in just a bit here.

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,080
How about you?

11
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,400
Oh, always.

12
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,940
I'm always doing that.

13
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah.

14
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,060
Yeah.

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,180
As long as I'm breathing.

16
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,860
I'm doing something that I think is interesting.

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,360
So then there was a question in chat that was brought up regarding voltage, electricity and all that.

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,420
And is it simple?

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,840
We can get a little bit into that.

20
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,860
I wanted what I wanted to bring up.

21
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,720
Essentially, just the impetus is, you know, there's a lot of discussion about Scripture whenever the Greek shows up.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,900
Right.

23
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,620
And last time we did something with Sam, it was kind of good to get off the topic.

24
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,040
But I wanted to just bring up a couple of things that I think surmise things that let's say I were never to speak again.

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,780
What would you get out of it?

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,020
Right.

27
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,100
To sum up what is going on with that, with that subject?

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,860
You know what I mean?

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,100
In a nutshell, just like Wes asked in the chat.

30
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,240
Let's see.

31
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,440
The question was something like there's no specific topic yet.

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,920
I like to I really like the Greek to go a bit more into depth about the nature of electricity and voltage, more or less, more versus less voltage.

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,460
Right.

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,840
That was initially the question there.

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,020
Well, the thing is, I think I've done that with Scripture.

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,040
And I want to do a quick recap on that because it's good to talk about a lot of other things.

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,720
And if you pay attention to what I'm going to say now, you can apply it to almost anything.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:33,820
And the reason I like bringing up Scripture is because it is notably and lawfully a very high priority message, communication.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,940
Not because whether you believe in it or not or know it or not, because it is.

40
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,440
Because if you have a lawful and quote unquote legal mind, there's a prioritization on notices.

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:45,820
Right.

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,940
You know, there is such some there's a concept known as a notice.

43
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,340
Right.

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,640
And a notice could be, you know, curb your dog.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't step on the grass or something like that.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,100
Or it could be, you know, we're going to you have to vacate the property in 30 days, you know, and there's various degrees to notices.

47
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,880
And I've never seen any higher notice than that, you see.

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,300
But you have to also understand, when you bring up things from a lawful standpoint, you lose 99% of the people.

49
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,880
Well, five nines after the 99 on this planet.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,220
So there's really no one to discuss anything with when it comes to.

51
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,760
Well, I shouldn't say discuss anything with.

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:37,820
There is no audience as one would consider for things that are really based on what they're really based on, you know, like lawful in general.

53
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,400
Right.

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,640
And so the way you communicate those things is you just start communicating them publicly.

55
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,240
And eventually, from, let's say, a higher power, if it's meant for those that are meant to hear it, they kind of gather and hear it.

56
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,100
But it's not something that could be packaged and presented to the world at large, if you know what I mean.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:12,340
That's why when you look at alternative media or anything alternative, the patriot community, you know, you know, the law system is completely corrupt, and they have all these remedies, none of them work, really.

58
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:28,900
You know, you have the alternative medicine stuff, almost none of it works, you know, on and on and on, right, whatever you want to discuss, because they have no, anyway, no sense of what's lawful and unlawful.

59
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
So with that said, what do you think?

60
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,440
Should we just broach on it really quickly or no?

61
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,740
Sure.

62
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,400
I think it's a great idea.

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,800
Sure.

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Okay, let's get back on the track with what I wanted to just bring up.

65
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,860
If you were to grade that using the simplicity grade system, what is available to most people is a D minus.

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,660
It should be given an F, and I'll tell you why.

67
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:31,820
It is a D minus because it is an erroneous version of the information that's been held in the earliest copies that we have, right, which is why I suggest go to an interlinear.

68
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:45,940
Now, because erroneous versions or versions or a story that has so many errors, and it leads to bad doctrine or bad belief or paints a poor or inaccurate picture, it has to be given an F.

69
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:57,180
In other words, it fails to communicate enough information to consider it viable from the original, you see, what we have is the oldest copies, let's say.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Is that pretty easy to say?

71
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,660
Yeah, and I feel every bit of that that you just said when I first started, yes.

72
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,940
Yeah, so it's a complete failure, catastrophic in the least.

73
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
In the most, it's actually – a failure would be like a zero.

74
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:29,000
What it actually does, what you have, doesn't matter what language it is other than what's preserved in Hebrew, let's say, and Aramaic, and you might even say the Greek.

75
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:44,140
It's an utter failure, and it's actually – it has promoted most of the things that are considered forbidden or abominable or don't-dos because of such a bad doctrine.

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,460
Now, you can say that from a functional point of view.

77
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,800
The reason – as a failure, right?

78
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:06,740
But if you look at it from the D minus point of view and you actually read, let's say, the King Jimmy, King James, or everything's based on King James, even the Geneva, you have some morons out there saying, well, the King James was a corruption of the Geneva.

79
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't really see much of a difference between the two.

80
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
And here's the other thing.

81
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,780
I stopped doing it recently because I figured there's a limited group of people listening.

82
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:42,140
But whenever you hear the biblical topic being brought up, just bringing up verses or what people are familiar with as the Bible, if you don't hear a caveat that even till this date, the present day, we don't have an accurate translation of it, what you're going to be listening to is pretty much looking – a BS, a wholesale BS, and pretty much you're going to be looking for semi-edible corn and poop.

83
00:08:43,100 --> 00:09:12,060
There is no sane individual – sane meaning healthy and collective and rational on any perspective – that will venture on a quote-unquote biblical discussion to the Western world especially without first stating a caveat or a disclaimer that we're going to be discussing the biblical text, but there is no accurate translation in existence.

84
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,080
Period.

85
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,480
This is an important caveat, and caveats are given usually, disclaimers in the beginning.

86
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,540
You hear these legal morons usually.

87
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,140
They say, well, we know we're not attorneys.

88
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,240
We're not here to give legal advice, but we're going to keep going.

89
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
You hear that, disclaimers, because they don't even know what that means.

90
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:40,040
So the disclaimer, if you don't hear that disclaimer, you're pretty much going to be sold or you're going to be buying into a bill of goods that is still part of that spin cycle of crap.

91
00:09:40,500 --> 00:10:02,220
Now, the reason I'm bringing this topic up – I could say these things much simpler, but I want to give the explanation as I bring them up – is because you're going into a time period now prophetically where that's going to change, and it's going to change drastically in its eventuality of the next decade, but it's going to go unnoticed.

92
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:17,160
Here, what I mean by that, the change will be unnoticed, but if you know this is coming, in other words, what's going to change is people are going to start going away from what they've been thinking is the Bible and start having a sane approach.

93
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:26,600
Now, what I mean by that is even if you read the King James, if you're paying attention, you will see anomalies in there.

94
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,120
So this doesn't make any sense.

95
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,560
It will say, for example, my name is the Lord, and you know that's not a name.

96
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,320
So then you're going to say, well, there's something wrong here.

97
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,820
But most people don't do that, right?

98
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:49,160
And then other places you'll read what the laws are, and then actually in other places it tells you there are things happening that are contrary to the law done by people that are keeping the law.

99
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
So you're like, okay, something's wrong here.

100
00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:03,120
So it has its – you know, you can – and that will – any rational or sane person will then beg to say, well, maybe I should read the introduction of this piece of crap document, and it'll tell you exactly.

101
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,340
Just a question when you brought that up.

102
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,680
Do you think that people are going to pay more attention to bloodlines?

103
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,360
Yes, but the problem with the bloodlines is – well, it's not a problem.

104
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:26,340
That is something that is – there's a couple of verses regarding how people will be sifted like you sift grain or, you know, they'll be sorted.

105
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,400
And you know who's going to do the sorting is the gods are going to do it.

106
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,000
What you will see – this is the other thing that Evan brought up.

107
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:43,460
Ninety-nine percent of the time when countries and places are mentioned geographic, it has to do with the society in that geographic location regardless of who's living there.

108
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:52,760
So for example, let's say tomorrow you're reading the paper that everyone in Israel left, and everyone in Italy moved to Israel now, right?

109
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,100
What do you mean?

110
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,780
The prophecy still stays true because it's the land of Israel and the people that are there, right?

111
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,740
Okay.

112
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,100
See?

113
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:13,900
So for example, when you read in Exodus and other places about Egypt and all that, don't think that there were – I would say it was maybe 60 or 50 percent Egyptians.

114
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,320
The rest of the people were immigrants, right, if you took the nation as a whole.

115
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:31,020
Like even today when you hear something like Rome, later in the later periods of Rome, if you walk down, you know, anywhere in that part of the metropolis, you'd say, where are the Romans?

116
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,560
I see people, you know, we call it Shemitic descent here.

117
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,020
I see northern people.

118
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,860
I see – where are the Romans?

119
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:49,160
It's like when you go to a coastal city in America, you see Korean, Chinese, black, Latin.

120
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,880
Where are the white people at?

121
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,280
Right, right.

122
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,000
You know what I mean?

123
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,880
I mean, yeah, you still see them, but you know what I mean?

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,860
Where are the white people at?

125
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,420
Yeah.

126
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,220
So yeah.

127
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,900
So yeah, I thought America was a white country.

128
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,620
So what's going on?

129
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Or look at the American military.

130
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,300
Yeah.

131
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,660
Especially when they have a presentation of at least a few squadron or, you know, let's say battalions.

132
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,020
Where are the white people at?

133
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
I thought America was white.

134
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,960
Where are they at?

135
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,640
I see Latin, black, and everything else, every shade, but white in there.

136
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,800
I mean you still see some white people.

137
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,240
I try to bring them up, especially when they've got a flag carrier or whatever, you know, but – Right, right.

138
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,500
Okay.

139
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,800
So what I mean by when you hear about these things, you'll see the change.

140
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,380
So anyway, what you will see is this change coming, and it will be radical if you know it's coming.

141
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,100
Most people are clueless.

142
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,900
You know, they just go along.

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,100
I'll give you a quick example.

144
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,160
In the summer of 2001, I was working for a client.

145
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,820
I was doing some murals, some artwork, a mural in their home, and they happened to be – actually, if I say they're dismantled.

146
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:06,180
They come from a family that owns some of the largest copper mines in the world in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and they were busted by President Carter.

147
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,980
I'll give you an example of the background here, right?

148
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,980
And they're always watching the political scene because their fortune was busted.

149
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,600
You know, imagine the government steps in and breaks down Bill Gates into, you know, 15 different companies, and he has to move Microsoft to China and Chile or something, right?

150
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,100
Did you find that rather interesting back in the day when Bill Gates was getting his hand slapped by the government?

151
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,200
All of a sudden, that just went away?

152
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,020
Yeah, it did.

153
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:41,140
It was really the IRS because they wanted to make sure that – they wanted to teach him a lesson on the money system, and then everything was fine.

154
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,720
Right, right.

155
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,820
Because all of a sudden, that just disappeared overnight.

156
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,660
I was like, wow.

157
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,960
Because most people – and I've met people in the upper crust of society, in the elites and luminatis and all that.

158
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,000
They think there's money.

159
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,600
They don't know that there is no money yet.

160
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:03,800
So when you get past a certain point, they explain to you how it works, and then they're like, oh, OK, I'll roll with that because I know there's no loan now.

161
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,520
You feel better.

162
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,640
See, like most people think there's money.

163
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,620
If they have a big loan, they sweat it, right?

164
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,260
Oh, I've got to pay back the loan or I'm going to lose this, right?

165
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,500
But if you know there's no money, there's plenty of federal laws written in your favor if you know them.

166
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,900
He also became very helpful to the government shortly after that also.

167
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,620
Exactly, because there is no money.

168
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,860
Right, right.

169
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,400
Yeah.

170
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,960
So if you know the legal system or how it's set up about money, and no one sweat – you won't sweat a loan.

171
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Because there are plenty of laws that will tell you, hey, if anybody – the law actually says it.

172
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,700
If someone comes after you with Dunning and asks you how much – I mean that you owe something, all you've got to do is deny it and say, prove it.

173
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,460
Prove it that you lent me anything.

174
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,100
Prove it.

175
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,060
Right, yeah.

176
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:50,860
Yeah.

177
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,580
You can't.

178
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,080
Show me where it comes from.

179
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,960
Right.

180
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,140
So he got in there, and he figured out what it meant.

181
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,120
So if he needed to float several billion, he knew – it was all a dog and pony show.

182
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,940
All he had to do was put his signature on a piece of paper.

183
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,320
It runs through the several clearinghouses, and he gets the billion out of his own signature, right?

184
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,300
That's important to know when you're working in this, right?

185
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,640
I'll give you another example regarding money.

186
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,640
I was around some oil tycoons a few years ago, and it was a deal on the $40 million to $50 million.

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,420
And they wanted to – instead of using their own money, just go to a bank and use their bank's money, right?

188
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,060
Of course.

189
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,840
That's how you do it, right?

190
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,820
And I was around them in their home, and they were like, oh, a bank called me.

191
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,020
They want me to go down there and sign some checks.

192
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,980
Now, their bank is supposed to lend him money.

193
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,660
And I said, well, what do you mean it called you again?

194
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,200
He says, well, two days ago, they wanted me to go down and sign some checks.

195
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,340
And there were checks for $40 million.

196
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:54,400
So in other words, the person borrowing the money is signing the checks because then the bank takes the check and deposits it through the Fed and runs your social security number and gets it out of your social security number.

197
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,320
So I said, how many checks did you sign?

198
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,100
He says, oh, this would be like the fourth one.

199
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:05,780
I said, man, the bank just got like $120 million from you, and they're going to lend you $40 million and tell you that you owe it.

200
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,700
You got to pay it back.

201
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,579
Are you joking?

202
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,900
What's wrong with you people?

203
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,660
He didn't know how the money system worked, by the way.

204
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,859
Right.

205
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,980
He's a billionaire, too, almost.

206
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,300
So I just want to show you how – that's why very often I come out in Enchiladas is a planet full of idiots.

207
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,740
And I'm not talking about the people waiting at the bus stop.

208
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,500
I'm talking about everyone, wholesale.

209
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:36,560
But anyway, I was doing some mural work for this guy, and I was noticing there was a subtle – going back to what was going on in 2001 in the summer.

210
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:48,640
And I noticed that the news for about – the television show they call the news and the radio, they kept bringing up this name, Osama bin Laden, from spring and the summer, subtly bringing it back and forth.

211
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:56,540
There was a bomb – there was a hull blown out of a ship near Yemen a few years before, a couple of years before, and they put it on him.

212
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,900
And the name kept coming up.

213
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,260
And I was having a discussion with a client over a break, and I think we were just socializing really at that point.

214
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,720
And I said, you know, you've got to – this is like June, July of 2001.

215
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,740
And I'm like, you know, this Osama bin Laden character is going to be used in the news.

216
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,600
I mean he's in the news, and they're going to – something is going to happen, and they're going to pin it on him.

217
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Oh, no, that won't happen.

218
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,360
Our biggest problem is China, blah, blah, blah, blah.

219
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,760
Right?

220
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,380
OK.

221
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,880
Do you see how subtle a statement is?

222
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:39,480
And it's just like – and actually I did confront him after, around October, and I mentioned that he was just totally silent.

223
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:52,400
He was like – so anyway, also I was around someone who said, well, 9-11 is next month, you know, 9-11, get it, September 11th, emergency month.

224
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,120
And I had another person before that once say to me, how's your credit score, Greek?

225
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,460
And I said, what is that?

226
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,900
What do you mean?

227
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,600
What credit score?

228
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,320
What are you talking about?

229
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,620
He says, well, you make sure you get credit score is really good because there's going to be a lot of security jobs coming up in the future.

230
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,200
And if you've got a really good credit score, you'll get a really good high-ranking position in any kind of private security.

231
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,620
I'm like, what?

232
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,960
What are you talking about security industry?

233
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,580
What security industry?

234
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,090
Right?

235
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,290
You see what I'm saying?

236
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,330
So anyway, you see it.

237
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,370
Are you paying attention in other words, right?

238
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,110
Enough.

239
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,410
How much attention are you going to pay?

240
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,470
It's really simple when someone just tells you what's going on that you can see rationally as well.

241
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,470
So again, very simply with the scripture, you're in that time period.

242
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:57,570
The other thing about scripture is I want to talk about is the poor doctrine that is – what is – you know, the Christianity, Judaism, Islam even, because they're descendants of Abraham and they attach – and by the way, if you read the Koran, there's not like one consistent story in there.

243
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:09,170
I mean it – well, one day in – let's see, maybe I promise in a couple of years if I'm still around maybe or somehow get out information on who wrote the Koran, why it was written and all that other crap, right?

244
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:29,070
So what I want to get into though is because the poor doctrine, the bad doctrine has been cemented with bricks and mortar fixtures like churches and universities, Bible colleges, lots of – you go to a hotel and you see a Bible in there and it's in the television.

245
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,870
It's in the movies.

246
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,330
It's been used as something good or – right?

247
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:42,190
What has happened is you have a really bad idea, which is a bad concept, the version itself, and it has manifested physically now.

248
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:43,870
You know what I mean?

249
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,530
So it has manifested physically in the world.

250
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,950
So now you have two things to overcome.

251
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,230
This is again with any bad idea.

252
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,090
We can discuss the medical system is exactly the same.

253
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,270
You know the magic cuff.

254
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,770
Originally, blood pressure was a concept.

255
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:15,350
If you look at it in the 20s and 30s, some academics were arguing about what that pulse, how it should be measured, and they eventually made it a vital sign, which it can't be, right?

256
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,210
And they built lots of equipment and there are buildings built around that concept.

257
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:32,550
So you have really bad concepts that have taken foot in society and they have cemented it with brick and mortar and fixtures and real things.

258
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,590
You could touch, right?

259
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,430
Right.

260
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:47,410
So that's why people can't see and get over it even though they understand there's censorship and they understand that there's a spiritual intangible side that's preventing them from seeing things.

261
00:21:48,350 --> 00:22:03,870
So if you could see all that stuff through all that stuff, now you could transfer what I just said regarding the really, really bad biblical concepts through the medical industry, through the nutrition, through the financial.

262
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,590
Government itself is not operating as it should be lawfully.

263
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,190
None of them are, by the way.

264
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,830
They have the medical industry, religious industry, and the government, the legal society, whatever.

265
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,850
They have the appearance, the food industry has the appearance of being lawful, but they're not.

266
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,810
And it's very difficult to find anything that they're doing that is lawful in anything that you're going to interact with.

267
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,250
So that was the first point.

268
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,610
Well, the world society is like that, for God's sake, Sean.

269
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,690
Right.

270
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:49,050
And what it is, it's a testament to the robustness of the human condition, meaning your ability to sleep, eat, and avoid catastrophic violence.

271
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:57,810
Well, these days you're lucky if you can make it through the year without some kind of weird manifestation coming at you.

272
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,050
Even if you're eating lawfully, that usually doesn't happen.

273
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,230
And that's another thing I found interesting.

274
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,530
The priest and what they wore, what they ate.

275
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:25,750
Do you think this, when it was with the Ark, do you think this was a lot to do with the behaviors, with the inductance of the person, the foods he ate, the specific garments?

276
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:36,150
It's like if the Ark knew that you weren't pure or following the law.

277
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,810
Yeah, the Ark, the presence of the Ark was symbolic.

278
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,030
Well, it was a symbolic replica of something that was somewhere else.

279
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,290
There was actually an angelic being that was a body double of that particular God.

280
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,470
Oh, okay.

281
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,610
That came, yeah.

282
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,010
You remember how Saddam Hussein had a body double and all this?

283
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,790
Right, right.

284
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,270
Well, the Creator has a body double.

285
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,870
So it knew that you weren't pure.

286
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,390
Of course.

287
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,650
That's what I wanted to bring up.

288
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:17,850
There's a lot of transmutation in scripture, and one of them is when you touch a dead animal, you're unclean until noon, right?

289
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:25,850
Well, if you eat animal product or flesh, actually milk wouldn't be that, because milk is not…

290
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,250
You wouldn't be unclean.

291
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:37,550
Right, you would be unclean, but while it's still in your gut, you can wash before noon, and then after noon you're declared clean, but it's still in your gut.

292
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,010
It's still in your gut, yeah.

293
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,070
But now you're clean, you see, after washing.

294
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:43,550
Technically.

295
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,690
Technically you're clean, yeah.

296
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,710
So that meat now is clean, even though it's in your body.

297
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,590
You're declared clean.

298
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,590
Oh, okay, okay.

299
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,830
That's what miracles are, it's a form of changing things.

300
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:11,050
If you look at the root word meanings of the word miracle, look at where it's used, and go look in an interlinear and get a grip on what that means, and it's not what you've been told.

301
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,050
Interesting.

302
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,830
Just like the word forgiveness.

303
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,590
The word forgiveness means to get away from it.

304
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:21,390
Right.

305
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,150
It doesn't mean, oh, it's okay if you punch me in the nose, no.

306
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,670
If someone punches you in the nose, forgive them, which means get away from it.

307
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,230
Yeah.

308
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,090
So it doesn't happen again, basically.

309
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,150
Right.

310
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:51,190
Another thing I want to throw in there, I had a discussion recently regarding the law and Christianity, and that's a very short thing I can give, because it could be a very long discussion, it could be a five to eight hour discussion, really, if you're going to start bringing up the 12 beef patty special sauce, you know, each specific verse, right?

311
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,170
You know, no one talks like that, by the way.

312
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,990
I have a disdain and a hate for, you know, show me the verse while you're speaking.

313
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,550
You know, that's why I hate it.

314
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,230
It's because people that do hateful things do it, first of all.

315
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,990
Second of all, no one speaks that way if you're watching a movie.

316
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,590
Do you remember what happened at one hour 36 minutes and 24 seconds?

317
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,070
Do you remember?

318
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,790
What?

319
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,830
You know, or do you remember the scene where he jumps off the building and he flies over to the next building?

320
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,030
Well, give me the time on that.

321
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,610
What do you mean?

322
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,690
It was at one hour 36 minutes and 24 seconds.

323
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,410
No one speaks out, but they've done it with that because these are disturbed people.

324
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,090
But regarding the law, most of the people, just to throw this together, use the writings of Paul.

325
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:51,750
Now, Paul was – if you look at the writings of Paul, he cites the law over 100 times, you know, issues of the law that are to be followed and considered, you know, as holy writ and to live properly and to be, quote-unquote, set apart.

326
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,790
And to be in good graces with the Creator.

327
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:07,890
But in other places, there seems to be like a little bit of the – I would say like a falling away kind of sentiment when he discusses the law.

328
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,950
So how can he cite it in a positive way over 100 times, maybe 150 or 200 times?

329
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,130
Really, I'm saying 100 because it's easy to find that.

330
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,770
And then in other parts, be so almost disdainful of it, right?

331
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,810
So it can't be the same law.

332
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:39,490
What he's really discussing – and I don't like to discuss Paul because it's on a PhD level, and I believe that most of the people at this point that are hearing my voice are on the first or second grade when it comes to scriptural studies.

333
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,990
But what I'm going to state is this.

334
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:58,190
If you consider the historic relevancy of the time period and the condition of humanity at that point, there was something called the oral law held by the de facto priestly class, which were the Pharisees and the Sadducees.

335
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:08,330
Pharisees were basically supposed to sit in for the Levites, and the Sadducees were basically supposed to sit in with the Pharisees, but they represented the elite class.

336
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:09,850
Right?

337
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,490
So they were in the pockets of the elite and the Romans and whoever else conquered, right?

338
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,970
OK.

339
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,810
So they had an oral law.

340
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,170
Now it's known as Talmudic law.

341
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,210
And what they had done is they were using it on the people harshly.

342
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,310
Right?

343
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,890
You get it?

344
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,370
Right.

345
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,450
So most Christians, you'd like to use that.

346
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,170
Now, the Paul saying they don't understand that condition.

347
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:55,310
Now, the other condition is when Christ had proven that what happens after death with the resurrection, it was a world-changing, there were a lot of interesting things going on through his whole life period that no one could explain, other than there was some interesting individual saying and doing some very interesting things.

348
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:05,530
And there were many people who didn't know what was going on and were not interested in quote-unquote scripture until those events were transpiring.

349
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,350
And the people that were knowledgeable of this were saying, well, who is this guy?

350
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,810
He says, well, look, you could read about him in the scripture, the Psalms, the prophets and all that.

351
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,510
He's prophesied.

352
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:25,930
But let me ask you, could you find him anywhere in the oral law that the Sadducees and the Pharisees had?

353
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,530
Nope.

354
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,700
There's nothing to read there.

355
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,820
There's nothing to study because it's just an oral law that they tell people what to do.

356
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:33,860
Right?

357
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,880
You get the difference?

358
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:47,940
So what they call the early Christians were essentially not Christians at all because they never called themselves that ever.

359
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,580
It was a derogatory term.

360
00:29:49,900 --> 00:30:02,360
And it was a derogatory term that is difficult to explain because it's beyond any derogation or pejorative that we can conceive of today, if that makes any sense.

361
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,960
So do you want me to give an example of that?

362
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,750
Yes.

363
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,150
Anyway.

364
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,630
Oh, OK.

365
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,110
You know, like, you know, like the Sodomites, they call them faggots.

366
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,410
And if you call a Sodomite a faggot, you'll say that's derogatory.

367
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,430
That's not politically correct.

368
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,590
But, you know, Sodomites call themselves faggots, too, in joking or whatever.

369
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,970
Black people, you know, nigger is a derogatory term, but black people call themselves niggers, too.

370
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:41,650
But, you see, the term Christian was so derogatory that it could never be used in jest, in joking around.

371
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,910
There is no derogatory term that exists today that could actually show the magnitude of what that really meant.

372
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,310
All right?

373
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,350
Yeah.

374
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,510
That's really, this is what people don't understand today.

375
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:05,810
Now, at that time, the people that they were calling Christians, which basically came from the Pharisees and the Sadducees, which means Messianite or a zealot, means you're politically dangerous.

376
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:13,690
You want to make trouble and you're going to get everybody killed because, you know, when the Romans sniffed out if there was going to be a rebellion, they just killed everyone.

377
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,030
Right?

378
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,170
That's what they did.

379
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:24,750
So anyway, not always, but that was the typical story behind not – they didn't root out a rebellion.

380
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:31,750
The Romans basically said, well, you better – if you don't – they go to the authorities and said, if you don't take care of it, you're all finished.

381
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,350
You're done.

382
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,430
We'll take 10 percent.

383
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,770
We'll take one out of 10 people.

384
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,490
And then if you don't take care of it, then we'll take another one out of 10 people just randomly.

385
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,290
Right?

386
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,490
So anyway, so what was going on?

387
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:56,550
There was a movement that people were interested in what was going on, and they knew that this was all written about in the scripture, which the Sadducees and the Pharisees frowned upon because they had their oral law.

388
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:07,050
So what happened then was these people took an interest in the scripture, and they were stating that we should keep these laws as they were written from Moses.

389
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,230
You see?

390
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,010
Right.

391
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,670
Where the sentiment during the day – even today, this is still going on today.

392
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:25,270
If you speak to anyone who is religious or non-religious, that is, quote-unquote, Jewish, they – when you say you study or keep the law, they don't know what you're talking about.

393
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,260
They think you're talking about oral tradition, Talmudic, Rabbinic law.

394
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,480
They don't know that you're talking about what's in the Torah.

395
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:38,830
Right?

396
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:39,650
OK.

397
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,330
It sounds bizarre, doesn't it?

398
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:41,670
Yep.

399
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,790
It sounds really bizarre.

400
00:32:45,070 --> 00:33:01,470
It's a really – so these people who had discovered who the Christ was and wanted to study the written word and the law to find out more about him and had proof through good testimony that he was resurrected were the enemies of the authorities.

401
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,670
And those were the ones that were thrown to the lions and all that.

402
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,010
Right.

403
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:14,670
At the same time that this was going on, just like the 9-11 thing, you have all these different theories out there and conspiracy groups.

404
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:23,050
Like right now, I think like the one conspiracy group has taken hold on most people's consciousness with the nanothermite.

405
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,790
Right.

406
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:33,830
Well, the one that – while all this was going on, there was several groups in different parts of the world, of course, and eventually they were agglomerated in different ways.

407
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:50,230
It's almost like leaderless, but they were supported by the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the Samaritans, who are not good, by the way, but they're called good, and Simon Magus and all these others to create all these stories.

408
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,830
Gnosticism came out of that.

409
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:58,210
Gnostics would be like the nanothermite or the space energy weapons that took down – just total crap.

410
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:04,130
But it sounds plausible because you're so ignorant, you need to grab something to satisfy that vacuum of knowledge.

411
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:12,310
So the people that were called the early Christians in a derogatory term – remember, they never called themselves that.

412
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,630
They ceased to exist by the 2nd century AD.

413
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,790
They were probably all killed off or went underground or ceased to be vocal about it.

414
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:30,469
So what took hold after that is what you have is basically a conspiracy theory that exists now.

415
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:39,710
That's why you have Santa Claus in church and the pope and Easter bunnies and hell and you're going to go to hell or heaven or all this stuff that's just erroneous pagan crap.

416
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:51,770
So what I did right there was I gave you a history to current date of what is going on with that thing you call the Bible, which is essentially an off-the-shelf doorstop.

417
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,250
And you threw in some lineage there, which was very helpful.

418
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:08,750
Yeah, I threw it in pretty quick, but if anyone wants to go and re-listen to what I just said, you'll get a pretty good grip on what's going on, but you really won't.

419
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:22,970
In essence, until you meditate and do a little more historical studying because when I mentioned calling someone a Christian was such a deep insult and pejorative term that there are none these days that exist like that.

420
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,830
So yeah, it just shows you how insane everything is.

421
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:38,690
There's a little bit of talk recently I brought up in a lot of Shemitic languages actually.

422
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,370
If you remove a letter from a name, it means a big deal.

423
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,270
It changes the name, right?

424
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:56,210
So in that concept, that was done to change many things and it changes it more drastically for a translator as well.

425
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:13,530
If you remove a letter from a Hebrew word, it changes the meaning of the word, and a translator will no longer see it as a word obviously meaning this with a letter removed, but he'll see it as, oh, this is obviously this word, which is not original.

426
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,710
It gets pretty deep when you start taking letters out of Hebrew.

427
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,010
Or even just one or two letters.

428
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,430
It'll change the entire meaning.

429
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:33,950
So someone viewing the text from an objective point of view that wants to create a quote unquote translation or attempt one will easily carry over the new meaning because of the missing letter.

430
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,370
In English, it doesn't work that easily.

431
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,650
You can remove a letter from a word in English and you're like, oh man, I should have run spell check.

432
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,970
You know that it's just spelled wrong.

433
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,210
You know there's something missing, right?

434
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,270
So that was just an interesting concept I wanted to bring up.

435
00:36:52,410 --> 00:37:03,850
So in regard to the biblical stuff and the scriptural stuff, where you are today is where I just brought everyone up to speed on what's going on and where you're at.

436
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:27,270
And the other thing I wanted to bring up, which is quite fantastic, which is really the fantasticness of any subject when you find out what really is going on simply by objectifying it, is you will see that the subject matter in scripture is regarding the society of the gods.

437
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,910
So that is the fantasticness of the whole thing.

438
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,070
Forget about your superheroes and your fiction fantasy stuff.

439
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,530
This is way, way beyond anything.

440
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:50,150
I always used to say that if anyone wanted to produce an accurate biblical movie on one aspect of the Bible, of course not the whole thing like Noah's Ark or something, Genesis or whatever, right?

441
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,290
Even the Christ, whatever.

442
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,430
No one would understand or recognize anything in there.

443
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,410
That's how deviated it is, right?

444
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,530
So what I'm saying now is based on not only the biblical text.

445
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:14,350
It has nothing to do with whether you believe it or not, because it has to do with historical texts as well.

446
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:21,090
And just to go back to a movie, a film of any biblical situation, no one would recognize it.

447
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:27,070
Let's say you created, there are plenty of sci-fi films out there that are fantasy, right?

448
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,390
Reading the script sounds plausible, you do the movie and it's plausible to watch.

449
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:39,050
But I'm telling you, anything biblical done that way would not be plausible because of all the bullshit that people have been told.

450
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,030
You could not say that it's biblical.

451
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,410
You'd have to name it something else.

452
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,950
And you could probably keep the original names and no one would recognize them anyway.

453
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,770
Right?

454
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,510
So this is how far removed you are and this is a story about the gods, the most powerful beings in the universe.

455
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,890
And let me just say it in a wholesale way, no one knows what's going on.

456
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,950
Yes, there are people that know what's going on.

457
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:14,270
But in a wholesale way, if you were to have a map of the galaxy and, for example, put a pin on where no one knows what's going on about the gods, you would easily put a pin on the earth and say, yeah, these people don't know anything about the gods.

458
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,070
Wholesale.

459
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,370
There might be a few down there.

460
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,510
I feel sorry for them if they do.

461
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,210
You see what I mean?

462
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:20,810
Right.

463
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,550
So this is a situation that you're in right now.

464
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,550
But it's going to change and it's going to be quite interesting.

465
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,150
And the same thing holds true for the medical industry.

466
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:40,210
If you're out in the galaxy, say, put a pin on all these planets, where these people live, let's say, where they don't know anything about how their own bodies work, put it on the earth.

467
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,810
These people don't know how their bodies work.

468
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,290
No.

469
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,290
Hmm.

470
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,950
Now you're going to have some inkling I brought up the Taoist medicine and the qi and all that.

471
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,530
Yeah, they do.

472
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,690
They do.

473
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:59,150
But currently, as it is right now, the younger people, everything's becoming centralized, Americanized, Westernized.

474
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,290
Yeah.

475
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,550
I'm not hearkening back to being a romantic fool about days of old because they weren't much better back then either.

476
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,770
Because if they were so much…

477
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,650
You know how they say, well, our great-grandparents were wiser and smarter in the good old days.

478
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,690
Well, if they were so good, how did you end up in the shit right now?

479
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,690
If they were so good?

480
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,290
Yeah.

481
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,990
Stop making excuses.

482
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,670
Stop being a hopeless romantic.

483
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,430
So, that's pretty much it there.

484
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,230
I'll just take a breather.

485
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,010
Anything going on?

486
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,230
Let's see in chat.

487
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,290
Let me walk over here.

488
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,510
Have a seat.

489
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,710
Put on some cheaters.

490
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,730
Get over a few years, more than half a century.

491
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,790
No matter how proud you are of your eyesight, you're going to need some kind of assistance, I think.

492
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,790
Well, they threw me into the deep end of the pool.

493
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,310
They're Greek.

494
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,210
I am a trifocals now.

495
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:50,790
Oh.

496
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:57,310
When I work on small things, I work on, let's say, like spark plug development, right?

497
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,130
And it's really like jewelry equipment.

498
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,890
You don't use heavy…

499
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,530
Well, you know, it's working with metal and automobile stuff, but everything is under two and a half or three millimeters.

500
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,030
Right.

501
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,190
Two and a half a millimeter with metal.

502
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:19,310
And it's going to be subjected to very high temperatures and high voltage, which likes to eat away at things when it's not done properly.

503
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,570
So, I don't see much there.

504
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:24,750
Oh.

505
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,370
Yeah.

506
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:27,830
Oh, yeah.

507
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,750
Spellcasting.

508
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,310
Yeah, the number of chapter verse thing.

509
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:30,550
Okay.

510
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,110
Naming of chapter verse thing is also a form of spellcasting, I think you said before, Greek.

511
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,230
Directly, no, but it does use that format.

512
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:53,690
You know, like a lot of chants and songs that people think are original are actually, you know, forms of keys and chords that have carried through humanity for a long time, and some of them could have been used for that.

513
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,330
You know, like I've used various name issues.

514
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,530
Like, you know, you've heard of people calling, using the name Jehovah or Yehovah.

515
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,470
Yeah.

516
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:17,660
You know, Yehovah means in Hebrew, by the way, I'm going to just use this loosely because there's a more accurate way to define this, but generally it means to bring distress or bring mischief or to bring calamity.

517
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,580
Oh, my.

518
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,520
That's why the Jehovah's Witnesses, right, are in the, you know, so anyway.

519
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,380
Oh, my.

520
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,420
It puts a whole different spin on them.

521
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,340
Oh, yeah.

522
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,480
And Yeshu means his name will be blotted out.

524
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,980
Right, I remember that.

525
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,540
And that's actually part of a whole verse.

526
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,880
There's a couple of other words, vizikar, you know, which means out of memory.

527
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,200
But, so anyway, yeah, it's interesting.

528
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,560
What it shows is the robust efficiency of the ancient language and how specific you have to be with it.

529
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,540
Yeah, the spell casting thing is interesting.

530
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:09,160
You know the analogy I give about a trap, which is the best way to avoid a trap is knowledge of its existence, right?

531
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:09,920
Right.

532
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,300
And spells are very similar.

533
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,520
In other words, if you don't know there's a spell, it's probably going to be more effective.

534
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,240
And I'll tell you, it is.

535
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,020
I mean, just look at the name Jehovah or Jehovah that they're using, right?

536
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:32,140
And it's really hard to separate it from that part of the world around that time, so it ties back in there.

537
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,880
Yeah, humans are a strange bunch.

538
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,520
They always have been, but they won't always be.

539
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,780
That's a good thing to know.

540
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,440
So, I don't know, should we get into electricity or anything like that?

541
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,360
Back into your capable hands.

542
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:58,440
Well, the interesting thing about that is, believe it or not, there's a bunch of interesting stuff.

543
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,240
I shouldn't say a bunch, not much.

544
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,240
If you could find it on Tesla.

545
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,900
I can't approve anything, right?

546
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,600
Because remember, you're still eating corn out of poop, right?

547
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,440
So I can't say, go check this.

548
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,900
Right.

549
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,200
But who is it, Jerry Vasilatos, I dropped the link in once.

550
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:29,760
He did a lot of research on Tesla's stuff while it was still in the library in New York, before they put it all in storage or destroyed it, right?

551
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,540
Right, and government confiscations.

552
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,920
If you could get past the narrow-mindedness and partial schizophrenia of Eric Dollard, he's good to listen to.

553
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,120
He's an interesting fellow.

554
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,620
He's out in your parts of the woods, yeah.

555
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,300
Actually, Northwest.

556
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,120
Yes.

557
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,080
Yeah, I'm not going to say anything about it.

558
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,140
He did have some interesting prospects on many things.

559
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,680
Yes, if you know how to pick it out of poop.

560
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,100
He had done a fascinating subject on a circus that he went to, an old one.

561
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:16,660
They had a couple of pipe organs in it, and he was talking about, I guess, the aviants.

562
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,440
How it really moved you around inside.

563
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,900
It was very acoustically sound, let's say.

564
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,640
Old choral music, Bach.

565
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,780
He's a big proponent of Bach.

566
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
I've always been a big proponent of Bach.

567
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,440
I remember meeting, when I got into metals and stuff like that, a guy says, it helps to play Bach.

568
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,220
I'm like, why?

569
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,360
It helps transmutation.

570
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,500
Then I heard Eric Dollard say the same thing.

571
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,980
It's polyphonic.

572
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,720
I was like, okay.

573
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:58,080
The tuning of the organs and everything, and how they were very accurate in their placements, and how the sound diffused through the building.

574
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,160
It was quite interesting.

575
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,140
The most impactful part of the sound, just like the light, is the part that you don't see.

576
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,120
They say UV rays and light are destructive.

577
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
Infrared is thermal.

578
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,020
You don't really perceive that as much as you do the visible light.

579
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,960
The same with sound.

580
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:29,620
There are the various chords and various notes in the sound that, when they're isolated where they peak, deliver the quality.

581
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,500
I, being a musician, I can really relate to that.

582
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,480
There's music out there that just will move you.

583
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Then there's some that actually appall me.

584
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,260
Yeah, like the ones that move you, you'll see that they have peaks in A, right?

585
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,840
A sharp.

586
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:57,360
They'll have soft, I shouldn't say soft peaks, but there'll be a preponderance of that.

587
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,780
The minor chords, yes.

588
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah, when they're in there.

589
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,920
You don't really know they're there.

590
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,520
Once you find out that they're having an effect, you have to seek them out.

591
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,560
You're like, oh wow, what does this have in common?

592
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,820
But no one will say, there's a lot of A sharp in that.

593
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,400
Very rarely, unless you're tuning an instrument.

594
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,360
So, I would suggest that that's a really big topic.

595
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,660
But I don't like giving the analogy of electricity to water, because they're very two distinct things, right?

596
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,700
It's like saying, let's talk about birds, so I'm going to give an analogy with a cow.

597
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,180
It doesn't work too well.

598
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,560
But they both have to eat, and they're both vegetarian predominantly, most of them.

599
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,000
But then it falls apart.

600
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:57,200
But essentially, you cannot find, and this is a difficult statement for people to hear, but it's true if you research it long enough.

601
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,260
Any time in history where there was a lack of knowledge of what we call electricity today.

602
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:12,620
You know, this force unseen that manifests through lightning, that manifests through shocks, that manifests through magnetism and all that.

603
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,020
That's always existed, right?

604
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,680
Through man's vernacular, man knowing of it.

605
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:28,780
And it didn't come until certain societies and people that we're aware of, were able to do experiments and memorialize them and then hand them down.

606
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,680
Like Volta, Galvani, Newton, and all these other people.

607
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,580
But there were people in every society that experimented with it.

608
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,040
The Greeks had a pretty good handle on electrostatics, right?

609
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:55,940
So they would actually, you know, if you rubbed glass with sheep's wool, a large enough piece of glass and enough sheep's wool, and you had enough slaves dragging that thing, you could send a spark across the room and zap someone, right?

610
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:56,680
Yeah.

611
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,100
So they would use that and do things.

612
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,720
There's some interesting writings.

613
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,100
Too bad a lot of the stuff that I've discovered is not on the rectangle.

614
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,880
And years ago, I just passed it off.

615
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,700
I figured, oh, great.

616
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,120
You know, I'll find it on the internet.

617
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,060
And I'm looking and looking, and it's not on the internet.

618
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,960
I'm like, oh, okay.

619
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,100
We'll get there eventually.

620
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,520
I think I recently put up something about the mechanisms of the ancient Greeks.

621
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,240
They were fascinated with machines, that steam-powered, water-powered, electrostatic-powered machines.

622
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:38,120
I think I put something in the chat about how the early churches were using robots.

623
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,460
Yes.

624
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,400
They were animated.

625
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,180
Yes, like a wooden figurine that would be animated, and people would be amazed.

626
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,560
We know a bird, you'd put a coin in a machine, and the wings would move.

627
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,800
It was always about money, of course, and getting the people's attention.

628
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:06,920
And the reason there was a pull-it-back-to-the-circus, or the churches, the early churches, they were funded because if you got – see, people were always very leery of the political part of their society.

629
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:15,860
But if you got them to wholeheartedly give their allegiance and trust to the church, then the political side comes from the back door and controls them through the church, right?

630
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,580
Or just today.

631
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:18,940
Same thing.

632
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,040
Just like I say, if you go – you want to meet dumb people?

633
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,480
Wait every four years when they do an election, or every two years.

634
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,420
It depends on where you are.

635
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,640
And everyone, yes, if you ask them, where are you going?

636
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,420
Say, I'm going to go vote.

637
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,460
That's a real dumb person right there.

638
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,720
They might sound smart.

639
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:42,420
They might be a doctor, a lawyer, a judge, or even a college professor, but I could show you 15 different ways in five minutes how stupid they are.

640
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,080
And how ignorant they are, I should say.

641
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,140
In general, about the entire workings of society.

642
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:57,720
They might have a narrow specialized field, like a shoemaker or whatever, but they don't know what's going on within the society that they live in.

643
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,980
And I'll tell you that ants won't know more about their society than humans do.

644
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,920
I'll say it again.

645
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,160
Ants, you know, the little endemic creatures, know more about their society than humans do.

646
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,580
So, I mean, the society that you live in.

647
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,640
So, you know, I mean, look.

648
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,660
How many people say, I'm going to the bank?

649
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,200
You know, like their bank, that's really a bank.

650
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,320
You sure that's a bank?

651
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:23,660
Right.

652
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,260
I'm going to church.

653
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,720
Are you sure you know what that is?

654
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,860
Are you sure it's what you think it is?

655
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:32,900
I'm going to the doctor.

656
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,040
Are you sure you know what he is?

657
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,040
What he's doing?

658
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,620
Are you sure about that?

659
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,100
I'm going to the supermarket to get food.

660
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,740
Are you sure they have food there?

661
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,080
Are you sure that's edible?

662
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,820
Just because you can open your mouth, stick it in there and chew and swallow, doesn't mean you should be doing that.

663
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,220
So, anyway, yeah, this goes across the entire board.

664
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,120
Yeah.

665
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,200
So, have fun.

666
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,000
What else is there to do?

667
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,220
Enjoy yourself.

668
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,320
Responsibly, of course.

669
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,280
You know, like the old liquor ads say on TV, drink responsibly.

670
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,620
It might indirectly tie into the concept of hell, which is going to a bad place.

671
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,020
Forget about the hellfire and the demons poking you and all this stuff, right?

672
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,100
Hell is supposed to be a place of discontent.

673
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,560
You're in it, but you don't realize it, in a sense.

674
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:36,160
And if you actually look at the translation in there, it means the grave, simply.

675
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,460
You know, there are several other words.

676
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,420
You have Sheol, Guana, and they have a generic term for that.

677
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,860
So, it will only get better from here.

678
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:50,220
And I don't mean within this society either.

679
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,980
So, that's the best part of it.

680
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,150
So, we've got mystic and all that other stuff.

681
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,830
Man, that's really kind of big.

682
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,150
It would be interesting to do it.

683
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,930
I think I have discussed it in the past loosely.

684
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:19,250
And just for Wes out there who's listening, I know we're discussing spark plugs and things like that, and he's fascinated to see what playing around with, let's say, the gap in a spark plug does in engine performance.

685
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,930
But essentially, just for that, you have two things going on.

686
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,310
You have a current there, and how do I know there's a current?

687
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,390
And there's a voltage there, and how do I know there's a voltage?

688
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:35,710
Well, the voltage seems to be more obvious because that's what's discussed with the coil discharging the spark, high voltage.

689
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,450
But the current is actually the part that degrades the material.

690
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:44,790
You know, it smashes the electrons to bits after a while and creates all that internal heat.

691
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:54,790
When you have a vaporized fuel, let's say, mixed with air, it's not the voltage that ignites it.

692
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:01,210
It's the current, the part that's more destructive, the part that's ready to just, you know, affect change in material.

693
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:08,530
So widening the gap to increase the voltage also increases the current because the gap is bigger.

694
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,010
You need more current to jump to associate with the voltage, right?

695
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:21,130
So the optimum condition would be a shorter gap where the current is lower and more robust.

696
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:29,890
But also you want a bigger gap for higher voltage because the voltage does not ignite the mixture.

697
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,290
But what does it do for the mixture?

698
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,850
It charges the mixture, right?

699
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,410
You know, like you charge a capacitor with voltage, right?

700
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,350
Let's say, and current.

701
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,650
So there's one side of the spark is voltage.

702
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,670
The other part is current.

703
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,570
The current ignites and the voltage charges.

704
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,670
So there you go.

705
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:54,530
So you'll have a faster ignition with a smaller gap but less of a charged mixture.

706
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:06,270
If you go with a bigger voltage, you'll have more of a charge in the mixture, but then the ignition becomes iffy or not as consistent.

707
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:15,030
So actually, I personally here, I've figured out a way to overcome both of those about 75% of the way.

708
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,830
In the industry, it's not even 5%.

709
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,550
So, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,070
It's just you got to look at it objectively.

711
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:33,850
Look, it's not difficult to go into an emergency room, ICU, intensive care unit, and have about a third of the people go home the next day.

712
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:40,500
I'm not talking about a regular hospital room now if you know how the human body works.

713
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,600
I'm talking about ICU.

714
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:47,600
When you're in ICU, they usually stick you after a week or a few days in there, they put you in a hospital bed for a month to six months.

715
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,380
Where because of health care, they usually kick you out the door within about a day or two now.

716
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,480
And you heal at home.

717
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,540
But your time of healing is still the same either way.

718
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,300
But it's the opposite.

719
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,260
It's not because...

720
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,800
They're a bank, the hospital.

721
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:22,600
I always tell people, if you go to the bank, anything you sign or whatever, you want to speak to someone in the administration, and you would like a cash receipt for the document you just signed.

722
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:29,300
Because if you talk to the idiot that deals with the public, I want to speak to someone in administration.

723
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,560
And you wait, they could produce that moron in five minutes or five hours, I don't know.

724
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,100
And you have this long form or short form, anything that says...

725
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,440
I have copies here, I signed this, this and that for you guys.

726
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,160
I'd like a cash receipt.

727
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,280
Do you know what I mean by that?

728
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,860
These documents that I signed have a cash value.

729
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:59,980
And when I say cash value, I'm talking with five to six to seven zeros behind each one.

730
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,520
Per person.

731
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,460
These guys...

733
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,760
Don't believe what I just said.

734
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:13,300
Go look up, if you know a hospital, look up the stats on Manto or any of these business sites, how much they earn a year.

735
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,600
Even in a small city, a billion a year.

736
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,360
A small hospital.

737
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:28,060
A big hospital in New York can do 15, 20 billion a year earnings.

738
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,160
Billy with a B, right?

739
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,200
Wow.

740
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:31,900
Yeah, look it up.

741
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,880
You'll be surprised.

742
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,400
Where do they get all that?

743
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,760
Credit card swipes, insurance?

744
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,260
Nah.

745
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,520
That too, that's double dipping.

746
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,060
All that stuff goes offshore and is used for money laundering.

747
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,460
Money laundering.

748
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,660
Find out who owns these hospitals.

749
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,840
You'll be surprised.

750
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm not going to say that because it varies, but it has nothing to do with medicine.

751
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,020
It has to do with finance.

752
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,860
Here's another thing, concept, guys.

753
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:07,140
If you have a general, a military general or admiral in your neighborhood, meaning in the country, they usually have a Wikipedia page or some history of this guy.

754
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,560
They're weaponized, you know what?

755
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,460
Look at their history of all these generals and admirals and all that and look at their schooling.

756
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,340
What do they all major in pretty much?

757
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,820
They go to a military school, of course, but what did they major in, almost all of them?

758
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,560
What do they have degrees in?

759
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,820
Yes, economics, finance.

760
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,280
That's right.

761
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,400
Why?

762
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,580
Because it's about money and there is no money.

763
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:46,580
It's about how they're going to convince people to know if you want to know.

764
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,840
Actually not.

765
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,680
Most people say they want to know when they find out if they don't like what they're hearing, it's no good.

766
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:58,100
I used to do radio with others and I had one guy always tell me, I don't agree with that or I agree with that.

767
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,640
And I was like, you agree with that?

768
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

769
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,040
I hear that a lot.

770
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,700
So let me just interpret what you just said.

771
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,500
You agree with me.

772
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:16,940
If you didn't agree with what I said, because you agree with what I'm saying, it makes it true.

773
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,940
This is how people roll in the world.

774
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,300
Oh, I don't like that.

775
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,200
I don't agree with him.

776
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:21,720
Why?

777
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,260
Well, I don't like the way he parts his hair.

778
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,820
So what he says can't be true.

779
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,200
It's a standard.

780
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:30,940
God.

781
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,600
I hear that all the time on the Rectangle.

782
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,260
If I catch an interview or someone sends me a link on something, I hear the idiot host and the moron guest.

783
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,520
Oh, I agree with you.

784
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:50,460
At least I would give the host the benefit of the doubt until he said I agree with the stupidity that the guy was saying.

785
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,800
I said, oh, no, you're both morons.

786
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,900
Click, all right, off.

787
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:01,260
It's just, you know, and it sounds short-tempered like in a way that I wouldn't.

788
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,600
Maybe there's some corn in there.

789
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,260
I'm like, you know what?

790
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,220
I don't want it.

791
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,180
I'd rather be ignorant of that subject if they have anything good at this point because I just can't get past their stupidity.

792
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,180
It's a way of information gathering and it's always been that way, believe it or not.

793
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:28,660
Another thing, just as a little caption on the whole thing, even when you read historians from the ancient days, they were very subjective, by the way.

794
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:36,940
They get into self-praise and praise of the subject that they're writing about if they find it favorable.

795
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:54,340
And they do the opposite if they don't find the subject favorable and then to top that off, I'm talking about ancient historians now, is that who knows how many times their works have been redacted or changed and translated into English.

796
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,460
Right?

797
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:02,440
So if you're going to read Herodotus or you're going to read any of this stuff, yeah, see if the subject matter is interesting but then try to get it in the original language.

798
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,440
Watch what happens.

799
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,580
It's very different.

800
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:14,780
Or you'll see three paragraphs in the original language and only one in English.

801
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,360
Yeah.

802
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,420
And usually it's the opposite.

803
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,440
Usually you'll see one paragraph in the original language and three paragraphs in English to explain it.

804
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,640
So you're like, oh, why did they leave those other things out?

805
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,840
So, yeah.

806
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,400
Oh, no, they wouldn't redact or leave stuff out, would they?

807
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:59,800
So that's why it's really important to know for anyone that studies history, what I find to be important is what is important that can be known, salient stuff, information that really pertains to where you are now so you can actually use it so you don't score high on a trivia board game, but you know you have enough accurate history at least to explain where you're at right now.

808
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,440
It's like navigating a ship.

809
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,980
You ever see the old-fashioned big sailboats?

810
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,800
They have diesels on them too.

811
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,700
You've got all these rolls of paper and all this navigation stuff, but you're only using a little bit of it for the trip.

812
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,940
You don't need all that other stuff, all those maps and all that.

813
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,720
Right, right.

814
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:24,320
Because it doesn't pertain to this particular journey that you're setting out to do this week.

815
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:46,220
So that's basically the suggestions that I give to people when they study is get a handle or figure out where you are now, what your interests are, and find out if there's anything that would help you along if you knew about it, of course from the past.

816
01:02:48,190 --> 01:03:01,810
Speaking of interesting things, this morning in chat, somebody threw out that link about the Arizona TV station when it was taken hostage.

817
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,230
Oh.

818
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,830
Yeah, that was an interesting thing out of history.

819
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,170
Really?

820
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:09,770
Yeah.

821
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:11,090
It was an article?

822
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:19,370
Apparently they interrupted a live broadcast, had this nutcase that was holding a gun.

823
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:33,670
I believe he fired the shot, and they forced this anchor to sit back and read off this dissertation by this nutter who was sitting there with a gun.

824
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:35,230
Nutter?

825
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,070
You mean like the Pope?

826
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:36,350
No.

827
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,330
He didn't have the clothes on.

828
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:45,830
Yeah, it was I think a five-hour ordeal.

829
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,750
It was quite the interesting thing.

830
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:55,190
It was way from the 19, I want to say late 50s?

831
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,670
Somewhere in that area.

832
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:58,390
The black and white?

833
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,170
Yeah, the old black and white.

834
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,070
It was a cool TV.

835
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,630
I think it was Arizona, if I'm not mistaken.

836
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:08,890
Yeah.

837
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,390
No, no, I'm not familiar, but those things happen.

838
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:15,350
Again, when you talk about the news, there's a lot of stuff happening.

839
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:21,430
Most of the stuff that happens that could be interesting never makes it to the news.

840
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:28,510
The stuff that's usually in the news is the stuff that's there as part of the agenda, and it sounds kind of conspiratorial.

841
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:41,530
Of course, there'll be an event and they'll put it in there but yeah, there's a lot of crazy stuff happening all over the place.

842
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:57,870
Of course, when I say the news, I mean what they put in front of everyone for a day or two or three, but because of the rectangle and the quote-unquote independent journalists, if you have a smartphone you could go out and be a journalist.

843
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:17,030
Just like back in the days, I knew several people that were independent writers and photographers and you put your story or your stuff together and the New York Times at 4 in the morning opens up, anyone has anything interesting to bring in or whatever, or you call a TV station for an interview.

844
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:23,730
That doesn't have to go that way anymore because when they have material they just do a website or a blog and they put it up themselves.

845
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:47,190
Also, the major news concerns, UPI and AP and all the other ones, independent reporters, if there's something that's noteworthy for them to use and you're there and you have a cell phone video of it, New York Times will buy it from you.

846
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,690
They'll buy the rights from you even though you're just somebody out there with a cell phone.

847
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,430
So that still happens.

848
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:07,750
Very seldom do you have any real journalism where you're actually going out and looking at things anymore like they used to.

849
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,610
Well, the thing about nutters,

850
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,230
let me just throw this in,

851
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,210
if you've ever known anyone

852
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,530
that worked in EMS,

853
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:15,910
the paramedics,

854
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,290
those guys,

855
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,770
if you ever hung around with them

856
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:21,190
or whatever,

857
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,830
they have stories on and on and on

858
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,650
and very often,

859
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,070
back in the day,

860
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,870
they took Polaroid shots of things

861
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:29,870
that they were called to check out

862
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:32,430
and that was some of the most

863
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,190
just freakish,

864
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,990
nutter-based stuff you can imagine

865
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,550
that never made it to the news.

866
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:39,450
Oh, yeah.

867
01:06:40,370 --> 01:07:04,970
That would be the kind of, like if you were to write a horror movie or an X-Files, and you needed material, you'd want to go befriend or recruit a retired EMS person and ask them, either him or his buddies or whatever, for access to their portfolios or private portfolios of all the things they'd seen that were weird in their career.

868
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:12,330
And you would have enough to do at least four or five episodes of X-Files and maybe three or four horror movies.

869
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,890
Maybe a few seasons.

870
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,310
Yeah.

871
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,550
Anyway.

872
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:39,810
This nutter that I was speaking about was claiming something about Islam and controlling people, quoted something out of Ezekiel, I believe it was 37 or 38, and how Johnny Cash and all these other singers were prophets and some weird...

873
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,750
It was really out there.

874
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:48,670
We started off by saying today that really bad versions create really bad doctrines and beliefs, don't they?

875
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:49,510
Exactly.

876
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:50,650
Exactly.

877
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:51,150
Yes.

878
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,230
Yes, we did.

879
01:07:52,830 --> 01:08:16,069
And again, just to go back to what I was saying earlier, the people that were around the first century, the early, quote-unquote, I'm not going to use the term, you know, Ishtans, this rhymes with Ishtans, with a C-H, I'll just say it, Christians, what they dubbed in a derogatory sense, they did what they did, I guess it was meant for them to do it, but they did it the wrong way.

880
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:33,750
They wanted to make a mark in society and establish the rule of the law as it's written in scripture and not what the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the Rabbinics were doing, because they were the predominant religious, spiritual people in that part of the world, right?

881
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:34,710
Right.

882
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:44,390
They failed to acknowledge one small little detail, that this world is being run by the adversary, or Satan.

883
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,569
Well, just failed to mention that, yeah.

884
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,149
Well, they failed to live by that truth.

885
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:57,870
Almost a vanity kind of thing, then, you know, rather vain.

886
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:00,930
Yeah, it was rather vain, and they got it.

887
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:22,670
But if you met them and you say, well, yeah, what you're saying is correct, obviously, just like, not because it's a matter of what religion you are, it's like, for example, if you met an attorney and you saw what he's doing, you're like, wait a second, dude, here's your law book, it's not like that.

888
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:38,130
But if you met these people back then, you'd say, yeah, that's correct, so you know what's going on, you're living in this unique time, and also, what you're saying is correct according to the writ, but, like I say, who are you going to tell this to?

889
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,090
Look around you.

890
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:39,750
Crazy.

891
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:58,450
A planet full of idiots, and they're cosmically censored, and the only reason the Pharisees and the Sadducees are like that is to accommodate the evilness of the rest, so shut up, sit down, if you're going to do it, do it, this is not a friendly place.

892
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,550
No, they try to make a mark,

893
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,110
you had the concept of communes,

894
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:04,610
even today,

895
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,030
where people physically separate themselves,

896
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,570
the true separatists,

897
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,870
that separate themselves

898
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,390
and form a commune out in the wilderness,

899
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:13,930
or whatever,

900
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:16,970
that time is over,

901
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,970
so you separate being right in it,

902
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:20,830
just like you could be in the middle of a sewer,

903
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,230
but just don't be skinny dipping

904
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,090
and drinking the water,

905
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,310
you need protection, right?

906
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,130
Right, right.

907
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:36,430
Asthma, breathing, so if you're in this shit society, which is what it is, no matter where you go now, it's a matter of, do you want to drink the stuff they drink?

908
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,590
Do you want to breathe the stuff they breathe?

909
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,350
You know, because they thrive on it.

910
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:58,450
That old Persian tale that you talked about, they thrive on the crap, you don't have to thrive on it, you can still find something, and if it's not good, you try to make it good.

911
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:05,790
Make your day good, you don't have to be a part of their thinking, actions or anything, no.

912
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:27,460
That's right, and if they're in the condition that they're in, in a wholesale market, and they sell away, meaning everyone around you, it's not, after a while, you have to throw up your hands and say, they have nothing to do with it, they're just participating, this has been set up for them and they fell for it.

913
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,500
They can't change it.

914
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,740
No, no.

915
01:11:31,700 --> 01:12:02,040
Now there are many times in history where there's an apparent change instigated by the people, yes, it does happen on occasion, on the big early ships, if you had overloaded to capacity the ship with people and there was a whale or something on one side of the ship and everyone went to one side, the ship was in danger of flipping over, if you had that many people.

916
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:02,760
And a lot did.

917
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,780
Yes, some in the Great Lakes did, with cargo and things.

918
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:14,180
Some of the largest ships to ever go down are in the Great Lakes, you'd think it would be the Atlantic or the Pacific, for reasons like that.

919
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,560
Shifted loads.

920
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:28,560
That could happen, and it has happened in a small way throughout society, apparently, but I wouldn't put too much weight in it, no pun intended.

921
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,420
So, that's why, again, the truth, how many times have you heard the truth is still a secret about anything?

922
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:55,100
You hear people discussing wrong, they'll just spout out whatever they're told in school, or whatever, biblical stuff, wrong, medical stuff, wrong, it's just, what are you talking about?

923
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,500
It's like, who was your first president?

924
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:05,940
Yeah, well actually, just even recent history, past 50 years, I have no idea what's going on.

925
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,880
Oh, easily, easily.

926
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,680
I'm interested in political stuff.

927
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:20,300
This is a very quick way to judge the wheat from the chaff, the stuff that should be thrown away or the stuff that should be consumed.

928
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,340
Whenever you're looking at any

929
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,220
political issue,

930
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,060
especially when it's going to change over

931
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:26,740
at an election,

932
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,200
when they're making all their promises,

933
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,380
if you have anyone political,

934
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:33,440
and if they don't stand up and say,

935
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,220
this is not because I'm saying it,

936
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,860
this is the veracity of the truth of the matter,

937
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,280
if they don't stand up and say that

938
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,660
we've been bankrupt for about

939
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:43,940
75 or 80 years now,

940
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,760
it's about time we get some lawful money

941
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,840
so we can operate lawfully.

942
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,020
Do you have anyone discussing that?

943
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,560
No, and they can't.

944
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,560
So it's all crap.

945
01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:01,640
So, alright, anything else going on?

946
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,960
Otherwise we're on for about an hour or so, right?

947
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:08,380
Yeah, we passed about the hour, 20 some-ish, somewhere in there.

948
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:19,880
Oh yeah, I see here, someone's putting, a conservative in Australia is socially acceptable and encouraged.

949
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,080
Yeah, that's the new age stuff.

950
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,480
They don't even know what the truth means.

951
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,240
Just say that's very nice.

952
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,340
Their truth is very nice.

953
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,560
Yeah, very nice.

954
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:39,040
Yeah, but you've got to understand too, I mean, there's still, you know, it's good to profile, good to be stereotypical out of efficiency.

955
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,140
It's not good to profile and use stereotypes if it's in vanity.

956
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,840
You know what I mean?

957
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:54,740
So, the stereotype and the profile for Australia is that it was basically, I don't know, when did they discover Australia?

958
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,360
1988?

959
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,780
When did it become a country?

960
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,460
I'm just joking.

961
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:08,180
It was set up as a spillover by the Dutch and the English and all that.

962
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,760
And not because nothing good can go there.

963
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,920
I mean, of course you have some good that can go there.

964
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,600
And you said you were going there.

965
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:32,140
You were disencouraged because of that initial fact that it was a spillover, a penal colony, a place where they sent crazy people or criminals or black market or people on the run.

966
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:32,640
You know what I mean?

967
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,640
So, it's kind of like growing up in parts of New York City and you're a white boy and you say, I'm going up to Harlem.

968
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,500
Oh, no, you can't go there.

969
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,980
You'll get hurt.

970
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,980
They'll kill you.

971
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,620
I'm like, no, that's not true, obviously.

972
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,240
But a lot of people have been discouraged from going up to Harlem because of stuff like that.

973
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:49,880
You see what I mean?

974
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,060
Of the stereotype and the profile of that.

975
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,920
Going to the red light district.

976
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,900
You don't go to that part of town.

977
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,500
Many people are discouraged just from a simple statement like that.

978
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:01,680
You see?

979
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,400
I see.

980
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:10,380
Wes just asked, are ether and electricity completely independent of each other?

981
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,140
No, they're not.

982
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,680
No, because electricity, let's just use electricity in the common way that people speak and use it.

983
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,580
That is the byproduct of the ether.

984
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:41,920
Just like, let's just say you would have, the ether would be the humidity in the air and the condensate you see off of a cold plate dripping off, that would be the water which is the electricity.

985
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,180
It's a condensed form of ether.

986
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,100
And when I mean that, I mean literally.

987
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:55,780
It is a concentration of a degraded form, the one that most people are using because it's coming off of chemical decomposition.

988
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:05,920
You know, batteries that are chemically decomposing, coal, nuclear, hydroelectric plants, you know, the way the transformers are wired and all that.

989
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:11,830
Just like the medical industry.

990
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,530
They study, that's all based on dead people.

991
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:18,110
Well, how could you say that, Greek, very simple.

992
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:21,170
What do they base their anatomy on?

993
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:23,920
Dabber.

994
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,560
They don't know what a living kidney looks like.

995
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:38,320
They might know what a living kidney looks like when they first cut it out of a person, but by the time they get to examine it and catalog it and illustrate it, it's quite dead.

996
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:39,980
Right?

997
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:41,300
Oh, yeah.

998
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:49,340
They don't know what, that's why the early Gray's anatomy, whenever they brought up a body part, it said it always, it usually appears like this.

999
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,600
It doesn't say it looks like this.

1000
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,880
It appears like this, right?

1001
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,080
The heart appears to have a ventricle here.

1002
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:02,880
And you see, this renal gland appears to be, you see, they always were very safe that way.

1003
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:10,320
So, this is actually, these are grunts.

1004
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,400
These academics, these professors, these people in the professional fields, they've done all the grunt work.

1005
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,480
You know, it's like, let's say you have a beautiful structure you want to build, you need the foundation dug.

1006
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,620
The architect and the engineer and the artist or whatever is not going to, you know, the master carpenter is not going to dig the foundation.

1007
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,660
The grunts are.

1008
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:43,320
Sorry, and if you dig foundations, one of the aspects of getting the big chunk of something ready is grunt work.

1009
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:55,360
And when you go to any of these institutional training facilities known as universities or in programming facilities or whatever, that's all grunt stuff.

1010
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:01,340
And I always challenge people if they challenge me on the aspect of that.

1011
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:02,760
Very simple.

1012
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,200
Go to your Ivy League schools, which are online right now.

1013
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:18,980
Depending on what school, university, you know, or particular field in the university and look up the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate studies and actually list all the classes and courses you take, right?

1014
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:32,860
Pretty much like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, upstate, downstate, medical, Berkeley, USC, whatever, you know, Northeast, Northwestern University, whatever you want to look at and whatever field you want to look at.

1015
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,640
Look at the curriculum objectively.

1016
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,760
And all that other stuff, NYU, whatever.

1017
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,400
Do they teach any law in their undergraduate or graduate?

1018
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,620
And the answer is no.

1019
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,380
They don't.

1020
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:47,920
Right?

1021
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:56,280
When you look at all of the medical universities and colleges, do they teach anything about how the body heals and how the body really works?

1022
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,380
No, they don't.

1023
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:10,830
I tested that theory with my daughter who was trying to become an RN and had a couple of experiments with her.

1024
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:13,350
Not a clue.

1025
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:14,570
Not a clue.

1026
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:27,730
The RNs, they do a lot of microbiology, you know, like inside cells and chemical, basic chemical stuff, you know, biology.

1027
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:33,250
Basically, it's a biochem study is what she's doing and cell studies.

1028
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,250
You have to memorize all this useless stuff.

1029
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:39,830
And half of it doesn't even exist, by the way, in the real world.

1030
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:41,970
Right, right.

1031
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:48,130
I got to look through some of her stuff and paperwork.

1032
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,190
You won't find any real photographs.

1033
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,150
It's all drawings too and artist renderings.

1034
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:56,390
Simularities.

1035
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,090
And they don't exist.

1036
01:20:58,670 --> 01:20:59,950
Those are good.

1037
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:02,250
Maybe finish off with something.

1038
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:07,110
You know, when you go to these quote-unquote supermarkets, they have a pharmacy department.

1039
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:11,890
And usually within the pharmacy department, they have a blood pressure machine.

1040
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:20,070
And when it's not busy, and I see the pharmacists are just, you know, bored out of their skull, and I mean that, you know, like they're angry about their lives being there.

1041
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:27,410
They know deep down inside they're doing the wrong thing, but they have no other way to function because that's the path they're on.

1042
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:46,410
Anyway, when I notice they're just like staring into space with those little trays and stuff, especially if they make eye contact with me while I'm looking at them and looking at the area, I say to them, I say, hey, this blood pressure machine here, where can I get one of these?

1043
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:49,070
Or is this something I could get from you guys?

1044
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,490
And they're like, oh, no, no, we just rent the space for it or whatever.

1045
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,590
I say, why do you want one of these blood pressure machines?

1046
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,310
This is like the kind you put the coin in, you know?

1047
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:57,250
Mm-hmm.

1048
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:01,430
I said, why are you interested in one?

1049
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,490
I said, oh, glad you should ask.

1050
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:11,190
See, I'm starting, I'm starting a museum on medical quackery and fakery and I wanted this to be one of the primary exhibits.

1051
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:14,050
And they kind of stare at you.

1052
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:14,810
Yeah.

1053
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,650
Get that look in their eye.

1054
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:26,110
Yeah, and one guy, I remember it was near closing and I said that to him and then on the way out he was leaving and he says, why did you say that?

1055
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,050
I explained it to him.

1056
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:30,010
He says, yeah, you know, I have a suspicion about that.

1057
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,050
He was an older guy too.

1058
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,010
I have a suspicion about that blood pressure stuff is all garbage.

1059
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:54,270
And right there in a lawful society you take them out back and shoot them because he's been responsible for, well, he's been responsible by how much prescription medication and just like the certain people, they said, why did you put all these people in this camp?

1060
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,890
I was just following orders, right?

1061
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,050
After a while, those people got hung.

1062
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,010
For just following orders, didn't they?

1063
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:02,670
Yeah, this guy is multiple.

1064
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:04,250
Mm-hmm.

1065
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:10,010
Yeah, and it's in a lawful society that will not exist.

1066
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:14,030
So in a sense, you have these reminders constantly, you know.

1067
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:23,330
I mean, I've been in, back to the legal society and meetings with attorneys with other people and they're discussing and the attorney doesn't know the law at all.

1068
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:25,670
We brought up some laws once in one situation.

1069
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:31,370
He was befuddled and he was just frantically looking through the book and the book, I said, how long have you had these books?

1070
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,430
He said, I've had them for about 20 years.

1071
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,710
They look brand new, never touched, right?

1072
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,810
And then he got frustrated.

1073
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:38,510
He couldn't find it.

1074
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,070
He said, oh, here it is.

1075
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,850
Oh, no, this is not it.

1076
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,670
I said, no, that's not it.

1077
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:45,450
And he puts it aside and he says, listen, just do what the judge tells you to do.

1078
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,170
I'm like, what, excuse us?

1079
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,830
Excuse me?

1080
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:49,370
Right?

1081
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1082
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,950
Take care of that.

1083
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:04,410
Yeah, go take care of that.

1084
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:06,370
That's another guy that you would take out back.

1085
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:14,330
if you keep doing that, you lose half the society, you know, and then the other half that's left are sad.

1086
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,870
You know, it doesn't work this way.

1087
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,230
The gods have to do it.

1088
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:29,530
There has never been a situation where any, whether it was through peaceful or violent means that have changed this core rottenness in human society you know that, right?

1089
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:30,310
Right.

1090
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:36,830
There have been violent dictators that have tried eliminating groups of people.

1091
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:37,390
Did it work?

1092
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:38,210
No, it didn't work.

1093
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:52,010
Because eventually they were gone and they turned the system around and if you go to places like the Soviet Union, China, they have just as many idiots, pharmacists, attorneys, whatever, you want to go down the line, fake food.

1094
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:58,570
I mean, in China, didn't they produce a whole bunch of fake milk out of melamine and poisoned, you know, 100,000 people, babies, right?

1095
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:01,670
Yeah, that was a big thing there, what, 10 years ago?

1096
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:05,510
Yeah, maybe 4 or 5, maybe 10, yeah.

1097
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:13,510
So this goes on everywhere, and then you have a place called, the Europeans were tired of justice so they came and formed America, right?

1098
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,430
Make it better.

1099
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,090
What did they get?

1100
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:25,050
They tried to do it once, on the other side they tried to do it peaceably, and where did it end up?

1101
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,030
Nowhere, it's the same.

1102
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:41,070
So the situation, the evil that persists, when I say evil, I'm talking about it's in the ones that you trust, I'm not saying don't trust anyone and be paranoid, I'm just saying you're not objective enough to know what trust is, let's say, right?

1103
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,270
For most people.

1104
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,130
And you know what?

1105
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:53,570
They will.

1106
01:25:54,910 --> 01:26:07,470
That's why, you know, I was looking earlier, there was something in chat about the book of Revelation and it's scary, and I'm like, well, yeah, book of Revelation is really a hands-off kind of book, anyone can read it, how can it be hands-off, right?

1107
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:23,990
Anyone has access to it, because there's a very small specific group of people in the situation that you're in, right?

1108
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:26,190
That's all it is.

1109
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:34,470
And that book will not be comprehended if you don't fit in the description of that first verse.

1110
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:39,690
I'm not saying the person who posted that in chat is or isn't, I'm just giving that as a general statement.

1111
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:46,570
The other aspect of anything that's in scripture is, of course, the caveat.

1112
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,150
It hasn't been translated yet.

1113
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:55,530
We mostly just have it in Greek, which is not good.

1114
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,170
A limited version of Greek.

1115
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:59,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:04,290
We need to get some, because none of those guys back there did anything in Greek.

1117
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,850
Anything you see in Greek was, at minimum, 150 years later.

1118
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,230
And it was not one of the earlier writings, you know.

1119
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:17,290
It was just a certain amount of pages too, wasn't it?

1120
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,310
Not so much.

1121
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:27,550
Well, again, there's a lot of speculation that one can go into because we don't have anything that can show us better.

1122
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:31,490
So you have to do the best with what you've got.

1123
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:37,570
Just like I was saying earlier, if you just had the King James and it says somewhere, like, my name is the Lord, you're like, we know that that's not a name.

1124
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:38,590
We know that's a title.

1125
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:57,090
We know that it's a poor title because it doesn't even have a sequence of things in that version that you could start piecing it together.

1126
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:05,590
But you will leave, if you just have the King James, you will leave with a very bad idea of what went on.

1127
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:16,910
That's why when you go to, things like the King James, the Geneva Bible, and other translations, have created really bad doctrine and really bad religion.

1128
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:24,070
For example, if you go to the American Midwest they have formed a religion around that Bible.

1129
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:25,590
Not around the scripture.

1130
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,490
They think that is the Bible.

1131
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,470
They think that's what was given to the prophets.

1132
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:34,330
They think that what's in there is, you know...

1133
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:36,010
Oh, it's a vanity aspect.

1134
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:41,030
Yeah, and they've actually created a religion around a false document.

1135
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,210
Like bell-bottoms or something.

1136
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:59,630
So that's why I'm saying when you see the religiosity the only solution for those that are in that is extraction, which could be viewed as poaching.

1137
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:04,450
You don't go there and say, hey listen, leave this place, whatever, you know.

1138
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:08,010
But they're usually unreparable.

1139
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,790
They've already done unreparable damage.

1140
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:18,110
Not because they've just created a religion out of a really bad document or bad version or bad information.

1141
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:25,770
It's because not only now but always the state of society has been so unstable that that's where they find their maximum stability.

1142
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:31,790
So if you show them where they find their maximum stability it's really not worth it at all.

1143
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:35,070
Now you've pulled the rug completely from under them.

1144
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:51,690
It's kind of like the magician or the trick, it actually takes a lot of finesse to pull the tablecloth from under the place setting and China wearing everything on the floor also when you do that for them.

1145
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:55,590
Because they don't understand where else to go.

1146
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,290
Right, well they're left empty then, yes.

1147
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,230
Completely empty, yeah.

1148
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:04,810
So that's why I'm saying they just walk away and it's a very solo path.

1149
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:07,910
Sam often reminds us about that.

1150
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:10,530
He'll say, well I don't care about them, I just care about myself.

1151
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:22,230
Now it might sound self-centered, narcissistic or selfish, but I think he's trying to make a point that just get it out there and whoever can use it will use it and don't bother.

1152
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:23,910
And I'm just interpreting that.

1153
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:34,430
We had one perhaps, can we wait for another show, any info worth sharing about the so-called dark ages around 10 to 12 AD?

1154
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,790
You said this time period was heavily censored.

1155
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:40,670
What was it?

1156
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,410
10th or 12th century, yeah.

1157
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,210
It is very heavily censored.

1158
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,730
You're not going to remember it.

1159
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:55,790
That's post-imperial Rome, formal imperial Rome, way post-imperial Rome.

1160
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:59,290
That is a time of tremendous meddling of all the cultures of the earth.

1161
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:10,010
It was also a time where about 75% of all the people on the planet were wiped out due to natural disasters, cataclysms and things.

1162
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:13,190
The Greek mentioned, I was practicing information regarding the cataclysms, right?

1163
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:14,770
Yep.

1164
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:21,630
There's records you can do, you could do a strenuous study.

1165
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:36,390
You will find that during that time period, like between 6 or 800 AD to 1100 AD around there, about 90% of the population in Europe was wiped out due to plague and natural disasters and astronomical events.

1166
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,970
Strange phenomena, stuff we've never seen.

1167
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:59,990
I always used to throw in an opinion which I don't like to put out, but apparently what happened there around the year 4000, around the year when the 1st century AD was a de facto end of the world scenario, mankind should have ended right there.

1168
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:12,230
I think the spirits that are poised to do that in Hmm.

1169
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:16,470
Yeah, because you see right now there's nothing else to prove.

1170
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:25,330
Everything that mankind needed to have accomplished about mankind was accomplished around the early part of the 1st century.

1171
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:27,210
This is all filler time.

1172
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:39,730
This is the time where you've already got your tooth filled at the dentist and you're walking out of what you were in earlier.

1173
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,450
Right, and you've got anesthesia going.

1174
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:50,310
Yeah, and you're just walking, either waving or you're like, oh man, I've got to get home now.

1175
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,510
Now you're walking back out.

1176
01:32:52,570 --> 01:33:01,810
See, before you were in the waiting room, 1st century was when they operated and now you're, I'm just giving a western analogy, and now you're walking through the waiting room again.

1177
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:05,050
Yeah, there's nothing going on.

1178
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,030
There hasn't been.

1179
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:08,190
Laughing gas is still good.

1180
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,510
Yeah, yeah, nitrous.

1181
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:21,230
Yeah, so I would say that, yeah, I would say that just be patient, educate yourself, get informed.

1182
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:25,850
Well, it's about the only way you can do it.

1183
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,940
Okay, Dark Ages 5 to 900.

1184
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:36,180
Yeah, that was the time when most of the stuff, 10th to 12th century, getting into the Middle Ages.

1185
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,720
We have a lot of heraldry.

1186
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:48,340
There was a boom in heraldry and a revival of the late imperial Roman way of doing things in Europe.

1187
01:33:48,520 --> 01:34:02,700
You know, when you see all the knights and King Arthur and Beowulf and Grendel and the art came out from that time period and later from that part of the world, you know how England got more prominent and all that?

1188
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:03,260
Right.

1189
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:09,120
Well, they did, but they were just doing what the Romans had done, just like the Romans had done what the Greeks had done before them.

1190
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:15,700
That was that whole time of like the King Arthur days, the Camelot, Middle Ages.

1191
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,480
Repeating, repeating, repeating.

1192
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,760
Castles, that was just repeating.

1193
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,480
The height of the Roman,

1194
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,660
well, not the height,

1195
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,580
prior to its

1196
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,980
gradual, you know,

1197
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,060
imperial collapse,

1198
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,120
let's say,

1199
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,120
which it didn't really

1200
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,640
collapse all of a sudden,

1201
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,360
it was just,

1202
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,300
it's kind of like

1203
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,100
saying it got overrun

1204
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:36,880
and changed

1205
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,320
and

1206
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,340
they just revived that

1207
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,380
in the 10th or 12th century,

1208
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,440
but what's unique about

1209
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,120
like from the years

1210
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,480
like 450 to 900,

1211
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:46,520
especially around

1212
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,860
the years like 600 to 800

1213
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,380
is when you had the majority

1214
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,520
of the people on the planet

1215
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,200
wiped out.

1216
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,960
When I say 75 percent, that's a majority, let's say.

1217
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,300
Holy smokes.

1218
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,780
Yeah, and there's no information on that.

1219
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:06,460
And that's also where you have a lot of the legends of the flying carpets and the Vamanas and all that, you know, flying machines.

1220
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:07,720
I remember you saying that, yeah.

1221
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:17,800
Yeah, you know, sometimes people will look at documents and they're told these are thousands, you know, like Sanskrit is 20,000 years ago.

1222
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,320
I'm like, nah, it's like 600 B.C., dude.

1223
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,020
You know, it's not that far, you know.

1224
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,900
The pyramids are 15,000 years old.

1225
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,460
Nah, not really.

1226
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,460
They're like 3,500 years, man.

1227
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,080
You know, but you can't, you know, that's their truth, right?

1228
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:34,640
Right, right.

1229
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:41,080
They've got plenty of dummy loading they can get involved in to figure out what they want to believe in.

1230
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,330
Oh, it's a divine thing to do.

1231
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:52,670
Yeah, and the other thing, the thing about the truth, again, none of that matters really at this point.

1232
01:35:53,550 --> 01:36:01,790
Well, I shouldn't say, it's very, it's good to know, if you're getting, if you're not getting, if you're not getting corn out of poop, but.

1233
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:20,010
Yeah, but what, in terms of a social perspective, none of that matters, because you're, none of it will be able to be implemented, unless you know when the gods are going to implement what level of, level of truth, you know, the low level or medium or high at certain points, you know.

1234
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:33,970
But there are simple truths, which are which I like to discuss, usually, and so, whoever listens to, let's say, a short or long single event, can walk away with something.

1235
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,050
Right.

1236
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:35,610
And I think maybe

1237
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:36,270
in the future,

1238
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,630
I'll be discussing

1239
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:38,370
a little bit more,

1240
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:39,210
I mean,

1241
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:40,770
five or ten years ago,

1242
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,650
sometimes I'd say

1243
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:42,650
I would never say this

1244
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,090
in public,

1245
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:44,050
and I find myself

1246
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:44,910
saying certain things

1247
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,510
now in public,

1248
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,370
but never say,

1249
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:48,490
and right now,

1250
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,270
let's say I'm thinking,

1251
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,530
oh,

1252
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:50,390
there may be some things

1253
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,930
I need to say

1254
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:51,430
in the future,

1255
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:52,830
and I might be saying

1256
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:53,270
them sooner,

1257
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:53,570
like,

1258
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:53,830
you know,

1259
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:55,150
I'm not going to bring up

1260
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:56,090
what topics they are

1261
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:57,390
because people are going

1262
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,350
to start hitting me up

1263
01:36:58,350 --> 01:36:58,730
on them,

1264
01:36:59,310 --> 01:36:59,630
you know,

1265
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,490
so I don't want to

1266
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:01,470
start too much curiosity,

1267
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,150
I'm not teasing anyone,

1268
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:03,950
I'm just saying

1269
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:05,230
it's not nothing

1270
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:06,130
that anyone else

1271
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:06,970
can't figure out,

1272
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:07,490
I'm just,

1273
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:08,730
and it's not that

1274
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:09,430
I figured it out,

1275
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,670
I can just give a report

1276
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:11,490
if there's a difference,

1277
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:12,310
you know,

1278
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,590
there's no figuring on it,

1279
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:13,970
I mean,

1280
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,270
there's always figuring,

1281
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,230
in other words,

1282
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:17,430
how deep you want to go,

1283
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:19,830
and how much more,

1284
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:22,030
but what kind of reporting,

1285
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:23,150
and that's what I always

1286
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:23,610
used to say

1287
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:24,290
in the early days,

1288
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:25,290
I'm not here

1289
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:26,750
to teach anyone,

1290
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,770
or get anyone to,

1291
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:30,350
or anything,

1292
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,690
I'm just giving a report,

1293
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:32,690
you know,

1294
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:39,010
strictly because it's become

1295
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:39,350
very,

1296
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:40,650
these subjects have become

1297
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:43,390
almost non-existent,

1298
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:43,850
you know,

1299
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,210
in the way they can

1300
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:45,890
be discussed,

1301
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:46,270
and so,

1302
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:46,870
and it sounds,

1303
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:47,750
a lot of things

1304
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:48,670
I like to bring up

1305
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:49,950
sound ultra-rarified,

1306
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:50,910
but they're not,

1307
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:52,290
they always have to do

1308
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:52,690
with something

1309
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:54,970
you're already engaging in.

1310
01:37:55,450 --> 01:38:02,870
And you can tangibly check it if you take your time to do so, you know, I always encourage check it out, you know.

1311
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:22,070
Yeah, yeah, it's not that difficult, unfortunately, I have to watch, if I'm going to ponder something I'm going to speak on, I like to, see if I could couch it within the rectangle, you know, I want to, hey, you know, I want to maybe talk about this, I'm going to see what's online about it.

1312
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:25,370
I'm like, if I don't find anything online, I'm not going to talk about it too much.

1313
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:29,650
I'll bring it up, I'll say, this is not online, but I want you to consider these things, you know.

1314
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:37,970
But if it is online, I'll just keep going quickly through it, you know, and, because anyone later on who wants to go through it might find some stuff on it, right?

1315
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:39,830
But there's a lot of stuff.

1316
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:44,690
It does seem like we are getting more and more into the digital book-burning era.

1317
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:56,290
Information seems to vanish, not to appear again, which is very interesting to watch.

1318
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:15,080
I looked at stuff that when I first got my first computer way back in the day, and stuff that I looked up and archived and try to look for it now, I mean, there's a lot that I didn't Right, and it's not even on the archives, it's not in the way back machine.

1319
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:15,920
Yeah.

1320
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,720
There is a site, by the way, I've lost all bookmarks.

1321
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:23,100
No.

1322
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,300
I use Maxton, M-A-X-T-H-O-N.

1323
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:27,040
Yeah.

1324
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:33,180
You know, but anyway, it's about like how to destroy an account as a website.

1325
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:40,680
If you have an account and you want to destroy an email account and don't want it anymore, or a Skype account or whatever, you just I had that bookmark.

1326
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,220
I gave it to some people that have used it.

1327
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:54,820
I've never used it, but the reason, yeah, I think it was yesterday or this morning, I turned on the computer and it went through this process of upgrading and no bookmarks, all right, at all.

1328
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:11,860
Yeah, yeah, so, well, but I, as a young person or young man, I remember having a tutor that kept slapping the pencil out of my hand and because when it's really important, you shouldn't have to write it down, you should commit it to memory, right?

1329
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,020
Right, right.

1330
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,840
But then again, notes are very important.

1331
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,740
Bookmarks can be important.

1332
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:29,800
I got wise and always started archiving all my bookmarks and I periodically would update every couple months or so.

1333
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,020
Okay.

1334
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,260
That saved my keystore a couple times already.

1335
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:36,060
I'm using

1336
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:36,400
a

1337
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:36,820
a

1338
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:37,420
a

1339
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:38,580
a

1340
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:38,780
a

1341
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:38,880
a

1342
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,400
a

1343
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:16,720
a

1344
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,960
a

1345
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,200
a

1346
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,760
a

1347
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:34,500
a

1348
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:34,600
a

1349
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:34,700
a

1350
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:34,800
a

1351
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,360
a

1352
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:37,460
a

1353
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:14,740
old English versus modern English and with the digital format you can with an

1354
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:18,720
upgrade over a period of six months to a year all of the designers getting

1355
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:24,860
together and changing stuff can do more change than there was that in other

1356
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:29,000
words the change between the old English the way it was pronounced written and

1357
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,940
understood to modern English which took several hundred years that could happen

1358
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:40,340
within months or years now with a digital format right oh easily easily

1359
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:46,840
even shorter I would think yes yeah yeah so you so gradually this is an

1360
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:52,020
interesting thing within the next few years the entire language will be

1361
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:59,820
changed because oh yeah so you catch people doing it now you know they

1362
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:05,840
incorporate some of those certain emojis into their vernacular and and the

1363
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,580
appearance also of the language like the letter a may not mean the letter a

1364
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:13,820
anymore there's something I'm not saying it's going to happen and I don't think

1365
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:23,200
it will teach they don't teach a script a cursive anymore none of that yeah for

1366
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:29,120
sure for sure there's the penmanship is atrocious declined they don't even know

1367
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:38,120
mail a letter for God's sakes yeah which isn't yeah what which is a whole

1368
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:42,780
other convention it's all done point-and-click you know I'm done

1369
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:48,900
yeah it's a yeah it's a completely different convention but but but they

1370
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:53,360
will have their their online stuff delivered in pot and parcel correct

1371
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:59,100
boxers yeah but they won't be able to read the label yeah or write the label

1372
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:06,800
by hand I should say right label you know but I have this suggestion that I

1373
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,220
made regarding the language change may or may not happen that quickly but I

1374
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:17,520
wouldn't be surprised if it is you know the actual yeah yeah we can kind of

1375
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,340
gauge it in media how they're they're changing their scripting and approach

1376
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:30,800
it's subtle it's very subtle mm-hmm well to me it's not subtle though no no it

1377
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,420
to the to the morons at large yeah it is yeah they don't they don't know it's

1378
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:41,360
happening or they realize it's okay like the Android the Apple phone the smartphone

1379
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:47,980
platform regardless of the the operating system I can't I I always like to be

1380
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:55,020
around I will usurp the opportunity well if I'd like to be around people that

1381
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:59,520
have them when I'm out in the field oh and I just tell them look this up for me

1382
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:05,840
but if you had me the thing to do it I just want to smash it oh you said one

1383
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:13,360
time it's a nine-year-old girl how true how true I raised one so yes

1384
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:20,780
you're spot-on oh yes yeah because that's what I perceive it to be if you

1385
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:26,060
see it that's that's what I perceive as well so I mean I can't say having raised

1386
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:35,090
a girl definitely definitely very true all right let's what do you think

1387
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:41,210
anything else sir we've been on for let's see two hours waiting about Skype

1388
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:49,410
okay yeah these things are okay people think they're free they're not they're

1389
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:54,850
using credit you're the credit that was given to you to operate just on a

1390
01:45:54,850 --> 01:46:00,150
closing thought perhaps another closing thought right there's a big to-do in

1391
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:05,110
what they call America because there's a very high credit rating right with

1392
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:08,430
what's called illegals and I'm not talking about sick birds you know an

1393
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:14,570
eagle that's sick and it's you constantly see legislation on that from

1394
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:17,650
one hand I'll tell you why it's a big deal it's never going to be discussed

1395
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:21,650
and it hasn't been discussed it can't be discussed because the people that are in

1396
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:25,370
the legislature presidents Congress they don't know this either I mean

1397
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:28,870
they're so compartmentalized some of them do if you bring it up they'll say

1398
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:33,170
yeah I know it but they can't articulate it and I'm going to articulate it for

1399
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:38,830
everyone here listening when you have someone that comes over to this

1400
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:42,290
jurisdiction known as America and the various jurisdictions there in the

1401
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:47,550
various political subdivisions and they start performing in society whether it's

1402
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:56,090
labor jobs or job trying to buy or sell something there is no money to do that

1403
01:46:56,090 --> 01:47:04,490
lawfully so the liability on the government is huge huge you could

1404
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:10,050
literally take down the government if you knew how the legal system really

1405
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:16,190
worked if you were if you're a wetback that came over here worked for a week

1406
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:20,830
and you knew how really the system work you could you could leave a billionaire

1407
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:24,190
or be taken care of for the rest of you they probably kill you though before

1408
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:32,790
that because there is no money to pay you you've got some serious beef so so

1409
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:38,510
what is going on is when when you're branded in illegal do you have to hurry

1410
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:44,710
up and get papers it has nothing let me repeat nothing to do with identifying

1411
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:52,810
you for God's sake you know yes it has everything it has everything to do with

1412
01:47:52,810 --> 01:48:01,190
you identifying with a credit line to operate which is vis-a-vis let's say the

1413
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:05,390
Social Security number is the easiest one there are other numbers too but even

1414
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:09,010
someone that has a temporary green card or whatever gets a Social Security

1415
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:15,030
number yeah there's what they have to do and once you operate or accept that

1416
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:21,130
because supposed to be voluntary right now you have now waived all of your

1417
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:25,570
rights to go after them for lawful currency or lawful compensation in this

1418
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:31,270
country because now hey they could say hey you got a credit line asshole but

1419
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:35,690
they never let you they never tell you what it is yeah yeah they do yeah the

1420
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:40,090
funniest thing is when I was an economics professor type guy had a

1421
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:45,750
daughter's is all she's only 16 she doesn't have any credit I'm like what an

1422
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:52,450
idiot what an idiot this guy teaches economics right so and they're all like

1423
01:48:52,450 --> 01:48:55,290
that by the way because if you're an economics professor and you know how the

1424
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:59,710
money system works and you talked about it you will find yourself eating out of a

1425
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:06,870
garbage can in about a year and they know that well they do or worse yeah so

1426
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:10,090
that's a pretty general statement that holds true across the board with any

1427
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:17,370
field so there are people that know it and don't and promote the other stuff

1428
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:24,140
like the Sadducees so that's why they're sad you see right sad they're

1429
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:30,540
sad you see so anyway I would say I would say that's that's probably enough

1430
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:37,040
for tonight almost about two hours and it's more or just driver yeah yeah okay
