1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,480
Good.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,020
Good.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,100
Got the rest in there.

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,400
Okay.

5
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,280
Yep.

6
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,000
Got the rest in there.

7
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,700
Let's see.

8
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,280
Okay.

9
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,360
So, anyway, anything that you've got brewing on your mind?

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,900
Interesting conversation on Tai Chi yesterday.

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,680
Oh, really?

12
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,100
Yeah.

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
Well, that's an interesting thing.

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,220
I don't really get into a lot of public discussion on things that people can't access immediately.

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,840
Right.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,439
That's why you notice most of the things I always come out ranting about is the calendar food.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,100
Yeah.

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
No one's paying attention about things that they're already engaged in.

19
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,340
Yeah.

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,800
You see?

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:37,740
Yeah.

22
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,760
So, the other...

23
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,440
Yeah.

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,560
I'll give you a little background.

25
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:54,220
Years ago, people used to come to me about health issues, and I said, well, eventually I discovered through experimenting with them, believe it or not, you know, because no one really knows, most of the time the remedies did work, and I said, well, wait a second.

26
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,800
Wait a second.

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:07,720
The ultimate experiment is on their onus, meaning, hey, if your state of health depends on your behavior, right?

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,980
Right.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,620
Right.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,940
And your state of health goes down, that means that it's something in your behavior is doing it.

31
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,200
So...

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,600
Something's changed.

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,500
Right.

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,640
Or what you've been doing is catching up with you.

35
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,180
Right.

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,800
Finally.

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah.

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:34,400
So I just told people, make a list of your behavior, and then make a list of the things that you think you should be doing, or foods you don't like that you, you know, things that you should, you know, like that you prefer, don't prefer now, and take those two lists and switch them.

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:45,460
Do the ones that you, the things that you think you should be doing, which are better, and foods that you don't like, which are better, which you're not eating, and do those, and don't do the things you normally do.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,780
Like change where you sleep in the house, you know, or wherever you sleep.

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
Change your bed position, in other words.

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,240
Change your...

43
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,080
The diet, yeah.

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,640
Seasonal.

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,820
Right?

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,660
Right.

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,460
Just start switching everything around, and you should get better.

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,500
And nine, nine out of ten times, they did.

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,440
And take note, each time you make those changes, give a little time in between to see that, you know, that you're manifesting the right things, or things are still kum-si, kum-sa.

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:24,420
There's a surgeon, to give you an example, there's a surgeon that was diagnosed with cancer up in the north, central north, midwest, like in the Chicago area, let's say.

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,440
I don't want to get too specific.

53
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,140
And because they're so brainwashed, they kind of, you know, freaked out about it.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,680
And somehow they got, I got in touch with them, and I said, why don't you do that?

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
And about six months later, they were cancer free.

56
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,380
I'm not saying this is a cure for cancer.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm just saying I have that example, you know.

58
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,040
Yeah.

59
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:58,600
So, nonetheless, I wanted to maybe, because whenever I go out and interact with people, I was out at the shops a lot today, and I realized that people kind of freak out when you give them blanket statements.

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,200
And I think maybe more detail on that would be a good thing.

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,120
You know how I say there's no religion that does anything in their texts, and all that, right?

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,420
And you know, I make a lot of blanket statements.

63
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,600
Like attorneys don't know anything about law, doctors don't know anything about medicine.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,820
So most people don't like to hear that kind of stuff, because they're so entrenched.

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
That's all they have.

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:29,200
And they're always told how insecure the world is, and all of a sudden you're showing them that the things that they have full faith and credit in, and full faith and confidence in is also no good.

67
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
Now what, you know, they have nothing to stand on.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,720
So I wanted to give us a little bit more detail in that direction, what I mean by those blanket statements and clarify them.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,680
Right.

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,440
Yeah.

71
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
So you think anyone's going to come in?

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,420
In the meantime...

73
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,660
I don't know.

74
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
It's early.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,060
It's early.

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,900
Or unless they're shy.

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,620
You know, I know there will be a couple of them for sure.

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,520
And like I say, I had that gentleman called just a little while before, and so I'm sure that he will find out.

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,940
And folks, you are welcome to call in, and we'll sit here and chew the fat, as they say.

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,700
Mm-hmm.

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,620
Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,780
So, with the blanket statements, let's just, you could, I'll give a few examples.

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:22,180
We could either do, I'll let you pick, medicine, law, or religion, or money, or any one of those subjects.

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,820
Just pick one.

85
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,840
I'll go through how a blanket statement on that works.

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880
I'll do money.

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,380
Okay.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,640
Money.

89
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,220
Very simple.

90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,620
There's hardly anyone, if not anyone really, anymore that works in the banking system that knows anything about money.

91
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,060
Now, the final, or how it works, how the credit system works, and the final thing is, that has any moral character.

92
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:52,780
Because I have met, by the way, certain people that work in retail banks, and they just downright don't care that it's, you know, a sham, right?

93
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,480
Amazing.

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,900
So, what I mean by that is very simple.

95
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,900
If you go to a bank teller with a check and say, I'd like Federal Reserve notes for this, they freak out, and they get up, and they walk away, and they get the manager.

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,520
They don't know what you're talking about, but they're counting them out all day, right?

97
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,500
The other thing is, they offer all these products.

98
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,880
You ever notice when banks offer mortgages and loans, they're called financial products in the fine print.

99
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,420
So, there is no money in that respect.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,280
So the confusion on what they're doing is not even clear to them.

101
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,560
But essentially, a small percentage of the people that do work in that field, when they find out what's going on, quit.

102
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,460
So that one is an interesting one.

103
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:51,000
But there are, the thing about a blanket statement like that, there are all the people that remain in that for a long time.

104
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:58,000
It doesn't matter which one of these institutions that mankind deals with right now is, oh, ringers on high.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,420
Well, I should have probably muted that Dona Smith.

106
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,780
I'll go ahead and take this call, and go ahead, Rick.

107
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,020
They're either, I've said before, they're evil or ignorant throughout their entire career in it.

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:23,320
And what I mean by evil, for example, I have run into bankers that know that there is no money, and they're actually using your credit line, and they know that the system will back them up.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,540
And they do state that, say it doesn't matter.

110
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,180
You see, there is no, we don't need any just scales and measurements, and yeah, we'll just take all your stuff anyway.

111
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,420
Then you have the ones like the tellers that work at the banks that don't know what Federal Reserve notes are, and they're counting them out all day.

112
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:54,660
And then there's a third part where there's a group of people within that banking system that do find out what's going on, and then they want to leave, or they switch over and say, I'll just be evil.

113
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,880
I don't care about it.

114
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Yeah, we know that we didn't lend you anything, but we're going to come take your stuff anyway and give it to someone else.

115
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,520
You see, now that small group of people are the ones that usually you find in certain fields or former professions.

116
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,260
Like someone says, oh, I used to be an attorney.

117
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,620
Well, what happened?

118
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,480
Well, I don't want to talk about it.

119
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,100
Or they'll say something.

120
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
They'll say something.

121
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,260
Usually, I've had several of them say, well, the Bar Association, that's a very evil group.

122
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,100
I've had a couple of attorneys that I've met say that, right?

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,800
One says, I don't want to talk.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Then I run into another one who retired, knew what it was about, and came out of retirement and started another practice because he just liked fleecing people.

125
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh, God.

126
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,720
That's sad.

127
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,660
Oh, no, no, no.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
This is the reality of it.

129
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,820
Yeah, I know.

130
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,440
I know.

131
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,360
I know.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,660
And the same with the doctors.

133
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:52,880
When they work in medicine and they find out that what they're doing is not healthful, it's just emergency medicine gone wild.

134
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,320
It used to be in the Girls Gone Wild tapes.

135
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:05,380
OK, it doesn't matter if it's banking, religion, medicine, what they call law, the legal society, which includes police and all that also.

136
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:26,840
There's a small percentage of them that do find out what's going on, and then they're at a crossroads where it's, well, I either stay and go the evil route, throw everything out and just be predatory and manipulative and pranking because the system will back me up and the majority of people will never find out.

137
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,440
Or the other group says, well, I have to find an exit strategy.

138
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,640
I got all these years invested in this and I've got to get out.

139
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,799
What else am I going to do?

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,700
That's got to be a tough one.

141
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,799
That's very tough.

142
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,400
They usually stay in after they make that moral decision between six weeks and two years, typically six months to two years, and then they're out.

143
00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:05,280
So when I make these blanket statements, there's always a small group of people consistently finding out what they're involved in is just downright evil, I should say, and misrepresented.

144
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,820
Evil meaning the opposite of good.

145
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,740
And they're looking for an exit strategy.

146
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,840
They're like, oh, man, I've got to go pay these student loans now even though I'm not going to be working anymore.

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,100
I've got children to feed.

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,840
I've got to have all this other stuff.

149
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:31,180
And I have met quite a few people in law enforcement, legal society, medicine, and religion that have left once they found out what was going on.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,400
And I have met quite a few that are just – they know what they're doing is immoral and wrong, but they do it anyway because it's an easy way of life for them.

151
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:53,180
And I could say I've met many people that are ignorant about it, but I don't have to say that because just about everyone involved in those fields is ignorant, the great majority.

152
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,920
So we were basically – again, it goes back to the planet being inhabited by morons.

153
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,080
So these blanket statements are true, but I just wanted to give a little more detail, which I felt I have in the past as well.

154
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,960
I just wanted to give a little bit more depth.

155
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,200
And then, of course, you've got the adversary that's in control of the earth.

156
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,120
And then you've got the independent gods that are ruling over the countries.

157
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,420
Yes, that's pretty much the summation of it, yes.

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:28,940
Yeah.

159
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,900
You're just not going to win on that.

160
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,220
No, no, it's a matter of setting yourself apart.

161
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,460
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,360
And that's another subject unto itself.

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,700
Yeah, there's several ways.

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:57,800
There's a lot of people speaking in, especially in the Western – well, I should say Western even more than that – the American society about leaving the cities and living in the country or getting away from people's physics.

165
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,120
That'll set you apart, but you're still going to have some interaction.

166
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,640
Then you have the other way of setting yourself apart, being amongst them, but just not being like them, right?

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,260
Right.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,900
And it's a mindset.

169
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,740
It's discipline, learning, and practice, lots of practice.

170
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:32,240
Well, ultimately, the spirit, meaning the mind, when your personality makes you – that's going to be reprocessed in a different body in the future, and you'll probably have most of the memory, and I hate to call them lessons.

171
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,920
I think it's more of a process than a lesson, because most people just go to the grave as dumb as shit, to use that medical term, right?

172
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah.

173
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,240
And most people – and then the other people are the evil and the set-apart ones.

174
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,420
That's basically a very simple way to break down the whole group of what's on humanity.

175
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,600
There's several ways with different clichés.

176
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,020
There's two types of people, those who want to be left alone and those who won't leave them alone.

177
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,200
Lots of different ways to look at it.

178
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:11,180
But essentially, for the ones that go to the grave that are just completely clueless, which is the great majority, what kind of lesson did they get?

179
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,620
None, really, because they didn't know anything that was going on.

180
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,500
The only lesson they got, really, is basically you get hungry, you eat.

181
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,620
You sleep.

182
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,980
You want a comfortable bed.

183
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,000
When it's cold, you want to get warm.

184
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,860
When it's hot, you want to cool down.

185
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,480
I like the color blue, right?

186
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,820
I mean, that's pretty much it.

187
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,880
That's the depth and breadth of the character.

188
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:54,840
So the reason I'm saying it in this context is not to be condescending, but to say, let's subjectify the great majority of people that have been born, lived, and died here as being utterly clueless about anything that's going on, or what things are supposed to be based on, or anything lawful.

189
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,080
That'd be a good way of looking at it, yeah.

190
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Right.

191
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,280
People say, well, once your lessons are done here, then you can do...

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,600
What lessons did they get?

193
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,700
Right.

194
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,140
Nothing.

195
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,240
Nothing.

196
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
What lesson other than...

197
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,640
The only thing there would be the implementation of the Spirit in this incarnation.

198
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,340
And it wouldn't even be for their purpose.

199
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,100
Right.

200
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
Well, of course, they were serving...

201
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,420
It would have been for a higher purpose that we don't understand yet.

202
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,180
Right, right.

203
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,880
So here's an interesting thing to sum up.

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,540
I'm just kind of...

205
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,740
Dumb people are there for a higher purpose.

206
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,020
So anyway...

207
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,800
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,700
And I don't mean dumb, because a lot of these dumb people actually score very well on IQ tests, and are professors.

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,740
Well, ill-informed, still closed in the system.

210
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:51,940
And we had a question in chat about, could you speak more about the bar, which is always a fascinating subject.

211
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,680
Oh, boy, that's a mess.

212
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,640
Well, you want to look at it several ways.

213
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,800
First of all, it's a monopoly.

214
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,800
Second of all, it's a religious institution.

215
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,680
Third of all, it's an occult institution.

216
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,320
It's a schizophrenic institution.

217
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,760
It's an institution that misrepresents what they do in the field.

218
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:23,000
The bar members, and also those that support them, are boots on the ground representatives of the adversary.

219
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,980
It's even in the language.

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
So that's the easiest way.

221
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,560
There's someone that describes them as a closed union shop.

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,760
What they're doing, believe it or not, in the Bar Association, is completely illegal and unlawful.

223
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,280
But it's kind of like the organic food when you go to the market.

224
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,060
It's like, why do you have organic food in the market?

225
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,740
Well, so people can eat better.

226
00:14:49,740 --> 00:15:04,560
But what kind of a society would allow a great portion of the food or a great amount of the food to be toxified and not fit to eat, or who knows if it's fit to eat or good for them?

227
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,800
And then because of that situation, we're going to bring one that is organic.

228
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,560
That's a pretty – organic food does not sit – I mean, I prefer it, but it doesn't speak well for society at large.

229
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
How can you allow that?

230
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,220
Right.

231
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,580
You see?

232
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,420
So people talk about all of these political issues and all that and whatever.

233
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:40,640
And when it comes to the Bar Association, the way you deal with them is you can't deal with them from the top down because if you interact with their members and you go to the Bar Association, it's like, well, we have nothing to do with that.

234
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,500
You have to get an attorney.

235
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,240
Ha, ha, ha.

236
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:42,980
Right?

237
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,280
Right.

238
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,860
Or we'll consider it.

239
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,420
So then you have to go from the bottom up, you see?

240
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,440
Yeah.

241
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Like if you can't kick out the general, you take out the foot soldiers one at a time.

242
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,060
Right, right.

243
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,560
And the way you take them out is with you, you don't take them out physically.

244
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:11,240
You take them out spiritually with the mind and not by bringing them down, but by bringing yourself up, by finding out what the laws are.

245
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,940
And here's another blanket statement.

246
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,620
There are not any attorneys that know anything about law.

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:27,140
When I say anything, meaning when you just pick one law, it doesn't stand on its own because it's attached to definitions and it's part of another series of codes and things.

248
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:45,220
So when these attorneys understand the definitions and the series of codes that a law forms with, now they know the law, they will get disbarred because you can pick up, let's say very simply, someone crosses – I'll sort of change this a little bit.

249
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's just say it's based on a true story.

250
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,860
Someone crosses the border from Canada into the U.S. with a duffel bag full of that green stuff that everyone smokes, right?

251
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,680
Or they're saying that they want it legalized, right?

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,960
So he gets busted by the Canadian side, but they decide to let him go to the American side anyways, and the Americans bust him, right?

253
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,839
I mean the Canadian side knew he had it, but they let the Americans deal with it.

254
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,540
So they run him through an arraignment, all this stuff.

255
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,260
They're going to get him 10 years in jail and all this stuff because it's like 35, 40 pounds, right?

256
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:31,520
And he gets an attorney who says basically according to public law 9-whatever-whatever, Title 21, which is possession, has been repealed.

257
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:42,760
And he goes in front of the judge with the attorney that says that, and the judge says, I never heard of that, and if you say that again, I'm going to put you up for review.

258
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
That's what the judge tells the attorney, right?

259
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,560
So what kind of a defense does he have then?

260
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,160
Yeah, he's guilty or not guilty for drug possession.

261
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,420
The whole thing has been repealed.

262
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,660
So now that attorney gets disbarred, he loses his ability to operate.

263
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,460
He's not a license, you see?

264
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,280
There's no attorney on the planet that's going to go in front of a judge and tell the judge to represent you according to the law.

265
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,000
What they all say is just do what the judge says.

266
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,440
And they always put in a non-guilty plea.

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:19,980
You know why?

268
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,000
Because in the justice courts, any plea entered is admitting that the charges are true.

269
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,620
Right.

270
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Immediately.

271
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:45,380
Yeah, so I've heard also there was an attorney that brought up the U.S. bankruptcy, a place in Ohio, an attorney in Ohio, two of them, brought up the U.S. bankruptcy and its inability to pay on a foreclosure case, and they got disbarred for doing that.

272
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,490
Now a bar is not a license to practice law.

273
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,990
It's that you're a member.

274
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,810
But what happens is the state supreme court is not really a state supreme court.

275
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,510
It is a state supreme bar court.

276
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,730
They gave themselves permission or a license.

277
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,650
Yeah, and there's no record of that whatsoever.

278
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,210
No, there isn't.

279
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,670
So this is not on them.

280
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,550
Who cares what they do?

281
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:21,010
Essentially, it's like saying we have a locust swarm coming through here and it's going to just decimate everything, which would take one-tenth of everything, right?

282
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,470
Let's talk about locusts.

283
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,030
What are they?

284
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,010
At this point, you'd better focus on protecting yourself and your property from these things.

285
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,910
It's a little late.

286
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,130
Yeah.

287
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,770
Do you see what I mean?

288
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,310
Yeah.

289
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,590
It's like you fall overboard and there are sharks in the water.

290
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,210
Well, let's talk about what sharks are.

291
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,330
Well, I think get yourself out of the water first, and then we'll talk about sharks because you don't want to find out firsthand.

292
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,870
No, no.

293
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,650
Same thing with the medical society.

294
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,770
The same thing with the religious society.

295
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,970
I mean it just goes – accountants are also like that, really talk about.

296
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,570
So you find yourself on this planet, right?

297
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,150
And then you find yourself wanting to gather information.

298
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,710
And when you prioritize the level of importance or the priority of the quality of that information, you'll find that no one knows what's there.

299
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,070
Most people are on the secondary or tertiary, third step away from it.

300
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,030
See, most people would say you need law.

301
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,710
That's an attorney.

302
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,690
Oh, no, sorry.

303
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,710
That doesn't work.

304
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,030
Well, unless he's going to get disbarred tomorrow after he talks if you get him to.

305
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,930
So the same with a doctor.

306
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:43,770
Ask a doctor, any doctor, when you put your feet and your toes or your hands in water, why does the skin shrivel up?

307
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,070
Oh, boy.

308
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,750
You want to see like the rabbit in the hat look?

309
00:20:49,630 --> 00:21:01,650
And you know if any of them speak out in the trade that they're in and admit in any way, shape, or form that goes contrary to what has normally been established, you're done.

310
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,950
You guys will find a different job.

311
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,390
They are, yeah.

312
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,670
Right, right.

313
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:19,070
Most likely they will meet a brutal either – yeah, they'll either be excommunicated because it's a religious thing, and then it will go downhill from there.

314
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,050
If they persist, they could get physical harm done to them as well.

315
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,690
That's basically any field.

316
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,610
The automotive industry is the same, by the way.

317
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,910
Amazing how that kind of turned around, huh?

318
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:41,430
I discussed an aircraft propulsion system that worked really well, and the faster you went, the less fuel you used, and it was totally silent.

319
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:50,710
And I had a retired aircraft structures engineer tell me, we'll never do that because it doesn't make any noise.

320
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,730
Right.

321
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:55,950
Yeah.

322
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,150
Oh, my.

323
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,530
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:06,710
And I've had a retired spark plug person tell me, we'll never use those spark plugs because you have to have some pollution.

325
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,750
In other words, when you improve the spark plug design, the emissions go down almost to nothing.

326
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,070
Right.

327
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:11,650
Right.

328
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,950
You can't have that.

329
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,410
So after a while, you have to relax about it and don't take it personally.

330
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:29,970
You have to say to yourself, okay, these people on this planet, it doesn't matter what country you're in or when you lived, right, this is really not a good place.

331
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,670
And you know what?

332
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,070
If you read the ancient holy writs, they tell you it's not a good place.

333
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,030
Yes.

334
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:41,590
That's why people don't understand it because they don't understand everything else around them.

335
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,410
And Vandy just pointed out construction is the same way.

336
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,170
Most of your fields, your biggies out there are getting that way.

337
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:50,690
Oh, yeah.

338
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,050
And that just also tells you that the gods are doing a really good job.

339
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,430
Yeah.

340
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,230
The ones that are not doing a good job are doing a good job.

341
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,210
In other words, they're doing what they're not supposed to be doing.

342
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:04,950
Right.

343
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,550
Right.

344
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,470
And the interesting thing is don't take it personally because it's not personal.

345
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:19,610
In other words, this was set this way, including you being here, before you even thought of it or thought of or heard anything like this.

346
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:31,330
Just to go back to the way people listen and to information, like when I go on The Rectangle, sometimes I have someone here and listen to it all, so we just crack up, and it's a serious subject matter.

347
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,110
They'll be like, quote-unquote, whistleblowers talking about something or a doctor.

348
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:52,930
Mainstream is even – I mean I'll just laugh and turn it off with the mainstream stuff, but the alternative stuff I'll just keep laughing and leave it on a little bit longer because you've got to give them a little bit of – a little more leeway.

349
00:23:53,070 --> 00:24:04,770
And the reason why you give the alternative stuff, the YouTube videos and all the websites and all that stuff out there a little more time is because you know they're not bestowed or beholden to an institution.

350
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:13,170
Usually you don't have someone do a website regarding, let's say, GMO food in the mainstream.

351
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,730
They'll be positive for it, and then you've got to just laugh and turn it off.

352
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,870
The alternative, they'll be against it, but you still laugh because they don't know what the hell they're talking about.

353
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,370
But you've got to give them a little more time because you know they're not going to get fired for talking about it.

354
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:38,010
So in other words, here's a human or a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant who's unabated, free to speak, and this is all he's got.

355
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,810
And he hasn't even – doesn't even – yeah, you see?

356
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,210
And it's just stupid.

357
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:55,030
So – and also half the references the alternative guys make are the bullshit that the mainstream came up from, the bullshit science and the bullshit medicine, right?

358
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,930
Talking about viruses and this and that and DNA and all this other stuff, right?

359
00:24:59,490 --> 00:24:59,750
Right.

360
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:09,370
I'm not going to get into this much because after a while you realize, ah, just harp on the important stuff, but all of it is really junk.

361
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,310
They say, oh, the DNA is so important.

362
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,950
RNA is so important.

363
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,510
There's a double helix, all this.

364
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,830
They try to make it sound so important.

365
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,130
So the efficacy of it and its importance in the organism, right?

366
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:34,110
Well, and if it wasn't them, if it wasn't them, then you'd have these other – the spiritualists out there who are, you know, it's the golden mean ratio and all this other good stuff.

367
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,350
Sure.

368
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,570
Yeah, it just goes.

369
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,910
But just back to the DNA, if anyone wants to look into it, you know, there's a little motor in the mitochondria that produces it, right, very rapidly.

370
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:49,250
And if you study that motor, it moves at, you know, the equivalent of 200 miles per hour if it was in our scale, right?

371
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,010
Yeah.

372
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,730
And everyone is talking about it.

373
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,530
You know, no one is talking about triple helix stuff that's in there also.

374
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,310
Isn't that funny?

375
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,870
You could probably research it.

376
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,990
I don't know how much is online.

377
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,790
What is the triple helix other than the – there's the double helix.

378
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,170
But no one is talking about the triple helix proteins.

379
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,170
What about those?

380
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,810
They get ignored.

381
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:25,050
Okay, so my point here is when you start bringing up a subject, you know, what is going to happen is, you know, you can't bring it up if you know it's not correct.

382
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:33,990
Speaking about it, if someone just listens to you for a moment, they think you're just another schmuck talking about, you know, whatever they're used to hearing, right?

383
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:45,230
So in some cases, some of the scientific stuff, what they call science, what is best left alone because ultimately that's not what allows you to stand up and walk across the room.

384
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,990
Again, ask any scientist or medic.

385
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:56,650
Like, for example, I was conveying in the engine-driven wagon today and NPR or something had science Friday, they call it.

386
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,610
Oh, I just had to roll down the windows because my own laughing was making my own ears ring, right?

387
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,790
Complete morons.

388
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,430
But, you know, obviously they're speaking to an audience that's even more moronic.

389
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,510
So obviously it's going to sound smart.

390
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,190
But the thing is you ask any of those idiots, well, what does it take for you to get up and walk across the room?

391
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,790
They don't know.

392
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,850
Or ultimately, you know, what keeps you alive?

393
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,490
They don't know.

394
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:26,470
You put 10 of them in the room, you'll get 10 different answers, you know, or some might be similar.

395
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,350
So they all can't be correct.

396
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,170
Either they're all wrong or only one is right.

397
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,350
In this case, they're all wrong.

398
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,570
You see?

399
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,810
It's like putting 10 attorneys in a room and ask them how should I handle this case.

400
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,050
I'll tell you right now, they're all wrong.

401
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,550
I don't have to know who they are.

402
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,090
That's obvious.

403
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:52,110
Put 10 priests, 10 pastors or whatever in a room or even the Pope himself and ask him a biblical question.

404
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,830
I don't need to know what the question is or what they say to tell you they're wrong.

405
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,070
Why?

406
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,770
Because this is how far gone down the line it is, you see?

407
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,810
It's too far down the line.

408
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:12,090
See, if, let's say, put the Pope and all these other pastors and ministers in a room and the priests, if you did that 500 years ago, they wouldn't even consider answering.

409
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:20,040
They would just threaten your life, you see, because it was critical for the political system back then.

410
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,220
Right.

411
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,780
Let's see.

412
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,260
We might have someone wanting to join.

413
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,880
I'll drag them in.

414
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,040
I think it's, let's see, it's Vandy, I think.

415
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll drag them in and I'll just say he just messaged.

416
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,850
Might be having Eddie call in pretty soon, too.

417
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,190
Okay.

418
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,950
All right.

419
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,910
So, so these things are important.

420
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,130
And the thing is, you must maintain a light heart about it.

421
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:21,010
Some kind of perspective that doesn't allow you to allow it to get under your skin and make you feel angry or rough about the situation.

422
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,530
Because if there's anyone to be upset about, it's your parents.

423
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,090
And that's a common thing, too.

424
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,350
Yeah.

425
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,190
And there's the other higher level is, you know, the God that brought you here.

426
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,070
But just don't do it publicly.

427
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,330
You know, if you've got a beef with him, he's willing to hear it.

428
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,870
And later on we're going to find out why we didn't speak to the gods more.

429
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,770
They were always hanging around waiting and listening to us, right?

430
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,490
Yeah, and we don't talk.

431
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,490
Yeah, and they can listen to more than one conversation at the same time.

432
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,710
So get a frequent dialogue.

433
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,810
At least it's going to be a monologue.

434
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,670
You know, I like, for example, there was a Transformers movie a few years ago.

435
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,690
Not that I like the movie.

436
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,990
Everything that comes out of Hollywood is garbage right now.

437
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,750
Because why?

438
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,230
Not because they don't know how to make good movies.

439
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,310
Because where's the audience, right?

440
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,750
One of the Transformers, he spoke by what was on the radio.

441
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,750
If you ask him a question, he just tuned to the radio station that gave the answer, right, in little bits and pieces.

442
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,810
I don't know if you remember that.

443
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,950
I think it was the yellow one, the front one.

444
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,990
So you will get some kind of a response.

445
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:36,570
So we're joined also by, I think, Vandy in Demonsland, and he's muted, I think.

446
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,650
So that's fine.

447
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,750
So that's pretty much the hash on the broad brush strokes right now.

448
00:30:47,530 --> 00:31:04,890
There's always an exception, but it doesn't take away from the statement not being true, in essence, because essentially when the people that find out what's going on in any of these institutions leave, you're left with the ignorant and the evil, right?

449
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:11,230
When I say evil, it's not the imitation Hollywood evil thing, you know, whatever.

450
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,670
Evil just means the opposite than good.

451
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,220
Oh, somebody's puppy.

452
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,660
Yeah.

453
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,060
An interesting example would be what they call the food markets.

454
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,560
You have a choice between good and evil, right?

455
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,340
Let's say organic versus non-organic, right?

456
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,540
It's interesting and ironic almost how this choice is being put in front of us.

457
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,140
Where years ago it wasn't.

458
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,480
It was all good.

459
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,040
All the apples were good.

460
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:41,660
Yeah.

461
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,540
There weren't as good this year.

462
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,300
There was no choice of evil and good, meaning evil potentially spread and GMO'd versus good, which is not.

463
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,360
Doesn't that bring back the story of good versus evil or the knowledge of good back into this society?

464
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
I think it never has been.

465
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:09,580
This might be the first time that what I know it is through recorded history that you have a choice between good apples and bad apples at the market.

466
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,540
You know, organic versus non-organic.

467
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,500
It's a precedent.

468
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:23,470
So society has allowed that to happen or the gods behind it, I should say.

469
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:23,910
Yeah.

470
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,990
Yeah, because it had to start somewhere and then trickle down.

471
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:36,230
And I think the human population in some ways is really just the effects of what the gods have given them.

472
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,590
Sure.

473
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,690
And within that, what they do is they give you a ship, what you do on the ship.

474
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:48,230
And then they have to, like if someone's doing something they shouldn't be doing on a ship or too much of something that spreads, then the gods step in backwards.

475
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,490
In other words, we do things here, then the gods have to come and change it a little bit.

476
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,290
Little tweak.

477
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,010
If necessary.

478
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,910
Or they'll either tweak it or boost it.

479
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:58,810
Yeah.

480
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,830
A lot of times it's boost.

481
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,730
And you get your butt handed to you sometimes.

482
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,790
Builds character, though.

483
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,190
Yeah, they have diminished much of the ability of humans to see.

484
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,710
Again, the cosmic censorship is still pretty thick.

485
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:26,630
And that's going to be a curious anomaly to watch that open up on certain subjects to allow for a more lawful perception of the gods.

486
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,710
Because right now, you know, most people's perception of the gods and even themselves is completely unlawful.

487
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,190
Yes.

488
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:34,970
Oh, yes.

489
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,470
Completely unlawful.

490
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:37,530
Yeah.

491
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,940
So no one else yet.

492
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,860
We lost Vandy.

493
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,660
And let's see here how long we've been going.

494
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,360
Yeah, we're about half over.

495
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,700
Yeah.

496
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,440
Okay.

497
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,880
Well, I thought I was thinking of springing up a stream or a round, like what you call a round table.

498
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:57,640
Yeah.

499
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,500
To see if I'll come around.

500
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,340
Well, it's still early, yeah.

501
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,280
And we have a few people that are sitting on, definitely listening.

502
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,480
Let's just see.

503
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,580
Take a quick here.

504
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,860
We've got about seven or eight.

505
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,260
Okay.

506
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,100
Which is a good start.

507
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,659
And I'm popping in messages once in a while.

508
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,400
Let them know that we're.

509
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,989
Good.

510
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:40,550
So the pervasiveness of how the same, let's say the undercurrent of this evilness and just blocked censorship and pervade, you know, this is the falseness of any field, whether it's money, religion, science, medicine, law, anything, you know, food.

511
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,790
You find it in just about everything that's institutionalized.

512
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,770
And even that word institutional doesn't sound good because of that.

513
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,190
It's not by chance.

514
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:02,090
It's a setup, you know, and you're not going to change it.

515
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
It will change.

516
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,110
It will change.

517
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,210
Actually, it will change.

518
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,270
They want it to change.

519
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,530
Sure.

520
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,270
Sure.

521
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,830
And the people also.

522
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,690
See, when some of the censorship is lifted, certain things will change.

523
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:16,750
Great.

524
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,210
Great.

525
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:18,770
Trickle down.

526
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:29,630
A few other things, perhaps, to bring up with, you know, things that are coming, because this is, I keep saying this was a springtime.

527
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,750
Yes.

528
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,330
Yes.

529
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:56,710
But also to consider, just to go back with the, when I bring up all these various institutions and the censorship, when the censorship is lifted, you're going to see more people, you know, their perception of these institutions changing and either going away from them or changing those institutions.

530
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,250
So, so it's not, you know, these things are not in stone.

531
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,050
I mean, it's still unbe able to table.

532
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:12,190
In other words, it's still not going to be fixed to the point where it'll be around and, you know, and then in the world to come at all.

533
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:18,410
But it'll be able to allow, you know, more of a lawful perception of of the gods.

534
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:32,390
And that's, that's one other thing that when you, when you discuss the coming Middle East Union, when you discuss, you know, the 15 years or 14 years we have left, you know, as a society as it is.

535
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,650
That has to do with the gods at this point.

536
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,870
You know, I heard someone recently said, oh, yeah, the, the, the people that, you know, made us love us enough.

537
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,070
They're not going to let asteroids hit.

538
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,350
They're not going to destroy everyone.

539
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,290
I said, no, they're not going to destroy everyone.

540
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,490
But they're sure going to open a big can of whoop ass.

541
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,230
And they're, they have very low regard for physical things, by the way, the gods.

542
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,310
They do know that's how.

543
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,250
And they're rather targeted about it too.

544
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:58,970
Yeah.

545
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,070
I mean, when you read about some of the things.

546
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,570
Well, you know, different people.

547
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:17,150
If I remember correctly, if I'm wrong, but you're the wrath will be something on the order of what you've what what you've put in what you reap what you sow.

548
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,450
I guess was what it really boiled down to.

549
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:20,930
Sure.

550
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,910
But the interesting thing about this is that it's going to be brought upon the entire environment.

551
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,390
So those that were selling well and reaping well are still going to get a whoop ass.

552
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,390
Yeah.

553
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,890
That's why I keep saying don't take it personally.

554
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,870
And I think it's going to affect, you know, how much of lawful timekeeping affects knowledge of the gods.

555
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,450
You know, that's something because there's a mention of the times changing, which means different things are actually.

556
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,450
I want to bring up another point since I just brought up the timekeeping thing.

557
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:59,310
I noticed there was always comments about timekeeping, and I realized someone is actually counting the days, and that's a good one.

558
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,130
I think 301 days for this year so far.

559
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,830
Yeah.

560
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:09,410
What's interesting is what you will hear with the pagan, the non-lawful timekeeping.

561
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,650
You hear this everywhere on the street, on the rectangle, people you know.

562
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,270
Usually when it approaches the end of the year, especially they'll say, oh, it's December and the year is over already.

563
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,490
Where did the year go?

564
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,830
You ever hear that?

565
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,670
Oh, yeah.

566
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,250
Yeah.

567
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,250
Now that sounds like because everyone is saying it or it's a cliche and you're used to it.

568
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,510
It's been said for a long time, and you've always heard it.

569
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,990
It should be just discounted as just one of those fluffy sayings, but it's not.

570
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,670
Let's analyze that for a minute.

571
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:54,470
What's going on there is the psyche is trying to reach out in a pleasant way towards the subject, not in a negative way because they don't know any other way.

572
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,970
It's like when you think of law, you think of an attorney.

573
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:04,390
You have to think of them pleasantly because you know nothing about any other way.

574
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,150
Right.

575
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:13,710
If they don't know the law and they've got you believing that they're the ones you go to for the law, how the hell are you ever going to learn the law?

576
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,430
That's their profession.

577
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:16,230
Yeah.

578
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:16,930
Right?

579
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,690
You see?

580
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,510
That's very simple.

581
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,290
You just have to read.

582
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:24,130
So what happens when people are saying towards the end of the year, oh, look, the whole year is gone.

583
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,470
2017 is gone already.

584
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,390
It's already December.

585
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,470
They're trying to keep that pleasant because they don't know what's going on at all.

586
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,410
They're completely removed because, you know, you could say, hey, OK, idiot.

587
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,750
Decem means 10.

588
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,710
How many?

589
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,170
How many months are in a year?

590
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,350
You see?

591
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,490
That should raise a question.

592
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,010
Hey, moron.

593
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,650
Novum means nine.

594
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,810
Octo means eight.

595
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,950
Like Octopussy.

596
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,210
You've seen the movie, right?

597
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,550
Yeah.

598
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:55,730
Yeah.

599
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,570
OK, so what are you talking about?

600
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,270
Oh, well, I don't get it.

601
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,930
Yeah, that's right.

602
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,890
You don't get it.

603
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,230
And you never, ever will.

604
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,730
So what's happening is they know something is wrong.

605
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,550
How many times you hear this?

606
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,970
I know there's something really wrong.

607
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,210
I just don't know what it is or what's coming next.

608
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,410
Right?

609
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,850
You hear that all the time.

610
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,670
Yes.

611
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,110
That's not a that is.

612
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,690
And why does no one address?

613
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,930
They'll just.

614
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,870
Oh, yeah.

615
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,410
We'll just hold hands and agree.

616
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,010
I just when I do interviews and people say, I agree with you on that.

617
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,690
Oh, I'm like, wait a second.

618
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,550
Does that mean that if you disagreed, it was wrong?

619
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,390
Who cares if you agree with or don't agree with?

620
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,590
Most people are not used to hearing anything objective.

621
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,190
At all.

622
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:44,910
Yeah.

623
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:45,830
Yeah.

624
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:46,770
Ever.

625
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:52,930
They're going to go to their grave and back to the worms, and they will have never heard anything objective in their entire lives.

626
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:58,110
And not heard it, but processed or being able to work something through objectivity.

627
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,610
Felt it.

628
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,110
Yes.

629
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,610
And no.

630
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,950
It's pretty scary.

631
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:02,870
It is.

632
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,090
So I wanted the reason I brought I see this with every subject all the time.

633
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:14,050
I brought up the timekeeping thing because this it's within the the recent history here.

634
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,230
Oh, it's December 2017.

635
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,210
Look how fast the year went by.

636
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,570
You know, they're crying out.

637
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,530
Like help us, but we can't be helped at the same time.

638
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,210
Right.

639
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,090
Because because, you know, there are a lot that will just turn you off right away or change the subject.

640
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:32,830
Yeah.

641
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,610
And so the spirit is trying.

642
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,510
But the mind is just pooched.

643
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:39,690
Yeah.

644
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,530
And the only reason the spirit is trying is because it comes from the same source.

645
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,630
And that source is a true source.

646
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,130
Yes.

647
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:47,530
Yes.

648
00:41:48,210 --> 00:42:00,370
It's just like you can take, you know, a wheel off of any Chrysler vehicle pretty much of the same body chassis, even though, you know, or a Dodge and a Chrysler, they're interchangeable because they come from the same thing.

649
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,450
Same with Toyota parts.

650
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,390
You know, you can take from the same class, you know, or size.

651
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,150
Yeah.

652
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:16,210
Most of them are interchangeable because you see, because so it just shows that they have a common source, but it also shows the effect on them.

653
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,610
Right.

654
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,450
So I just want to bring that up because it's with everything.

655
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,530
Today I spoke to a woman.

656
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,390
She goes, I have Crohn's disease in my doctors.

657
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,350
I said, Whoa, whoa, whoa.

658
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,350
Hold on.

659
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,090
Let's start all over.

660
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,530
Is that okay?

661
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:26,850
She goes.

662
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,890
She goes, Yeah, it's okay.

663
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:34,570
I said, Okay, you were diagnosed with Crohn's disease by a doctor.

664
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,030
Are you sure he's your doctor?

665
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,670
Like, where can I get one on my own?

666
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,550
Or does he see you the only one that he sees?

667
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,050
She goes, Yeah, that's right.

668
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,970
You see, that's just the start of it.

669
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,990
Yeah.

670
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:49,450
Yeah.

671
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,770
I have diabetes.

672
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:52,970
They say.

673
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:53,230
Right.

674
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,550
And I said, No, no.

675
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,110
Hold on.

676
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,010
Can we start all over?

677
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,330
Yeah.

678
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,650
You were diagnosed with diabetes.

679
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,310
You get it?

680
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,970
Big difference.

681
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,710
Big difference.

682
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,530
I have high blood pressure.

683
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,610
Now, hold on.

684
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,010
I won't even say you were diagnosed with high blood pressure on that one.

685
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:16,770
Yeah.

686
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,430
That's the magic cuff syndrome right there.

687
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,010
You got had big time.

688
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,390
The sticky on her.

689
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,650
Yeah.

690
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,970
You got 10% of the people in this country just, you know, ready.

691
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,270
You know, they're goners.

692
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,150
How do I know?

693
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,030
High blood pressure.

694
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:42,090
And I think one time you and I touched on the fact of how lonely people are that they'll just accept this stuff.

695
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,710
Yep.

696
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,810
You know, just because they're in contact with something.

697
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,390
Well, they're lonely also on many levels.

698
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,070
They think that human contact is the only thing there is.

699
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,770
They're not aware of lawfulness of the gods.

700
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,430
They're not aware of.

701
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,010
Oh, yes.

702
00:43:59,390 --> 00:43:59,590
Yeah.

703
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:10,000
So, in essence, it's a crazy game, but there's no prize.

704
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,800
You know, as the old saying, when you play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

705
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,560
Yeah.

706
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,680
That's exactly what's going on.

707
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,200
Very simple.

708
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Now, there was something else we were going to bring up, I guess, so no one else has come on.

709
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,980
But you mentioned about the Tai Chi and all that.

710
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,780
And I diverted in saying that I always like to discuss things that are.

711
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,180
Yes.

712
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,800
Yes.

713
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,000
Regarding what people can contact.

714
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:45,800
When you start discussing an element of, let's say, movement or, you know, like Tai Chi, people, you know, are always looking to find, well, I have to learn it.

715
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,480
Well, yeah, you do, again, like the diagnosis, yes, Tai Chi.

716
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,000
But you're doing – everyone is doing it anyway because how do I know you're alive, right?

717
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,700
Right.

718
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,340
You're alive and you're moving.

719
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,260
It's that same energy that is moving you around.

720
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,940
It's the same energy if you understand how to put it in a can.

721
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,880
You could use it to change weather or shake the ground or move meteorites in space and all that stuff, right?

722
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,820
So, it's that same force.

723
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,640
It's just that your body picks it up differently.

724
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:22,880
And if you understand how your body is picking it up and manipulating it or using it or it's going through you, now you're conscious of it, now what are you going to do?

725
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,380
You know, it's the difference between being asleep behind the wheel or being conscious when you're going down the road.

726
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,180
Big difference.

727
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,440
Big difference.

728
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,580
What I mean by – you could still go down the road if you fall asleep.

729
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,820
I've actually done it.

730
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,900
I've actually fallen asleep on the highway and woke up and I was fine.

731
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,500
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

732
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,920
I would say anywhere from one second to 15, 20 seconds, let's say, right?

733
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,540
Who knows?

734
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,620
You'll be cleaning the wrong 25 out of your shorts on that one.

735
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Yeah, right.

736
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,240
So, but spending your whole life asleep, I don't know about that.

737
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:13,340
And the old masters, especially the ones that we were tossing about in chat, those masters took the time, the discipline, the practice.

738
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,740
They started understanding what was out there.

739
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,020
But the time is a matter of who you are and it's up to you.

740
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,640
Some people could learn it in six weeks.

741
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,280
Some people could learn it in six years.

742
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:40,720
Now, what it is, that's also – the Tai Chi Chuang, that's as that school is, let's say, identified, was around 1000 A.D. from a master in that part of the world.

743
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:49,260
What I like to discuss is the manipulation of this energy was around before, all the way since the beginning of mankind.

744
00:46:49,260 --> 00:47:02,340
And I would even say that pre-flood people and not even pre-flood people but just people in the past walked differently, stood differently, spoke differently, meaning the way regardless of language.

745
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,520
Their posture was different.

746
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,620
The way they handled things in the physical realm with their bodies was different.

747
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,640
One simple way to look at that is look at how the geometry of the tools were made.

748
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,160
Very different, right?

749
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:27,280
Have you ever noticed that in the past, even if you couldn't afford exquisite or fine things, there was some embellishment always done on stuff.

750
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,560
It always had a little bit of a curve.

751
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,240
It always had some kind of a marking.

752
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,660
It had some kind of an artistic visual, something to smooth it out into the environment, right, if you look at how things were made in the past.

753
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,920
And that had to do with they understood this energy flow, right?

754
00:47:44,320 --> 00:48:00,920
So, I would suggest that there is, if you want to call it movement of the body for just getting out of bed, working in the field, or even self-defense or fighting, it was always done slightly, well, let's say different than it is today.

755
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,700
Right.

756
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,280
So how were they doing it back then?

757
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:20,300
I also put in a video with Lars Anderson, the archer, who redefined archery by looking at ancient artwork and what's been memorialized about the posture and how the arrows were held of archers, right?

758
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,280
Yeah.

759
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,540
And also, of course, what does the establishment do?

760
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,860
That's trick archery, like trick shooting.

761
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,540
Well, I definitely want a trick shooter to be a bodyguard.

762
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,980
Yeah, oh yeah.

763
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,740
Or whatever.

764
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,980
Or like Bruce Lee was a trick martial artist or something.

765
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,200
Right.

766
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:48,440
So these people, I mean, the comments, I think the merit should be obvious when you see it.

767
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
Yes, yes.

768
00:48:49,800 --> 00:49:04,720
In terms of the body movements and all of that, if you look at ancient statuary, even how vases were painted, how people were depicted in artwork, how, and again, statuary would be probably the easiest, you know, ancient statuary.

769
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,900
One thing that stands out is they were very proud of who and what.

770
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,140
They were always upright, very structurally sound, I should say.

771
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,300
Yes, sort of.

772
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:24,040
But I would say if you look at, if you understand how energy flows, it has to do with how the joints are managed.

773
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,240
Yes.

774
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,640
You always see the joints were always bent.

775
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:40,040
And they were centered and they were not, the only time you see the very vertical postures is against the Egyptian temples.

776
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,160
Yeah.

777
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,880
Or the Oracle temple, where they had the back against the stone.

778
00:49:44,880 --> 00:50:07,020
But the actual, I would suggest, what's been memorialized about the movements of people, again, on certain statuary vases and drawings next to inscriptions, you will see there was a fluid movement unlike what you see or consider to be a posture today.

779
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,020
Yes.

780
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,720
For everyday movements.

781
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:20,830
Remember when you brought that up about the Master who was borrowing the Chi from another person in order to manipulate?

782
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:21,390
Yes, that's how it's done.

783
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,050
Yeah.

784
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,650
And there are no videos on YouTube that discuss that.

785
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,050
No, no.

786
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,950
And there's a reason for that.

787
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,550
I'm not going to be, put it this way, I'm not going to be the first one in public to do it either.

788
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,410
Gotcha.

789
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,260
Well, I've done that in private.

790
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,000
Let's just say that.

791
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,140
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,700
Well, think of it this way.

793
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,540
I also put the question in chat.

794
00:50:49,500 --> 00:51:05,920
From whatever partly, see, you know, partly some, meaning a little bit of what you can glean off of the rectangle or even reading books about this, what they do is they tell you, give you technique in what's going on, but they don't give the specifics on how you actually do it.

795
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,340
Right.

796
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,600
Like give you, for example, Trevor James Constable, Will M.

797
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,320
Wright would talk about whether work, but they don't tell you exactly how to do it.

798
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,360
And so there's a bunch of stuff on the internet, but that's not, you try that.

799
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,240
It might maybe work a little bit, but you'll, it'll just be a passing hobby or whatever.

800
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,100
Or you'll turn on the TV and it's like, why did I just drown 100,000 people?

801
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,260
You know, or something like that.

802
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:28,640
Yeah.

803
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:38,520
It's not, it's not something that the fine points on why these things work, and how they work are happening discussed on the rectangle, period.

804
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:50,200
But it's one of the comments I put on there is that when you do listen to all of these guys anyway they tell you it's all external isn't it.

805
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,120
No, every one of them.

806
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,380
Right.

807
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,200
Well, yeah.

808
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:00,300
So, because it's all external, what are you doing thinking about what you're going to do?

809
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,840
Why don't you start thinking about what you're going to do with these external forces.

810
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,840
But, it's hard not to take it personally in this case because that's what's keeping you alive when you get down to the chi, right?

811
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,760
Right, right.

812
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:30,920
So, and also the other thing you have to remember is if anyone listening has ever done anything that they were considering themselves good at, you know, like a discipline, let's say playing an instrument, a sport, what have you.

813
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,840
If you don't do it for a few days, what happens?

814
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,380
You regress slightly, don't you?

815
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:36,740
Right?

816
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,240
Bodybuilding or sports are excellent example.

817
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:47,360
Sometimes it's good to take a few days off or a week off, but if you don't do it every day as a discipline, you'll notice that it regresses.

818
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,400
But what happens though, I'll give you an example with professional cycling.

819
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,420
It takes years to get there unless you're a natural.

820
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,360
I've met some people that are complete naturals.

821
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,620
They never really trained, but they did get into a training regimen because once they were recruited, of course, they're going to train.

822
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,740
But what I'm saying is they achieved that high level without a lot of grooming and a lot of investment.

823
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,880
And the same with music like Yo-Yo Ma, right?

824
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,760
Played the cello at Fork or played concerts at 10 and all that sort of stuff.

825
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,200
Maybe I got the same guy right.

826
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,540
But anyway, what will happen is once you learn a discipline and you get at the top of the field, you have what's called a memory.

827
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:33,880
So even though you haven't done it in weeks, months or years, even many years, if you decide to get back into it, it will take you much less time to get up to that level.

828
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,640
You may never attain that peak because let's say you're much older now.

829
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:47,300
You don't recover as fast as when you were younger, but you will have imprinted in you the techniques, things that you almost can't explain, but you know how to do.

830
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,820
And you will achieve a very high level again in a short period of time.

831
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,780
Let's say I've noticed this with cyclists and bodybuilders and people in the sports, usually 30 to 60 days.

832
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:03,340
They can get the best they could ever be at that point where a novice getting into that field would take a year or two.

833
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,520
Oh, easily.

834
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,280
Easily.

835
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,060
So another example would be you can take a professional musician who hasn't played the instrument in a few years.

836
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:18,840
In 30 days of practice, he will be where a novice wouldn't be in 2 or 3 or 4 years because you have an imprint in you already.

837
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,180
Yes.

838
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,760
Yes.

839
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,960
So when we go back to the Tai Chi and all that, and Tai Chi just means the energy around you.

840
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:41,540
I mean I don't like using the Star Wars reference, but if there's anything in Hollywood that ever exhibited that more than any other, let's say, thing that people – you can mention and people understand what you're referring to, it would be Star Wars, the Force, right?

841
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,040
Yeah.

842
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,140
Good visual.

843
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,200
That's exactly what the Chi is.

844
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:54,740
But they don't see – because they didn't know what it was also to the extent – or they're holding back how anyone and everyone can access it.

845
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:04,500
And also you see the Jedi were trained to be such unless you had a natural inkling, which they're using occulted demonic terms from Hindu references, by the way.

846
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,660
Jedi is a demon, right?

847
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,180
Right.

848
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,060
If you study the Hindi culture.

849
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:16,780
And within the Hindu culture, they have hundreds of religions and millions of gods through the ages.

850
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:28,760
But the essence here is that these are core understandings that anyone can grasp, but very few can use, right, because of the discipline aspect.

851
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,760
Because there is a technical, mechanical aspect to it.

852
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,520
And then there's getting to know the why, why you're doing it.

853
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,820
Well, simply because it's there.

854
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:54,920
Well, I think the spirit and the energy have a lot – Well, the spirit is your personality, what makes you you, like a fingerprint, but better.

855
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:02,280
I mean fingerprints, they're good for, what, 140,000 or 200,000 and then they fall apart, right?

856
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,160
Mm-hmm.

857
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,760
Your spirit is unique to you and no other.

858
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,700
Right.

859
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:27,300
And I guess what I was alluding to was the, I mean, if you're, let's just be frank here, if you're a jerk, your chances of really learning the discipline well is not going to be so easy or good a path for you.

860
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,180
No, it might be a good path for you, but really bad for others, like Darth Vader.

861
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,020
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

862
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:45,420
Let's say, or the Emperor, in Star Wars again, but they had pretty good access to the, and they weren't reserved about using it when they felt they had to either.

863
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,940
Exactly, yes, yes.

864
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,640
It could be used either way.

865
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,620
Mm-hmm.

866
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,200
It's the, I call it the Ether.

867
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:55,740
Right.

868
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,920
The ancient Greeks called it Zoe, that's where you get the Z-O prefix for zoology or zoo or, you know.

869
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,860
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

870
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:03,240
Right.

871
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,440
Prana in India.

872
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,860
Right, right.

873
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:18,560
Let's see, it would be nefesh in Hebrew, really, the breath, or nef, Arabic.

874
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,560
Okay.

875
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:21,920
Right?

876
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:29,460
The breath is really the aspect, because though, see, you have to understand, see, one of the videos they stated that's what makes the blood flow.

877
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:47,340
Well, yes, but it really, the blood flow is part of your metabolism, because if you stop breathing, okay, let's say you stop breathing, and let's say indefinitely, you just stop someone from ever breathing again, their blood flow will stop also within what?

878
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:47,520
Right.

879
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,740
Three minutes, five, 10 minutes, 15, 20.

880
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,260
I'd say three is a good number, yeah.

881
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,600
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,240
I'd say really 15.

883
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,340
Oh, okay.

884
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,840
The heart beat will get down to two beats per minute.

885
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,680
It could be resuscitated.

886
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,980
The breath is very important in all of that.

887
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,520
Yes.

888
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:13,060
Now, if you stop the blood flow, you're going to lose the limb, right?

889
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:17,300
But it's very difficult to stop the blood, so it's really the breath is the trigger.

890
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:18,740
Right.

891
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,500
So when you're inhaling, I think I've discussed how you get nutrition from the air.

892
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,200
Yeah.

893
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,480
You know, yeah, so your body is not porous.

894
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,460
There's no pores in your lungs at all.

895
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:38,340
They're completely sealed like a rubber raft or an air mattress, or even tighter than that.

896
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,140
It's biological.

897
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,520
It's always adjusting, right, where you know how tires are porous, you know.

898
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:52,120
So, yeah, how you access it is just that, right?

899
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,160
I could give an example with weather work.

900
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:06,880
If you want to put a rain over a city, you have to understand that whether you're on the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere, the flow is from west to east, right?

901
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:17,960
So you look at where the city is relative to where you're set up, and you look at it and you say, well, if I speed up the flow, what will happen?

902
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,920
Or if I slow down the flow, what will happen?

903
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,860
Or if the flow is blocked, what will happen?

904
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:24,940
Right.

905
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:32,660
You see, so the only three things you can do, and the combinations of those three things give you nine possibilities, I think, right?

906
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,240
Yeah.

907
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,280
It's the same thing for breathing in a human.

908
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,040
So the same thing happens when you direct energy.

909
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,780
You have nine possibilities, let's say.

910
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:44,600
Yeah.

911
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,940
You can slow it down.

912
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,900
You can block it or you could speed it up.

913
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,980
And now here's the other interesting thing.

914
00:59:52,900 --> 01:00:07,980
What are the chances of you getting an active chi or ether from something like a chair or a door or a computer versus getting it from a cat or a plant or a human?

915
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,520
The cat, the plant, the human offer a lot more than a chair.

916
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:13,480
Mm-hmm.

917
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,000
Get it?

918
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:15,700
Yeah.

919
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,700
So now, the cat out of the human out of the plant, which one has more flowing through it?

920
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,800
Simply by size alone, the human.

921
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,140
Because even a small human is bigger than a cat, let's say, right?

922
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:29,540
Mm-hmm.

923
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,240
Or a plant.

924
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,180
So when you understand how the energy flows through people, what am I doing?

925
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,820
I'm explaining what I said I wasn't, right?

926
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:44,700
When you understand how the energy is flowing around people, let me just say it this way.

927
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:52,220
You ever notice when you're in a crowd and there's a speaker, let's say a political thing, and the people get all roused up?

928
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,180
And what happens to the speaker?

929
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:03,420
Well, let's say someone's making a political speech and the crowd is agreeing and they all thrust their hands up to clap and shout in agreement.

930
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,320
What happens to the guy at the podium?

931
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,540
Doesn't he feel a rush?

932
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,760
Oh, yeah.

933
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:08,960
Big time.

934
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:09,820
Big time.

935
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,460
You could see it, even if you've never experienced anything like someone.

936
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,740
How about even let's get back on a personal level.

937
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,800
Have you ever been complimented?

938
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,280
Someone patted you on the back and just with a real smile looked at you and said, you did great.

939
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,280
And they meant it all earnest, not just one of these casual things you say that's polite, right?

940
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,740
You can feel it.

941
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,660
You feel that rush.

942
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:29,920
Why?

943
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:30,820
Okay, yes.

944
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,020
Now, we've been taught that it feels good, yes, and all that.

945
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:41,420
But right there, when you're being complimented, that person is sharing through words and through their spirit.

946
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:46,760
Because if they complimented you and meant it, you only feel that rush.

947
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:53,400
If they complimented you and didn't mean it, which means they didn't focus that energy on it, you don't feel it either.

948
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:53,800
You notice?

949
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,080
You're like, well, that guy complimented me, but it was hollow.

950
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,180
He didn't mean it, right?

951
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,440
And you know it.

952
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:00,620
Okay.

953
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:01,720
All right.

954
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,540
So when you understand what people mean, they have different flavors of emanating this energy.

955
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,960
And you can direct it and capture it and put it in a bag, right?

956
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,860
And it doesn't – you can't hold it.

957
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,720
You can slow it down or speed it up past you, right?

958
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,780
And that's what you redirect.

959
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:24,000
And that's why when you were watching these videos – I'm not going to say right now more on that.

960
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,100
But when you're watching the videos, especially the masters, they were able to throw people without touching them.

961
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,740
Yep.

962
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,220
Right?

963
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,000
Every one of them.

964
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:39,820
So – and they had learned through their own experience, and they knew what they were looking for.

965
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,000
And not only did they know what they were looking for, they knew when they had it.

966
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,240
Yes.

967
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,680
So there's a lot of people that know what they're looking for, but they don't know when they have it.

968
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,380
You see?

969
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,940
Because they don't know that much about it in the first place.

970
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:58,980
That's what you saw, the various macinations and movements that certain people will do different than others.

971
01:02:59,400 --> 01:02:59,660
Right.

972
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,180
Right?

973
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,220
Because that's them – that's how they interact with it.

974
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:14,150
The best thing is to not have to externally exhibit all of that and then refocus it.

975
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,200
And you notice I haven't brought up fighting.

976
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:24,860
I haven't brought up conflict or anything because this is how you – this is what people do all the time.

977
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,260
Also, you can charge – there are things that are done – like let's say when you're excited to do something.

978
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:32,580
All right?

979
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,620
Whatever it might be.

980
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,260
It could be cooking or whatever, even anything menial.

981
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,620
When you're not – you don't feel like doing something and you try to do it anyway.

982
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:47,900
You feel like this dullness, like you're moving through peanut butter, or you're not really there.

983
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,900
You don't perceive what's going on around you.

984
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,140
But when you want to do something, you start perceiving more of what's going on.

985
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,040
What you're actually perceiving is this life force.

986
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,680
So this is just a little primer to get people.

987
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:12,000
I have never really brought this up in presentations because, number one, it goes a little – well, the thing is it's not an immediate thing.

988
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,500
It can be with more discussion.

989
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,460
But it's better to discuss things that people can see immediately, right, that they're always engaging in anyway through interest.

990
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,880
Like how can you not be interested that you're being pranked over the calendar?

991
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:34,360
How can you not be interested that you're being pranked by the medical system telling you that in the winter when it's cold outside you're going to catch a bacteria that's going to make you sick?

992
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,460
Well, then why don't we just throw out all the refrigerators then because I thought the cold renders bacteria inert.

993
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:41,920
You see?

994
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,760
So anyway, this is just ridiculous.

995
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:52,100
So these things, like just right away, the magic cuff, all these things, the blood pressure and the magic cuff, the prank.

996
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,040
All of these things can be addressed immediately.

997
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:15,880
When you start getting into discussions about something that is a core reality really and how to really function without even having a handle on any of these other things, I think just sonically in a general Western audience is not that important, even though it is one of the most important things.

998
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,620
I'll give you an example.

999
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:27,360
One of my former mentors, Trevor James Constable, he had gone to India and he spoke to a group of weather people and scientists and university types.

1000
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,860
And he lifted up a tube and he says, this is a device that channels prana.

1001
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,100
And none of them batted an eye.

1002
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,000
They were like, they all nodded.

1003
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,700
Yes, we understand what you're talking about.

1004
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:51,280
Where if you held up with something that looked like a hollow tube slightly modified to a Western audience, professors, when I say this channels energy or ether, they'd be like, oh, yeah, sure.

1005
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,560
I'm listening.

1006
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,580
I don't know.

1007
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,600
He'd be laughed off the stage.

1008
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,060
Or he might just say, I don't know.

1009
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,720
He's going to have to prove it.

1010
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,420
Or whatever, you know.

1011
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,380
But in that culture, they're like, yes, we understand exactly what you're saying.

1012
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,860
Do you see the cultural difference?

1013
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:16,920
I am presuming that the majority of the audience that listened to these sonic events are of that Western mindset.

1014
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,740
But I think it's a fairly reasonable assumption to presume that.

1015
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,000
So I don't get into a lot of these other things.

1016
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:32,120
In other words, I am, I wouldn't say custom tailoring, but I am, you know how I said you accommodate the audience, right?

1017
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,420
Most of the things I discuss are to accommodate a Western mindset.

1018
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,180
And it's a shame.

1019
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:45,820
That's why when I get into, let's say, discussions of food, it's like how to make the most basic flatbread, how to make basic rice, how to make basic.

1020
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,080
If I did that in another culture, I'd be laughed at.

1021
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,140
They're like, what's wrong with you, Greek?

1022
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,400
We know that.

1023
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:51,400
Right.

1024
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,620
You get it?

1025
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,300
Commonplace.

1026
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,640
Right.

1027
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,160
I went to a Middle Eastern audience and said, this is how you make rice.

1028
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,140
This is how you make flatbread.

1029
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,040
This is how you cook meat.

1030
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,380
They'd laugh at me.

1031
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,420
Yeah, we know.

1032
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,140
That's how you do it.

1033
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:10,080
But if I have a Western audience of Americans or, you know, white European or whatever, they're going to be like, wow.

1034
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,720
Yeah, it works.

1035
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,360
I make perfect.

1036
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:12,600
Right.

1037
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,320
Because I know they don't know how to cook.

1038
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,620
So, you know, you have to, again, speak.

1039
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,460
You have to know to who you're speaking with.

1040
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,240
Right.

1041
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,920
And I don't know everyone that listens, but I'm, again, saying this because I'm presuming it's predominantly Western.

1042
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:29,500
Right.

1043
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,140
And I think I'm correct in that.

1044
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,180
Yeah, I would say so.

1045
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:33,340
Okay.

1046
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,020
No one's calling in.

1047
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,660
Anything in chat?

1048
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,000
No.

1049
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,920
No call-ins and no Skypes.

1050
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,020
And let's see.

1051
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,920
Let me just check chat real quick here.

1052
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,460
And pretty quiet.

1053
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,280
Yeah.

1054
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,400
Okay, that's fine.

1055
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,480
The Japanese adapted it from the Greek.

1056
01:07:59,140 --> 01:07:59,800
Say again?

1057
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,080
There was one comment in there.

1058
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:14,820
Heard a jujitsu master say the Japanese adapted it from the Greek M.A. It's possible.

1059
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,200
This is one thing.

1060
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:25,220
Okay, this condition, what we call international condition that we're all aware of, is not the first time.

1061
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,420
This has happened prior in history.

1062
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,420
It's just not discussed.

1063
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,700
You know, like I was having a discussion recently with someone regarding the Renaissance.

1064
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,660
I'm like, what Renaissance?

1065
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,060
That is a complete propaganda thing.

1066
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,660
What Renaissance?

1067
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:42,359
If you look at how they define it, that's just like saying, you know, some street in Iowa got some street lamps.

1068
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:43,700
Right.

1069
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,160
So what?

1070
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,240
That doesn't mean.

1071
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,279
You know what?

1072
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,859
It's getting everyone to focus on, you know, the Roman, you know, the Pope really.

1073
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:52,560
Right.

1074
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,800
Telling everyone what to do.

1075
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,840
But it was really, there was an emperor also that doesn't get a lot of play because Europe had an emperor and the Pope.

1076
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,740
It was the emperor and the Pope that ran, you know, the world at the time.

1077
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,340
Right.

1078
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:13,200
And then the subsequent, I wouldn't say they were in suzerain to the, but you could almost say they were suzerain to the Pope.

1079
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,779
All the kings and monarchs were, you know, subject.

1080
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,939
In other words, they ruled their own area, but ultimately, you know, they were subjects of the Pope and the emperor.

1081
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:35,399
So regarding that, but this sense of internationalism that is sensed today about, you know, easy communication and all this and knowing of other cultures has happened before several times.

1082
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:45,840
And when the further back you go and the more evidence of this is found, the faster it's sequestered or censored because, you know, it's not popular.

1083
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,160
It doesn't agree with the history that has been told.

1084
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:54,240
That's why very often when people tell lies, they spend so much energy covering up, you know, what they've said.

1085
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,080
Right.

1086
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:07,660
And we also got to bring in that the fact that the gods in the censorship also had their hand in that, too.

1087
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,920
They just wanted us to not know.

1088
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:27,820
Well, because it's very here's the other interesting thing with so many people on the planet today and there's a level of stupidity with almost everyone is that it's so easy to create a panic event where most people just kill each other off for no reason.

1089
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,600
You see, so they have to stage the numbers up for them to do it, for the gods to do it.

1090
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,320
But even though men will have a pretty good chance at it.

1091
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,020
It is all about them.

1092
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,560
Yes, well, it is.

1093
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:51,400
And like, for example, if you're building a small theater of 10 people, the chances of an injury happening, or even if 100 people, if someone cried fire is not that great.

1094
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:57,760
If you built a theater with 50,000 people and someone cried fire, the chances of injury is much higher.

1095
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,080
You know, you could easily say, you know, 100 people were trampled to death.

1096
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,020
Right.

1097
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:12,420
So, as the numbers get bigger, and more of these morons communicate, you want to obviously censor them.

1098
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,740
That's an obvious statistical fact.

1099
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,540
It's too bad to say it that way.

1100
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,440
It's just, I'm not, don't take it personally.

1101
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,340
They have to be censored.

1102
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,280
That's why you'll never hear me say, well, there has to be less censorship so people can learn.

1103
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,920
I would never say something as stupid as that.

1104
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:45,120
What I'm coming out and telling you is, there's another society called the gods, and you guys are being set up.

1105
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,680
And you don't know it.

1106
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,800
And it's not just that one thing.

1107
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:56,000
You'd better find out about how the body works, how to keep time, what all these institutions are really doing, subtly.

1108
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,280
And check the anomalies.

1109
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,640
Yep, and all these other things.

1110
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,180
And there were a few of them, as you pointed out.

1111
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:12,720
And I think we noticed one just a little while back on the third Sabbath, which was way out of alignment with the...

1112
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,540
By a day.

1113
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,220
Yeah, yeah.

1114
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,460
And it was weird when it caught up.

1115
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,080
Oh yeah, it'll do that.

1116
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,640
It's been doing it since 2005.

1117
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,600
There was like a big shift of time there.

1118
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,640
I'm still trying to wrap my head around that one.

1119
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:36,060
Around 2000, what they call 2005, it's hard when you use the number because they end it in December.

1120
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:43,820
You miss out on the progression of that when you use the Pope's work schedule, but that's when it stops.

1121
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,660
And this year was rather well-behaved.

1122
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,660
A few years ago it was really, really off.

1123
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,160
And yeah, we'll see if it behaves this year after the first month.

1124
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,880
And that's just a sign that in the latter days it will start to err in its ways.

1125
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:10,780
It doesn't mean you can't tell the month, it just means that you can't tell the Sabbaths with the moon strictly on point.

1126
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:15,360
And that, by the way, is in the Book of Lamentations also.

1127
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,620
It's in Isaiah.

1128
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,700
But most people read that and don't know what that means, how critical that is.

1129
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:28,700
What do you mean, I'm going to break your Sabbaths and all this other stuff?

1130
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,460
I do a Sabbath every Saturday, what do you mean?

1131
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,360
They don't understand.

1132
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,740
You know what I'm talking about?

1133
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,820
Of course you do.

1134
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,560
Let's see, we had one from Vandyman.

1135
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,280
Can you ask a question about Zechariah?

1136
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:58,480
And then he also has, trying to find the meaning of the word hekel and having difficulty getting anything.

1137
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,180
Interesting picture search.

1138
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:10,360
The word hekel in reference to the Scripture Institute translation.

1139
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:18,480
There's a translation that's put out by some scripture people out of South Africa, those guys, right?

1140
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,300
Yeah, they're just making stuff up.

1141
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,620
They're applying a different word that's, I think, not there.

1142
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:33,020
But, hekel, that's the word that they're using for temple or house.

1143
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,390
Okay.

1144
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,410
Yeah, there's some strange things going on in that one too.

1145
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:47,730
Which, by the way, it's hard to recommend any biblical...

1146
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:52,210
People ask me, like, what's a good translation to read or what version, what do you...

1147
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,370
So you've got to read all of them?

1148
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,350
Mm-hmm.

1149
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:57,630
None of them are any good, but you've got to know them all.

1150
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,050
Why?

1151
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,470
Because you're on this planet.

1152
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:07,590
If you try to bring up a conversation regarding biblical stuff, you better know what they've read.

1153
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:08,990
You see?

1154
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,190
And knowing the law.

1155
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:13,650
And you'll get to see the anomalies.

1156
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:19,970
Well, yeah, what I mean, the point that he's bringing up, I'm assuming, is from the translation.

1157
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:25,390
You have to know the King James and all that, because that's what's being used for common parlance.

1158
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:33,050
If you go to a party and people are discussing the Bible, well, guess where they got their information from?

1159
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:40,310
Most 99% of the time, King James, or NIV or one of these others, which are King James also, you know what I mean?

1160
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,690
So you have to know it.

1161
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:44,270
You can't say, well, I don't know the King James, I know the real scripture.

1162
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,530
What happens to the conversation?

1163
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,930
Well, there is none.

1164
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:50,470
Yeah.

1165
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,690
Well, should we take a little pause here, if you want?

1166
01:15:53,830 --> 01:16:02,250
And we can come back to this in a little bit and give us a chance to maybe stretch legs and grab a coffee and all that kind of good stuff.

1167
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:06,270
And we can return to this in, say, maybe five, ten minutes or so.

1168
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,410
Sure, let's do that.

1169
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:14,050
And just real quick, I want to say, when you're reading a biblical version, you can read many of them at the same time.

1170
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:22,910
You can literally, if you have them in paperback, just turn to the first page of Genesis, all three or four, how many you're reading, and just read them all at the same time.

1171
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:24,170
Right?

1172
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:24,950
Right.

1173
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,930
So you get familiar with all of them or whatever.

1174
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:29,550
But that's what crazy people do, though, right?

1175
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:29,910
Anyway.

1176
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,290
Okay, so we'll see you back here in a few minutes, okay?

1177
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,390
Okay, we'll see you in about five or ten then.

1178
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,650
Okay, see you.

1179
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,050
Okay.
