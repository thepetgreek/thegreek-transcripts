1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,470
There we go.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,350
All right, we'll bring ourselves back in.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,230
And greetings, folks, when we're back.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,470
And a nice little pause there.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,510
Okay.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,170
Yeah, organic coffee is on sale.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,830
So some coffee.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,370
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,590
That's a joke, right?

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,690
But it does taste better.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,470
It does.

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,950
It's just crazy.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:40,310
So it just shows you how even when everything gets starts to get pushed to the side and thrown into the trough, you know, for all the pigs, there's still something that's left on top that might work out.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,290
So but it's really bad.

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,610
So any questions in chat?

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,570
Let's see.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,170
Let's see.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,490
We were just talking with Vandy a little bit about the ISA.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:57,160
And uh, oh, yes, there was a question in here.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,080
What was that?

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,160
Did you confirm with what the heck?

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
Oh, was I presumptive?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,300
I think you were.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,820
I think Vandy acknowledged that you were in the right direction there, I believe.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,220
Okay.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,800
There was a question.

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,220
Yeah.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,660
So what was the fig tree?

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,140
I got Gabby there for a second.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,520
So I wasn't painted.

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,980
Question about the fig tree.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,340
Yes, yes.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,080
Well, there's fig trees.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,980
Yeah, was the fig.

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,260
Let's see Eddie.

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,000
Was the fig tree refers to Israel?

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,560
Why did the Christ curse the fig tree?

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,520
Well, you know, I have gone over that.

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,240
But maybe I'll go over it again.

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,140
Mm hmm.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,980
And it's not a pat answer thing, because the pat answer is because he did.

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,540
Right.

43
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,880
And you know, when you talk to most people, you could do anything you want, right?

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,840
Because they, you know, they're trying to defend something they know nothing about.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,020
Because for most people, faith is something that they know is not true.

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,980
Right?

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,420
Or they know can't be defined.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000
But the definition on that is quite simple.

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,920
When you know how I adverse I am to people asking me for verses to show one specific thing.

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,800
Unless I get into a specific thing.

51
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,580
So this one is a specific thing.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
So you can easily say on the surface, yeah, because he did.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,940
But there's a long explanation.

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,640
And the story starts off with Abraham.

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,720
There was a scene where Abraham is goes into a covenant with the Elohim.

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:44,700
And what's interesting about that covenant is it's mostly one sided, although almost all of the performance, if not all of the performances on the Elohim, on that agreement, isn't it?

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,260
With Abraham, right?

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,680
He doesn't have to do anything.

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,300
At that point, speaking when the cup is made, he's all the performances on the gods.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,660
So at that point, and the most high right when I say Elohim, because you know, he does it by proxy, right?

61
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,740
And then and then you move down.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, before we get out of Abraham, there's a scene where he has a vision where things are horrible.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
He sees these really horrible things happening.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,400
I don't know if you remember that.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,940
It's a dream.

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,420
It's a it's a multiple part dream.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Well, we only are told to get the reaction.

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah.

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,500
All right, fast forward.

70
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,600
The reason I bring up Abraham, because that aspect starts with him, right?

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:27,980
Right.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,220
This particular aspect directly, because before that he the gods are working with everyone, right?

73
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:43,820
Okay, now fast forward to Daniel, which is another thing that people don't understand, no matter how hard they try, because it's not time yet.

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,760
But you'll get a lot out of it, if you just read out of it.

75
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,240
Now, Daniel takes place at the 70 year Jeremiah in the book of Jeremiah.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:08,540
You know, you find out in other places, they're told they're going to have 70 years of captivity, or 70 years of indignation, or 70 years of not in the land, right?

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,100
Right.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,380
Not good, because of their actions.

79
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,760
Prior actions of 370 some odd years.

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,480
Yeah.

81
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,459
So, okay.

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,580
So, or, you know, maybe two centuries, you could say for sure, 200 years.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Now, when you look at the way Daniel is interacting, by the way, I've never said this publicly before, I'll say it now.

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,980
Daniel is a good role model, if you want to know how to interact with the gods, by the way.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,060
I'm going to say that again.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,680
When you read scripture, read it like a screenplay.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
You know, when you read a screenplay, it's not just a book.

88
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,340
You know that it's going to be acted out, right?

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,960
That's why it's a screenplay, or a movie, or a theater, a play.

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:04,820
If you'll notice how he, wouldn't say, let me, in a not so respectful way, over embellish it.

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm going to say this non-respectfully.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,180
I shouldn't really, but let's just say, you know how he overdoes it when he's praying, right?

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes.

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
You know, but is it overdone?

95
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,460
Not really.

96
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,740
I mean, it's just, you know, he'll start there praising the Allah, right?

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Which is where the Arabs get Allah, for short.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,140
Right.

99
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,020
Which means the God, because his name is not used there.

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
So, right?

101
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,140
If you look at that, I just want to throw that in there.

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,160
You know, you start, you know, Christ said keep it short, but that's not something you should shorten, I should suggest.

103
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:42,860
No.

104
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,360
I would suggest.

105
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,240
Just keep the praise, because what that does is, it's not only for the gods themselves.

106
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,240
They don't really need that.

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,900
They know, they're very confident, really.

108
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,500
They don't need your praise directly to know their position.

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,800
But it shows your character too.

110
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:09,320
It shows your character, and also it's a signal beacon to the angelic presence, because they're the ones scouring the human landscape, looking for who's, you know, wants to send a message, right?

111
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,600
Because they're the ones that bring it.

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,420
Right.

113
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:32,440
Just like, just like, you know, years ago, what you, you put the one on the rural, especially at the post box, and when you had mail to go out, you lifted the flags, and the postman knew that you had to, you know, there was mail outgoing there, so he had to make adjustments, he can make adjustments to his bag, or get the outgoing bag before he got there.

114
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,680
You know, very, just the economy of movement for the angelic that delivered the messengers, right?

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,420
Right.

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,660
I never really got into that before, but anyway.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Yeah.

118
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay, so we start off with Abraham.

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,500
You see some things that are really horrible, and we'll fast forward to the book of Daniel.

120
00:06:49,260 --> 00:07:06,540
We know about they're in there for 70 years, really one other year, but one of the things that Daniel presents is what's going on with the nation, or the people, and he is told that there's going to be another 490.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
There's a 490 year thing that's brought up.

122
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,300
Why?

123
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,180
Because if you don't correct it in the first 70, then they make it seven times more.

124
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,220
Right.

125
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,760
Get it?

126
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,580
Yes.

127
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:31,320
Now, and they didn't correct it, and they didn't, and now if you don't correct it during the time, you get another seven times to correct it, you know, of indignation, let's say.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:51,400
And if you still haven't corrected it, and then you get what's called condemnation, and that's why the Christ cursed the fig tree, because it was the end of the road for them, from that spiritual end, not what they did to him, specifically as a man on earth.

129
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,620
That came later as well.

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,640
That had to be done no matter what, which is still a secret, believe it or not.

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,100
Yeah.

132
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,480
No, well, no, it was known that they wouldn't...

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay, that was a poor choice, Jess.

134
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,640
Well, when the gods condemned, yeah, I don't see a lot of tests, but...

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,900
No, I meant as far as the Christ, for him coming back, it was a proof of after death.

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,280
Oh, no, yeah.

137
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah, that's what I meant.

138
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,240
I wasn't saying that about the other...

139
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
Oh, no, that's fine.

140
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:34,080
The Christ said one purpose only, strictly, was to show those who knew, and ask the question, what happens after death, and prove it.

141
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,600
He was there to prove it for them, not to start another religion, and all the people who didn't know scripture.

142
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,120
He specifically said that, I came for the lost of Israel, right?

143
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,860
Now, if you look at that word lost, it's not lost like your lost dog, or, you know, you're lost and found.

144
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,320
The word is perished, I mean the dead.

145
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:03,920
He came for those that have died of Israel already, not the living, but he is living, and he's here for the living to see, because the living are the ones that know about him being here.

146
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,540
So, there's a dual-sidedness like, you know, to it, right?

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Because if no one had died yet, he wouldn't have to come to prove it, right?

148
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,480
Right.

149
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,060
So, but there's another...

150
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,740
That's why the entire, I keep saying confidently, the whole notion and concept of the Christ is still a secret, because how do I know?

151
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,240
You still see Christians around, right?

152
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,720
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,500
Like, what are you talking about?

154
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,680
Get out of here, you know?

155
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
I hope this is a pretty good signal right there.

156
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,820
Or you still see what academics are writing about stuff.

157
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,760
It's like, what are you talking about?

158
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,240
Get out of here.

159
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,600
It has nothing to do with that.

160
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,260
You know, they try to put him in...

161
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,740
So, in other words, what people think the Christ is is completely false.

162
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
That's why they categorize him with Buddha and Muhammad and all these others.

163
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm just surprised it hasn't been made into some kind of superhero, as doggy as this society is.

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,760
They have.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,180
Really?

166
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,040
They have one, the Christian one, that with the bobbing head that you put on the bar.

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,300
Oh, no.

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,720
Oh, okay.

169
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,660
Yes, yes.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,100
When they made a song about the plastic Jesus.

171
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,260
Yeah, they've got a shroud.

172
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,940
Yeah, they've got a shroud in some basilica in the Vatican, thinking it's a shroud, you know?

173
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,860
They should take that and make a cape out of it.

174
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,920
Make that the cape.

175
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,820
We'll do a Jesus superhero cartoon, and his cape is actually the Shroud of Turin, also an image on there.

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,140
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, God.

178
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
These people are ridiculous.

179
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:45,480
But anyway, but here's the other point to cursing the fig tree and condemning Israel to that, is that the highest Elohim chose one group of people to keep order, and these people couldn't do it, so he basically condemned all of humanity at that point.

180
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
What did he condemn them to?

181
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,500
Remember, he went 70 years of captivity, and then it went to 490, now it went to 2,000 years.

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,980
Two days, and how do we know?

184
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,060
There's three days and three nights in the grave, right?

185
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:00,780
Right.

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,960
So you know how the numbers work when you're in your second year, when you're two years old, you're in your third year now.

187
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,860
You're in your third year.

188
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,540
See how it works?

189
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,180
Yeah.

190
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,040
So three days would be 2,000 years.

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,460
You're in your third day now, right?

192
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,480
You're in the third, you know, so.

193
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,980
That's some serious, serious whoop-ass.

194
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah, and you're born in it, and everyone that you've ever known, everyone that they've ever known, over 15, 20 times, you know, is born in it.

195
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,320
That's a lot of generations.

196
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, and what that means is you're disconnected.

197
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,720
Right, right.

198
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,720
You know, as you were before.

199
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,960
You're not completely disconnected, because we were speaking about the chi, the prana, and the ether before.

200
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,900
Right, right.

201
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,480
You know, they could just think it and shut off everyone's ability to breathe immediately.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,900
Oh yeah, in a heartbeat.

203
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,480
You're not completely cut off.

204
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,940
They're just hands off completely.

205
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,580
Almost like we're pushed into the corner, you know.

206
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:13,560
Right, right, but also they're hands off openly, like unlike they were before, where you know, an army was told to stand down, and because the angels are going to go in front and fight for them.

207
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,960
You see, and it wasn't just, oh, coincidence, you actually saw that happen.

208
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,300
See, all that's been cut off.

209
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:32,570
So, from that realm, you know, from that higher realm, the lower entities, oh, they've been busy as hell, you know.

210
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,690
Yeah, they have.

211
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,710
And how do we know there's their presences everywhere?

212
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:47,350
And the only way they get away with it is by presenting themselves as good, just like doctors, attorneys, and accountants, and preachers, and ministers, and pastors.

213
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,390
Hope, Ryan, and Zucker.

214
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,520
Yep, yeah.

215
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,160
So, that's, don't take, I tell people, don't take, there's nothing you can do about it, and don't take it personally.

216
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,620
So, just think of it as a, you're in a really, you know, what do they call those country club prisons?

217
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,880
You know, like the club fed, is that what they call it?

218
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
Club fed, yeah.

219
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,580
You're in club fed right now, everyone.

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,600
You're in prison, really.

221
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,740
But it's a spiritual prison, you know.

222
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:25,260
So, if you want to know, we're basically talking about the outside world, the free world right now, which is the realm of the gods.

223
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll pour a little more coffee.

224
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,100
Any other questions there?

225
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't see, just that somebody had made the point that, Hope, you're recording this, we don't want to have another one of those.

226
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,040
Another one of these, or those, but.

227
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,880
Yeah, the program that didn't exist.

228
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,460
Oh, that's fine, that's all right.

229
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,660
I know, well, I've got it all between the ears, I think, or somewhere.

230
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,700
Oh, no, no, that was when we first started this, yeah.

231
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,180
And yes.

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
Yeah, it's all right.

234
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,120
It's out there somewhere in the ether, right?

235
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,340
Yes, it is.

236
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Yes, it is.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,160
But for safety's sake, yes, it is being recorded, and it will be there later on.

238
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,260
Check out for what I'm saying.

239
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,620
Yes, yes.

240
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,140
An interesting time you'll have when you do.

241
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,440
I hope so, yeah, because you don't want it to be boring, which is a fun thing.

242
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,460
No, no, and I always go off to some other tangent that takes me here, takes me there, and I'm like, oh my god.

243
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:46,340
Yeah, I assure you, if you asked anyone out there at this point, I'm being saying this with humility, of course, ha ha ha, but you know, as much as possible, why was the fig tree cursed?

244
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:57,300
You're not going to get a simple, you know, it's going to be so oversimplified that you're going to walk away still wanting to figure it out.

245
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,980
Well, I'm trying to show you that all of these things are not about one thing only.

246
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,840
You have to go to where the entire, where did Israel start?

247
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,240
Where did Israel, right?

248
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,460
And not only did Israel start, where, why was Israel, Israel because of who?

249
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,200
You see, the patriarch, right?

250
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:25,440
And then you got to go there, and that's why there's so much confusion, is because it's all fractional.

251
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,380
Yeah, yeah, like a broken mirror.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah, you don't see the whole body, just a little piece.

253
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:49,640
So, I would suggest that answering these things simply, and showing how, you know, from the beginning to the end, where it goes, is one way that someone can say, well, you know, I heard it, do I understand it?

254
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,560
Well, I might have to just trust the Greek, because I haven't read that or studied that.

255
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,640
See, that's where you go to the next level now, and you say, well, he said all these things, let me see if I could find them.

256
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,760
Yeah, yeah, best way to do it.

257
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,660
You said, you said if you go on the way, then you've just done a year's worth of study in a few minutes or an hour, right?

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
Because you've gotten the shortcut.

259
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,800
I believe in shortcuts, shortcuts are always the way to go.

260
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,260
But it doesn't make it, if it compromises quality, then the shortcut is not good.

261
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:32,710
Right, right, and it's a heck of a journey when you do, when you do go and check it.

262
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,930
Anyone wants to look up in front, by the way, where does that cutting corners thing started from?

263
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,470
Remember that?

264
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,270
Was it a document thing, or was it something else?

265
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,070
You know, when you're cutting corners, it means your quality goes down?

266
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:46,770
Oh, yeah.

267
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,370
So what?

268
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,610
Yeah, that was another thing you were always going to do, was a little episode on cliches.

269
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,730
Yeah, cutting corners.

270
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:06,599
I'm trying to think of a word that, I'm drawing a blank, Greek, I'm drawing a blank.

271
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,000
It might be a reference on it if someone wants, but you see, shortcuts are good.

272
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I think everyone has gotten used to, especially with the rectangle, finding out that doing a shortcut is more ergonomic.

273
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:45,100
So if you start taking, let's say you take 10 biblical questions, and you show how the situation started, all the way to how it affects where you are today, and you draw this pathway through the scripture, with each one 10 times, you've covered the book, vast swaths of the book very quickly, that way, in understanding.

274
00:17:45,840 --> 00:18:05,700
Which I want to bring up, by the way, because the religious cultures, all of them, regardless of what they are, it's either the clergy or congregation, or the followers or the leaders, they have an unwritten rule that it's forbidden or taboo to give proper interpretation, or any interpretation.

275
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,100
Then when someone tries to say something, they say, well, that's your interpretation.

276
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,660
It just shows you how they're all just massively ignorant, right, and evil, you know.

277
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,200
The hive mentality.

278
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,420
It's forbidden, you know, just like if you deal with an attorney, it's forbidden to show the of the law.

279
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:42,040
Earlier I mentioned with the attorneys or so, about the, I just want to say this real quick, you don't have to learn the law, you just have to learn, you do have to learn the law, but the way you learn the law, the man's law, is by learning definitions.

280
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:58,700
So when you're charged with something, they'll cite what code it is, so you just, the code could be hundreds of pages long, but the definitions are only less than a page long, and if you see that that code doesn't apply to you by definition, it doesn't matter what they're charging you with, you stick on that, you see.

281
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,420
Yeah.

282
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,260
You get it?

283
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,120
So, okay, someone is handing me another smaller rectangle here.

284
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,240
Cutting Corners.

285
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:16,360
According to an analytic dictionary of English etymology by Anatoli Lieberman, the phrase cutting corners may have derived from the cater corner in the 16th century.

286
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,920
The verb cater was first recorded and defined replacing something across diagonally.

287
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,540
Okay, so when you cut the corners, I guess, and you measure diagonally, the thing is shorter, right?

288
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,120
Thank you.

289
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,810
So, yeah, you know how televisions were measured diagonally and to make them sound bigger?

290
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,210
Remember that?

291
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,310
I think they still are, aren't they?

292
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,230
Did I lose you, Bruce?

293
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,930
Are we still streaming?

294
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,670
I don't know if we're still on, so I'll mute until I hear from Bruce.

295
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,180
Sorry, Greg, I had myself muted and I was in the channel, couldn't get back to the window back quick enough.

296
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, that's fine.

297
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,780
Yeah, we're still on, right?

298
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,440
Yes, oh yes, we're still going.

299
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,040
Yeah, so it has to do with measuring diagonally, and if the corners are missing, then it's shorter, right?

300
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,380
Right.

301
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,160
Cutting Corners.

302
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,720
Got you.

303
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,380
Okay, anything else?

304
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,880
Not at the moment.

305
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,200
That's what got me into trouble there a little bit.

306
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,640
I couldn't get out of that window.

307
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,600
Exiled to spiritual Siberia.

308
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,560
Is there a god assigned to each person?

309
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,860
That was something you brought up one time.

310
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes, well, it's done by, again, let me go back to Abraham.

311
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:06,660
He was told to leave an area because of the gods that were there, and the ones that, not because of the gods that were there, but because of the conditions of the people around him and the gods that they worshipped, right?

312
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,340
He couldn't do, so there's a physical change, yeah?

313
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,120
Yeah.

314
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,640
But I wouldn't say there's a god assigned each person.

315
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,760
The way you do that is by jurisdiction, family and country.

316
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,800
But we see now, part of this time period, there's nowhere to go.

317
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,560
The entire world is under the goddess religion and under the adversary, you know.

318
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,460
So where are you going to go?

319
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,480
Well, you know, I heard someone recently, well, I'm going to move, and I don't know where I'm going to go.

320
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,120
And I'm like, well, just remember this.

321
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,320
Wherever you go, there you are.

322
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,120
And that's really where you're at right now.

323
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,920
Wherever you go, it's about being set apart.

324
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,740
You're not going to run into anything, any lawful society or anything good that represents the good.

325
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,700
Now, you're going to run into a lot of things that represent themselves as being good falsely, right?

326
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:15,200
No one's going to say, hey, we're a satanic, well, you know, we worship the old lord of darkness, and we'd like to enslave you and whatever, abuse you, come to our country.

327
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,060
No one's going to say that.

328
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,500
Right, right.

329
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,180
Or how dare you, you know, whatever.

330
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,840
So yeah, they always, it's a counterfeit.

331
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,360
Vandy had one here about, what about the saying, to feel it in your waters?

332
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,880
Where did that come from, I wonder?

333
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,140
Well, you know what, here's the interesting thing about that.

334
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,560
Let's look it up.

335
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,700
No, I don't know what that means.

336
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,480
All those cliches, I think at this point, the most immediate way to look it up is on the rectangle, isn't it?

337
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,060
Yeah.

338
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:02,220
But if you have conflicting, or some either seems inappropriate, or not pertinent, or not direct, then you're going to have to go into print.

339
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,180
Yeah.

340
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:13,900
By the way, the rectangle is far better off than things that are solely in print, if they're accurately on the rectangle.

341
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,640
Right, right.

342
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:38,620
Because you can access it now, you know, if you have a book, let's say, you know, I have a book here, I never retrash and say it, it's here, right, and it got passed around and ended up with me, and it's an old book, a very old book, and nothing on it is on the internet, right?

343
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:52,280
But if it was, right, I could travel without it, and go on the internet and access it.

344
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,240
Right.

345
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,560
But right now, if I travel without it, I don't have it.

346
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,240
Yeah.

347
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,880
You get it, you see what I mean?

348
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,660
It's like, you know, the Outlook emails, how they're not web-based, you have to be on the computer that it's set up, versus Gmail, you can access, right?

349
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:18,020
So the rectangle does that, and it allows you to tap into that, you know, universally located access.

350
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,000
Right.

351
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,830
Where the stuff in print doesn't.

352
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,990
Now, here's an interesting thing, there's commentary,

353
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:33,670
if anyone can find it, when the printing presses were being produced, and plans were being given,

354
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:41,770
and training on how to print material in Europe, there was a lot of commentary about, oh no,

355
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,490
this thing, the printing press, is going to ruin society, because all these gossips and tales,

356
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,610
and people orally speak on, you know, they dissipate, you know, over time, but once they're

357
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,050
going to print, once they put this crap in print, it'll be around much longer.

358
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,330
Yeah.

359
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:09,750
Now, from that respect, I could see like, for example, 9-11, JFK, and all these other conspiracy stuff, they rely on the internet to keep their crap going.

360
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,590
Conspiracy theory, right?

361
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:21,810
Where if they had to actually go out and print a book, you wouldn't see as many notions and stupid stuff on those things, for example.

362
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,220
You know, like those two things I'll just bring up.

363
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,820
Like, JFK is a closed case, as we already have confessions on that.

364
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,320
Who did it?

365
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm not going to say.

366
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,640
If you want to find out, you can research it yourself.

367
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,600
If you can't find it, go ahead and email me, and I'll tell you who did it.

368
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,440
9-11, you can look at it all you want, you're not going to figure out how those buildings were turned into dust on your own.

369
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,340
You have to have a certain knowledge of high energy dielectrics, let's just put it that way.

370
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,240
And that technology is about 80 years old now, 90 years old.

371
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,580
It's not from space, and it's not nanothermite.

372
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:08,120
And if you don't know how it was done specifically, you could, don't, well, I shouldn't say email me, and I'll tell you I don't want to start going in those directions.

373
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,520
But yeah, email me, and I'll tell you.

374
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,120
I'll put it in chat one day.

375
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,940
I think you have, I think you have to some degree.

376
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,820
There was a video that you posted about a ship in the water.

377
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah, a 10,000 ton ship turning into dust.

378
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,760
And it's on my server, folks, in uploads.

379
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Have a peek.

380
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,060
Very nice, very, very interesting piece of work.

381
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,780
I wish they would have left the camera roll just a little bit longer.

382
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,900
Oh yeah, I think at that point the wave, I think the water wave caught it by that point.

383
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah.

384
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,420
There used to be some really good ones on Project Plowshare.

385
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,220
They took them down like 15 years ago, or like say 2003, 2004.

386
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,900
I bookmarked them, and now they're gone on an old computer.

387
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:16,100
But it actually showed you a series of buildings as a radio tower, and they did, you know, the device went out, the zero box, and zero time goes off at ground zero.

388
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,280
And you saw everything turn to dust.

389
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,700
Oh, let's see, I got some four critters here.

390
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,520
And so you saw everything turn to dust, just like at the World Trade Center, you know.

391
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,780
And I'm like, oh, this is a piece of cake, you know.

392
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,680
And then having conversations with Dimitri takes it to a whole other level.

393
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,060
Yes, yes.

394
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:49,480
And JFK, there's a confession on that, and if you want to, if someone confesses, and you can't tell if someone is telling the truth or not, that's not the person who's making the confessions problem.

395
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,900
Right, right.

396
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:59,340
That's your inability to understand if someone is telling the truth or not, and that's a serious human problem from that respect.

397
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,260
So anyway, because you're living in a society where evidence doesn't matter.

398
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,060
How do I know?

399
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,840
Well, look around you.

400
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,460
Yeah.

401
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,620
That's why they put labels, put it this way.

402
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:25,200
If you lived in a society that was just 5% reasonable, or really 1% reasonable, 1%, all of the, especially in America, the supermarkets and grocery stores would close because no one would buy anything in there.

403
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,800
How do I know?

404
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,860
Because simply of what's on the labels of the food that you buy, right?

405
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,680
You would read and see, I say, oh, this shouldn't be eaten, and no one would buy the food.

406
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,420
But because it's you buying that food, I know you have no, evidence means nothing.

407
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:52,720
Now, what I mean by that is, I'm going to put some toxic or semi-toxic material in a container and put a label on it that you know is there, and everyone knows is there, that states that, and you still buy it.

408
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,600
And a nice, bright color.

409
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:56,860
Yep.

410
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,340
It doesn't matter, though.

411
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,120
Yeah, because you know what the color is.

412
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
It's the information.

413
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,580
I think you shared one time.

414
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,220
That's what the children's, yeah.

415
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,520
Yeah.

416
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,400
And then some of the constituents, some of the, what was there, plaster.

417
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,740
And some of them, if spilled out in a city or something like that, you'd have to get a hazmat team to come in and clean it up.

418
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,560
Yeah, it's okay if it's in the cereal box.

419
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,420
It's okay if it's in the cereal box.

420
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,160
If you pour it on the sidewalk, though, it's a thousand dollar fine.

421
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,860
Easily.

422
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,820
Yeah, easily.

423
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,060
For toxic waste, yeah.

424
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,140
And cleanup time.

425
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,040
That was an interesting thing.

426
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:51,220
At one point, Phoenix Water had gotten up to a thousand parts per million, and the EPA said anything more than 700 parts per million on the sidewalk is a thousand dollar fine, but the tap water is, yeah, see.

427
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,000
Evidence doesn't matter.

428
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,420
It doesn't matter at all.

429
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:54,860
No.

430
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,660
You know, it says it right on the money, Federal Reserve note, and then who owes the note?

431
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,000
The United States of America.

432
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,660
Yeah.

433
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:08,570
You know, people in commerce, like you take a $10 bill, but no one asks who's going to pay that bill, right?

434
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,170
Who's going to pay that bill?

435
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,570
Yeah, who's going to pay that bill?

436
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,150
These are bills.

437
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,030
Yeah, who's going to pay them?

438
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:22,410
That's why when they're in Congress, they pass bills, because they're putting out all this spurious, presumptive debt.

439
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,030
And, you know, the financial people are like, you're putting a law and a bill.

440
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,250
Who's going to pay that bill?

441
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,670
The people.

442
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,490
They're so stupid.

443
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,570
We'll charge them with stealing rocks from the moon.

444
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,950
And they have, the reason they pass bills is because you have all the credit.

445
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,330
Yeah.

446
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:52,850
It's kind of like, you know, let's say you go to a restaurant, and you have nothing, you're Congress, and you're in a restaurant with all these rich people, and they give you a bill for a tuna fish sandwich.

447
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,050
You're like, I don't have any money.

448
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,390
And you're like, well, you know, there's all these wealthy people in here.

449
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,250
Maybe I'll convince one of these guys to buy me this $5 sandwich.

450
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,450
And chances are they will.

451
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,510
No one will.

452
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:04,830
You see?

453
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,270
It's like watching a bad TV show.

454
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:08,870
Yeah.

455
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,850
Well, TV is bad because of this.

456
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,450
Oh, true.

457
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,750
Oh, God, yeah.

458
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,370
Oh, yes.

459
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,550
It's just, but, you know, again, it's, they're accommodating the people.

460
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:33,970
If you haven't been out in public lately, or if you don't have any family or friends, I suggest you go temporary, we'll do a temporary rent-a-family-and-friends thing to find out if you don't want to go out to the shops and talk to people.

461
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,610
Live on air.

462
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:43,630
If you have any other humans or surface-oriented habits around you, you'll see that you are surrounded by morons.

463
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,210
It's very simple.

464
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,810
It's scary.

465
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,910
It's a cosmic problem.

466
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,530
See, I'm one of the few people in the world that say this consistently nonchalant.

467
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,810
It's not a pejorative thing to say it.

468
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:02,090
In other words, I'm saying it because it is accurate in the sense that, like the Forrest Gump, stupid is as stupid does.

469
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,610
In other words, do not expect anything beyond what you see, because it is completely out of their control at this point.

470
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:17,730
Not because it is out of their control, because at this point it's out of their control, and it's been out of their control, because they're incapable, incompetent.

471
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,870
How would you say it?

472
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,290
You know, they're just not capable of it.

473
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,190
They're just not.

474
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,010
Because of the very simple things that we, you know, always discuss.

475
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,570
Eddie's asking, why did Moses have horns in some pictures?

476
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,190
Because he did.

477
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,050
Yeah.

478
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,710
It's in scripture.

479
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,710
Charon.

480
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,440
You know, there's other words for shine.

481
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,900
Why did they pick the word charon?

482
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,100
Because that's where you get chariton from.

483
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,820
A horn is a symbol of power.

484
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,640
Now, there's many ethereal explanations for it, but essentially in scripture you have an altar with horns.

485
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,300
You have horns being broken, and then you have someone being given horns.

486
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:20,500
Well, if you want to know exactly why, exactly and specifically why, you'll get a chance to ask him yourself in the future.

487
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,190
But all I can say about horns is that they're a prominent feature that is shown in places of power.

488
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,500
And Moses was chosen to be in a position of power.

489
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:55,920
And there's an entire story about Moses which can be discussed, which you can get out of the few verses about him personally out of scripture, combined with how antithetical most of the things that they were told to do were from where they came from and where they were going.

490
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Antithetical meaning opposite of the societies, the traditions of Egypt, and the traditions of the Canaanites, meaning where they were leaving and where they were going.

491
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,560
There's a specific reason for that.

492
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:17,980
You'll never see that anywhere else in history because everywhere else in history when people had traditions and laws and things they blended in from where they came from.

493
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:32,260
But what's interesting about the Torah or the teachings and the laws that were given to Moses as, let's say, a constitution of a nation or a family or a group of people were contrary to the others.

494
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:46,900
And there's some pretty deep stuff in there which I probably won't go public with for still a couple of years.

495
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm going to wait and see how the understanding changes because it gets pretty deep.

496
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,220
I mean to the point where it's not politically correct at all.

497
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,340
I'm not one for being politically correct.

498
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:11,900
I'm just saying that it'll be simpler if some of the censorship as it starts to move along and better texts get put out and more people read.

499
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,520
And then we could go back and say, see what this says right here?

500
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,700
Do you want to talk about that?

501
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,320
They're like, wow, I've never saw that before.

502
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,100
I'm like, yeah, isn't that interesting, right?

503
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:32,910
Yeah, I try to keep everything for the past 14 years, 15 years basic publicly as much as possible.

504
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,590
Same stuff.

505
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,410
Everyone says it's the same stuff over and over.

506
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,430
I'm like, great.

507
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,150
If you got it down pat, you have license to go out and use it.

508
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,650
I'll never say you got that stuff from the Greek.

509
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,470
Go ahead.

510
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:42,790
Go.

511
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,730
Go start speaking.

512
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,310
Go.

513
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,230
Huh?

514
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Needs to be said.

515
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,980
No one else is.

516
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,560
Oh, yeah.

517
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,200
Well, it will be.

518
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:06,160
Well, here's the thing for people to remember, regardless of what interests you have, because whatever interests you have, most likely are ones that are earthly.

519
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,340
The main point to speaking, if I were to just be

520
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:16,200
given 30 seconds, it would be that this whole thing now, especially, is that people acknowledge

521
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,100
the gods truly who they are, lawfully who they are, not something that you believe in or don't

522
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:27,880
believe in or whatever, and that they made us and that they're coming back to get us to set the

523
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,620
earth up for humanity 2.0, let's say, or the next level of this situation.

524
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,000
That's the whole point.

525
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:45,780
So no matter what you're interested in, whether you're a bus driver, a plumber, a clerk, a writer, whatever, a singer, a cyclist, a chef, a welder, it doesn't matter.

526
00:36:46,720 --> 00:37:03,120
The thing to keep in the back of your mind is that the entire society in the next 14 years or less, actually probably less than 10 now, by the early mid to 2020s, is going to acknowledge mid to slightly after that, acknowledge that the gods are real.

527
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
It's not something you believe in or whatever.

528
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,600
It's just a real thing.

529
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:18,700
So once you acknowledge that they exist lawfully, not the fairy tales that you hear through religion, then it's time, then lawfully they could act upon what they have to do.

530
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:29,860
Because if the gods start doing things and no one understands who they are, then later on the humans will be like, well, we didn't know who you were, so why'd you do that?

531
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,220
You didn't give us enough time to catch up.

532
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,880
You didn't give us enough time.

533
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,000
They don't want to hear that.

534
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,820
You see what I'm saying?

535
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,380
Yeah, it's lawful.

536
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:45,960
So everyone is, yeah, people are going to go into the next level knowingly or conscious of it.

537
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,300
Another example would be like, I don't think anyone will ever be at the resurrection not knowing they're at the resurrection.

538
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,160
Right.

539
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,000
You see, so there's a level of cognizance that's going to be increased here.

540
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:08,280
So, and those that don't know about the resurrection, which is the majority of the people that have died, there's going to be some kind of instrument or application or something that's going to make them aware of it.

541
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,200
But what's interesting, that's on that end.

542
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,060
See, they're done already.

543
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:21,300
But for those that are here right now, which makes this time unique, is such an application or instruction will be done on earth prior.

544
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,900
Not about necessarily resurrection, but just that the gods exist.

545
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,420
Yeah.

546
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,300
Yeah.

547
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,540
And if you read, there's like two billion Christians, a billion, two billion Muslims, and those people don't know anything lawful about the gods.

548
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,280
I mean, forget it.

549
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,740
Or the Hindus or the Indy culture or the Buddhists, they don't know anything about the obvious.

550
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,840
You just go along the rectangle, look at books that have been written.

551
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:50,880
You know, you could press the most ardent believer in any of these faiths about where they get what they're saying, and then they fall apart.

552
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,280
It's a straw man argument across.

553
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,820
So this is going to go, this is going to change.

554
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,100
And once it changes, that's when things are going to get really good, you know, down here.

555
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,660
And that's just, you know, a setup again.

556
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,200
Yeah.

557
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:16,320
I hear more and more people say that I'm not into organized religion, which seems to be more predominant now than it was.

558
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,560
Yeah.

559
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,020
Well, whether they like it or not, they're going to, they're going to be into organized destruction when the gods.

560
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,680
And that's a tough subject to try to broach.

561
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:40,700
I tried lightly here and there, and it didn't, didn't take quite as well as I was hoping, but that's, that's fine.

562
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,140
That's fine.

563
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,300
Well, that's a difficult one because it's not just addressing that particular part of the speech.

564
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,720
It's the character of the individual.

565
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,480
Yeah.

566
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,480
You have to draw, you have to draw a line.

567
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,340
There's several lines and several, let's just discuss this maybe for a moment, several forms, levels of this.

568
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,580
You have to discern who they are.

569
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:07,380
Like one of them is like, okay, judge them quickly and say, well, is this someone I want to engage?

570
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,100
Exactly.

571
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,600
Right.

572
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,360
Do they have, are they a space here?

573
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,900
Are these one of the ones that are going to go to the grave completely clueless?

574
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,980
Or is this one that's falling for the Antichrist?

575
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,920
Actually, the answer to that one is yes, because everyone is pretty much going to fall for the Antichrist.

576
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,720
Right.

577
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,360
And the other thing is you can discern them and say, can we talk about this later?

578
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:39,560
You know, or the thing is addressing the organized religion aspect is, is a catchphrase as part of the hive mentality also, you see.

579
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,220
Yes.

580
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,380
So you got to see they're locked into a hive also.

581
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:55,080
So you could tell them that you prefer the disorganized one, the one that's so disorganized no one even knows about, no one will ever really know about in this lifetime, you know, and that might, you know, just the opposite.

582
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:02,700
But that's the interesting thing right now is that there's going to be a sorting that's going to be done, you know.

583
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,420
And when I mean sorting, I mean literally a sorting, you know, when you sort things out to separate them.

584
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,160
Right.

585
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,400
So, see, it's been done before also.

586
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:19,060
You could see that some people, you know, were the complete, you know, antithesis of what would be a model, let's say you set apart a person and they were made to be, right?

587
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,760
You know, everything that, you know, the gods have a way of doing that.

588
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:30,400
If it's meant for someone to do something, and when they're not doing it on the cruise ship, they'll lean the entire ship so they do.

589
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,780
You know what I mean?

590
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,360
Right.

591
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,800
So, or they'll send agents down to move it around.

592
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,840
It's very interesting.

593
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,160
See, if you know how these things work, it's really interesting.

594
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:53,940
But if you don't know how they work and you just always chalk it up into the, you know, because you're censored or whatever, oh, you know, whatever, then life is just, you know, you have to find, I'm sure you still, your interests lie somewhere else, you see.

595
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,700
And there's most people always find their interests in something, usually stupid stuff.

596
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,920
You know, anyone could say, well, you know, who says it's stupid?

597
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,500
I'll tell you it's stupid and I'll give you a hundred reasons why.

598
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,300
But that's all they can do.

599
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,520
You know, if you try to tell a fish they could climb a tree, they go insane, right?

600
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,380
You tell a monkey to climb a tree, right?

601
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,880
Or a cat.

602
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,180
Right.

603
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,340
Yeah, they, they're not, you know.

604
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,520
Bloodline.

605
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,000
And see, you had kind of a hard one to dissect here.

606
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
Subjects on the bloodline.

607
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,470
Not sure how to interpret that.

608
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,450
And Greek, did you ever DJ in Studio 54?

609
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:48,970
No.

610
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,050
No?

611
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,190
I've been there, but not DJing.

612
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,350
E-flow, especially blockage at the spinal column.

613
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,450
Huh.

614
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,910
You guys are not supposed to know that I, that I worked with music, but anyway.

615
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,190
Yeah, there was no hint of that.

616
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,810
Let's see.

617
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,770
You know, the thing about music, if it sounds good, it is good, right?

618
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:22,730
It is good, yes.

619
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,510
And friends don't let friends listen to bad music.

620
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:42,740
They're not, no, there's questions about the, what was that, about the chi blocking the spinal column.

621
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,620
Is that a question on the chat?

622
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,340
Let's see in here.

623
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,380
Yeah, yeah.

624
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,580
Blockage at the spinal column.

625
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,180
That's because the, the spinal column blockage is an interesting one.

626
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,000
In, if you look up spinal column in German, it's not called the spinal column.

627
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,980
It's called a spiral column.

628
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,780
Get it?

629
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:10,780
Yeah.

630
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,760
As in a spiral.

631
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,500
Yeah.

632
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,900
That's interesting because if you look at it from various principles, what is it composed of?

633
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,020
Let's just start mechanically.

634
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:28,480
It's very dense and then not so dense, you know, the cartilage in between and, and then dense and then not, it's alternating dense and not dense.

635
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,720
Okay.

636
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,660
What does that tell you?

637
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,920
Right.

638
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,100
And then you have, it's hollow and you have a nerve that goes through it, right?

639
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,720
So the denser the material, the more reflective it is, the softer, the more absorptive it is.

640
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,580
So when you look at the spinal column, you have absorption, reflection, absorption, reflection, right?

641
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,300
Because the, the, the heart bone reflects and the soft tissue in between absorbs.

642
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,500
So you see the alternate teeth, like teeth on a zipper.

643
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,280
You have air and then metal, air and then metal, the metal reflects the air absorbs.

644
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,800
So that is the key to understanding a blockage in the spinal column.

645
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,400
So, okay.

646
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,080
No question.

647
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,860
Just reporting.

648
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,900
I tried the cashew tempeh mix.

649
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,100
It was banging.

650
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:24,600
Thank you.

651
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:24,940
Oh yeah.

652
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:32,940
You know, I'm going to, I've got a lot of veg recipes, by the way, I went away from the blockage, but I gave the key to it.

653
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,280
So let's see if it unlocks anything.

654
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:50,300
The, the food issue is important because you're at a point right now where still we all are eating to stay alive.

655
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,380
And the higher the quality of the food, the higher the quality of your life that goes without saying, right?

656
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,580
And highest possible quality food.

657
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,540
And also that allows one to be in the highest quality state is a non-animal based diet.

658
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:15,280
Now, the interesting thing about that is a murdered animal or a killed animal is different than an animal product.

659
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:30,940
There's some people that have intolerance to animal products like eggs and milk right now is an egg, an egg is an egg, a whole, you know, when you're eating an egg, you're eating an entire chicken, feathers, the beak, right?

660
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,480
You see the energy there, right?

661
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,060
It's not just the chicken, right?

662
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,620
So an egg, I would say yes, is an animal, but the milk is not.

663
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:51,220
What's interesting about that because the milk is a by-product that's a living excretion for the young cow or boat or sheep.

664
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,140
Semi-dilutaneous puss-hacks of bovine.

665
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,920
Right, but actually most people, I could say it's the most Americans have never had real bread.

666
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,640
Most Americans have never had real milk.

667
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,560
Most Americans have never had real vegetables or real cheese or, you know, those kinds of things.

668
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,920
Yeah, well, you look at what they've stripped out of it.

669
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,520
Yeah, so okay, but it would be good with cashews also.

670
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,600
Cashews really soften up when you eat them, but chestnut and cashew mix, oh yeah, it's banging, yeah.

671
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,080
That's what I call umami.

672
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:39,180
Umami is like another flavor which is just simply delicious, you know, like if you've ever been around Japanese and they really enjoy food, they go, oh my, you know, that's like delicious, yum, that's their yum, right?

673
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:48,840
Yeah, so I would say that non-animal is the way to go.

674
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:59,500
You know, there's more nutrition pound for pound, believe it or not, but the thing that people need to again learn is technique in that as well.

675
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,860
You know, you've heard, I've mentioned before, the technique of you should chew your liquids and drink your solids.

676
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,380
Yes, yes.

677
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,220
I mean, don't guzzle, you know, move it around in the mouth for liquid, so you're chewing it.

678
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,100
Everything begins in the mouth.

679
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,880
Just drink the solids, you chew them until they're liquefied and you'll eat less that way.

680
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:29,520
I mean, scripture, I've been saying this ever since I found it out a long time ago, or not a long time ago, you know, let's see, 16 years ago.

681
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,920
It indirectly promotes a vegetarian diet.

682
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,260
Now, why do I say indirectly?

683
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:42,140
Because it states that if you touch the flesh of a dead animal, you're unclean, simply.

684
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:42,940
Yes.

685
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:43,640
Right?

686
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,160
So, if you're eating a chicken sandwich, are you touching the flesh of a dead animal?

687
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,480
Right?

688
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,860
I had once, someone says, it doesn't say eating it.

689
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,060
I'm like, so how are you eating it?

690
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:01,520
Oh, you know, there's an old, there's an old ghetto joke.

691
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,200
That was so good.

692
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,800
I didn't even touch my teeth.

693
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,060
Right?

694
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:04,520
Yeah.

695
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,220
Fascinated.

696
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:05,440
Right.

697
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,000
So, so yeah, so it indirectly promotes that.

698
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:20,880
So I would suggest it is noble to be quote unquote, vegetarian, you know, intake.

699
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,120
It is the most noble.

700
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,080
That's clear.

701
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,800
You know, from that perspective, from scriptural perspective, right?

702
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,060
Because it's not noble to be unclean.

703
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,060
It's more noble to be clean.

704
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,680
And if you touch dead animal, you're unclean.

705
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,620
Well, then it's noble to not touch that animal.

706
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,140
And if you're not touching that animal, you're not eating it.

707
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:45,960
Right?

708
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,460
I mean, you can say there are more different ways to say it than what it says.

709
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,680
That's why I keep saying it's indirect, but it's, it's rational, you know?

710
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,660
So I'd like to get more into all the recipes.

711
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,800
I mean, we will speak on food again.

712
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:10,100
Yeah, you had a pretty good role going on that, on chat that one day, and it was some very interesting preparations.

713
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,140
And some of them I'm definitely going to try.

714
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,800
Good.

715
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:15,520
Yeah.

716
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:15,800
Good.

717
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:24,200
Now, the, unfortunately, the most variety you're going to get is in the Asian and Middle Eastern cultures, when it comes to non meat eating variety.

718
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:43,020
If you tell, you know, an average American, no meat, they think it's canned string, string beans, and pasta or rice or something, you know, right, you know, red rice, you know, they have no idea of, you know, they think they have to, it's a, you know, a freakish thing to get into whole foods.

719
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:49,680
All their food decisions are made by the stupid rectangle and media of some sort.

720
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,680
Oh, that sounds good.

721
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,840
And they're still promoting mythical calories.

722
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:55,820
Yeah.

723
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:02,900
You know, the definition of a calorie is, you know, one degree, one, right, gram, one degree Celsius of water, you know.

724
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,040
So, I mean, it has to be carbonized.

725
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:14,780
All caloric determinations are made by completely carbonizing the object where the caloric determination is being made.

726
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,960
So, if you are pooping, that poop can be burned.

727
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:18,900
Yeah.

728
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,140
Yeah.

729
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,820
And calories don't apply.

730
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,240
Now, if you're pooping charcoal, if you eat food and you poop pure carbon, then the calories do apply to you.

731
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,900
And we want to hear from you.

732
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,920
And they think that the energy that you're moving around and staying awake with is heat energy.

733
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,360
I mean, you talk about a useless trade like haberdashers.

734
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,040
Remember growing up?

735
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,700
Nutritionists, they're completely useless.

736
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,460
Yeah.

737
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,100
Yeah.

738
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,580
Yeah.

739
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,320
But that's okay.

740
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,400
You know, accommodate the morons.

741
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:02,860
You got to keep these morons busy because the last thing you don't want them switching from morons to barbarians.

742
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,180
Yeah.

743
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah.

744
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,660
Yeah.

745
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:21,340
You know, when barbarians, I mean, in the loose form, not the just, you know, people of barber and, you know, the ones that were called barbarians in a pejorative sense, but I mean, savage, barbaric, and just, you know, murderous, because it doesn't take much for it to do that.

746
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:26,180
No, the ones that are just here and there in the news are quite enough.

747
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,720
We don't need a whole group of the damn things.

748
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,840
The greatest curiosity is see how the gods are going to turn it around.

749
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,880
So people, all these morons, I mean, I'm, I'm watching.

750
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:46,000
See, the thing about prophecy is, you know, what's happening, going to happen, but you don't know how it's going to happen.

751
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:56,540
It's kind of like getting tomorrow's newspaper read to you in bits and saying, well, you know, a silver Corvette is going to, you know, crash into a burger joint.

752
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,380
And you're like, oh, which burger joint?

753
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,620
And where?

754
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,220
Right.

755
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,020
Right.

756
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,140
And I got to look around and where all the silver Corvettes are registered to.

757
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,340
Right.

758
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,820
And where all the burger joints are and see if you can go and look at all those spots.

759
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,600
And it'll happen.

760
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,520
You just don't have the exact.

761
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,380
I don't know when.

762
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:14,900
Yeah.

763
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:15,920
Yeah.

764
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:23,720
Where the Moons and the Greeks Israelites was a question posed in question or in the chat today.

765
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,660
It's a mixed bag.

766
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,120
Today is a mixed bag.

767
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,500
I would say the Greeks were, I mean, the Romans were Greek.

768
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:42,040
That's there is a small group, I would say, of people that would be identified as the true Romans.

769
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:52,140
But the population and the true Romans, let's say, that were considered, you know, to be as a culture were all Greek anyway.

770
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,260
If you go to the island, if you go to Sicily, the oldest temples are all Greek inscription.

771
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:06,280
Not because they were conquered by the Greek, but because that was the language which developed into Roman later.

772
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:06,800
Right.

773
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,520
And there's many aspects of it.

774
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,680
I mean, here, you know, in Italian or Greek, so we're not out.

775
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,960
So meaning, you know, you have one face, one race.

776
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,260
Right.

777
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,840
Literally is what it means.

778
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:30,300
But you could say that, you know, how Brazil was or is a penal colony of Portugal and Australia was a penal colony of England.

779
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:30,920
Right.

780
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,840
You could say that part of Italy was a penal colony of Greece, essentially, you know, as a culture.

781
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:49,880
But there were people, you know, that lived there and, you know, there's myths about it and there's some very sparse information about it, who the original Romans were.

782
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,540
But were they Israelites?

783
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:51,920
No.

784
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,280
Were they heavily, heavily, heavily ordained to be interacted with?

785
00:54:59,500 --> 00:54:59,820
Yes.

786
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,190
You know what I mean by, ordained to be interacted with prophetically.

787
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:05,770
Right.

788
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,540
Predestined.

789
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:15,820
Yeah.

790
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:27,160
And also to have the, to show, you know, to show the way for this lousy 2000 plus years, you know, 3000.

791
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,480
It's all been crappy, but don't take it personally.

792
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,540
You know, how do you just navigate it?

793
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,340
Right.

794
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,100
Right.

795
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,900
And watch to see which Corvette hits the Burger King.

796
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,080
All right.

797
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,240
I'm very curious about milk.

798
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,740
Well, I guess you should be.

799
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,660
As Vianney writes, I was very curious about milk.

800
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:57,100
Well, there's stuff in milk that is, well, milk is intended for baby cows.

801
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:09,120
And the, the aspect of using milk as it comes out of the udder is for a baby cow.

802
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:22,880
The most, I would say processing it into cheese or yogurt, you know, even though it sounds like a type of milk product or whatever is the smart way to take it because you're not a baby cow.

803
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,200
When you process it, you change it.

804
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:38,500
You know, when you go to a sandwich shop and you get a pickle, you know if I tell most people, especially in America, that's a cucumber, they look at you all funny because they've had a cucumber, you know, and that's what it is, the pickled cucumber.

805
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:38,900
Right.

806
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,440
But it's totally unrelated.

807
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:47,060
I mean, it doesn't resemble a, you know, a cucumber, fresh cucumber has a melon flavor to it, right?

808
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,360
Like a melon, right?

809
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,460
It's just, it's really, it's what it is, it's a melon.

810
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,160
What you pickle it and cure it, it changes it completely.

811
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,320
An alchemy.

812
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,200
It is a form of alchemy.

813
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,600
So cheese and yogurt and other milk products are more digestible than, than milk.

814
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,200
And if you were to do raw milk, that would be the best you can have.

815
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,580
But it would be a sustenance thing.

816
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,620
Yes.

817
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,460
You know, it would be because there was nothing else to have.

818
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,860
You would adapt and there's a reason.

819
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,240
Sure.

820
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,720
Like if I, like if I were told to eat pork, I'd rather eat what the pig eats.

821
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,160
Right, right, right.

822
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,580
Then eat the pig itself.

823
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,580
You see what I mean?

824
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,100
Yeah.

825
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,560
What is the cow eating, you know?

826
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:33,800
Yeah.

827
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,380
Why don't you eat what the cow is eating?

828
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,240
I'd agree.

829
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:43,540
Instead, you know, well, you know, yeah, I mean, they'll, you know, they, they, the cows are, you know, very interesting that way.

830
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:50,860
They'll eat all the choice stuff first and they'll go after all the other stuff down to the point where, you know, sometimes it looks like they're just eating dirt.

831
00:57:52,680 --> 00:58:02,280
But yeah, you know, I used to interact with people that managed like, you know, big money portfolios.

832
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:11,700
And when the whole stock thing went down in 2008, which I told them it would happen in 2006, 2007, because they were, you know, but I was a little late.

833
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:19,660
But anyway, I was on several conference calls and, you know, they managed, you know, billion-dollar private portfolios.

834
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,080
And this guy's personal portfolio went from 12 million to 3 million.

835
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,720
He's like, oh, I don't know how I'm going to survive.

836
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,680
And I said, survive?

837
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,000
I don't think we're talking about the same thing.

838
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,580
If I see a blade of grass growing in the median of the road, I know I could survive.

839
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,320
What are you talking about?

840
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:37,860
Survival.

841
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,660
Yeah.

842
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,540
What does that mean?

843
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,440
You know, so when you get down to it, if there's vegetation, you will live.

844
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,360
Now, there will be a point in the future, well, you won't have much time anyway.

845
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,540
The vegetation will all be gone, right?

846
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,520
It'll be all of it burned up.

847
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:55,880
Yeah.

848
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:02,720
But then after that, you won't be worried about vegetation being gone.

849
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,600
So anyway, yeah, you wouldn't be worried at all.

850
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,980
You know, it's another interesting thing.

851
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:20,340
It's not in scripture, but I would suggest that those that are left here, if there's no vegetation and the animals are fixing on biting your leg off, what are people going to eat?

852
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:29,560
You know, well, we've been given examples before in scripture when there was nothing to eat, they were given something to eat.

853
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,680
Remember the manna?

854
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,320
It's quite interesting.

855
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,360
The scripture everyone's going to eat.

856
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,780
Survivors are going to get manna.

857
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:44,520
But I'm just thinking, you know, you have to provide, just like when you throw someone on death row or prison or whatever, they still give you food.

858
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,440
I mean, typically.

859
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:46,360
Typically.

860
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,560
You know, I'm just thinking, yeah, they call it a rite or whatever, but yeah, so.

861
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,540
Yeah, last week, yeah.

862
00:59:54,730 --> 01:00:05,030
So, I would suggest, again, I wouldn't suggest directly, but indirectly as much as possible, a vegetarian type thing.

863
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,710
Now, vegan, a vegetarian diet, but vegan is something that comes up often.

864
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:17,570
Mixed review, vegan is excellent if you know how to do it, but what I have found, I'll give you, I'll share some personal experience.

865
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:30,270
In short, what you see in most western cultures as being vegan is white people that don't know how to cook, and when they make their food and it tastes bad and you complain, they say, well, it's vegan, that's why.

866
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,190
Right?

867
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,050
Where it's quite the contrary.

868
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:37,050
Properly prepared vegan food is some of the most delicious food you'll ever eat.

869
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,370
I'll give an experience.

870
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:48,430
About 35 years ago, I was at Thompson, Tompkins Square Park on the east side of lower Manhattan, and someone says, hey man, the Krishnas are coming, you know, they're gonna pull up with their Krishnamobile and they're gonna feed everyone.

871
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:48,930
Let's go eat.

872
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:49,370
I'm like, nah.

873
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,550
But anyway, I went there and I had the most delicious food and it's all, you know, vegan, right?

874
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,150
No animal products whatsoever, right?

875
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:55,590
Right.

876
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:04,210
So after that, we went to this one restaurant, maybe 10 years later, and I was like, oh, this food is dry, there's no flavor, and the waitress says it's vegan.

877
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,030
And I'm like, oh.

878
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,910
And then I went to this lady, she was baking vegan cookies.

879
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,450
You know, these are white people in a restaurant, you know.

880
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,630
And I said, these are terrible.

881
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:15,650
She goes, oh, it's vegan.

882
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,070
And I went to someone's house, says I'm vegan.

883
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,430
I said, this food is horrible.

884
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,150
She goes, it's vegan.

885
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,590
That's why I'm like, wait a second, it doesn't add up.

886
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:27,530
So when all the people that ethnically know how to do it, it's delicious.

887
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:31,670
And when these Westerners get into it, it's not very good.

888
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:33,790
Oh, I see what's happening here.

889
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:34,770
Yeah.

890
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,630
Leave it alone.

891
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:40,270
Just say you need to watch more late-night cooking channel show, whatever.

892
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:41,430
You just don't have it going.

893
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,010
So leave it alone.

894
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,270
So that's essentially what I found out.

895
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:53,070
And it could be some of the most delicious food you'll ever eat because there's a lot of various schools of thought.

896
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,050
Like one of the things I've learned, like you spice the food a certain way.

897
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:04,970
So if you were, let's say at the beach and you threw the food on the sand, the seagulls and the crabs wouldn't eat it because of the spice combinations, you see.

898
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,310
So it's supposed to only for humans.

899
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:08,630
And you know, you see what I mean?

900
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,250
So that's like one philosophy.

901
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:16,710
There are many schools of thought, but the Vedics, by the way, in the Mahabharata, were always the culprits.

902
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:20,430
They would be like the Sadducees and the Pharisees of the New Testament.

903
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,710
They were not viewed very well.

904
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:22,470
They were extreme.

905
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:26,770
They were dogmatic and deviant.

906
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,610
But you know, so everything is kind of backwards.

907
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,710
But this is a whole other conversation if you want to get into those writings and read them positively.

908
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:44,010
But I would suggest that, again, maybe doing future discussions on quote-unquote vegetarian applications.

909
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,290
It excites me.

910
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:59,770
One of the simplest things to do for people is, I suggest before you get into this or as you get into vegetarian type cooking, get as familiar as possible with Middle Eastern and Asian ingredients.

911
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:13,690
And then once you get familiar with those ingredients and you get the immediate satisfaction because the quick recipes and the quick combinations will yield good results, then you start to learn more local, and I mean cross-latitude substitutes, right?

912
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:14,550
Right.

913
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:23,030
So if you don't have tahini, which is sesame butter or paste, you know, liquid, you can substitute other nut butters, right?

914
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:27,430
If you don't have one type of grain, you could substitute it with another.

915
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,930
And so it's basically grains, legumes, which are beans, right?

916
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:31,510
And vegetables.

917
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:39,410
And you have to understand the use of root and leaf and spice and all that.

918
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,330
And you can create some really delicious meals that way.

919
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:50,810
And quote-unquote meat hearty meals, you know, meat substitutes, if you're living around the carnivorous types.

920
01:03:51,550 --> 01:04:00,150
I think here it posted, let me just read it again, it was the tempeh-chestnut mix.

921
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,730
Tempeh is a fermented dry soybean cake, right?

922
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,030
It's an easy way to say it.

923
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,130
With chestnuts, which are underused.

924
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:19,050
If you've ever had roasted chestnuts, that's a common thing, especially people growing up in rural environments or where they're available, you know, they split open and they have a wonderful inside the chestnut.

925
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:28,150
It's a sweet, pecan kind of, you know, it's a wonderful nut, or I don't know, it's a fruit really, what's a nut really, isn't it?

926
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:28,550
Yeah.

927
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:39,250
Now most dried nuts like walnuts, almonds, cashews, and things like that, when they're heated with moisture, they get soft, right?

928
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:40,070
Right.

929
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,630
If you've ever, yeah.

930
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:53,730
So, you know, when they're heated with moisture, they'll absorb the moisture and take on more of a softer fleshy kind of texture and flavor changes as well.

931
01:04:53,970 --> 01:05:06,550
So we can get into sort of describing quick meals and the best thing to do when you, let's say you, well just like anything, you know, like taking notes when you hear something new, right?

932
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,830
And you refer back to that.

933
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:17,510
If you're going to learn to eat vegetarian, let's say it's good to develop a menu so you don't have to wing it, you know, and go get some burgers, you know?

934
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,190
You see what I mean?

935
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:28,670
And also you have to be careful, there's a tremendous market towards the vegetarian people, like veg burgers and so some of that stuff is just crap.

936
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,690
I wouldn't say most of it, I haven't tried most of it.

937
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,050
I steer away from pre-packaged stuff.

938
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:51,470
But, you know, there's a big market, you'll see veggie burgers and veggie this and veggie that and soy this and soy that and especially to the American market, I would say the quality is spurious and questionable and I wouldn't, I don't, yeah, I wouldn't say that it's something that you should pursue.

939
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:52,390
Right.

940
01:05:53,410 --> 01:06:08,550
The pre-packaged stuff, now unless you know that it's a reputable, you know, and then you'll end up paying more pound for pound than a steak because you can get a lot of beef and chicken and stuff at just a couple of bucks a pound.

941
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:14,130
You look at a thing of high quality veggie burgers, you know, it's like not even a pound and it's 10 bucks.

942
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:19,210
You're like, uh, that's now I'm getting to the price of prime rib, right?

943
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,870
So it's just vegetables.

944
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:25,650
So they're telling you, hey, look, if you're lazy, we're willing to separate you from your credit.

945
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:26,670
Yeah.

946
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,470
Yeah.

947
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:32,060
So, all right.

948
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,900
Anything else, any other questions, any other considerations?

949
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:46,390
We had Vandy Man asking about, uh, let's see, only missing the milk with cooking plant-based substitutes give different results.

950
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:51,450
How about a shortcut pointer, please, for making sauces and such.

951
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,430
For making sauces and such, some shortcut pointers.

952
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,430
Oh, uh, let me see.

953
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,070
Only missing the milk with cooking.

954
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,710
Well, milk is a thickener by the way.

955
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:08,910
When I've made soups and sauces for people, especially if they're not tomato based, when I add milk, they're always wondering, oh, this is delicious.

956
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:09,750
How did you thicken it?

957
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,350
I said, with milk.

958
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:10,950
And they're like, what?

959
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,250
They don't think of milk as a thickener, as a flavor agent.

960
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,870
It has a lot of, you know, flavors.

961
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:20,010
Well, if you cook it, see, if you, if you warm it, it has a lot of flavor.

962
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,430
If you heat it, it doesn't.

963
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,230
But if you boil it, it does again.

964
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,570
Milk is one of these things, almost like onions.

965
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,110
If they were hard to grow, they'd be a delicacy.

966
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:34,330
You know how onions are sulfury and pungent when you cook them, they get really sweet.

967
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:35,470
Right.

968
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:40,890
If you had the transformation that takes place with an onion, if they were difficult to grow, they would be like truffles.

969
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,210
It would be very expensive, right?

970
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,270
Which truffles are not, by the way, lawful for me.

971
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,890
They're like mushrooms.

972
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:51,870
But, uh, I would suggest that, um, milk can do that.

973
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,190
But anyway, I just spun off on that.

974
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:53,410
Okay.

975
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,170
Given different results.

976
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:57,190
How about a shortcut pointer, please, for making sauces and such?

977
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:04,770
There is no shortcut for that because sauces, there's an entire school of cooking devoted just to making sauces and stocks.

978
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:23,210
And the simplest way I could say with a sauce and let's say such would be a broth in a stock and any other wet consistency, uh, would suggest that if you bring it up to a high heat and you see a foam or a scum or anything rise to the top, that is not one particular ingredient.

979
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,050
Skim it off.

980
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,370
That's all the undigestible stuff, you know?

981
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:44,290
Uh, the other thing I would suggest is, uh, you have to understand that, uh, if you know the ingredient, um, you, then, you know, each individual ingredient, what, you know, started, what combination is complimentary to the next.

982
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:50,410
Like, you know, for example, when you're making a stock or a broth with veg, if you cook it too much, you kill all the flavor, right?

983
01:08:50,529 --> 01:09:00,069
Have you ever, have you ever like, uh, cooked a carrot, uh, let's say for 15 minutes and it's got all the wonderful carrot flavor, but if you cook it for 45 or a half an hour, it has no flavor.

984
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,069
It's just like eating a vegetable fiber.

985
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,130
Yeah.

986
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,390
So yeah.

987
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,750
So, but you can cook a carrot.

988
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,930
I could show you a cook carrot for six hours and it'll have more flavor than ever.

989
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:12,810
Yeah.

990
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:13,830
How do you do that?

991
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:15,729
Well, it depends on how the heat is applied.

992
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,270
It's all about heat management.

993
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:28,729
Now, if you're going to get into gazpachos and things that are cold combinations or raw foods, the combination is more critical because you're not looking as a factor for heat to change anything.

994
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:34,490
You know, if you put raw onion in a raw, uh, sauce, it's going to be raw.

995
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:43,750
It's going to taste just like that unless you can combine it with something that will maybe direct the, uh, the palate somewhere else, but it, that it will not go away.

996
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,290
You know, that raw onion sulfur will not go away.

997
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:48,450
Right.

998
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:58,070
So, so it gets, if you get into raw foods, then it gets a little more complicated, but it, but then it's, it's still complicated when you're adding heat.

999
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:09,010
Uh, I would suggest always what, what I do just, and this is also very conscientious of the evolution, I should say the unfolding or the way humanity has been.

1000
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:17,370
I can give, this is, if I'm going to give just a short hint of an anything is inconsistent heat, unless you're baking a cake or something with a batter.

1001
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:24,330
Inconsistent heat is the key to delicious sauces and delicious stocks and broths.

1002
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:24,610
Why?

1003
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:39,090
What I mean by inconsistent heat, you know how people have a, either a gas or electric stove top and they set a timer or they set, they bring something to a simmer and then turn it down low and it's consistent, right?

1004
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,470
Food preparation was never that way.

1005
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:49,870
I mean, the thing is it could be with a hearth that is hot enough, but you always had varying temperatures.

1006
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:54,990
You know, let's say, imagine you have a hearth and it's not stone and you're cooking on it.

1007
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:58,190
The coals will burn down and then you add more coals.

1008
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:03,210
So as they're, you know, the food goes on, it's very hot and then the temperature drops a little bit or a lot.

1009
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,290
Then it goes back up again when you added the fresh coals, right?

1010
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,130
After 20 minutes, cause you're cooking, let's say a roast.

1011
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,110
So you have this heat that goes up and down and up and down.

1012
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:18,150
Now you don't want that for batter baking, you know, like a cake or something that could ruin the cake, right?

1013
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,070
Uh, that's why the best bakeries have very heavy ovens.

1014
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,350
But for sauces, what I do, I'll give you an example.

1015
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:46,210
If I'm making, let's say a sauce of any type, uh, I would, uh, bring it to a simmer, bring it down low and then turn it off, walk away five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, come back, bring it up again to a simmer and then turn it down low, 15, 20 minutes or so, turn it off, walk away five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour.

1016
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:56,170
You see, and then you, you, what happens is this expansion and contraction inside the, the, the ingredients, right?

1017
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:04,630
So when you're applying heat, let's say to a carrot, that's in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, you know, he's in the zoo, what do you, you know, thanks for the bath and he's slicing the carrots in there, you know?

1018
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:19,170
But what happens when you, when you, when you put the, I'm using the carrot all the time here as a reference, and as the temperature goes up, the pressure around the carrot increases and the flavors or the carrot material moves away from the outside.

1019
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:27,370
When you, but the heat, the heat changes it though, makes it more flowable because it, you know, the cell's being broken down, let's say softened up.

1020
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:36,070
But when you turn down the heat, the, the liquid around the carrot now contracts and it pulls the, the flavor out of the carrot, doesn't it?

1021
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:37,650
Versus compressing it in, right?

1022
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:38,230
Right.

1023
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:39,590
Right.

1024
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:44,990
And you just do that several times and you've drawn the flavor out of the carrot by inconsistent heat.

1025
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,750
That's why like the worst thing to me is crock pot cooking.

1026
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:51,330
All these white people think crock pot cooking is so good.

1027
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,990
I'm like, oh, there's no flavor.

1028
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,670
What is that?

1029
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:53,870
What?

1030
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:58,530
Yeah, I see there's like, you got this side and the other, but that doesn't, that's just, why?

1031
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,970
Because it's consistent heat.

1032
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:01,430
Yeah.

1033
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:05,970
Consistently, you know, for hours or whatever, eight hours, whatever the thing goes on.

1034
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,190
That's not how things are cooked.

1035
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:14,430
I mean, this is not how things, well, you can cook it that way, but that, it doesn't work well.

1036
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,450
Not recommended.

1037
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:19,350
For, for, at least for the, it depends on what kind of a palate you have.

1038
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:24,050
You know, if you're dealing with people, if you're dealing with people and you ask them, how is, how does that taste?

1039
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,030
And they say it's good.

1040
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,490
Well, obviously, you know, you have two, there's, there's a fork in the road there.

1041
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:38,610
One is you have to start explaining to them how to communicate what food tastes like, or they never, they're just not, they just not into, they're not attached to their palate.

1042
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:39,910
It's either good or bad.

1043
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,730
And they can't tell you what it is or whatever.

1044
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:42,030
Right.

1045
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,910
So there's several different ways.

1046
01:13:45,170 --> 01:14:00,290
Like a simple example would be salt, you know, a very good salt when you just taste it, let's say plain, you know, just a grain, it should initially be salty.

1047
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:07,250
And then it gives you the essence of the mineral is a little metallic, a little earthy, or whatever.

1048
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,090
And then it should have a sweet finish.

1049
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,590
That's how high quality salts are.

1050
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:13,030
Right?

1051
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,570
So when you first touch it on your tongue, you know, it's salt, you get the salt node going, right?

1052
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:21,210
And then it's what you look quality of the salt may taste a little earthy or metallic or sharp.

1053
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,890
And then it should finish off being sweet.

1054
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:32,710
If you get like the iodized salt that most people have a restaurant serve, you put it on your tongue, it's salt, and then it's salt, and then it's salt, and it's saltier.

1055
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:36,010
And it just has like this electric galvanic buzz.

1056
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:38,270
Yeah, that's not good.

1057
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:45,550
That is a chemical, I mean, byproduct that is a, you see, so like a high quality salt will always have a sweet finish.

1058
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,290
No, it doesn't make any sense.

1059
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:48,230
I try it, I don't taste it.

1060
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,370
I'm like, well, fine, it's not for you.

1061
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,110
Then food is either good or bad.

1062
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:53,210
You know, I mean, that's a whole other category there.

1063
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:57,450
Most people don't taste their food, and they don't want to know about tasting their food.

1064
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:02,030
And the only reason I'm saying it this way, well, you know, most people might say, well, that's not me Greek.

1065
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:02,330
I know.

1066
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:10,690
But I'm just saying, this is the if this was not the predominant mindset, you know, why is it you can't find good places to eat?

1067
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:18,450
You see, so I believe you summed it up once before standard American diet, sad, sad.

1068
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:19,170
Yeah.

1069
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:26,650
So again, giving the example with assault is is a simple way to, you know, understand the palate.

1070
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,290
Good analogy.

1071
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:40,200
You guys are not supposed to know that I used to do private chefing and all that other kind of stuff, too.

1072
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,300
So I'm not supposed to know that.

1073
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:43,660
Not supposed to.

1074
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,660
So anyway, you've never gotten that from the conversations.

1075
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,160
No, no, I don't think so.

1076
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,510
But it gets interesting.

1077
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:01,310
I think the food stuff is important because it's really the fuel, you know, in a different world.

1078
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,050
Yeah, yeah.

1079
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,390
It fuels the the the passions of the individuals, too.

1080
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:22,890
I mean, I think I've mentioned before, when I was out in the Midwest of America, various classes of people, meaning people living literally out of their cars, people living in trailers, people living in small homes, and people living in, you know, McMansions.

1081
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:23,690
Right.

1082
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:29,230
And they all whenever I stayed with any one of those, I felt sick because of what they ate.

1083
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,930
I'm like, are you joking?

1084
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,410
This is how you people eat.

1085
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:37,710
I feel sick, you know, in the Midwest.

1086
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,130
And the irony of it is that's where all the food is produced.

1087
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:42,670
Yeah, yeah.

1088
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,590
So I'll never forget.

1089
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:51,590
I can definitely tell just from listening to you, you have a passion, a great understanding.

1090
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:57,210
And it must have showed very well in your work and probably still does.

1091
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,130
I hope so.

1092
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:02,870
I try to keep to myself more than I ever have in my life before.

1093
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,570
But I just want to give a little food story.

1094
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,750
I was in an upper middle class place in the Midwest.

1095
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,570
And the lady says, preparing lunch.

1096
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:09,950
I'm fine.

1097
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:12,750
I walk in and there's a smell of like warm cardboard.

1098
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,730
And she has this big plate and I see these things.

1099
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:17,010
I said, are those egg rolls, empanadas?

1100
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,290
What are they?

1101
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,870
She goes, oh, those are hot pockets.

1102
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,430
And I'm like, what?

1103
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,430
I've heard of something on television.

1104
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,610
Let me just try it because it didn't smell like food.

1105
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,870
It just smelled like warm cardboard.

1106
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,690
Fat, smell the fat in the air.

1107
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,230
Yeah.

1108
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:34,130
And it just had no, it was just salt and some kind of texture.

1109
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,250
And I was like, no, thanks.

1110
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:46,480
So, you know, this is, I mean, this is the culture here, you know, and again, I'm addressing the American audience.

1111
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:52,060
Shame on you guys for, you know, having the breadbasket of the world, you know, which really is Russia.

1112
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:58,840
But the problem is you can't get, they don't have the infrastructure developed as known.

1113
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,740
They are now.

1114
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:00,400
Yeah.

1115
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,880
But America was typically with all the coastal waters.

1116
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,040
They don't have as many rivers and coasts to move things.

1117
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,780
They have to move by land, you know, and even though they have rivers, it's not, they're not as connected as well as here.

1118
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:22,520
So it's interesting how you have the most availability of food in what's called the states.

1119
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:34,220
But I noticed that you won't engage in the best quality food in the states unless you're on the coast, east coast, north or west coast, more towards the south.

1120
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,120
You know, that's where you have the European and Asian influence and demand.

1121
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:39,540
Yeah.

1122
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:47,500
So, you know, because they do demand it, you know, it's not this challenge.

1123
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:58,020
The biggest challenge, if I know I'm speaking to American audiences, anyone in the Midwest, and I start doing a cooking talk, it's like, where are you going to get the ingredients in the Midwest?

1124
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:58,660
Yeah.

1125
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,820
You're going to drive 40 miles to get a miso.

1126
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:21,640
And even if they know what you're talking about, you know, so, you know, I'm not, it doesn't have to be, I mean, there's many, you can make everything from scratch, but I'm just saying, I think one way to give immediate direction is for immediate gratification to, so you feel victorious.

1127
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,960
You know, you don't want to start out your journey and defeat.

1128
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,780
Yeah, right.

1129
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:37,540
You want to feel victorious every step of the way, and not to build a false confidence, but to to encourage confidence on a new path, let's say.

1130
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,760
Yes, yes.

1131
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:41,880
Yeah.

1132
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:51,480
So, it's going to be interesting with the food, but so far I've always kept it very basic, you know, very basic stuff with high success.

1133
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,140
Anything else?

1134
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,060
Anything else going on?

1135
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,000
I understand the talk of the palate.

1136
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,680
I was instructed how to eat and taste only in my late 30s.

1137
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,920
Anglo-Saxon diet is garbage.

1138
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,860
Yes, we, so we have a little confirmation there.

1139
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,280
We do have some confirmation.

1140
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:13,060
And so, one out of ten people agree so far.

1141
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,840
I think there was a struggle that was ensued.

1142
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,380
There was a spiritual problem behind that also.

1143
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:25,840
You know, spiritual meaning the people that, you know, that set the culture.

1144
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:26,660
Yeah.

1145
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,420
You know what I mean?

1146
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:28,740
Yeah.

1147
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,760
You know, and I've gotten into the, the...

1148
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,660
It was orchestrated.

1149
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,540
Well, the Anglo-Saxons were the Babylonians that did all this really nasty shit right after the flood.

1150
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:47,480
They were on the run, and they were so much on the run that even they couldn't even stay at the Mediterranean Rim, you know, the Mediterranean Rim where they could be gotten.

1151
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,620
They had to go all the way, way, way, way, you know.

1152
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:51,720
Wow.

1153
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:53,440
Yeah.

1154
01:20:54,820 --> 01:21:03,020
And, you know, not everybody, not everybody in the Middle East looks like when people, you know, say, oh, I'm not, I'm red-haired and really light-skinned.

1155
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,440
I'm like, yeah, so what do you think?

1156
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,700
If you came out of Babylon, you're supposed to have like dark skin and a hook nose with black curly hair.

1157
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,500
What are you talking about?

1158
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:17,280
You know, everybody, you know, that you had the entire, you had blonde hair, blue eyes in there, as a matter of fact, still today.

1159
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:25,140
So, and, you know, the Danites, well, we'll get into what people looked like back then.

1160
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,660
And the best thing, though, is to actually bring up some supportive material.

1161
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:35,900
Yeah, and the bloodlines, how that transfers, that'd be an interesting subject unto itself.

1162
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:49,160
Yeah, if you do, see, if you start doing research without doing research on what someone researched that someone else researched, you can get more objective, but you still, the shortcut is important, you know.

1163
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:57,400
You can see what people look like if you research on your own, but, you know, look at everything, you know.

1164
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:06,700
Like if you talk about a certain, let's say, bloodline or whatever, you know, in a conversation or even within your own research, you'll find a lot written about it.

1165
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:15,340
But that was written because someone else wrote something else about it that got it from someone else that wrote something else about it.

1166
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:21,160
So, you go through all that really quickly and see what the sources are and go there and start looking at source material as much as possible.

1167
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:27,870
I think they call it mirroring now on the internet, right, when you mirror something.

1168
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:32,290
That's been done by academia for its time immemorial.

1169
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,790
Yeah, yeah.

1170
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:40,810
I mean, that's why, you know, they tout Greek philosophy and you look at an ancient Greek and you're like, that's not what it says.

1171
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:46,690
Because they were mirroring bad translations, you know, from a thousand years ago now, you know, still in print.

1172
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:48,130
Oh yeah.

1173
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,740
Well, the Bible is an excellent example of it.

1174
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,800
Example, yes.

1175
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,260
We all know how that one got ended.

1176
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,070
All right, what do you think?

1177
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:02,390
How long have we been going?

1178
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:04,950
Let's see, let's just take a little peek here.

1179
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:07,310
We're at an hour and a half on this segment.

1180
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:07,990
Yeah.

1181
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:10,410
Okay, anything else from anyone?

1182
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,990
I'm not seeing anything.

1183
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,190
Let's see, you can take one more final peek here.

1184
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:19,450
Because we're not coming in with, you know, a subject here to fill in.

1185
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,290
So, this is kind of open.

1186
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,430
Yeah, and we didn't get any calls.

1187
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,630
That was kind of a shame.

1188
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:34,470
Oh, can Greek go into picking apart more lies regarding nutrition and about blood sugar?

1189
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,190
Is there such a thing as low blood sugar?

1190
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:47,090
Is anything true in respect regarding insulin and how the body handles sugar consumption?

1191
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:53,010
There was some study done on that about fruit and the sugars and, of course, eating of the fruit.

1192
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:59,570
You were also eating the stuff that helped break down the sugars out of the fruit.

1193
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,250
Okay, let's just go back.

1194
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:10,410
I don't want to get into the specifics because looking at the myopathy of the whole thing of nutrition is very simple.

1195
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:21,170
When you eat anything or drink water, if you go study, very often when I would do this in interviews, I would drop to the host what the intestines look like.

1196
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:26,610
And then I would show it next to what a steel-belted radial tire looks like.

1197
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:29,130
And there's almost no difference.

1198
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,290
Nothing ever gets through inside.

1199
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:37,870
When you eat anything, regardless of what it is, or even water, it doesn't pass into the body at all.

1200
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:45,410
It passes from the mouth to the anus and it goes through various induction centers, you know, the mouth, the throat.

1201
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,510
You know, you have taste buds in the throat as well.

1202
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:53,450
And it goes down to the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, large intestine, colon, and out.

1203
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,130
And by the way, most people eat, they probably have taste buds on their anus.

1204
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:15,470
But anyway, so if you look, if you study all of those, the mechanical or the anatomical aspects, and even though, you know, when you see across sections of the entire digestive system, those are from dead people, by the way.

1205
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:15,950
Yeah.

1206
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:21,990
Because they're not putting it under a microscope when someone is alive, especially in a cross-section.

1207
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:31,770
I mean, there have been experiments, you know, with digestion years ago, about 200 years ago, a guy came in with a shotgun wound in the stomach, and they kept it alive, and they kept putting food in there with a string.

1208
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:32,670
Do you remember that, doctor?

1209
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,190
Yeah, yeah.

1210
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:37,170
Yeah, wasn't somebody with a glass stomach?

1211
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:39,430
Yeah, or something.

1212
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,350
Yeah, something in that order, yeah.

1213
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:46,250
Now, remember what happens when something dies, it starts disassociating, right?

1214
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:54,210
Like, a cadaver flesh is not as firm and as ductile as a living flesh or skin.

1215
01:25:54,790 --> 01:26:07,410
So, remember, even though you're looking at all these anatomical diagrams, that is from dead things, and they still look robustly sealed, and closed, and hermetically sealed.

1216
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:11,070
Could you imagine how much tighter it is on a living being?

1217
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:12,170
Much tighter, right?

1218
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:20,010
So, when you see the distance between the cell walls and what's called an intestine, that's on a dead tissue slide that's been preserved.

1219
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:23,810
In the living creature, they're much tighter than that, even.

1220
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,950
Much, much tighter.

1221
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,710
See?

1222
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,950
So, now, let's fast forward.

1223
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:35,870
I need to leave, like, five years for what I just said to sink in, before I talk about anything else.

1224
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:47,130
But, what I mean by that is, if there's too much or too little sugar in the blood, or minerals, or whatever, how did it get there, if nothing goes in?

1225
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:55,570
Yeah, because if it went through the intestines or anywhere else, you'd be dying in sepsis.

1226
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,170
Yeah.

1227
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,570
That's right, you will die.

1228
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:57,770
Yeah.

1229
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:04,750
And, stop thinking that there's so many millions of doctors, and students, and universities that teach you get absorbed.

1230
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,630
Yeah, there's a planet full of morons, why should they be?

1231
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,790
Where did they come from?

1232
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:14,670
Where did your scientists, and doctors, and animaticians, and all these people come from?

1233
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,630
Alpha Centauri, Mars, Pluto, where did they come from?

1234
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:18,630
No, they're from Earth.

1235
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:19,810
Oh, oh, okay.

1236
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,970
No, thanks.

1237
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,650
Now, they've done a lot of grunt work, because, how do I know?

1238
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:28,490
They've taken slides from dead creatures, and cataloged them, and illustrated them, haven't they?

1239
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:29,510
That's a lot of grunt work.

1240
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:32,350
But, they can't see anything other than that, right?

1241
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:33,410
They can't.

1242
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:36,010
So, how did it get in there?

1243
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:39,170
How did any sugar, or any water get in the blood, and how did anything?

1244
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,370
That is the real question.

1245
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:42,610
What is the mechanism behind that?

1246
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:44,270
You see?

1247
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,190
And, there you will have your answer, yeah.

1248
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:48,770
Yeah.

1249
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:52,530
And, that goes on into specific things.

1250
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:57,570
So, how do, the best way to deal, you know, do the opposite for more effect.

1251
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:02,490
Sometimes, you know, something becomes too much of one thing, it flips, and becomes its opposite.

1252
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:18,670
So, in this case, if someone is diagnosed with a low blood sugar, that, unless you were, you came out of the womb like that, and developed into your formative years like that, if it is a later condition, that condition is done by two things.

1253
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:22,850
One, it's a, what they call hereditary, or genetic timing, right?

1254
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:27,010
And, the other thing, the other thing would be your behavior.

1255
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:31,130
So, no one knows how to remedy that, other than you.

1256
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,010
Yeah.

1257
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:33,770
It's obviously what you're doing.

1258
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:39,730
So, make a list of everything you do, or you've been doing something that's catching up.

1259
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,090
Yeah.

1260
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:40,410
Yeah.

1261
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,450
And, you find the structure.

1262
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:47,910
Make a list of everything you're regularly doing, and then what you think you should be doing, and then reverse the list.

1263
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:49,390
Yeah.

1264
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,250
But, well, you think you should be doing most of the time, people know.

1265
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:52,890
They'll tell you.

1266
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:55,270
Just like they say, well, where did the year go?

1267
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,190
It's December, right?

1268
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,350
You know, they're saying it, but they don't have an answer.

1269
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:02,690
Oh, yeah, I know I eat too many hot dogs for breakfast, right?

1270
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:04,210
You know what I mean?

1271
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:07,590
Oh, I know I've been eating too much meat lately.

1272
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,970
I know I should be eating less ketchup.

1273
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:12,210
I know I should learn how to cook.

1274
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:16,990
I know I should be using a gas burner instead of an electric stove.

1275
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:20,370
I know people say it all the time, what they should be doing.

1276
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:21,410
They have their answer.

1277
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:23,170
Yeah.

1278
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:25,130
They're answering themselves.

1279
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:26,610
Yeah.

1280
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:32,250
A good way to reset, this has worked with people before, is what's a reset?

1281
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,490
You know, if you fully reset a computer, you kind of go back to how it was brand new, isn't it?

1282
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,870
Don't you?

1283
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,390
I mean, usually.

1284
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:43,010
Let's say you reset it to the point where you have to put, you know, reload the operating system.

1285
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:43,490
Yeah.

1286
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:51,170
Other than what, you know, the hard drive will always mark that it's had stuff on it before, even though you don't see it, right?

1287
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:51,610
Right.

1288
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:56,010
But for all intent and purpose of this, it's reset from the beginning.

1289
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:02,290
Let me ask you, other than when you reset the human, don't you go back to eating baby food?

1290
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:03,270
No.

1291
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,910
Right.

1292
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:07,550
I'm not talking about, you know, mother's milk now.

1293
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:08,430
You don't need that.

1294
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:08,990
No.

1295
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:13,750
Even though it would be, you know, the ultimate reset, not necessary though.

1296
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,110
I would suggest going back to a baby food type diet.

1297
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:18,670
What does that mean?

1298
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:21,790
Broth, very soft porridges, purees.

1299
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,130
Think about it.

1300
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:23,970
Yeah.

1301
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:26,150
And do that for a month.

1302
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,670
Watch what happens to your body.

1303
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:34,650
I've told, I remember even myself, I did a vegetable broth diet for just four or five days and I felt renewed.

1304
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,950
Right.

1305
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:36,530
Wow.

1306
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:39,830
So, yeah.

1307
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,220
Interesting antidote.

1308
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,740
And then the scary part is when you go from a baby food, a baby diet, then to adolescent junk food, right?

1309
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:51,780
Yeah.

1310
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,560
And no, I'm serious.

1311
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,560
You will experience that.

1312
01:30:54,620 --> 01:31:00,680
If you do the baby food thing, you'll be craving double, triple cheeseburgers with french fries and melted cheese on it.

1313
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,060
Yeah.

1314
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:01,700
Sugars.

1315
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:02,580
Yeah.

1316
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,340
But you reset that way.

1317
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:15,180
And, uh, remember also when you told me about that with the sugars that you went to the store that one time to get some ice cream and, oh yeah.

1318
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:15,780
Yeah.

1319
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,020
Nobody getting your weight.

1320
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:18,980
I felt that.

1321
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,200
Oh, interesting.

1322
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:21,940
Yeah.

1323
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,200
Anyone that I once did the macrobiotic diet thing about 30 years ago.

1324
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,220
And, uh, and I still do by the way, but not strict.

1325
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,700
I understand the concepts.

1326
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,760
Once you understand the concepts, you never go back.

1327
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:41,200
Like once you know that the day starts at noon and the moon is the month you never, even though you may not use it, you'll never, you know, you'll always see a full moon.

1328
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,540
Or you'll see noontime.

1329
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,620
You're like, oh, it's tomorrow.

1330
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,040
You know, even though you see the anomalies.

1331
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,120
Sure.

1332
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:58,740
So the same thing, when you do the, when they're very dogmatic, I call them macro neurotics, you know, like you, you look too healthy to be eating health food, you know, kind of thing.

1333
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,040
But I did that really, I did a crash on it.

1334
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,920
And, uh, it was very athletic at the time.

1335
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,500
Brown rice, umabashi plum, uh, dookie beans, seaweed, um, and all this other stuff.

1336
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:15,680
And, uh, uh, I found myself getting up at two in the morning.

1337
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,640
Uh, I'll remember.

1338
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:24,400
And I go down the street to the convenience store and I went to the ice cream and the Oreo cookies and the graham crackers and those hit crackers.

1339
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,900
It's a dollar for a whole bunch of cookies, a HIT brand from Korea or something.

1340
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:29,620
Sure.

1341
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,940
And I opened them all that.

1342
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:38,560
And I sat there, I was eating it online, but I didn't care if I was getting to the register or not, because it was just, you know, I just needed to eat it.

1343
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,480
And, you know, I knew I was going to pay for it.

1344
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,660
And if anyone got in my way, I would just, I would have been murderous.

1345
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,060
That is the drive that I had.

1346
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:49,020
Wow.

1347
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:56,900
That is an intense, intense, uh, emotion behind the food that, and you said you've experienced something like that.

1348
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,520
Yeah.

1349
01:32:59,020 --> 01:32:59,280
Yeah.

1350
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,660
And it was, it was weird.

1351
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:07,360
I kept having these cravings that, you know, oh, you should stop and get a soda or you, you know, you should get this.

1352
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,380
And I turned my head, you know, just walk away.

1353
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:19,160
Because your body was, you know, imprinted and used to producing nutrition out of those things internally.

1354
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:19,660
Right.

1355
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,420
And it wasn't there.

1356
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:42,680
So I would, so I would suggest, uh, this is the way I suggest people transition diets with, uh, let's say if you want to go from, you know, uh, omnivore in meat to non-meat or, or anything, or vegetarian or any diet change, uh, set up the menu and the ingredients, start acquiring all the ingredients in the menu that you, you, that's your target menu, the way you want to eat in the future, right?

1357
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,720
Eat however you're eating now and start incorporating those new foods in there.

1358
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:55,340
And then over time, a few days or weeks, uh, start diminishing what, how you're currently eating and add more of those.

1359
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:55,980
Yeah.

1360
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,260
And then eventually you won't notice the difference at all that way.

1361
01:33:59,480 --> 01:33:59,920
Right.

1362
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,200
Got to kind of work your way out of it.

1363
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:04,700
Transition.

1364
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,320
Yeah.

1365
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,060
Yeah.

1366
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,620
It's like through the spectrum, right?

1367
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:13,120
You go from one aspect of the spectrum through the other, there's no boundary, harsh boundary.

1368
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:20,320
Actually in reality, when you run light through a prism, there are very harsh boundaries, but I'm saying that there's a mellow spectrum trans transition.

1369
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:26,820
You start incorporating what you, what you want to do, and then you start phasing out slowly and gradually at your pace.

1370
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:29,500
Some people can go, can just stop and go.

1371
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,540
You have to know yourself.

1372
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:31,320
Yeah.

1373
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,900
And if you don't know yourself, you're going to find out.

1374
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:42,120
Well, I did hit it kind of hard, but yeah, I, I, I can realize that more and more and, and it's getting better.

1375
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:47,840
It's a lot of that's worked out and I, I feel a lot better because of it.

1376
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,100
Yeah.

1377
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,120
Well, good, good.

1378
01:34:50,360 --> 01:35:03,780
The, the body will throw you down, um, uh, mechanically, just like if you misuse a car, you know, no matter what kind of a car it is or you don't maintain it, you know, you say, well, I haven't changed the oil in four years.

1379
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,260
It's fine.

1380
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:07,440
And then just one day the thing blows and you're like, everything was fine.

1381
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,320
It blew, you know?

1382
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,220
So you have to know what's required.

1383
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,080
And, um, speaking of which we, I think we, I think I've seen Wes.

1384
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:15,400
Yeah.

1385
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:22,100
Wes was one of the guys that brought up the question and, uh, I do look forward to that chat someday there, Wes.

1386
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,100
Okay.

1387
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,040
Yeah.

1388
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,700
So, uh, anything else or, uh, let's see.

1389
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,760
Yeah, we can probably do that.

1390
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,140
Let's see.

1391
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:46,700
There was one more, uh, however, hasn't it been shown that a person on what they label now as ketogenic diet, uh, will have ketones in their bloodstream after taking a blood sample.

1392
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,020
Apparently, well, the body produces that.

1393
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,600
Look, it doesn't matter what this, well, look, okay.

1394
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,400
That's the diagram that they, okay.

1395
01:35:55,540 --> 01:36:02,760
What happens is they've gone off to the extreme point where they're looking, uh, it's the elephant, uh, syndrome thing.

1396
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,760
They don't know what they're looking at so that, but they have to produce something.

1397
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,480
Okay.

1398
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:10,340
Put a label on it in other words.

1399
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,320
Yeah.

1400
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:17,740
Um, for example, if you eat a polyvinyl chloride PVC plastic, you swallow like a game

1401
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:23,580
piece, you know, a plastic checker piece, um, that will not show up in your blood really because

1402
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:28,160
your body doesn't recognize that as something like margarine, your body doesn't recognize

1403
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,440
margarine as something you could produce, but it recognizes some of the processes and the energies

1404
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:35,400
in the margarine and start screwing with your system.

1405
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:35,780
Right.

1406
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:41,380
That's why there was no, there was no heart attack or heart epidemic in the U S until they introduced margarine.

1407
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:41,880
Yeah.

1408
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:42,600
Yeah.

1409
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:43,440
Yeah.

1410
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:43,980
Yeah.

1411
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:47,120
It was margarine was injured and also iodized salt.

1412
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,380
Yeah.

1413
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,260
What was the big thing like that?

1414
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,240
Um, you know, there's, uh, go eaters.

1415
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:01,400
Remember that back in the thirties, twenties and you were given iodized salt in the early sixties.

1416
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,580
Yeah, no, no.

1417
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,460
I, yeah, yeah.

1418
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:06,060
That was, well, these are sick people by the way.

1419
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:22,980
You know, like for example, when you look at the high level medical people or Supreme court judges and, or high level attorneys or high level bankers, all the conspiracy theories you hear about their personal lives in reality, it's 10 times, they're 10 times worse than that.

1420
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,620
And you don't have to meet them to know it.

1421
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,900
It's obvious, right?

1422
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:30,160
It doesn't matter when you know, you're sharing a few stories on them.

1423
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,060
Oh boy.

1424
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:37,860
So, I mean, even recently they have a Supreme court judge that was found at a ranch, you know, died supposedly or whatever.

1425
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,540
And yeah, I mean, your mind can go with the conspiracies or whatever.

1426
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,820
I'm telling you it's much worse than you've ever imagined.

1427
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,160
So don't even go there.

1428
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:50,860
If that's why I think it's best that people don't know the truth about what's going on this planet, because I sleep at night.

1429
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:55,780
That's why I finalize it with the analogy of be thankful.

1430
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,640
No one came in and he pulled your liver out of your body when you're sleeping.

1431
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,140
That's right at that point right now.

1432
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,020
And you don't realize it.

1433
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:07,640
That's good that you don't realize it because it takes a very strong character to be able to, you know, relax into that notion.

1434
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:21,300
So, but when the body absorbs, shows things in what's called blood and all that, that's produced by the body, by influences that have gone through the body, not into the body.

1435
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:26,400
When you eat food, it doesn't go into your body, it passes through the body.

1436
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,360
Many, many different things.

1437
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,600
Remember old cassette VHS tapes?

1438
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:32,300
Yeah.

1439
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:40,500
There's not, the movie's not like being, it's not jumping off the tape into the VCR drum and into the wire and into the TV.

1440
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,480
The movie is always on that tape.

1441
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:47,420
As a matter of fact, if anything comes off of that tape, you lose the integrity of it, you see.

1442
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,680
It's induction, you know, that's happening.

1443
01:38:52,940 --> 01:39:00,900
It's really mind-boggling when you compare it to what we've been told how things work.

1444
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:02,700
You know what I mean?

1445
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,320
Right, right.

1446
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,380
So, so what do you do in this case?

1447
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:10,960
You know that, let me, let me just, this might be comforting.

1448
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:17,620
Years ago there was a study, this was done in the 50s, again it was done in the 70s and 80s and they stopped.

1449
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:20,300
I'm not sure if it was the Red Cross, I'm not sure.

1450
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:30,540
I need to one day look this up seriously again, but I put this away because it's not going to help, you know, society at large or even anyone listening because if they're still not going to find out how the body works.

1451
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:39,360
But there was a study done by one of these world health organizations and they, the study was about how centurions live, like people live over a hundred.

1452
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:49,760
So they went and tested, like went to like Hunza, Crete, Okinawa, places where they knew they would find a high concentration of people that lived at 200 or over.

1453
01:39:50,760 --> 01:40:01,200
And they're surprised they typically found these people, they were not bedridden, some of them were still getting up every morning and working, you know, in the field, doing agricultural work or smithing or something, right?

1454
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,120
Yeah, yeah.

1455
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:14,180
So, so they proceeded to take their vitals, blood sugar, blood pressure, and it was absolutely through the roof.

1456
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:18,780
I mean, we're looking at blood pressures like 170 over 200 and something, you know, it was at 120.

1457
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,420
And, and blood sugars that were 15 times acceptable normal level.

1458
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:28,860
And these are people that are 100 and some odd years old still working in the field.

1459
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,840
We're not talking about, you know, on their deathbed, right?

1460
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:31,620
Right.

1461
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:43,000
So they, and this was consistent and wherever they went in the world, the vitals of these people, these old people that were still full of vitality had horrible vitals, horrible vitals.

1462
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:51,120
I mean, if you were a Westerner and they read a blood pressure like that, they'd throw you in an ambulance, bring you to the ER or do a sneeze or whatever, right?

1463
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,040
Or put you on medication or give you insulin, you know?

1464
01:40:54,340 --> 01:41:01,260
So what they did was, yeah, I found this in print a while back and they stopped doing the studies because it went contrary.

1465
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:08,940
Now, this made complete sense to me, because at the time, let's say in bicycling, cycling, there was something called the fit kit.

1466
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:20,000
You see, unlike just a regular bicycle that you jump on, when you get into, just like any sport, whether it's a glove in baseball or a tennis racket or a bicycle or whatever, it has to be fit.

1467
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,680
You know, we're not talking off the rack.

1468
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:30,080
So how you set the seat height, the pedal cleat position, the handlebars and all that other stuff, people try to find a standard way.

1469
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,980
So what they did was they took the measurements of 100 professional bike racers, okay?

1470
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:40,700
And they averaged them all out, then they try to apply that as a standard fit kit to everyone.

1471
01:41:42,000 --> 01:42:00,140
And I'm like, wait a second, that doesn't work because a professional bike racer can nominally spend six to eight hours a day riding the bike, where if you find a local yokel who bought a bike because he thinks it's cool or wants to get into a recreational that rides two hours a month, you can't apply that average to him.

1472
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,180
You know what I mean?

1473
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,640
So that's what they're doing.

1474
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:12,280
When they're telling you blood sugars and blood pressure, they're averaging out from a study group of people what it should be.

1475
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:18,920
Now if they eat Hot Pockets for lunch every day, I don't care what their blood pressure is, do not compare mine to that, right?

1476
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,840
I don't want the magic cuff on me.

1477
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,140
That's the magic cuff, by the way.

1478
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:27,160
You know, there's no blood pressure, they put the cuff.

1479
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,300
That's the sphigometer.

1480
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,060
Yeah.

1481
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:31,840
Yeah.

1482
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,360
The sphigometer, yeah.

1483
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,320
Sphigometer, which literally means to squeeze and measure.

1484
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,440
So, yeah, this is what they're pulling on everyone.

1485
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:52,400
And they're getting away with it because it's not the medicine that they're putting on people.

1486
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,580
It's two things.

1487
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:57,820
They're getting away with it because, number one, its efficacy is very low.

1488
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:06,320
And number two, it's a testament to the robustness of the human creature, meaning the creation, how much of a beating and abuse it could take.

1489
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:13,880
Like I said, Midwestans eat at an average American white people family for a week, if you eat good food, and you will be sick.

1490
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:20,160
It's kind of like that movie, oh, a guy ate McDonald's for a month, do you remember that?

1491
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1492
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,060
Yeah, like that.

1493
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,740
So this is how people eat every day.

1494
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:34,760
That's why when you go, I mean, in public, the way people look and act is because if you go home and eat and live with them for a week, you will be sick.

1495
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:35,360
I will.

1496
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:44,140
And they're sick because of the way they eat and what they think, of course, also.

1497
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:59,000
But there's many levels to this, but the simplest thing is how and when are people going to understand how the body really works, because it's headquarters.

1498
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:03,260
And if you're deceived about headquarters, the only thing that'll go in and out is deception.

1499
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:11,800
So I don't see the possibility of people understanding how the human body works at society at large ever, until this is wrapped up.

1500
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:16,160
But in the meantime, it doesn't mean you can't just speak on it.

1501
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:31,300
And I used to, in private, get into long specifics about it, but ultimately, what works best for everyone is they know what they're doing, they know what they should be doing or could be doing, and that's the easiest way to change one's condition.

1502
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,760
The car is a metaphor.

1503
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:39,920
For example, I'll use an engine-driven wagon is what I mean by a car.

1504
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,520
I'll use a car for several years before I need brakes done.

1505
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:47,380
And then other people need their brakes done every six months.

1506
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,780
And you're like, what's going on here?

1507
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:54,160
And then you get in the car with them and drive, and you see they're accelerating, and then they slam it on this red light, right?

1508
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:59,500
And then here they go again, there's a red light, whoa, hit the brakes again.

1509
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,440
Okay, so they're racing to the red lights.

1510
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:06,520
And if you ask them, whoa, yeah, I know I do that, I shouldn't be doing that.

1511
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:09,620
Okay, you get into the car with them six months later, what are they doing?

1512
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,660
Still racing the red lights.

1513
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,140
They admitted that they shouldn't be doing, but they're still doing it.

1514
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:13,580
Right.

1515
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:16,580
That's why they need a brake job every year, every six months.

1516
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,740
Hurry up and stop.

1517
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,740
So it's the same thing with the human body.

1518
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:21,440
Yeah.

1519
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:32,340
But it's not completely the same thing, because if you think hot pockets are food, or canned string beans and whatever is food, right?

1520
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,140
Yeah.

1521
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:40,000
You probably will never, like you say, well, I eat too much canned corn, maybe I should eat more canned string beans.

1522
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,860
No, now you're stuck in the same mode.

1523
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,400
You don't that one, you won't be able to help yourself in that, you see.

1524
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,340
You get it?

1525
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,440
Yes, I do.

1526
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:57,500
Yeah, yeah, Greek, I ate too many canned corn, I didn't go to canned string beans.

1527
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,520
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

1528
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:03,940
See, then discussing this is, then, you know, we have to get more basic.

1529
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:09,300
And then ultimately, you'll find out they don't grasp what life is, the life energy, it's just chemicals.

1530
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,600
And then, then you chalk off another one.

1531
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:16,100
Okay, here's another 6,999,000,000 space eaters on the planet.

1532
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,140
What's that thing with beers on the wall?

1533
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:19,660
100 beers on the wall?

1534
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,680
Yeah, yeah.

1535
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,860
And beers on the wall, yeah.

1536
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,320
Yeah, 699,000,000,000.

1537
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,140
Oh, yeah, another one.

1538
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,120
Yeah.

1539
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,320
Oh, my.

1540
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:31,560
Yeah.

1541
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,980
So, you know, there's many levels.

1542
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,220
That's why the specifics don't matter.

1543
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:42,880
When I gave specifics about these things, it was not confusion, but it was a lot to tend to, not a lot of progress.

1544
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,000
When I just say, for example, eat seasonally, your body doesn't absorb anything.

1545
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:53,060
If you're not feeling well, it's because of your behavior, change your behavior, what you eat and all that.

1546
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:56,140
I get 100 emails saying, Greek, I tried that, it works.

1547
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,900
Right off the bat, simple, great.

1548
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:02,900
I used to get, you know, a sore throat in the winter every year.

1549
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,820
I listened to you say, I never got it again.

1550
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,280
Very simple.

1551
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:07,920
All right.

1552
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,580
Just keep it simple, broad strokes, general, and it works for just about everyone.

1553
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:32,700
And it's simple, and it's amazing how the obviousness of reality, the obviousness of any subject is not out there, not anywhere, really.

1554
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:43,720
You know, that's why, you know, the adversary, he divides, he confuses, he lies, and eventually leads to murder, because he was known as a murderer, right?

1555
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:44,760
Right, right.

1556
01:47:45,460 --> 01:48:00,400
Now, if you convince someone to go out and get a gun, and then convince them to shoot themselves, you know, by harsh, you know, standards around them, you're the one that really murdered them, even though they did everything physically themselves, right?

1557
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,640
Spiritually, you know.

1558
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:09,380
But legally, in a strict, by operation of law, they committed suicide, you see.

1559
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,720
So, right now, humanity is being murdered through suicide, essentially.

1560
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:26,520
But that's, I mean, it's not a surprise.

1561
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:43,650
Again, that's why there's no comprehension of ancient writs, because ancient writs speak very poorly of people, and anyone who tries to reckon that with the mindset that they think that what they see in the world is good, they're never going to comprehend the ancient writ.

1562
01:48:44,410 --> 01:49:05,690
But if you say, I'm looking for the truth, and you have two sources of reality, or perception, or information, saying that they're both good, but they're both very, they're opposing to each other, then they're either both wrong, or only one is correct, you see, because they both can't be correct.

1563
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:11,990
So, that's the other thing with the organized religion thing, you know.

1564
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,730
They're all wrong.

1565
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:19,630
That's why they're organized.

1566
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:28,830
Okay, anything else?

1567
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:34,310
Well, you see, I think we've pretty much wrapped all of them up.

1568
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,730
Yeah.

1569
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:37,590
Okay.

1570
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:39,990
Yeah, all right.

1571
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:42,950
So, you've got plenty of room on the server to load up another one, right?

1572
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:44,050
Plenty of room.

1573
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:45,150
Plenty of room.

1574
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:46,390
Okay, great.

1575
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:54,170
I just want to thank everyone who's come over to the chat and the emails.

1576
01:49:54,470 --> 01:50:01,950
I've gotten about 50 emails the past couple of days, and also donations.

1577
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:04,070
I've gotten a few envelopes this week.

1578
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:10,210
I appreciate all of it, and yeah, it just shows that it's not for naught.

1579
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:13,610
There's some reciprocation, and yeah.

1580
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:22,070
And for all you folks out there, we have another couple of months left here, another month or two, this one and the next.

1581
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:24,890
We'll see how the new year comes around.

1582
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:27,470
It's going to be the start of a new period.

1583
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:35,290
Keep yourself aware of that, and we'll get into more details probably on another Sonic event.

1584
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:41,890
Maybe we'll structure a Sonic event around a subject and keep that going this way.

1585
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:46,570
But the intent for tonight was to have call-ins, which didn't transpire, but that's okay.

1586
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,650
It worked out all right.

1587
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,190
We got some good answers, I think.

1588
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:56,750
And if you'll notice, no matter what subject, if it's, I like to have a Swiss Army knife approach.

1589
01:50:57,470 --> 01:51:07,270
It's just, you know, go back to the basics of it, you know, which is kind of difficult for most people, you know, because of all the distractions.

1590
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:08,790
Right, right.

1591
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:10,290
You know, so.

1592
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,910
All right, Bruce, thanks.

1593
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:14,790
Yes, I thank you as always.

1594
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:18,290
I've been enlightened again, and I'm very thankful for it.

1595
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:19,470
Good.

1596
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:24,370
You're welcome, and thanks for doing all your questions out there.

1597
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:26,510
It was much appreciated.

1598
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:34,170
It was an interesting set of topics, and you have yourself a good night, sir, and be well.

1599
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:36,230
Okay, you as well.

1600
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:36,750
Thanks, Bruce.

1601
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:37,350
See you.

1602
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:37,950
See everyone.
