1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
and most people will take their body as precedent over the other two and in a

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,840
way they should because neither the soul or the spirit could be animated without

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,500
it right so that when I say they don't the gods don't care about you that's

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,300
what I'm referring to they have no problem you know it's like you know if

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,500
they have like the news on you know the television show called the news on in

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,460
heaven how many humans died yesterday 80 million okay let me know when some you

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,720
know some real shit starts going on right so that's not the point the point

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,020
is are you looking at the obvious you know again people have asked the

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,200
question why does God allow all this suffering and murder and all that stuff

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,220
and death because they don't care about your physical state they care about your

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,240
spiritual state right how many times in prayer do you know you ask for physical

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,300
things or spiritual things Solomon asked for spiritual things wisdom and other

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,700
things have been asked but essentially it's a spiritual connection to spirit

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,860
beings your physical interest is secondary to them as a matter of fact if

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,760
you study some of the prophets they had been put through a living hell you know

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,780
parentheses you know right even Jeremiah if you if you're real slick you're

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,920
talking about reading the Bible getting a hang on the Hebrews handle mmm on the

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,300
Hebrew excuse me right before we got on something to do with Hebrew or Japanese

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,460
or Chinese or English has to do with are you are you paying attention you know is

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,880
it possible to have a roadblock I'm not a roadblock is it probably a robot or a

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,380
speed bump you know how the standard speed bumps are in Brazil and other

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,060
countries that call them turtles in their language right or increase okay

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,600
well is it possible to have a speed bump that's so small that you don't notice

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,800
but does affect the speed of the vehicle yeah it's called it's called a

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,260
rough road you know you ever go on you like when I travel around because I am

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,720
familiar with civil engineering and worked in that field whenever I get on a

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,640
road and I have people in the car I'm there oh this they rolled this up this

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,039
asphalt pretty good people like what you know or this right they use to course of

29
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:13,560
a grag aggregate on this asphalt like people in New Mexico they have a shit

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,660
crap specifications not all in Mexico most of it they use too large of a

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,760
gravel so wherever you're going you're gonna have more rolling resistance and

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,380
vibration right except for the big federal roads right certain places back

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,080
east it's really it's depends on how you mix the sand and the gravel to get a

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,780
really smooth and also if the asphalt is too hot you're gonna get washboard

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,520
effect bumpy ride if it's yeah right if it's too cold you're gonna get that

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,820
effect when they roll it if the roller is too heavy you know the roll out the

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,720
asphalt for the thickness of the asphalt it's going to be uneven so if you get

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,720
everything right you have a very smooth road right right but every road can be

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,300
criticized for its imperfections and that's that's what I mean it can be the

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,080
whatever state of imperfection you might be all the way to just a you know

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,420
completely deformed person on life support right is the whole scale but to

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,700
go back to what I was saying before if you look at reading it carefully in the

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,300
book of Jeremiah at one point he said he had an abominable an abominable thing or

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,280
an unclean thing that he asked to be healed and it wasn't I'm paraphrasing

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,660
here this is towards the middle of the the book and it doesn't go into it and

46
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,340
anything else or whatever and then after that he says that you know you're

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,860
like he tells the most high you're like a stream that doesn't flow your drive

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,120
oh and then he says well take it back you know because he's saying that in

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,980
front of other people right right so I'm not yeah I'm not discounting the power

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,980
of the most high or the hierarchy but essentially what I'm telling you is

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,300
they don't care about your state that you're in right now unless it's

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,820
predetermined to be rich or healthier or whatever or you pray and have it

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,600
mediated or you're just going to suffer with it or it's put on you you see so

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,400
very often in times in scripture especially what they call the New

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,740
Testament which you should avoid and I don't think there's I've only met a

56
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,899
handful of people in the past 15 years that I believe are competent to read the

57
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,520
New Testament the only reason why is because it's cumulative right the New

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Testament would be like master PhD level I'm not you know so if you just

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,060
started reading scripture a few years ago that means you're in the third grade

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,760
you're not going to go to you know fourth sixth seventh year college right

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,040
away right and if you do go there they're not going to start at the

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,400
beginning you know I've said this many times if you took like graduate level

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,540
mathematics do you think your first day in class you're gonna say okay everybody

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,660
this is a class 408 of abstract geometry we're gonna obviously start with the

65
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,280
basics 2 plus 2 class is what you know 6 divided by 3 is what they're gonna do

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,140
that in graduate level of college you think nope right you should have done

67
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,980
that are wise words those are wise right so when you get to the New Testament

68
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,040
you'll be wrapped around the axle you I assure you you will not comprehend or

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,660
understand anything being said other than articles and words like the and is

70
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,700
up-down hot-cold and you will only be able to use anything that you're

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,360
reading in the New Testament are over like an icing over a cake or a

72
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,840
superficial garment over a large body of mental modeling that's been done to you

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:47,460
through society church TV cartoons hearsay urban legend right so and if you

74
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,820
want to double on that I was doing some research on the King James because I was

75
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,180
actually talking to someone was pretty respectable the community yesterday and

76
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,480
there's a start of their Christian to go to church and just starting to learn the

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:06,020
Hebrew and it's painful to them because they notice that the discrepancies of

78
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,520
what they've been taught Christianity and what's in the King James is huge and

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,720
they don't know how to reckon with it right and and you can't it's just like

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,200
finding out like your parents are not your parents or you find out what you

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,300
know what's really in sausages or something right or you know those those

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,360
pork loins that they serve over at that restaurant is not really made of pork

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,780
but the homeless people that are no longer a hoops did I just say that okay

84
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,680
so yeah I'm not discouraging anyone I'm just saying hurry up and hurry up and

85
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,380
get to graduate-level thinking graduate-level comprehension of

86
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:52,620
scripture there there is no shortcut but there you can compress it so it is

87
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,100
like a shortcut right you know like one of the things I talked about I don't

88
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,480
really get into because more on the I don't want to sound pedantic use big

89
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Greek using big words man you got to keep it simple you know people don't

90
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,940
know like for you know I talked to people and they think hamburgers made out

91
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,520
of ham and I'm I mean that's how you know people are right so but in

92
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,200
heuristics which is a methodology of having like a tool set of things you

93
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,300
apply to solve problems very quickly versus going you know starting from

94
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,680
scratch right and like one thing in heuristics is when you're trying to

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,980
invent something you want to have as many failures as possible because that

96
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,340
just tells you how you shouldn't do it you know people typical people say when

97
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,420
they have a failure discourages them right but when you're on a research

98
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,240
project and you have a short timeline they encourage failure so like when

99
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,080
they're going to make something that hasn't been made before or designed to

100
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,940
be made and is not comprehended they actually welcome they hired twice as or

101
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,540
three times or four times as many people as they need and they just give them the

102
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,020
basics and they said start building this thing and the more failures they have

103
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,960
the happier they are because they're cataloging all of them and

104
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,900
documenting them as ways not to do it you see this is the opposite of how

105
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,920
people operate right but you know when you certain times old companies they get

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,800
to a point where all they want is failures because if they do succeed then

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,880
they they're cut their money their funding gets cut off right so what

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,480
happens with heuristics here would be fail as many times as possible and

109
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,360
and you welcome it meaning when you study scripture the actual failure itself

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,159
is understanding the misunderstandings that you've had you see but it's very

111
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,460
difficult right you know like I tend to be irreverent when when I can be and

112
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,860
when it's allowed like you know usually like with someone I was speaking with

113
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,380
recently I explained you know the different men and I said when Adam was

114
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,040
alone was either just jerking off in the garden he says oh he couldn't that's a

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,140
sin I said that deliberately I knew you know it would it would poke him the

116
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,920
wrong way because of his Christian background and I said no no no it's not

117
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,020
a sin I mean and I explained what sinning is and he's like okay now he was

118
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,380
he wasn't imploding but in a sense you know and it wasn't even asking the time

119
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,960
and telling him how to build a watch it was like imagine going to the kitchen

120
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,020
faucet and turning it on and it's like a fire hydrant right yeah so so I don't

121
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,020
know if anyone's here has ever worked with a three inch or two inch water main

122
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,920
it doesn't sound very big but it puts out a lot so so the the actually the

123
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,280
aspect can you fail studying scripture yeah of course you know so you need to

124
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,600
go through it now tie it back to what you were saying Bruce about the Hebrew

125
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:48,020
it's not about Hebrew what you can do for example is when you discover an error

126
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,260
a word meaning like for example sin in the New Testament doesn't mean what the

127
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,580
Christians think it means it means to miss the mark right so let's just put it

128
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,820
in this way if you had no desires can you sin and put it this way if you had no

129
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,660
desires and you sat in front of a TV and the remote never failed nothing ever

130
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,960
failed like your TV your beer your popcorn and and you slept there and you

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,840
had a toilet nearby nothing everything an endless roll of toilet paper there was

132
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:21,120
no way anything could run out whatever it could you sin no because you'd never

133
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,340
miss the mark right all right if you had no if you had no desires and didn't do

134
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,860
anything and everything was as expected and never attempted to do anything that

135
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:39,340
didn't work out can you sin no that's how simple it is right so it's another one

136
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,060
so another one is the concept of hell hell is the grave right and then there's

137
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,540
another place that's for spiritual beings or post-resurrected beings let's

138
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,160
say right which would be thrown in fire you know so those are different concepts

139
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,880
but 99% of the time when you see the word hell in scripture means the grave

140
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,980
now how many people do you run in the world and you say hell they think it's

141
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,760
you know this don't like this it like Satan's in hell right now you know and

142
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,200
all this crap right so just correcting that in your mind you know right so

143
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,780
you're correcting errors and so now when you're reprogramming yeah so the

144
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,000
deprogramming is where the mistakes are found and corrected and even though you

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,300
let's say get a handful probably a third of what you're still reading is

146
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,820
incorrect so you bite it you chip at it a little bit every day like when I used

147
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,680
to do restoration of architectural sculpture we get this real intricate

148
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,100
cornice piece would remove it make a model of it and it was really intricate

149
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,840
and I was like man I really you know this thing needs to be touched up in a

150
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,060
model to be made and I knew I had discipline that you don't sit there in

151
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,780
front of it for 12 hours a day for a month you just tell the client will be

152
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,880
ready in four or five months you do two hours or three hours a day on it right

153
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,700
right and you extend it out so you know because you're not a machine so the

154
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,040
mistakes on it right right because of what's gonna make you burn out his

155
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,000
emotions if if you were raised from a young child to do that for 14 hours a

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,880
day every day in and out yeah it wouldn't be no problem all that stuff

157
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,060
comes from the mental models and the image training and the culture you're

158
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:28,920
from remember the headhunter analogy right now so you know it's like when

159
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,080
people discuss politics I was scooting around a little bit on the internet I'm

160
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,500
not gonna mention any names but Ocelli I was gonna go into chat you know he's

161
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,460
always dishing dissing Trump and I was like why you upset at Trump because he

162
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,400
has more shrunken heads than you do anyway in other words it's like saying

163
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,580
you're all you're the same you're the same you know same culture you all keep

164
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,300
time the same way you eat the same stuff you have the same gods you have the

165
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,420
same interests you believe the same stuff I mean so what's wrong with the

166
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,860
guy you know he has more shrunken heads obviously right so you see there's no

167
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,940
way I don't see anything on the internet and and that's viable that I can

168
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,580
recommend to anyone even Jack Fresco which I find enlightening you know in

169
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,360
terms of his perspective being around so long basically you have you heard his 30

170
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,800
minute or there's a 30 minute YouTube where he's in England and he's real old

171
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
and he's saying take your Norman American which means fucked up and

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,480
that one that's really funny no no yeah I also drop a link and he got he's got

173
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,660
it as he got older he realized it wasn't going anywhere like Trevor Trevor at 91

174
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,020
it's funny I bring up Trevor because I pulled out a box and have all the stuff

175
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,220
that he sent me it's notes I got about an inch and a half thick of unpublished

176
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,260
and some of it published in original photographs and designs from Trevor you

177
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,120
can tell he's real old and he's on some kind of medication because when he's

178
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,980
writing his return address and his name it's on an angle right and then the

179
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,120
other times on different but anyway we've talked about chemistry does that

180
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,620
when I first started discussing things with Trevor is like no no no you can't

181
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,360
do that because it might cause some bad weather well like three years later he's

182
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,080
like screw it man I told me no through a tornado down here took out the county

183
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:20,240
40 to 30 tornadoes and he's like good boy you know so it because he changed

184
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,280
because he realized you know I saw him in three years go for him oh you have to

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,500
be very careful in public interviews to private being asked through these people

186
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,880
they're evil they're shit they're crap you know you bring them yeah if you

187
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,240
bring a cure to cancer they'll kill you and they'll ignore you right but if you

188
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,080
tell him you're looking for a cure of cancer they'll they'll have all the

189
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,360
middle-aged people running out you know and donating right right

190
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,060
see Jack Jack you know so he's you know much shitheads on this planet so anyway

191
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,940
this is the majority now I'm not you know the exception is so few it's not

192
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,780
even when I say morons shithead scumbags on this planet it's everyone and there's

193
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,860
a small minority that's an exception but they're so small it's not even worth

194
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,580
mentioning right it's like you have a building that's 500 feet tall and the

195
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,100
next one next to it is 500 feet in one inch can you say they're the same size

196
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,600
yeah you can't you can't see the difference without a laser beam or you

197
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
know a very accurate water level they look the same you see what I mean

198
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,400
there's no it was very very look even Jack Fresco talked about there's no way

199
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,600
you can change into ways and society has to collapse or go away or whatever and

200
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,560
still you know someone sent me a link and somebody says all these false flags

201
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,380
need to go away so go back to a harmonious world is that oh what an

202
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,260
idiot I can't work with someone go back to a harmonious world since when did you

203
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,920
have a harmonious world when you've been in the shithole with the gods the

204
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,520
gods you know you're in the shit with the gods right the good ones and the

205
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,380
bad ones you know you know what I mean so so here's the bottom line work China

206
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,400
was gonna be investigating weather modification in order to take care of

207
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:05,300
fires we got a few years ago more of four years ago and there might even be

208
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,240
some people listening that can that know this is true someone had some

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,960
contacts because I used to work with someone work with John Arava part of his

210
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,500
trust made like stealth materials out of nothing basically you know like Israel

211
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,860
got the paint put it on some 50 year old 40 year old jets and now they had still

212
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,780
planes you know I mean right it's basically if I could give you the

213
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,980
it's very easy to get some magnesium oxide with some silicone and various

214
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,720
other things but make a long story short this person John Arava's ex-wife was or

215
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,720
what he died his wife was a Chinese who had used to have tea with high-level

216
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,600
politicians in China and it ended up being she knew the current president of

217
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,300
China's wife and someone else that did business in Malaysia and China also knew

218
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,780
one of the cabinet people in the current government of China's three years ago

219
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,040
and we did a short synopsis on we did a couple of demonstrations on clearing

220
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,720
certain target cities that they gave us from here and we succeeded I actually

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,060
have all the reports State Department and all that right but it was a State

222
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,720
Department does a I'm sorry from the State Department website they do a air

223
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,339
monitoring for cities and we use that because it was more of a reference you

224
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,700
know as opposed to a private company you know so we took it from 900 parts

225
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,480
per mil per cubic meter or whatever the particular matter down to below 50 you

226
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,700
know anything below a hundred it's rare yeah so and then and then we stopped

227
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,820
within 24 hours I went back up to where it was you know and then we did it again

228
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,680
to show that it was not a fluke and it you know so anyway well the report got

229
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,320
on the current president China's desk and he looked at it about doing this

230
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,040
weather work and he says I'm not interested and he looked at the cabinet

231
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:59,780
people's but if you're interested you can do it I get it yeah okay let me

232
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,420
explain this for the people who are not too smart okay when you're a president

233
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,960
in a communist country or whatever and you're the king let's say and you say

234
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm not interested in it but you guys in my cabinet one of you might be

235
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,060
interested the minute one of those guys picks it up it's treason indirectly not

236
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,300
directly because even if he picks it up says well then I'll do it well isn't he

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,260
he didn't say don't do it but you're showing right that you're being a little

238
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:30,060
too ambitious here you see you know I mean mm-hmm that's like a Sun Tzu move

239
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:36,320
right so it didn't happen so now they're people no no because he actually did say

240
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,600
I don't want to do it but if you want to do it and that just shows who's gonna be

241
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,920
overly ambitious and they don't like like Stalin said always surround yourself

242
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,640
with stupid people so you can sleep because if you had smart people around

243
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,020
him you know you couldn't sleep right who's gonna kill me right make up a

244
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,520
story so so what they're doing now in China is there they picked a mountain

245
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,700
range and they're gonna use chemicals and I discussed this with Trevor a while

246
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,260
back says oh they're never gonna go for it I said I know but let's try it anyway

247
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,440
and he's correct you're not gonna get a cure for cancer you're not gonna get real

248
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,320
weather work that that makes the planet good let's say good conditions you're

249
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,940
never gonna get flying jetpacks you're never gonna go into space you're never

250
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,880
gonna get a hotel on the moon you're never gonna get free energy you work

251
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,660
because that was around 50 years ago and you know you know I mean Newman and other

252
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,080
things I don't Ernesto dropped a bunch of links and I saw in the chat today I

253
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,280
think he dropped them in yesterday and I looked at those I said man how did he

254
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,600
hack into my bookmarks so I had the same things book you know I was like oh no he

255
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,840
hacked into my bookmarks I went to check the computer you know because I have a

256
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,520
resource sniffer on it you know what I mean yeah sure yeah so I was just joking

257
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,200
yeah and then I dropped that image in if you're gonna copy my homework change

258
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,180
it a little bit shows the Quran in the Bible right you know most people are so

259
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,460
moronic they don't even know that the Quran was written by rabbis still you

260
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,160
know you know if someone asked you for the proof you know it's like well if I

261
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,140
say Mickey Mouse is a fictional character you need proof you get it

262
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:21,460
right anyway but anyway so you know because here look you got a guy that's

263
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,760
admittedly illiterate and the document was written 150 years later after he

264
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,120
died and about 90% of in it that has any lawful references direct directly from a

265
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,980
rabbinical commentary anyway okay so that's why I put it in there because it

266
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,420
had the Quran and the Bible I found a couple of other things on the rectangle

267
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,300
I put in King James Version inaccurate couple of interesting scholarly papers

268
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:55,340
done where the one guy says I've located 14,800 errors in the King James and I'm

269
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,060
like that's pretty good because I got about 5,000 personal ones and then I

270
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:05,900
estimate 27,000 you know errors in it right so it's it floats or it doesn't

271
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,260
matter to doors but here's the thing make mistakes but make the mistakes

272
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,900
knowing that you use them as a step on a ladder right no one builds a little you

273
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,620
know like no one no one by no one bought wants to buy a drill bit right why do

274
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,620
people dry build bits drill bits to make holes so if you're a drill bit company

275
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,380
and you want to promote your drill bit you don't promote the drill bit you know

276
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,580
it's coding it's technique you know it's quality because no one cares about

277
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,020
drill bits but if you have a drill bit company and you promote a better hole and

278
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,660
by the way you get it done with the show but then people will buy it you see what

279
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,100
I mean right right no one wants to read and study everyone wants to know the

280
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,810
gist of it I do but I found out I told you in the beginning when I hung out

281
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:58,450
with the Ernest L Martin crowd those old farts and the Armstrong farts and

282
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,370
the guys who came up with the Dead Sea Scrolls what's the keep forgetting

283
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:10,950
there are one of the guys here is in the they started the foundation in the 50s

284
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,910
when they found the Dead Sea Scrolls they didn't take interest the full

285
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,150
bright or all bright or something like that all these people that you know what

286
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,610
they're assholes I'm not afraid of saying it why because when what they do

287
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,870
is it's like the alternative media which is all a bunch of assholes anyway what

288
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,990
they do is like that oh yeah the mainstream is lying to us but we're not

289
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,550
going to do real journalism we're just going to grab press releases and repeat

290
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,430
them based on what somebody else said you know they don't know anything about

291
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,010
how many times you alternative media cry about vaccines and ask them how does the

292
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,310
body work was it you know what are you talking about they don't know anything

293
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:52,670
none of them right so what happens with these people in the alternative

294
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,190
biblical study thing they grab a couple of concepts like the Hebraic roots or or

295
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,870
something you know we got you know whatever right you know the dark you

296
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,650
know the moon but it's got to be the new moon that the astronomical you know the

297
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,330
dark moon right or whatever they grab some stuff and they get a following and

298
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,450
it supports them you see and then they realize that as they're learning if they

299
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,150
change the following will go to pot right that's what I was told when I

300
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,190
approached a couple of old heads from the Ernest L Martin group and the

301
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,490
Armstrong group I said look there's no Pope's I didn't call Pope's work

302
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,210
schedule and I said the moon has got to be full because you can't measure in the

303
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,090
dark moon it's got to be noon look and they're like oh no no no you can't tell

304
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,310
people that because it divides them I've said this before right it divides

305
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,650
them and they and then we're not gonna they're not gonna want to listen anymore

306
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,750
so it's better for them to listen to the stuff they're familiar with and gently

307
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,090
give them I said gently gently these these are like baby seals ready to be

308
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,070
clubbed by the gods and you want to be gentle you know what I mean the gods are

309
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:03,110
ready to stop you like a roach right if you don't believe me it just wait 14

310
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:09,030
years and see or not even so I think the time for what is it kid kid glove

311
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,370
and you know as they go Greek a you know people think you're an ass you know you

312
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,130
get more flies with honey I said asshole I don't want any flies I want people if

313
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,970
I want to collect flies why would I be you know talking right right you see the

314
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,070
analogies that are given so I think right now if anyone's looking there's a

315
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,750
segue again so make mistakes but the thing is we'll get into the news of the

316
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,730
thing is you could read if you had a lifespan of 500 years and you read the

317
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,370
scriptures every day there's a possibility you still won't understand

318
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,310
jack shit in it right possible right slim you'll be able to cite it but you

319
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,050
want to be able to push it together right so ultimately it's a communication

320
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,990
debate can you have an accurate translation strictly in Chinese without

321
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,750
in other words make an accurate translation Chinese and then destroy all

322
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,290
the Hebrew and Greek that never exists on the planet you still have the

323
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:06,570
scriptures yes you do because it's accurately translated in Chinese but that

324
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,330
doesn't help you does it okay so it's translated into Bulgarian and then

325
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,390
destroy so the only record of the scriptures on this planet is accurately

326
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,730
in Bulgarian is it is it valid yeah sure it is you know you see because the

327
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,530
message is retained you see it doesn't matter what language so well the back

328
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,930
going back to the failure aspect of it I would suggest that get a methodology

329
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,790
that you know when there's an error in the King James or anything you're

330
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,350
reading in English you know there's a pattern where these errors show up you

331
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,390
ever notice that you ever notice the patterns yeah but they're ready well

332
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,690
shit well over your eyes with them Christian or Jewish crap right so

333
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,710
there's not gonna find any Muslim influence in it right because I was

334
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:58,880
way later and you know anyway the story the bottom line of the story is you have

335
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,460
two societies the things you see and things you don't see and perceive and

336
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,340
they made you and you got a 6,000 year plan and then you're gonna go to the

337
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:17,760
next level and too bad basically in between just tough shit and they don't

338
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,940
care about you sorry they only care about their own you ever read in

339
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,640
scriptures my people will know my name for example in the book of John he says I

340
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,400
want you to protect these of my own I mean my flock right so that's how it

341
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,000
goes sorry I'm not making this up but would you rather I made up some bullshit

342
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,640
and told you God loves you like in their language I'm going to tell you the truth

343
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,400
right there's plenty of places that anybody can go and say oh yeah the gods

344
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,420
love you the Elohim loves you know they don't that's obvious they're doing they

345
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,040
love in terms of doing the right thing which is not disturbing the plan and

346
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,720
making sure 6,000 years go by that's where the love is you see because love

347
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,160
like Jack Fresco said love is bullshit you don't even know what it means you

348
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,220
don't even know you're right would you be in love with yourself you know I'm not

349
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,960
meaning from a narcissistic but would you be with yourself right you know how

350
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,600
people separate in relationships right so are we still on the air Bruce yes we

351
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,110
are yes okay so you notice I'm not in the family hour mode anymore now I'm in

352
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,470
the right this street back alley modes and I think this is how it's going to be

353
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,430
from now on because pussyfooting around when you have seven billion people with

354
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,910
targets on their backs you know I mean and you're all a target until they take

355
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,570
the target off you know you ever see these to play pranks years ago on the

356
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,830
child they say hey they pat you on the back and what they did was they put us

357
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:55,990
thing that said kick me on it you know or hit me yeah yeah oh or you know if

358
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,410
you're in the Midwest you got sucker tattooed on white on your forehead right

359
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,090
or wherever if you're an afro that's tattooed in black or you see I mean

360
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,210
there's these things have been put on people and you're you're up Schitt's

361
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,690
Creek with or without a paddle it doesn't matter so the point here is this

362
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,830
is buck up man up you know they say man up whatever and enjoy the ride because

363
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:25,930
what you are going to be experiencing from here on out is you're still going

364
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,130
to have an availability of food water place to sleep you know I'm talking about

365
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:36,510
you know the general consensus you know relative amount of peace relative amount

366
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,250
of wealth and all that and cosmic censorship going up you're not going to

367
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:46,670
be suffering anymore any less than you are now you see what I mean so once so

368
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,090
just make the best of it you know if you're gonna you know make a meal and

369
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,710
you know you can make it better by spending 10% or 20% more time or even

370
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:02,390
twice the time do it so you get used to it you know and all that so in other

371
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,230
words it's kind of like if you had to go back would you do it all over again you

372
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,770
do it the same way I do it a little better so why don't you start doing a

373
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:15,430
little better right now you get it right whatever it is you know if you're gonna

374
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,130
do laundry you know there's a stain on that shirt just take the time and get

375
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,150
the stain off so when after you do laundry sales day didn't come out well

376
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:25,710
you knew there was a stain there asshole make sure it's off before it goes in the

377
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:32,110
wash right don't count on the wash taking it out is what I'm trying to say

378
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:39,930
don't hope for the best do the best so bad going back to your studies and

379
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,330
getting a hang on the Hebrew what I would suggest is doing a cumulative

380
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,310
report if you've ever known any mid-level management or worked in

381
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,330
mid-level management other than the people that you know you're managing and

382
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,770
the people above you one of the things that their mid-level management managers

383
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,810
are tasked with is to write reports familiar with that you know when all the

384
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:05,170
employees go home okay so all right so we're not going to say anything you

385
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,430
haven't worked mid-level management I mean you know what you you're making

386
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,370
six figures and and you know you got a minimum of 50 to 100 people under you

387
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:19,110
the upper they have reports that they have to put together to see that

388
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,930
comparatively to the reports are written before where you know how they're going

389
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,990
right and and now it's gotten to when everything is so rigged and screwed up

390
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,430
that no one reads them anymore so what you do is when you read scripture take

391
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,570
notes and write a report on what you've learned even if it's just a few phrases

392
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,690
every time you study don't rely on your memory alone because when you go back to

393
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,490
three or four or six months after you've been taking notes you're like I don't

394
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,190
remember writing that oh yeah I need to remind myself of that point you see

395
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,170
right a lot very often people say I'm going to take notes on the on the show

396
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,650
you know the sonic events and I see that some of some people's you know

397
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,610
courteously sent me that I'm like that's not what I said that's totally

398
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,850
jibber-jabber would mean a part of it was what I said but that's not the point

399
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:15,540
you see mm-hmm that's a very good good point just take so what you read like a

400
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,540
lot of these old heads when I say oh yeah I get a wide margin borrowed Bible so

401
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,960
you could put the notes in the corner no don't do that because if you give the

402
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,620
lose the book you lose you know keep them separate you know you can do I

403
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,100
remember I didn't really get into it years ago I had a personal recorder I

404
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,820
just made recordings you know I'll just talk to him and listen to it with those

405
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,520
little micro cassettes are kind of annoying you know they cost like nine

406
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,980
bucks for a little tiny remember those little tiny things it was like a size of

407
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:51,840
match yeah so take notes I mean I've got a lot of notes but the problem with the

408
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,540
notes that I have is they change subject because I've worked with you know

409
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,780
acoustic reproduction water or petroleum restoration work construction

410
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,280
automotive ignition systems high voltage stuff studying scripture doing mining so

411
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,930
when I have notes for scripture guess what else is in there all that other

412
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,570
stuff right so people say we look at you know so yeah you're not gonna understand

413
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,910
them anyway I don't even understand them I mean I do but you know for scripture I

414
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,910
have to sift through it right so you take your own personal notes and here's the

415
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,430
thing from I'm not altruistic you know hope for the best or whatever but you

416
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,930
know if I think I've gone through enough summaries of what scripture is and the

417
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,310
gods and all that in less than a few minutes or an hour even in the past right

418
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:48,790
so you have the the picture of the jigsaw puzzle if you got a 1 million

419
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,150
piece jigsaw puzzle you still need that picture right right to help you you

420
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,670
don't really need it because what if all the pieces were white and they're

421
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:02,090
not and if all the pieces were white there's only after a certain matter of

422
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,550
time you're gonna see the patterns repeat anyway it'll make it really

423
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:11,050
difficult so when you the reason you use the photograph or the image on the cover

424
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,610
of the jigsaw puzzle as a reference is for fielding what I call fielding right

425
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,470
right so if you have a blue sky with a white cap mountain and the mountains

426
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,710
black and then a green grass the minute you see all the green pieces or parts of

427
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,170
you start fielding you start grouping them together all the white goes the blue

428
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,750
goes together right and then when you have the a piece that's let's say black

429
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,010
and then green you know while that the green is towards the bottom and the

430
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,390
black is towards the mountain and then you have black and white all that goes

431
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:42,710
up you see and you start gent your first thing is you start grouping your major

432
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:49,950
things and then you right fitting it together now one thing what do you hear

433
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,290
me talk the first thing I'd like to bring up in conversation even I did with

434
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,810
them I can mention names Ocelli the last time I brought up the guy nailed to a

435
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,710
cross wearing a diaper if you ever hear me speak that's the first thing I bring

436
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,330
up when we discuss scripture why because he's the one that's going to explain

437
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,989
and he's the center figure and in the center lampstand is that's where the

438
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:15,650
center of the book is him I don't know like you know I got I think someone put

439
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,570
in the chat Thomas or someone that mentioned book of Joshua you know well

440
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,150
who's the king who's the head of the hosts you know is the angel of the

441
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,489
Christ right you see so he so now when you understand the Christ is not this

442
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,810
thing that the church has put in front of you the sigil or whatever crap and you

443
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,469
understand that is the main spiritual being when it comes to in you know

444
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,130
inter interceding with man not the main hierarchy but the main interceder right

445
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:49,670
when you see things happening like who put the order on Jericho for the walls

446
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,350
coming down people think it was sound they're still idiots that even a history

447
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,990
channel a built a big speaker trying to knock a brick wall down it did at 170

448
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:03,490
decibels right and yeah stupid stuff it doesn't superscripture doesn't say that

449
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:09,970
the sound knocked the walls down the Elohim knocked the walls down anyway you

450
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,450
know it's like there's no burning bush I think you're familiar with that right

451
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:18,310
mm-hmm so right yeah yeah okay so you have to know who the Christ is if you

452
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,790
always forget it you're not going to understand scripture that's assured oh

453
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,690
how many people think the guy who nailed to a cross wearing a diaper is really the

454
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,050
Christ Oh most people right and how many out of those most how many understand

455
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:42,770
scripture none none doesn't matter what lip service you get they don't so don't

456
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:49,330
be one of them go through it quick you know so the shorthand on the fast way to

457
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,930
slap someone around get them out of their stupor if they survive it or you

458
00:35:53,930 --> 00:36:00,210
survive it is identifying the real Christ right which is the the the largest

459
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:06,590
identity theft in the universe right or cosmic the identity of the Christ is

460
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:12,510
subject on one hand to the largest identity theft known to man but on the

461
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,010
other hand guess what how was he able to walk through people walk in front of a

462
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,150
crowd that wanted through a crowd and escape a crowd that wanted to throw him

463
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,250
over a cliff I saw a minute before he has the ability like men in black right

464
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,370
invisibility if you see if you see if you sat down if you knocked on your door

465
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,890
right now Bruce and he came and sat down here for three hours and he left and he

466
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,090
said you know what he looked like well I don't know he looked like a man right

467
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,810
that's it no other detail how tall was he well he wasn't too tall but he wasn't

468
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:51,110
short okay that's really detailed not you won't be able to you see so is it

469
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:59,270
to interrupt his presence in the mind or whatever form and never really does

470
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:06,870
speak about that either oh yeah you mean of course technique or whatever was no

471
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,370
the technique well put it let's put it this way other than having a phaser here

472
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,590
wouldn't you want to be invisible or you know not invisible to where if you're

473
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,930
not paying it not invisible to the point where if you actually if you're invisible

474
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,150
you can't see because you need that fleshy eye but to be like a memory you

475
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,950
know to be a really vague oh it sounds like what I want to be sometimes you

476
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,950
know because after a while you say why bother that's my thing from now on is

477
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,310
why bother you know and most people just sit there like lackeys by the way look

478
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:46,620
up the definition of lackey l-a-c-k-e-y and read it either at a mall just put it

479
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,720
in a search and the regular dictionary is fine yeah because we don't need to

480
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,920
know if it's French or German or Bulgarian or a baby seal or whatever but

481
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,040
you know I used to be I used to use that word a lot in the 80s when we used to

482
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,840
assemble crews of people and train them as though they'll be fine because you

483
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,360
know you work with them supervise them for weeks and months and you leave for

484
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,220
like half a day and you come back and everything's gone to shit you're like

485
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,520
how could it be how could it be they were doing great for six months and you

486
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:28,780
leave you know what I mean mm-hmm it's not bringing me l-a-c-k-y okay try that

487
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:38,040
one yeah it didn't work l-a-c-k-l-a-c-k-e-y or l-a-c-k-e-y yeah let's try

488
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:45,440
you only see there we go read it and you're running footman valet from middle

489
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:54,020
French l'acquiesce foot soldier footman servant a word of unknown origin perhaps

490
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:05,260
the old Provencal lackey see gluten covetous if you put it in a regular if

491
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,660
you okay hold on for a second if you just I also look at if you put it in a

492
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,340
regular browser search I'm let's see I'll just put in lackey and they usually

493
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:20,960
throw a Merriam-Webster definition a servant especially liveried for man

494
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,860
servant and then it gets more into it behave servile to you wait upon a lack

495
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:35,280
of somewhere lackey someone is not who does mental tasks or or menial tasks or

496
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,640
runs errands for another a server follower needs a boss right yeah yeah

497
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,220
so it's actually you you don't want to be what are they called the poppy

498
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,280
syndrome right which is you stand up you know the English say that mm-hmm and

499
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,580
you don't want to be when the world of hammers you don't want to be a nail but

500
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:09,960
the thing is essentially you're pretty much done for and it's so obvious what's

501
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,580
going to be coming in the next decade and a half or less right you might

502
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,320
capture yourself once in a while say well how come nobody else sees it right

503
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,100
but then you have to catch yourself again you know what I mean you catch

504
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,720
yourself again and you say no one else even sees how you don't absorb through

505
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,680
the intestines no one else is talking about how calories are absolutely

506
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,840
meaningless they tell you you know your body fuel you know like your body burns

507
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,300
up calories where mm-hmm you know stupid poop and travel aria yeah yeah

508
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,620
they don't know anything about the money system at all they just say well it's

509
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,480
fiat right it's not based on anything right well it's based on what I think of

510
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:03,260
the Persian water story every time they don't know how the weather works you

511
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,500
know they say the rains bring the the clouds are bring the rains but the

512
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,340
how they do the range in the cloud right yeah so 200,000 tons of water in the

513
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,020
cloud you know what happens when you have water vapor the gravity pulls it

514
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,000
down it's called fog there's no water in the clouds I mean they don't know

515
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,120
anything you mentioned that about watching a thunderstorm roll and I do

516
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,640
that every time I can you if you have if you have the right kind of polarized

517
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,500
glasses or polarized lenses I mean before they went mass production there's

518
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:41,120
a guy I knew who had a decommissioned military surplus yard and they actually

519
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,160
pulled apart an SR-71 I have some I shouldn't say what what I have from it

520
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,220
but I had some interesting optics right okay and you know like a you know like an

521
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,060
a six or eight inch lens that's finally ground for a spy plane I was tossing it

522
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,340
around the guys like you know that's thirty thousand bucks for that piece of

523
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:05,120
glass there I'm like oh okay but anyway so yeah so you know when you when you

524
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,360
have let's say a piece of glass that's polarized you know like mil-spec if you

525
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,920
hold that at the cloud or if you can get some really good aviators glasses that

526
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,800
are true polarization you know like not the cheap stuff right you'll see when

527
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,140
you look at the cloud you'll see no matter what color it is there is a dark

528
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,420
layer like I said you know as the clouds have a silver lining it literally looks

529
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,220
like a metallic shimmer underneath the cloud and there's a little dark sandwich

530
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,120
layer like mill of whatever thin it's almost unperceptible unless you're

531
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,480
someone tells you it's there and the what that's where the water is actually

532
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,800
forming just like a magician would do it you know but a magician is ledger domain

533
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,960
you know I'm not talking wasn't there someplace at the beginning in Genesis

534
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,580
where the mist rose up from the earth right I think yeah this is before that's

535
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,800
different oh okay oh this is for the plants yeah yeah yeah yeah that's before

536
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,600
the sixth day right yes so yes and then after also it's mentioned I was speaking

537
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,080
of someone also about there's a dark cloud surrounding the earth in the book

538
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:24,480
of Job I think it's called the NAFA off on off but anyway so basically you're

539
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,040
typical and even atypical you're exquisitely you know entitled classes

540
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,220
your professors your industry engineers scientists there don't know either any of

541
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,200
these things that we mentioned and there's the short list is a thousand

542
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,520
items by the way the long list you could say pretty much anything people are

543
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,560
interacting with are not familiar right with it so if there are so oblivious and

544
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:54,000
so central to everything quote-unquote everything with very little exception

545
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:04,040
right how the hell are they going to know prophecy it's not possible not

546
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,320
possible this is divine intervention which is coming which is possible by the

547
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,140
way and probable and going to be happening because there are places in

548
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,480
scripture where certain people are going to be given visions of certain things

549
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:29,440
you know with clarity right hmm so so yeah I think that the level of like no

550
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,400
more family our talk you know once Sam says oh you know you sound like a

551
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,460
Philistine now you curse a lot you're not polite you know look when I used to

552
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,260
listen to you like Shelley in the Greek you're older stuff and would Seth you

553
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:45,040
were really about I was like yeah so what you know it's all an act you know I

554
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,360
could what do you want me to be right right right you know this is war it's a

555
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,820
theater of war you know I'm not at war but you know you're in you know what do

556
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,140
you want me to say how do you want me to say it right I think when you're talking

557
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,360
to people that are going to be stomped like a roach in less than a decade and a

558
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:11,840
half yeah I think it's time to give them a little reality check you know yeah so

559
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,660
yeah but that but they have no sense of reality and they won't because of the

560
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,780
censorship they can't right it's not possible I've actually been around

561
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,040
people that teach a university and their feet in their own fields and I bring up

562
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,340
some points that are just obvious like an eight-year-old you know whether it's

563
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:35,060
chemistry whether it's a human body physics and they freak out I was once in

564
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,860
a parking lot speaking to some academics oh I was gonna I'm gonna

565
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,580
lecture on Saturday at the University of oh and I said well how about this this

566
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:48,620
and that oh no it's the Greek I gotta run to the car you know yeah yeah I'm

567
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,860
serious Wow so yeah I think getting stepped on is gonna be well-deserved

568
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:59,040
but but here's the interesting thing about all of this you ready think about

569
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,800
what I said earlier and this is the best advice you can get whatever you do do it

570
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,540
the best you can do it if you got a stain in your laundry don't wait for the

571
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,780
don't hope for it to come up remove it make sure and then do the laundry right

572
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,000
right yeah you know if you're gonna cook a meal and you hope that it comes out

573
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,170
well no just take a moment and make it come out well right you know if you're

574
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,030
gonna wax let's say a dark colored car and you look at your wax and it's white

575
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,870
and the car is dark look at some liquid shoe polish the liquid or pin drop it

576
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:36,230
in the wax and mix it up make it dark you know then polish the dark car with

577
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,810
the dark wax and watch what happens it looks like that just got painted you

578
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,410
know when I do a wax car I tone the wax and then people say oh is that a brand

579
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:50,310
new car no it's 15 years old you know it looks shinier than a brand new car right

580
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,510
because you know so you see what I mean it's just a point you know just a little

581
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:04,430
better yeah you know it's called toning so right anything you do yeah and don't

582
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,190
look for approval stop seeking approval you know if you have to have to ask

583
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,770
someone is it good or bad or how did I do it or whatever you're missing the

584
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:18,770
point you know because you that means that if you from the beginning you had

585
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:25,310
never considered that you were going to improve the the situation like you know

586
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,290
I can with Ocelli I said I try to leave people better off than I found them

587
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,610
right give them a little extra thing to think about or do or apply which is like

588
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,010
only three or four people can do anyway maybe it's like at the campsite you

589
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:43,270
always leave it looking better than when you came that's right yeah so you

590
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,350
do that anyway and then you don't need approval because if your help if you

591
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,990
know that the people don't know this and you can impart something whether it's

592
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:58,930
sonically or physically or even emotionally do it you know don't like

593
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,470
Jack Frisco says telling someone something is wrong doesn't tell them

594
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:10,910
anything right just evaluate it you go over and even what I tell people this is

595
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,670
not right I don't just say that walk away I say well this is you know right I give

596
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:21,070
an outline of what was discussed or how it should be or evaluate what was what

597
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,670
they're doing and show what was done correct and then and then what was

598
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,350
incorrect show them how to make it correct and then then there's no feeling

599
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,630
that they did anything wrong they just needed to do a little more and there's

600
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:39,350
no inadequacy or change the way to do it yeah right but if you're cosmically

601
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,230
here's the other thing I notice if you're censored cosmically whether it's

602
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:46,950
a little bit or a lot of Greek speak you're gonna run away you can't stand it

603
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,710
it's like those you know those insect repellents I think they're 27 K or 30 K

604
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,850
plug in the wall makes the high frequency you can't hear it yeah to the

605
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,450
typical human asshole the Greek speak is like that's like that repellent they got

606
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:14,450
to run away ah right so which is fine I actually that's that's a reality so the

607
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:18,650
the aspect of making mistakes understanding the Bible understanding

608
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:25,470
where you are at seeing how obvious the head it's so flipping obviously you know

609
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:31,430
what's coming and how it's going to come right but how can it be obvious when you

610
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:36,550
can't even pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel right that's

611
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:40,810
an old Texas saying right now because if you're looking for the instructions by

612
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,650
the time you just accessing the instructions the job is done you get it

613
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:50,430
it's one of those things so this is the majority of the people on the planet

614
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:57,110
it's a you know I don't think telling people God loves them where everything

615
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:04,830
is going to be all right is is righteous or proper anymore and it

616
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:10,350
hasn't been for a long time by the way so I'll tell you what God loves you

617
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:17,750
they're dug in pretty deep yeah the word love instead and the word yes the word

618
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,930
like God by the I mean the word love by the way I'm using God for anybody else

619
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,770
tuning in you know the word love means to do the right thing even when you don't

620
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,870
feel like it all right and how many people say well I don't feel like doing

621
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,650
this I'm not going to do it where's the love right like you ever see even in

622
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,950
Hollywood you know the guy who you know saves the lifeboat you know so the and

623
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:45,990
he drowns or whatever do you think he feels like drowning no you know he's

624
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:49,490
doing the right thing so next time you hear the word love just imagine it's

625
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,930
doing the right thing even if it inconveniences you or it's not your

626
00:50:53,930 --> 00:51:00,790
desire you see that's what it means and that's what that's why you know people

627
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,970
say you know God loves you I mean they can't even define that they don't even

628
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,370
of course he does because otherwise it wouldn't be stomping you and putting you

629
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,650
through whatever but you're not going to if you start asking questions why is

630
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,570
there so much suffering war why is a newborn baby thrown in a hefty bag in

631
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,430
the dumpster how can you don't understand what's going on here you see and those

632
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,970
questions by the way I've been asked by many people I've even heard of people

633
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,990
being in prison camps Oh where's God allow this it's like oh you need to

634
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:42,900
study you know so he does it to his prophets as well so because you're in a

635
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:50,320
physical state but essentially anything else anything else pop up on that chat

636
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,500
or anything else you want to get into Bruce or otherwise I could do what Sam

637
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:01,780
calls a little Greek rant I'm gonna let you take it for a ride nothing in

638
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:08,780
chanting I'm I'm just fascinated by the information that you're you're giving

639
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,860
and I'd rather remain silent and listen well that's fine but I brought up the

640
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,380
news earlier have you been watching international news and especially the

641
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,020
Middle East and anywhere else it's all the you know all tied together now right

642
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,020
you notice in Jordan almost on time Jordan is having not yet but they're

643
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,200
having they're firing the Prime Minister and because they have a king right

644
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,180
basically they have a king that you know perpetuity to that family rules Jordan

645
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,040
and he appoints a government you know you can appoint a parliament whatever

646
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,940
you know sections of government legislative bodies judicial whatever so

647
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,660
he's starting to fire and and you know do you remember any discussions we spoke

648
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:58,100
about Jordan being broken up right yes in the past yeah no start watching

649
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,800
Jordan Hezbollah in Lebanon is making moves as various types of Hezbollah

650
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,320
there's a you know there's a Saudi Hezbollah there's a Lebanese one you

651
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,360
know they're different regions but they're they're going to have an

652
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,640
interesting ride Israel is going to walk through that place and pretty much hold

653
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,180
on to it most people are not familiar that all there was a actually an

654
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:26,040
occupation of Syria the current president of Syria now his father and I

655
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,240
had occupied Lebanon for many many years was kind of brutal there as well

656
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,720
and pulled out mostly are you familiar with the occupation of Lebanon by Syria

657
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,960
no no yeah okay well so Lebanon is one of these places always been occupied

658
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,340
anyway and not always but predominantly right in the past century or so is very

659
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,540
hard time you know if you lived in Lebanon there's various groups they have

660
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,100
the Christian group the Muslim group and various groups in there and you know

661
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,640
Syria was in there till the 70s they're supposed to pull out they didn't they

662
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,340
were kind of I wouldn't say high-level brutality but you know they you know

663
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,920
anyway so now it's going to be Israel it's going to go up through there and

664
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:15,160
Turkey is going to keep moving tearing up that area you know Syria Iraq right

665
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,820
all these things are past the springtime going into the summer growth

666
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:26,900
pattern and then we're going to see in the fall what gets torn down right if

667
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,700
you're going to have anything coming this fall it's going to be you know tear

668
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:40,780
down break down right so we'll see you know we'll see how it goes but I assure

669
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,120
you in the three and a half to five years that it'll be very different

670
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:49,320
political scene and all that very grim I would suggest because if you say well

671
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,980
Israel is going to go through March through Lebanon and stay there right or

672
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,320
they could actually influence a different legislative body or government

673
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:05,080
political body you know that's more favorable right you know but all this

674
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,340
influence that's going to be the expansion of Israel I'm not talking

675
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,720
about the greater Israel plan that they you know have been talking the Zionists

676
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,060
I've been talking about for a while this is different and also the breakup

677
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:25,800
of Jordan and still looking for a Syria to come one of the things that made me

678
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,520
go mm-hmm about a Syria was the US is the US military knows lackeys they're

679
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,780
putting up a bunch of temporary military bases on the Nineveh Plains without

680
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,540
permission they just showed up you know with their macaroni and cheese and

681
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:48,720
chicken ala King and their humvees and they started making some impromptu you

682
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,660
know just military bases in Nineveh recently and they asked the Iraqi

683
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,080
government what are they doing there well don't worry because they can't set

684
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,000
up a base unless they get our permission but did they get your permission no you

685
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,580
know it's kind of like one of those all lackeys in there right now they're all

686
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,920
just censored and the they're all going to be like finger puppets to the gods

687
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:17,010
right that are sent down to do what they have to do so things to watch yeah

688
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,130
on the rest of the front you know here's the thing like I told the wife every so

689
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,730
often you know the food qualities no matter how much good food we try to get

690
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:32,790
is going down down down recently I got a Trader Joe's organic rice that you know

691
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:37,550
just on a pinch I usually try to buy it in bulk I couldn't cook it in other

692
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,830
words I so I think there's like it was hard as if it wasn't cooked then I cooked

693
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,830
it again it still didn't cook as if it was made out of plastic and then the

694
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,150
next time I soaked it for an hour and cooked it was still uncooked I was like

695
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,230
this rice is uncookable what did they do shift to like a non-human grade rice

696
00:56:52,230 --> 00:57:00,130
strand a straight strain or something Oh you see and so I don't know if I'm very

697
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,090
sensitive to things like that not peculiarly sensitive like allergies were

698
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:10,770
but I noticed changes a quality quality changes and I just say well a

699
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:15,010
couple of years it's gonna start getting rough on the quality and you know it's

700
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:20,850
interesting as you know that I rebroadcast the past sonic events on on

701
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:28,090
the stream one when we're not doing live and I had the fringe on in one of your

702
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:40,610
old sonic events and they were talking about the laboratory meat and I think it

703
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:48,590
was I think it was a fringe but it was a show where he started out by discussing

704
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:55,470
laboratory meats now being created and most likely in the markets and it just

705
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:00,270
kind of sparked my memory when you're talking about the race is like oh my oh

706
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,490
yeah it'll be you look start getting it'll get to the point where life will

707
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:10,250
start to become difficult for everyone but acceptable and noticeable by some

708
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:22,210
when I say some like three or four people yeah so yeah so what else in the

709
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:27,750
news you know I think I've spoken about animal attacks we know that's on the

710
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:32,170
rise more than it's it's there are more animal attacks than are duly being

711
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:37,730
reported if you know what I mean if you know how to if you know how to and no

712
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,170
one is it grab that bull by the horns upon attended and said look there's a

713
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:45,870
rise of animal attacks right right but there is and the other thing is you know

714
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,050
there's a volcanoes going off yeah yeah that shows just getting in your mind

715
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:53,870
there's asteroids comets hitting the earth or asteroids recently yeah that's

716
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,670
in your mind just get used to it it's going to be another thing reported on

717
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:06,750
that interestingly yeah I was like a five it was a 10-foot asteroid yeah yeah

718
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,250
I think it was it might have been reduced even smaller than that they

719
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:15,150
just estimated the 10 probably but still you get used to it you've already been

720
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:20,130
primed back in 2011 2012 with the Ellen in and the excuse me the other ones

721
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,790
that's already in the back of your mind it's going to be more and more normal to

722
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:26,510
me it's none of it is normal because I know what's coming I don't know how it's

723
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:33,510
coming I don't know exactly when but I do know that the the the times that are

724
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,990
broken up it's going to get more intense as we get towards the end right and and

725
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:42,590
people will be so modeled mentally or spiritually into everything's going to

726
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:48,090
be okay right that no matter what happens at that point those they're still

727
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:59,220
going to be hopeful of course hmm so again I wanted to touch back if to the

728
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,820
jigsaw puzzle and the picture on the on the on the box as a reference right when

729
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:11,140
you get a jigsaw puzzle when you're studying scripture and your grab let's

730
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:16,800
grappling for or trying to reach for definitions are you not not you Bruce

731
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,620
but in general is a rhetorical question are you you feel victorious when you

732
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,340
learn what a word means or do you feel victorious when you get more meaning to

733
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:31,020
the overall story is the question you see because there are people by the way

734
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:35,320
who are Hebrew reader Hebrew speaking educated in Hebrew who can't still get

735
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,600
the meaning of scripture for example I seldom speak with someone who's from

736
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,620
Israel I actually frequently not seldom about once a week or every other week

737
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,740
and they had not read scripture and since they heard some Greek speak a

738
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,500
year or two ago they started they picked it up say I could read Hebrew I could

739
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,960
just read it straight out of the Tanakh you know and because they were raised

740
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,580
secular right I think you guys are familiar with the story in Israel if

741
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,660
you're religious rabbi runs your life so most people say I'd rather be secular

742
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,240
keep those assholes away you know what I mean right they're not holy men they're

743
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:18,240
little Nazis no pun intended you know but the and I mean that more truly in a

744
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,260
sense because they are Nazis were not fascist it was socialists right right so

745
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,440
so you know most of these people that are religious leaders are socialist

746
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,280
right because they get a group together you know it's group groupthink as long

747
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,140
as they're at the top but when this person was reading scripture they come

748
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,060
back to me you know in our conversations yeah it's basically just like you say

749
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,340
yeah the the Elohim you know the gods basically say this is what you want you

750
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:46,580
to do if you agree to it then you do it if you don't do it we'll tell you you're

751
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,520
not doing it will give you plenty of time to straighten up and if you don't

752
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,580
then well you know the rest is on you because I'm gonna you know nail you with

753
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:58,100
it now right that's what that's what I hear coming back to people that are

754
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,040
familiar with the original they could read you know not the interlinear they

755
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:05,240
read the script straight up Hebrew but they still don't get the story you know

756
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,120
the connections and all that but they you know completely because they have

757
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:16,040
to meditate on it once they download it you see I hope that was a inspirational

758
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:21,020
example because here's someone whose native tongue is Hebrew and comprehends

759
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:24,800
reading it but they still don't get the full import of what's going on because

760
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,940
it needs to be discussed in to meditate on it they need to do read more I said

761
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:33,400
what about this so I need to read more to discuss that you know so what do I

762
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,980
keep saying go through it as fast as you can to get it all downloaded you ever

763
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,660
want to download something on the computer and you see the progress bar

764
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,020
right come on already download already you know what I mean

765
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:52,480
yeah so I can use it not now but later so get it in you as or past you know you

766
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,740
ever go on a road trip for the first time and the second time you have to do

767
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,940
it even if it's a long road trip you're like that's not so bad because you're

768
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:04,660
familiar with the road right and once it's a regular commute truck drivers are

769
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,220
interesting that way you know if you hang around with truck driver and you

770
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,100
want to do a two-hour drive to them it's like just like going around the

771
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:19,320
block right so it's a matter of what you're used to but essentially again

772
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:25,400
just to recap the gods have a plan to keep humanity within its own let's just

773
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,360
say human gestures influenced by certain entities that are not your friends but

774
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,380
will always portray to be your friends how many times have you heard people say

775
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:41,000
I thought he was my friend right and you your biggest limitation believe it

776
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,100
or not other than your censorship and how moronic people are is your physical

777
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:51,760
body and when you once you get the emotional part which is impossible to

778
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,660
have the emotions that you do without a physical body right mixed with the

779
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,980
physical body and you start asking questions again I'm repeating this theme

780
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:08,040
tonight why is there so much suffering war and harm to the physical body you

781
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,580
need to start putting it together that maybe the gods don't care about that too

782
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:16,200
much did you ever stop and think about that asshole I tell people you know

783
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,600
because they don't care about your condition right now you have to go

784
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,500
through a certain amount of time yes you can pray for help yes you and it's

785
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:30,560
exactly what will be happening you'll be praying for help you get it doesn't mean

786
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:40,040
you're going to get it right so you're you're kind of like in a situation where

787
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,680
people in general and have been for thousands of years where there is the not

788
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:51,760
just the river in Egypt denial but combine that with the censorship I can

789
01:04:51,760 --> 01:05:00,480
combine that with the various cultures right and you have humanity as you do

790
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:08,080
and it's the end of humanity 1.0 or 1.5 I should say but nonetheless I would

791
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:16,840
suggest that when you run into any body of information get to handle the all

792
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:24,880
information in context by understanding the conclusion right you're gonna read a

793
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,520
scientific document on what viruses are and it's a thousand pages long well you

794
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,100
should peek at the conclusion because the conclusion says even after all this

795
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,980
experimentation we still don't know don't think you're gonna read the whole thing

796
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:42,020
and know you see right that means it's a waste of time if you're looking for the

797
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,380
solution you can read it for the experience I remember we talked about

798
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:49,860
failures and but the thing is you're always going to fail researching viruses

799
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,260
because they don't exist as their as your you know they've been categorized

800
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:58,220
anyone can do a slight search and find that virology is part of toxicology and

801
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,360
toxicology is liver function it's basically your liver you ever take the

802
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,660
garbage out and and you have a hole in the bag and you take the guy you come

803
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:10,020
back to this drip all over is that all the bag was leaking from all that beer

804
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,000
that was in there whatever you know I mean you gotta mop it up that's what

805
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,360
viruses that's what they're calling viruses essentially so when you get to

806
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,360
the conclusion and you find out who what the main aspects are of any body of work

807
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,540
while you're dealing with the body of work or thinking about that subject you

808
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,040
have a better more realistic handle on the subject matter

809
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,000
when I run into college students in their textbooks I'm like so what do you

810
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,140
think of that Phil I don't know I'm only about a quarter of the way through the

811
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,240
book said asshole on the weekend don't you just grab one textbook and page

812
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:53,140
through the whole thing read the whole textbook not read it directly but page

813
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,260
through all of it go look at all of it so you know what's coming you might want

814
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:03,020
to drop out of that class like this will get some credits fool right right they

815
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:17,200
don't do that anyway but you know so the the understanding basically is when we

816
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,240
talk about the scriptures of the Bible or whatever can be unsurmountable

817
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,600
because you have the various aspects of going back to the original text which is

818
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,800
not even it's been also the original text has been adulterated slightly right

819
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,220
but then you have all this information because it's one of the most popular

820
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:38,140
subjects on earth that you have to undo in your own mind right because you've

821
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:44,580
been loaded up with bullshit right and then you might want to study the

822
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,920
interlinear and you see that it's not your language but you're familiar with

823
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,880
right but even with all that work you still may not get anything out here's

824
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,360
proof of it by the way I used to seek out biblical scholars you know I figured

825
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,840
when I wanted to get into scripture 1516 years ago so this is easy just like

826
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,040
anything you seek an expert in the field use them for mentorship for a

827
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:15,880
little while to put you on the right track right wrong boy like I said they

828
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,939
might have something they worked on for 50 years that they share with you and

829
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:21,859
book that just saved you you say thank you very much

830
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:34,600
you know I mean and you move on but essentially I have I thrown in the part

831
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,640
about the cosmic censorship is going to be lifted but then it's going to be so

832
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,800
thick meaning very specifically so everyone follows what the Antichrist and

833
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,160
his crew is saying and you're going to fall for that deception yes you do yeah

834
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,740
yeah okay so in other words right now that hasn't hit yet so right now there

835
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,020
could be discussions but when this young fellow he's in his early 20s about 20

836
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:05,439
something or one or so in the 21st year when he rises to prominence anyone I

837
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:11,899
assure you anyone and everyone listening to me will fall for it right so right

838
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,319
you know so there'll be absolutely no reason to be speaking then or before the

839
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:23,740
even slightly before then that's how powerful this is going to be right that's

840
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,979
yeah yeah I was even a recent conversation I said if I you know how to

841
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:32,680
go bet in Las Vegas who's going to fall for the Antichrist I bet everyone that I

842
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,319
know everything I had is going to fall for it that's a very safe bet how do I

843
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:43,819
know well that's what it says I might even fall for it right you have to be

844
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:48,380
really really aware and also you have to be given a few ounces of insight you

845
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:53,320
know cosmically into it right because it says even the very elect might even fall

846
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:00,160
for it that's how convincing it'll be right Wow so the Greek speak lackeys

847
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,600
that sit back and like what the Greek is saying and all that you don't do a lot

848
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,480
of homework are definitely going to fall for it you know because here you're

849
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,940
going to have a world system that's going to be talking about being lawful

850
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:20,660
and using biblical law right so you know so oh that's great I've been looking for

851
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:25,400
non-mixed fiber socks finally great this guy's great who's the Greco that

852
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:30,860
asshole now we got the real thing now look right you see what I mean right

853
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:39,880
there's gonna be a real real yeah you're gonna have to the thing is you'll be

854
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,660
able to enjoy most of the things that are being said and perhaps done I

855
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:49,120
wouldn't say all of them until it starts really getting buck wild like they say

856
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:59,000
down south and yeah everyone's going to fall for it and that's what I'm talking

857
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:08,420
about now is like 2025 2026 2027 right yeah oh that's so far away no it's not

858
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:13,460
blink twice it'll be summertime I'll be end of summer quick oh look at them you

859
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:20,740
know look at all of you and I are I went by oh yeah years ago years ago

860
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,880
someone says it's gonna take about two years like oh that long now it's a two

861
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,960
years oh that's fine yeah that's just right around the corner now hmm ten

862
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,940
years ago I remember like a year ago right what you call the Pope's work

863
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:38,880
schedule 2008 in the summer I could tell you exactly what I was doing where I was

864
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,260
what up what projects I was on what I was thinking what I was eating what I

865
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:51,680
was wearing everything like it was a you not even a year ago right so even 20

866
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:57,240
years ago I have you know extreme detail why because it doesn't seem like the

867
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:03,300
distant past at all does it seem to you ten years ago distant past blue no it

868
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,260
doesn't even seem distant right it seems like well within reach of your cognitive

869
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:15,840
memory maybe a couple weeks sometimes yeah but yeah exactly yeah so that's why

870
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,420
you know recent you say like Sam saying man I don't know Greek you're getting a

871
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:24,780
little brash and crass and Philistine like I'm like yeah screw it what I

872
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,260
haven't gotten much support or just a couple of pats if I got any pats on the

873
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:35,540
back for Greek speak it's because I did it myself I mean I do appreciate whoever's

874
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:40,480
contributed for cigarettes and coffee and the kind words and all that about

875
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,820
seven eight hundred emails and all that but you know that and two dollars get

876
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:49,220
you on the New York City subway right basically if I had it if I had to rely on

877
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:55,980
donations for subway fare I'd be walking right so clearly this kind of talk or

878
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,660
advancement of this kind of subject matter is not wanted right because if it

879
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,200
was for every moron that was listening to me would tell ten other morons and

880
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,260
they would tell another ten and we'd have something going where we could

881
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:12,700
actually form not a group or an organization but form a place where

882
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:18,200
resources can be pooled and things can be advanced you know something like an

883
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,040
order because these groups and organizations usually say that it's

884
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:26,320
usually something that has a head right you want to have a guy honest with you I

885
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:33,020
can't find one person that'll that would take the time to even listen we're just

886
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,720
you know and I'm thinking of this hypothetic you know just if I were

887
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:44,060
supposed to do it or want it to do it yeah they're not right no it's cosmic

888
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:48,560
yeah it's cosmic I'm not blaming the people that are listening or whatever

889
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,460
this stuff is so poignant and so true that when I say it's cosmic and it's

890
01:13:54,460 --> 01:14:03,190
beyond human culture beyond human control there's your proof mm-hmm

891
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:08,370
because I you know I have considered it many times but then I just kind of sit

892
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:13,650
back and think well well here's the thing cognitively cognitively and

893
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,630
intuitively I know this would never work I mean on a scale where it would grow

894
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:22,250
not now no and I've also I've also prayed on it and cast lots and every

895
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:31,320
time I did it it was no if I cast lots 50 times it was no every time right you

896
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,460
see so I'm not stupid I'm not naive you know sometimes Sam will tell the people

897
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:41,270
say oh you thought you were so optimistic well yeah that was an act you

898
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,350
why is it an act well because you know when you're going out in public you want

899
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:53,820
to look like a slob right now not that I want to look like a slob now but I think

900
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:57,500
people need to be hit across the head with a wet newspaper a little bit more

901
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:03,240
than they have been in their daily lives so and I know you're getting hit across

902
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,300
the head from your ignorance based on whatever personal relationships career

903
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,280
out there in the street and at home whatever I know you're getting hit

904
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,860
across the head left and right but in terms of this subject matter there's no

905
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,200
pull you know it's just like you know either get it or you don't if you don't

906
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:28,960
get it just screw you and if you get it screw you too yeah yeah mm-hmm

907
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:36,740
it's harsh you know it's like oh what is God love so much suffering okay so

908
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:42,760
it's pretty evident that the gods don't mind a hundred million dead in these

909
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,800
world wars or in America five to ten million outwardly killed by attorneys

910
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,720
and doctors right and no one's saying anything I mean they're saying but no

911
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:57,780
you know there's no you know anything direction to curb that right so why do

912
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,140
the gods allow it because what are they killing what are they destroying physical

913
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:10,520
stuff you're gonna be brought back later chill man relax you'll be fine yeah but

914
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,900
it hurts now and your emotions about that are contrary to the cognitive or

915
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,160
the knowledge of that because you have a physical body no matter how much of a

916
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,880
good mood you're in if you get up at 3 in the morning and get a glass of water

917
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,040
and you hit your big toe on the kitchen chair it hurts your emotion you're

918
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,700
gonna not gonna be so happy at that moment you know because you're

919
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:38,140
physically attached to it your physical body I mean why do you think people do

920
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:45,520
drugs because it affects the physical which then affects the mind and like

921
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,950
fresco says and I've been saying for a long time I can't do drugs because it I

922
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:54,920
find it to be painful you know if I take a hit off of what they call cannabis or

923
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,720
marijuana I'm like oh shit why did I do that ah now I got to wait like four

924
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:11,920
hours to feel good again so it's crap to wear off you know I mean no so but the

925
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,920
the aspect of knowing what's coming doesn't mean that you're going to be

926
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,060
better off what makes you better off because of you knowing of knowing what's

927
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:28,200
coming is that you you'll be better off now because what you're going to be

928
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:33,140
doing is striving for doing the best that you can right now in that capacity

929
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:38,300
you see in other words don't put aside don't say like oh well this is how I

930
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,100
always do things and it works out sometimes sometimes it doesn't know take

931
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,760
a break and see how you can make it work out favorably for you and everyone else

932
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,540
around you every time and you'll notice that it doesn't take that much more

933
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:53,940
effort in the beginning it might just like going to the gym right so what am I

934
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:58,120
talking about food clothing shelter food clothing shelter better food better

935
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:04,840
clothing better shelter you see and in order to maintain better food better

936
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,840
clothing better shelter however you're gaining the credits that you're gaining

937
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,480
you might have to be more efficient at that you know get more credits per hour

938
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,000
or however whatever agreement you have right so you can have the better food

939
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,340
and clothing and more free time to do those things right you know I mean right

940
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:34,660
yeah and in terms of health that ties in also in terms of health ultimately just

941
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:40,000
pray that your death is quick swift and painless but the longevity aspect I mean

942
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,780
what are you gonna you're gonna want to be around for the next 14 years that's

943
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:48,180
fine if you want to but you you're not you're not if you're 30 now you're not

944
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:54,640
going to be old right you might actually here's the thing 10% might survive in

945
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:01,600
actually 10% might survive what's coming and live in the next 30 or 40

946
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:07,780
years until the entropy begins to be reversed right but it's going to be you

947
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:13,560
know how they say hell on earth for 30 or 40 years after they were the Elohim

948
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,360
after the gods show up I never got into details on that I don't have many

949
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:24,100
details but what is given is enough I mean there it's not going to be like the

950
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,060
magic hour when they show up there's gonna be a lot of destruction and

951
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:33,640
they're not gonna fix it once they destroy it doesn't say anywhere they're

952
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:41,020
gonna rebuild anything does it no right it's gonna be like anyone who does

953
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:51,190
survive is gonna be in shell shock for about 30 or 40 years so yeah that's

954
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:54,570
sobering moment I don't want I don't want anyone to believe what I'm saying

955
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:58,350
at all unless they unless they could start validating the data and the

956
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:05,870
information and then you file it away as a known possibility and that's it and it

957
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:11,850
is a good belief if the information is good right correct you have the bus

958
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:15,430
schedule and it says the bus will be here in an hour well it's a pretty good

959
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:19,050
belief to say the bus will be here an hour because it's on the schedule and

960
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,210
they tend to be reliable is it here now nope did I see the bus nope anyone else

961
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:29,610
know about the bus see the bus nope doesn't matter you got the information

962
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:36,530
you know it's just data information that's years ago I saw people even on

963
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:41,770
consulting I say listen just this is the information ABCD or whatever is sorted

964
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,950
well you know it's communicated on an eighth grade level or less file it away

965
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:51,170
for later right how many times you heard me say that file it away for later can't

966
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:55,210
use it now what you can use now is food clothing shelter up it you don't get

967
01:20:55,210 --> 01:21:00,130
start to eat better start to think better be lawful find out what God you

968
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:04,990
get your law from you know these kind of stuff right that's what you do right now

969
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,590
whatever you're interested in find out really what it's about here's the other

970
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:14,870
thing um you let's just a little segue you want to really you want to do this

971
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:19,870
Bruce you want to really have a laugh okay you want to I want you to go to

972
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:24,210
your browser and put in MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology

973
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:33,150
just MIT nuclear physics curriculum and I want you to read it and just a preface

974
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,450
before you get it's going to be quantum this quantum that Schrodinger's

975
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:40,130
principles you know Schrodinger these guys were mystics right getting high on

976
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:46,310
acid and opium and talking about occult mysticism right I'm serious you know

977
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:51,550
bumping particles and quantum bullshit right you know you ever notice their

978
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:57,970
stuff electron proton gluon muon moron how it all rhymes you know anyway

979
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:02,590
morons in training go to the MIT I'm not so we're not going to mention any names

980
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:08,270
here just MIT nuclear physics curriculum see if you could find this I want you to

981
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:12,350
read off the courses and we're gonna have a good laugh okay because years ago

982
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:15,530
they say it's not rocket science you know it's kind of like a double you know

983
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:19,810
thing but if you tell any of these idiots that are on the planet today that

984
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:24,650
you are a nuclear physicist from MIT they go oh he's so smart right so let's go

985
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:31,650
let's let's go read their curriculum nuclear nuclear physics curriculum yeah

986
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:35,590
graduate or undergraduate doesn't matter it's all the same you want to go to PhD

987
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:43,250
yeah it doesn't matter go undergraduate first or graduate courses yeah we'll try

988
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:53,030
master of science yeah that's fine okay let's get to overview the object of the

989
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:58,430
master's degree program is to give the student as thorough knowledge of some

990
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:03,070
so just read the curriculum do they have bullet points for the curriculum so with

991
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:07,470
a number next to it you they do not this I know okay

992
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:16,590
here we go yeah nuclear reactor physics one engineering of nuclear reactors

993
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:22,070
probability and its applications to reliability and quality control and risk

994
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:29,350
assessment modern physical metallurgy or radiation damage and effects in nuclear

995
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:36,630
materials introduction to plasma physics MHD theory of fusion systems fusion

996
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:44,690
energy engineering principles for fusion reactors principles of plasma

997
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:51,730
diagnostics nuclear technology plasma is essentially high plasma is essentially

998
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:57,650
ionization yeah yeah and by the way when it says nuclear nuclear reactor design

999
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:02,230
is do you have a tea kettle right you know the concept of a tea kettle how you

1000
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:07,430
heat water yeah that's all it is good yeah see managing nuclear technology

1001
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:12,490
nuclear non-proliferation nuclear science and engineering laboratory

1002
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:17,470
quantum theory and radiation interactions radiation biophysics

1003
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:23,450
non-invasive imaging and biology and medicine nuclear science and engineering

1004
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:31,370
laboratory and then we're into thesis research department regulations for

1005
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:36,730
thesis yeah that's pretty much into that so the undergraduate though I

1006
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:40,550
believe is you know when you first get your feet wet in there here we go under

1007
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:46,570
undergraduate went freshman they're going to probably they get into quantum

1008
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:51,090
physics morons gluons prove you know morons and they get into Schrodinger and

1009
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:57,730
they get all mysticism stuff that in other words the people that all that

1010
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:02,990
everything that you have that's useful from a hairdryer to airplane engines all

1011
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:07,350
that has nothing to do with what they're teaching that everything that you have

1012
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:10,610
that's useful in the world even today that's being developed was developed by

1013
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:17,190
people like Tesla people like Steinmetz you know not Einstein not quantum

1014
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:23,730
nothing that's why nothing is happening but go to the undergraduate so because I

1015
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:28,630
just I just burst out laughing looking at Stanford looking at MIT here we go

1016
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:36,230
there was Chicago thermal fluid engineering one physics to calculus is

1017
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:39,790
the introduction to computer science we're really at the beginning here this

1018
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:45,630
freshman year let's get down to the juicy stuff physics three physics to

1019
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:51,470
calculus different equations you're talking to new equations like mother

1020
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:56,090
nature like mother nature as a calculator yeah go ahead right social

1021
01:25:56,090 --> 01:26:02,730
problems of nuclear energy electronic signal and measurements applied nuclear

1022
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:09,110
physics nuclear system design projects neuron and science and reactor physics

1023
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:14,590
yeah so tea kettle how to heat up water yeah how to heat up water yeah

1024
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:20,470
probabilistic systems analysis complex variables and applications let's get

1025
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:27,310
into some juicy stuff here thermal fluids radiation biophysics nuclear

1026
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:31,030
asking why a bucket ask them why a bucket of water weighs more than a

1027
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:37,970
bucket of air right anyway you know we're just get mostly nuclear analysis

1028
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:45,950
stuff quantum theory radiation interactions is that the one with the

1029
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:57,030
Schrodinger yeah yeah yeah anyway you rock whatever that is yeah when you get

1030
01:26:57,030 --> 01:27:00,550
into the meat of what they're outlining like when you go to nuclear physics for

1031
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:04,290
this or whatever and you start looking into it a little deeper you're like what

1032
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:08,910
a crock of crap no wonder they're not getting anything done what they're doing

1033
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:13,190
is looking at the plants that were built 50 years ago and painting and making

1034
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:17,610
them a different shape and color they cannot develop new technology it's kind

1035
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:20,510
of like the car theory then you know mm-hmm

1036
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:26,930
develop a new car every year have you know there's a guy I was I was going to

1037
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:29,990
be introduced to him by someone that knows him personally is so he's out in

1038
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:33,390
California I was not interested because I know none of this stuff because these

1039
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:36,130
are people want to do stuff to make the world a better place when I hear that I

1040
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:41,690
go away the opposite direction and I'll go home and rearrange clip my nails and

1041
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:46,810
take a bath and rearrange a sock drawer then go look at what they're doing or

1042
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:50,090
but I will be familiar with it here's something called the tiny but mighty

1043
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:56,050
engine so it's the T what you know tiny but mighty it's a Hispanic extraction is

1044
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:00,330
his name he has a small rotary motor I mean you could basically pick it up it

1045
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:04,630
doesn't look bigger than I don't like a round cylinder let's say we have a foot

1046
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:08,810
and a half in diameter and he has it next to a you know eight foot long diesel

1047
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:13,230
engine it's the same power right because it's it's like a rotary engine

1048
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:17,010
but it's not based on the rotary principle of the road of the wine kill

1049
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:23,430
rotary it's based on another thing and this is designed to do went around almost

1050
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:29,730
somewhat like in a triangle or something yeah well the rotary is like that yeah

1051
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:33,570
yeah wine kill has that shape but this is similar to that and the problem this

1052
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:38,650
was developed and or thought of 75 years ago but they didn't know how to do the

1053
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:43,590
timing on it and he came up with the timing on it right so and it's

1054
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:48,890
perfected it's ready to go but no manufacturer will touch it right because

1055
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,630
if you brought the reason there's several reasons why by the way anyone in

1056
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:56,590
any field that's in dimension the manufacturers go moot moot when they see

1057
01:28:56,590 --> 01:29:01,510
a vast improvement the other reason why it's called NIH not in-house development

1058
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:05,630
and they don't want to do patents but I'm going to give you a have a I wish I

1059
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:09,010
could get if it was 15 years ago I'm going to tell you just remind me what I

1060
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:13,030
would done 15 years ago regarding patents but the other thing is if you

1061
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:17,590
bring in this newer stuff to the people that were trained at MIT and all these

1062
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:20,230
other you they don't they look at there they don't know what to do with it

1063
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:23,830
there it's beyond it's outside of the scope of what they've been trained you

1064
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:29,830
see you know I mean because that's why you when you read that curriculum like

1065
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:33,290
the people who really design like nuclear devices for engineering or

1066
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:38,170
weaponry they don't use any of the stuff that they've learned in school at

1067
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:45,250
all you can't it doesn't work right the the the handling and the development of

1068
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,510
the materials you know the radioactive materials they don't use any of the

1069
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:53,890
stuff at all that was in the schools you see you know this all so don't the

1070
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:58,690
patents again let's sorry this is how you mess up the industry in a good way

1071
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:04,730
what happens is just you if you have an idea get into a publisher in the trade

1072
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:09,110
magazine or whatever and have them write about it even though it hasn't been

1073
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:13,310
developed yet and if someone a corporation wants to patent it they're

1074
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,790
not going to give them the patent because it's that idea has been

1075
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:20,910
published before not patented people I'm familiar with the patent office how

1076
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:26,850
they work okay so let's say you invent okay yeah they tell you if you read the

1077
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:30,670
patent law it's not what people think as a major well everything is

1078
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:34,710
misunderstood but this is how patents are misunderstood also if you have an

1079
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:40,650
idea of you know a thing that you know is a can opener remote control and a

1080
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:44,950
and a beard trimmer and it doesn't exist if you get someone in like the

1081
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:48,770
Washington Post to put a little blurb or you put an ad for it even though it's

1082
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:52,350
imaginary if someone wants to go patent it later they're not going to grant it

1083
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:58,340
because you had made it public prior there's several examples of that like a

1084
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:02,240
digital loudspeaker guy wrote an article about that in the 80s and there

1085
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,480
are people that wanted the patent office will not grant because they're citing

1086
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,940
this article from like 1986 and he says I totally screwed them up and no company

1087
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:15,040
will invest in developing it if they're not going to get a patent on it so what

1088
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:20,860
it's about time that anyone or the thing is that not anyone has ideas but what I

1089
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:27,840
wanted to do was start a website and plug it so it has high visibility you

1090
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,940
know what I mean anyone that has any idea just start publishing on the website

1091
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:36,360
and you know make sure the patent office knows about your website to totally put

1092
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:42,520
the damper on this patent madness that companies do because they're not going

1093
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,640
to issue them a patent if it's already been published right so if you got any

1094
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:52,020
cockamamie ideas technological or otherwise let's start publishing them so

1095
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:56,640
like the scumbags of GM or Apple or whatever want to go and get a patent

1096
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,020
they're gonna say no you can't because it's already been published you see what

1097
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:03,980
I mean at least everyone has access to it now right so I know some inventors

1098
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,760
and they're all scumbags by the way every single one of them that I've ever

1099
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:11,320
met the only reason I associate with them is to help them develop their

1100
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:16,460
products because I think they have merit but if you want to talk about poor

1101
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:21,880
character greedy assholes if you know anyone who's gotten a I was just gonna

1102
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:27,260
ask that if how much greed but and they and all none of them I've never met of it

1103
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:32,140
that knows anything about how money works or even the general field of what

1104
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:39,880
they're patented I'm serious and this is without exception so I think it's time

1105
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,940
that I mean some of these industries and these knowledge-based things get kicked

1106
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:52,720
in the shins so if you got some strange idea whoever is listening whoever go to

1107
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:58,120
a centralized place that is well-known could create it and publish it online

1108
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:04,760
right and get it so you know people see it is there a margin of how many people

1109
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:09,680
have to see this in order to be considered published if the pot and I

1110
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:13,920
think but the example that I gave anyone could look this up digital loudspeaker

1111
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,660
there's a guy wrote an article in the 80s and he says no no company will be

1112
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:21,440
issued a patent because he really screwed it up because he was just joking

1113
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:27,440
when he did it and no company's gonna spend all this investment if they can't

1114
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,500
get a patent on it they're not because anybody could do it right because they're

1115
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,600
greedy assholes right now it's not because they're greedy assholes like I'm

1116
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,520
pointing a finger it's the culture it's like I'm not gonna mention names and I

1117
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:42,640
went to a Shelley's chat room earlier tonight he's talking about about Trump I

1118
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,600
like why what's wrong why are you mad at Trump because he has more shrunken heads

1119
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,120
than you you see they don't people don't see what's going on they're all dick

1120
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:56,780
heads so the whole thing is if it's that simple to throw a monkey wrench

1121
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:01,760
into this bullshit industry of that humanity has created do it you got a

1122
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,060
crazy idea something that was you know a dildo of vibrators trims your beard

1123
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:11,080
washes your carp and it's semi reasonable go ahead and publish it so

1124
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:15,300
these guys later can't get a patent on it right so at least it's it's open at

1125
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:23,950
open source you know I mean right anyway but you tell again it's like the

1126
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:29,690
MIT I go to physics degree at a physics degree at MIT yeah right yeah in my book

1127
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:34,830
you're qualified you know I'd have to watch you washing the car you know

1128
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:40,130
because you're just a moron in training but but the thing is when you when you

1129
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:48,250
make it all open source like that it you know it has it's a double-edged sword

1130
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:52,450
also because it won't come into development right but on the second

1131
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,990
hand it's open sourced already you see you know you don't have this restriction

1132
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,670
see when people get patents and you know anybody if you go to the patent

1133
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:04,550
office by the way you can copy anything for yourself you just can't put it into

1134
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:09,050
commerce you can't manufacture it and sell it right and mass-produce it or

1135
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,510
whatever right but you can make one yourself there's no infringement there

1136
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:15,730
now some people have the misunderstanding that there is I've

1137
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:18,690
looked at some forums regardless very so you can't do it because it's patent is

1138
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:23,150
not sure oh yeah you're right I can't oh yes you can asshole you can do it you

1139
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:33,590
just can't go into business with it you see so anyway the aspect of of doing

1140
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:38,510
patents is limiting the accessibility to that for everyone right how many times

1141
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:43,790
like for example Apple if you have a good idea and you patent it Apple will

1142
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:49,970
will not use it unless they take over the patent they don't do little royalties

1143
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:56,510
there was a big that which there's a small company that makes compute computer

1144
01:35:56,510 --> 01:36:01,210
speakers only that small company there there's a few of them they're very

1145
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:07,010
popular those guys tell me was that the one with the cell phone no they what

1146
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:11,230
they did is they came up with the iPod before the iPod the mp3 on a without any

1147
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:15,990
rotating moving devices you basically you know stationary memory on a chip for

1148
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:20,110
music great great and Apple said that they did it first and there was like no

1149
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:23,850
way because these guys have done it first on Apple rewarded they got a four

1150
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:28,510
hundred and fifty million dollar reward from Apple because they have Apple lost

1151
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:33,350
to them so it's just a bunch of guys and they got 450 and a half a billion from

1152
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:37,190
Apple or something and now they just make computer speakers it's one of the

1153
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,730
computer speaker companies that are popular

1154
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:49,850
Wow that's all yeah so these are these are treacherous people you know people

1155
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:54,630
don't know I mean occasionally the it gets out you know like here's a I saw a

1156
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:59,050
clip with Trump this is just an example because I give political and apolitical

1157
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:02,770
examples what during the debate someone had asked Trump you know you had

1158
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:06,610
bankruptcy three times what about you know responsibility there Trump says

1159
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:10,170
that's okay because these financial people they're killers they're you're

1160
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:15,690
ruthless people and he shut up right away you know yeah you think Apple and

1161
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:19,670
Microsoft all these people take over industries and do what they're in Google

1162
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:23,330
because they're kind and nice you know in the British sense you know or

1163
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:30,630
whatever no they're ruthless you know downright cutthroat yeah yeah and

1164
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:34,470
getting an understanding of so not to go off on the patent as we're getting an

1165
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,690
understanding of what is controlling people because you see the word patent

1166
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:40,790
that there's a controlling element to it doesn't it oh we can't do this

1167
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:45,990
patented bullshit you know you can't do it commercially and actually you can if

1168
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:50,650
you understand how to go around the patent there are people you know and you

1169
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:56,150
should because there shouldn't be you know if there's a beneficial technology

1170
01:37:56,150 --> 01:38:02,270
it should not be limited it should be open-sourced right right and yeah and a

1171
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:06,030
lot of people that I have discussions with that are inventors I said well you

1172
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:10,710
know I can help you improve or we just have discussions but you know you really

1173
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:13,850
should be oh no no it's Pat it's patented it's under license like yeah

1174
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:18,670
whatever so this is how people are getting rid of greed aspect to you know

1175
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:22,450
that's never gonna happen yeah I mean I want more I want the most

1176
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:28,850
shrunken heads is what I hear them saying exactly yeah the the same thing

1177
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:32,970
as with the Bible there's someone had once sent me there was an audio clip or

1178
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:36,590
YouTube or written one of the Kings in England when you know the Church of

1179
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:40,570
England broke away from the Catholic Church so they can Henry can get a

1180
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:45,170
divorce as the story goes and paraphrasing and when the King James and

1181
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:50,170
other Bibles were made available to the public and they were read he says

1182
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:54,050
remember this Bible is copy written by the King and the Church of England it's

1183
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:58,750
only there to inform your conscience in other words you can't use it right all

1184
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:02,510
right for yourself you know you can't go out and do what you want to do with it on

1185
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:09,810
it for start your own groups or whatever with it so but anyway did I ever discuss

1186
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:13,550
the shorthand of what the purpose of Scripture is because it's not futile

1187
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:17,770
it's meant to be comprehended but it's not to be comprehended by everyone you

1188
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:21,590
know what the sole purpose of that is by the way I'm suggesting here this is not

1189
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:25,410
an opinion it's a strong suggestion is so that later on after the resurrection

1190
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:29,050
there's no excuse no one can say we never had access on what your intentions

1191
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:36,390
were yeah right yeah because if the gods wanted you to know and everyone to

1192
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:40,930
believe in them they can just show up every hundred years on a global level

1193
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:44,630
tell everyone on your knees where your masters will be back in a hundred years

1194
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:52,710
do the law you get it how easy would it be for them to do that wouldn't be it

1195
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:57,290
would be no effort for them because they would do it by proxy they could create a

1196
01:39:57,290 --> 01:40:01,430
whole other set of beings that would be their doubles to come and do it you see

1197
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:06,250
which is lawful by the way as long as they come in their name right yeah right

1198
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:12,690
yeah and can prove and can prove it how do you prove it well you see that village

1199
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:16,190
over there boom pink blue light and they're all vaporized okay yeah you come

1200
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:25,490
in his name because that's what people understand right Wow so you know or turn

1201
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:36,240
water into wine right right mm-hmm so there you go and I think just you know

1202
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:41,560
harken back to the Greek speak it's not Greek speak is this is not a this is a

1203
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:47,460
leaderless concept in other words anyone can say what I say however they

1204
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:52,020
want to say it and make it their own I'd prefer they do that because you know you

1205
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:55,040
really have to be able to do it forward and backward otherwise you fall flat on

1206
01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:01,660
your face right like sometimes I ask from Ed can you speak on Queen of Heaven

1207
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:10,660
Queen of Heaven well the Queen of Heaven is a prop was a problem for the

1208
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:17,170
Israelites big-time Queen of Heaven was something mentioned it's actually

1209
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:22,810
mentioned as Queen of Heaven in the book of Jeremiah I think it's mentioned

1210
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:26,970
somewhere else there are other attributes to her like the asterod a

1211
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:31,490
start day which is the Cleopatra's needle he also says in one of the books

1212
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:36,710
why do you put that up my nose are you familiar with that verse no I'm not no

1213
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:44,770
okay that is associated you'll see it in full blast I can't say specifically

1214
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:51,050
it's the justice people you know the justice crew you know the the goddess

1215
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:56,370
but I can tell you specifically outright the Catholics call a rena de cielo

1216
01:41:56,370 --> 01:42:00,790
especially in the lat which literally means the Queen of Heaven that's what

1217
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:03,810
you see the Virgin Mary or that she's the mother of God

1218
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:10,050
sky goddess worship throughout the Mediterranean yeah right and that's the

1219
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:18,610
current Catholic chief deity by the way yeah and now if you go back to the text

1220
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:25,370
and I believe it's Yirmeyahu Jeremiah the Israel had worshiped or had that as

1221
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:31,310
a chief deity within the locales of Judea and parts of Israel Israel had

1222
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:36,790
gone away pagan way before Judea did but and they would light fires for her

1223
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:40,830
and bake cakes for her for hundreds of years during the time of judges and even

1224
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:45,890
the Kings and they said we prospered under her now you're telling us that

1225
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:50,790
we're going to be sacked by the you know Babylonians we don't believe it you see

1226
01:42:52,900 --> 01:43:03,450
I would suggest she's still around now there's a multitude of goddesses it's

1227
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:10,590
it's not complex but it's not singular in the book of Zechariah there is more

1228
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:15,750
than one female spiritual figure one of them is specifically carried to Babylon

1229
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:21,950
or Shinar in a basket are you familiar with that no no right and we know that

1230
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:27,630
most angels are male so here we have several female several meaning three

1231
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:35,330
portrayed that and one of them is put in a basket and carried by birds let's

1232
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:43,430
say but there are other of these you see female entities that straight that man

1233
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:50,800
goes after now the thing about that you could say is how predominant is the

1234
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,040
Catholic Church pretty predominant right actually it's funny listening to

1235
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,860
Christians Christians who argue that they're not Catholic I'm like what a

1236
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:02,080
dummy what do you think all that stuff came from you'll have the same holidays

1237
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:06,280
the same concept you know the guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper right the

1238
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:12,160
same does Pope's work schedule so how are you different you know okay you're

1239
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,920
not your vanilla and chocolate chip instead of chocolate okay but you still

1240
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:23,540
ice cream you see so there are one of the things is prosperity and and that

1241
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:28,800
reigns over has been given to have because how much prosperity and power

1242
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,420
does the Catholic Church have as having her as a key chief deity quite a bit as

1243
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:38,080
a matter of fact that you heard of the Jesuits and the bat is not

1244
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:44,300
conspiratorial this is actually easily accessible all be it being on the

1245
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:47,580
conspiratorial and that the Jesuits have influence in world government and

1246
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:52,480
intelligence agencies right you familiar with that maybe maybe not they're

1247
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:58,840
Catholic that's the Pope's army so you see that their chief God is this Queen

1248
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:04,960
of Heaven so that's what I could say about that I started going when I

1249
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,800
started just like anyone when you get into a topic of spiritual you want to

1250
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,400
look at everything right like the spiritual world right you look at

1251
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:17,580
everything but then when you notice that there's a hierarchy and the difference

1252
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:22,980
between the high-level stuff and the low-level stuff is so far apart that you

1253
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:25,900
don't want to dwell on the low-level stuff and you want to get to know more

1254
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:29,940
about the high-level stuff right because when you dwell on the low-level stuff you

1255
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:34,320
fall for the mental modeling that you get out there like how many people speak

1256
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:39,100
badly against Catholicism but yet still think they go to heaven or hell when they

1257
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:43,740
die or think that that you know the Christ is this guy nailed to a cross

1258
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:48,240
wearing a diaper right or was born on Christmas most of them still do so it's

1259
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:53,500
futile when you get stuck in that low-level stuff right you're not going

1260
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:57,200
to you're not going to get the truth there's people all over the internet

1261
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:03,140
that are bad-mouthing the papacy and the you know the the entire aspect of

1262
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:08,040
Catholicism and they have no other than this stuff that they make up or they

1263
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:12,220
look at each other what they're going to say next none of it is you know viable

1264
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:18,020
for research the none of them know them you know how the the the higher

1265
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:23,420
level stuff works you know the ones that are get stuck in the the study of you

1266
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:28,240
know the Catholicism and the you know what I mean so I found out with my own

1267
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:34,280
my own personal decision not to get into it too much and become an expert on the

1268
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:40,100
Queen of Heaven or Astaroth and all that other stuff because the only people that

1269
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:45,500
feel like they would benefit from that are a bunch of Muppets like do you would

1270
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,740
you feel let's say personally Bruce let's just have a personal thing here

1271
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:53,300
for a moment would you feel more benefit from talking about the Most High's ways

1272
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:58,460
or the Astaroth's ways of Queen of Heaven's ways it's a no-brainer I'd be

1273
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:02,980
up on that's no brainer exactly so why would you spend a lot of time on that

1274
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:07,000
because in other words the the world is the there's such a much wider and deeper

1275
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,660
wider and deeper body of knowledge to gain from the higher aspects of the

1276
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:17,200
spiritual world in the lower aspects again it don't trust what I'm saying go

1277
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,480
ahead and research people that are quote-unquote experts on the occult

1278
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:24,560
mystical they're pretty dumb not to mention names I'm not going to get into

1279
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,000
it I was going to you know who they are the classic ones you know they got the

1280
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,740
granddaddy of them Jordan Maxwell and the before him the Blavatsky's and all

1281
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:38,560
they're all idiots ask them to define you know anything you know money the

1282
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,400
soul the spirit time anything they can't because they're there they've been put

1283
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:47,900
here to satisfy a need which is the people find out about something they

1284
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:50,880
don't want to go along with it they want to find more and they stay in the low

1285
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,760
level crap right the David Ike's the you know what I mean right no project

1286
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:02,320
Camelot's the all that low-level crap let me ask you are there more five-star

1287
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:11,920
restaurants or there are more McDonald's yeah and why why because is it is it in

1288
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,500
balance yes it's accommodating the people don't want the better restaurant

1289
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,820
they want the McDonald's how do I know well duh that's a fact now you might

1290
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:26,480
pull a standard to a human asshole aside and say hey I see obviously you guys

1291
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,560
want the McDonald's better than the rest was no we don't know we don't know we

1292
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:35,980
don't know we do bullshit because if you didn't you wouldn't go there and it

1293
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:42,140
wouldn't exist you see you know I mean don't listen to what they say watch what

1294
01:48:42,140 --> 01:49:06,820
they do what else pretty much in on that one pretty quiet hmm that's fine so

1295
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:12,160
there's about 10 to 15 seconds to get down the stream so that's fine also to

1296
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,180
Sam said he might be interested in doing something tomorrow he's gonna get

1297
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:20,640
some more internet access if you're available tomorrow know what your

1298
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:24,760
schedule is like I think he had a couple of things you wanted to mull over see

1299
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:32,560
tomorrow I go in late and then I'd be up early somewhat early I could probably

1300
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:38,100
squeeze in a couple hours easy that's no big deal yeah I think take it we took a

1301
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:42,460
couple of months off I did I was actually involved with things that and I

1302
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:47,440
actually sat back and see what you know if anyone's gonna not hopefully

1303
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,520
hopefully someone was gonna do something no one really did anything with it so I

1304
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,660
just go seasonally you know this is getting into the middle of summer watch

1305
01:49:55,660 --> 01:50:02,540
how things are growing you know and just let out some information a little bit

1306
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:10,490
more every time slightly different so personally everybody cover your ears I'm

1307
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:13,930
just gonna tell Bruce the public at large even these streams chat whatever

1308
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:18,890
people email me are not ready for more stuff that's my decision you know

1309
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:22,690
somebody wants to tell me what people want you just say it anyway and let the

1310
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:27,930
people decide I said nah it's still operating on a real low level the whole

1311
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:33,010
the whole thing and even if I were to die tomorrow and it didn't speak anymore

1312
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:37,290
I'd be quite satisfied because I've said a thousand times more than anyone

1313
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:43,150
else has period at all on all these subjects on the and yeah my being cocky

1314
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:47,930
that's your problem if you think I am somebody said a condescending or whatever

1315
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:51,910
if you has the interesting thing I got a comment about being condescending if you

1316
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:55,210
feel like this kind of talk is condescending well maybe because you're

1317
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:58,010
one of the morons you know what I mean they always get offended you know what I

1318
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:03,750
mean I remember by the way when I wanted to learn and people were kind of

1319
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:07,230
rough around the edges giving the information I was quite happy to get the

1320
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:10,830
information and the morons that were not interested in information found to be

1321
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:16,530
condescending they couldn't be there right right so that tells me a lot you

1322
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:24,250
know like one time just to be sure you got over $200 of events and oh yeah and

1323
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:30,090
that's 200 hours more than yeah than anything else it's pathetic to say that

1324
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:35,390
by the way because there's so many people that are supposedly well-versed

1325
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:39,270
and there are different subjects that have internet access can get it out

1326
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:44,330
there even on a searchable query you know and it doesn't exist it's just

1327
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:48,570
what's going on and you know that it's even more pathetic is the people that

1328
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:52,690
work in the fields the entitled classes you know the doctors the attorneys the

1329
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:58,090
MIT idiots where we're not coming on saying hey this is bullshit you guys

1330
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:02,590
there are been told you know there is some of that going on there is enough

1331
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:07,990
to enough to say that yeah it's not correct to say no one is but they don't

1332
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:12,210
have it together you know they don't they just think it's one little thing

1333
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:17,850
and we just fix this and we'll make the world better again no sorry I had a kind

1334
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:25,430
of laugh today I went to these suspicious observers YouTube thing and

1335
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:31,630
he was actually mentioned something about the 18-hour day and that's the

1336
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:37,930
same place that I found out about the China in weather modification whether

1337
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:45,290
he's he's a little against that when he mentioned that about the 18-hour day I

1338
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:52,650
caught my eye right away as you know huh you know believe it or not I had not

1339
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:55,870
gone to him in about a month and I went there today and there's something about

1340
01:52:55,870 --> 01:53:00,790
the moon making the day longer yeah right yeah and I when these idiots say

1341
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:04,850
18-hour day they're talking about 18 hours of daylight not the 12 hours of

1342
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:12,510
daylight six hours of night okay okay the time date I think he was up in a

1343
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:16,990
million so I was like oh wow that's you know that's so good oh yeah because the

1344
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:19,510
thing is when you're dealing with a human you have to assume that there are

1345
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,650
more on and then you just wait a little bit and they prove it right yeah they

1346
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:29,210
did and then then you then you're not you're not hopeful you don't have this

1347
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:33,930
ooh you know the only thing you should be hopeful in is like let's say you're

1348
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:37,850
not good at making rice you know most white people you tell them to make rice

1349
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:41,490
they're terrified you know they'd rather run around the block 4,000 times because

1350
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:46,470
they know if they try to cook rice are gonna get a big lump of starch right so

1351
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:49,990
if you're a white person and you want to learn how to make rice learn how to make

1352
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:54,430
rice and that's where you're hopeful in because you're gonna make better food

1353
01:53:54,430 --> 01:54:00,550
now you see what I mean or you want to get lawful clothing and make better

1354
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:06,130
living environment you see that's what let's hope that they haven't taken the

1355
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:11,830
cookable rice and made that a permanent staple now god that was scary what yeah

1356
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:17,270
it is it is scary I I think what I'm gonna do is I have a there's a market

1357
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:21,910
that's a good 10 miles from here that's a huge market and they have some real

1358
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:26,390
high-end rice I'm gonna experiment I'm gonna get a small batch of high-end rice

1359
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:30,530
and they're giving example a high and it costs what beef costs you know in pound

1360
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:37,950
you know and it's Japanese and other varieties I'm gonna try a little bit of

1361
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:41,130
that because that's your good measure like you know if you get into a Maybach

1362
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:45,810
or a Lamborghini or Ferrari and it's a piece of crap you're not gonna your

1363
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:50,170
chances of getting into a Ford and it being good is you know your expectation

1364
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:55,690
should be lowered you know you go for the best stuff right right so it's a gauge

1365
01:54:55,690 --> 01:55:00,270
but not always because I've driven by the way at a high-end super cars or

1366
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:03,390
whatever and you go over a certain number speed and you're like oh I'd

1367
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:09,410
rather prefer you know 1978 Caprice classic was smoother you know because

1368
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:15,250
they feel like they're gonna fall apart right they're not forward to your report

1369
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:21,810
that's for sure yeah yeah yeah so I'm gonna get into a rice investigation but

1370
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:26,090
I I tell people around me the food you know like for example recently a few

1371
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:30,230
maybe a month ago I said to someone we're not going to be you know in less

1372
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:33,650
than two years are probably not going to be eating any animal products you know

1373
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:37,410
like a steak or chicken or fish or whatever I mean that's how much the

1374
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:42,170
quality is going to go down if you are paying attention you know I mean mm-hmm

1375
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:45,310
because the animals are not going to want to spiritually give up their bodies

1376
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:52,370
anymore for the for nutrition it'll be toxic when you eat it this is this is

1377
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:58,110
something else very nice you know there's there's the backtalk you know

1378
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:02,650
stuff that I've explained to people and they you know they come to me like man

1379
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:05,370
it's just like you said I said yeah you know well you shouldn't be surprised

1380
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:14,010
because we talked about it five years ago right you know so now how about how

1381
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,870
about you know instead of telling me it's just like you said Greek how about

1382
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:20,190
you know it's just like I said you know why don't you say that once you start

1383
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:25,050
looking further down the line you know I recently from this is just a little a

1384
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:31,110
shout out I think it was six one eight whatever he private mailed me about he

1385
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,270
wanted to find out more about the circus split in the church and the clowns of

1386
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:38,630
anything online I said I don't go look online the really good libraries in

1387
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:43,590
print I don't you know been to one in a while but they have stuff on ancient

1388
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:47,890
cultures and if you start looking at descriptive diagrams of ancient culture

1389
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:51,750
their temples they were just like the clowns of modern-day you know you could

1390
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:58,610
look at it yourself look at something where they were actually both

1391
01:56:58,610 --> 01:57:04,190
interacting well not only yeah and they used magicians like the Orthodox what

1392
01:57:04,190 --> 01:57:08,230
became the Eastern Church they used magicians and contraptions where you put

1393
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:12,750
a coin in and they had robotics I think a while back I dropped some links

1394
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:19,370
about the Greek church was yeah the church was investing in that yeah it's

1395
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:24,730
the same crap today look at the whether it's evangelical or any any denomination

1396
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:29,070
whatever demon they take some under their wing to inspire them to do that

1397
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:34,130
crap it's a circus it's a show people bounce around clapping hollering you

1398
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:44,250
know bingo yeah it's just a show it's a circus and it really you don't have to

1399
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:48,470
drop a ton of bricks on them if someone goes to church on with the circus but as

1400
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:53,250
I start looking up what that word really means if you read the scripture without

1401
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:57,430
watching the TV and what they tell you can see something different maybe don't

1402
01:57:57,430 --> 01:58:15,010
get your hopes up on that boy you know the thing is I think anything with

1403
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:19,390
Greek speak or anything that's along this line even with fresco whatever file

1404
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:23,410
it away you really can't use any of this stuff outside of food clothing and

1405
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:27,250
shelter and the proof is earlier like we said you know try to tell other people

1406
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:30,590
right like you know I gave the hypothetical thing how come there's no

1407
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:35,030
support for this and why isn't everyone listening getting 10 other people to

1408
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:39,010
listen right I know that's not going to happen because I'm not you know I've

1409
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:43,650
been on this planet more than 15 minutes right there is a time when

1410
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:50,330
specifically the identity and let's not be confused you know a lot of Christians

1411
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:54,530
I've had personal phone calls okay I call you on the phone I give them the

1412
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:58,110
phone number to bring their buddies on and they say well you know is this

1413
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:01,930
gospel to go to the whole world and basically they don't even know what

1414
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:04,470
they're talking they think it's what they're doing has to go to the whole

1415
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:09,010
world Christians are doing right when you actually look at the meaning of

1416
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:14,090
what's being said there what it was about twofold one was at that time the

1417
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:21,890
people who knew who the Christ was in his purpose and now to any information

1418
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:27,090
about that to come out to go against the misidentity right who the real Christ is

1419
01:59:27,090 --> 01:59:31,090
in other words right because people don't know you know that's one of the

1420
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:35,530
examples I'm giving is if they wanted even a small semblance of accuracy they

1421
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:40,730
should call him Joshua not Jesus because his name is Joshua like the book of

1422
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:44,690
Joshua the sixth book of the Bible why did they have to make up the Jesus because

1423
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:51,210
it's completely different creature right so there so Satan or the adversaries

1424
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:56,170
forces as we can't call him Joshua like the book of Joshua that's his name if

1425
01:59:56,170 --> 02:00:00,130
we're going to use the letter J we have to make it a different creature

1426
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:04,090
completely so later on if they're going to put our feet to the fire and say we

1427
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:09,210
never said it was Joshua's it was Jesus which is not in there anyway but that's

1428
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:12,270
not going to be enough to let him go you see they're just trying to lawyer

1429
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:19,050
their way out of it you see so what's happening is remember the whole purpose

1430
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:25,570
why is scripture so difficult to comprehend for most it's because it

1431
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:27,910
doesn't matter if you could it's not because it's not meant to be

1432
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:30,930
comprehended like some Christian circles tell you that's your

1433
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:37,710
interpretation sorry I don't like it now it's so later on no one can say that I

1434
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:44,170
didn't know it existed you see so know what the only reason you have scripture

1435
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:51,740
is so later on it'll you'll be everyone will be without excuse the last thing

1436
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:55,560
gods or angels want is some sniveling human scumbag saying well you didn't

1437
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:08,350
know sure of course you knew you know so the battery die we still here we saw

1438
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:16,270
no we're still going we're still going okay I was just taking all this in and a

1439
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:21,090
wealth of information again well I don't know about the wealth because it's it

1440
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:27,610
doesn't have any currency value to it didn't the knowledge yeah well remember

1441
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:33,430
you increase knowledge put an equal sign on the other side of the equal sign

1442
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:40,630
you know the little smiley face turn the smile upside down until you learn how to

1443
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:46,370
handle it you know for example when you go to the gym okay let's say you go to

1444
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:51,790
the gym and you're just an observer do the people look like they're having a

1445
02:01:51,790 --> 02:02:00,350
good time no right it's like a torture chamber isn't it you know as I've what

1446
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:04,130
do they call one of those Roku things and Netflix yeah I do sign in on our own

1447
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:09,170
stuff yeah but I was watching a film pumping iron with Schwarzenegger and

1448
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:14,710
used to do bodybuilding and I remember reading his books and all that in the

1449
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:21,090
70s right and I was telling someone I went in the other room I said it sounds

1450
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:24,850
like a torture chamber in there you know lifting weights so it's no

1451
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:29,670
different than people being tortured but is it beneficial yes it is beneficial

1452
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:34,730
for the body getting knowledge for the spirit is it beneficial for the spirit

1453
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:39,810
yes but does it sound like a torture chamber yes you know it's anybody happy

1454
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:46,790
no well that doesn't stop me from wanting to learn right because the

1455
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:53,650
reward you end up learning the highest the knowledge itself is its reward you

1456
02:02:53,650 --> 02:03:00,030
see and because it's the adversaries world it takes a form of currency when

1457
02:03:00,030 --> 02:03:06,590
you turn it around and twist it and make it devious that's when it becomes like

1458
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:11,750
MIT right or now churches or the various political groups when they twist it

1459
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:16,230
around and make it devious that's when it becomes gainfully you know currency

1460
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:20,270
knowledge you know many times you say oh yeah you know I have a best-selling book

1461
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:23,090
I said I don't want to read no best-selling book because who well why

1462
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:26,670
not Greek well because who the hell's reading it if a million people read it

1463
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:32,510
and they like it it can't be good right you know what King James is an example

1464
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:36,810
millions of people have read it they like it can't be good am I right or

1465
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:53,470
wrong you're right hmm who's hitting me on scarcity okay not much yeah so the

1466
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:59,750
the interesting thing is that the the the basics of it is like we mentioned

1467
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:06,170
earlier I'm not a relativist or anything you know how we you and I mentioned as

1468
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:11,210
you get older how fast time goes by mm-hmm right you know I I have like you

1469
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:14,790
know ten years now is not no big deal but when you're five years old a year is

1470
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:19,690
an eternity you can hardly wait until you're a teenager or you're not five

1471
02:04:19,690 --> 02:04:24,730
years old anymore it seems like you're five forever right right or so whoever's

1472
02:04:25,550 --> 02:04:29,370
yeah yeah and they don't like young the children don't want to be called babies

1473
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:32,790
right that's how you discourage them right and adults don't want to be called

1474
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:37,150
children or vice versa you know it gets to the point where no one knows why they

1475
02:04:37,150 --> 02:04:40,910
are where they are and why they want what they want to do and why it's just

1476
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:47,750
bizarre so how fast time goes by that the amount of time that is left this is

1477
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:53,790
from an informational point no one should be I shouldn't say foolish but

1478
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:57,270
should be jumped to the point say well because the Greek says we only have 14

1479
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:01,490
years that's it and that now you know we're in trouble no that's not how it

1480
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:05,670
should be what you should do is is separate the Greek from and say I'm

1481
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:12,750
getting information why there's 14 years left you see and whether it's good

1482
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:16,210
information or not is up to me to decide by through validation verification

1483
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:20,790
study or just emotional I don't like this guy so his information can't be

1484
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:25,910
good or I really like him so his information has to be good you see the

1485
02:05:25,910 --> 02:05:29,950
point is that it's put out there no one later can say that it hadn't been put

1486
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:36,570
out but those that are taking heed to what is being said and comprehend it in

1487
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:42,090
addition to if you are older or approaching half a century old that

1488
02:05:42,090 --> 02:05:46,410
decade and a half will come by like tomorrow not tomorrow but maybe the day

1489
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:51,730
after or feel like you know next week hey it'll be like if you have a haircut

1490
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:55,030
appointment in two weeks that's how fast it'll come you'll be getting your hair

1491
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:59,250
cut and the asteroids will be hitting that's how that's how it'll fear feel you

1492
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:03,390
know or you or by then you're gonna feel that you have a thousand actually

1493
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:07,070
know for most people listening you'll be getting your haircutting appointment

1494
02:06:07,070 --> 02:06:10,690
and be dreaming about the next perfect thousand years that you're being told is

1495
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:16,790
going to happen right yeah so anyway so this is a very very quick thing and now

1496
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:26,260
here just to recap the point is very interesting is although the thought was

1497
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:32,620
almost fleeting the very interesting point would be that if it's going to

1498
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:37,100
happen so quickly how come others don't see it with such specifics well because

1499
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:42,680
others don't see anything with specifics ask anyone what day it is a pope work

1500
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:47,180
schedule do your intestines absorb yes do you do calories yes what you know all

1501
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:51,600
these subjects that have been discussed right they don't see anything what's the

1502
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:57,320
money base oh it's just fiat no it's not it's a bond it's a mortgage can you

1503
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:01,300
trade mortgages of course you do it's done all the time do you want to be

1504
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:07,900
subject to that no it's all private you see they think the church is a good

1505
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:13,560
thing they think you know what I mean right it's Bruce okay since you've been

1506
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:17,080
listening since you've been listening to this stuff and you've we've touched

1507
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,960
on I'd say at least 10 different core heavy core subjects I know me core

1508
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:25,860
subjects meaning that I affect people on this planet have you tried to discuss it

1509
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:29,920
with other people and seemingly draw a blank or they've never heard of it and

1510
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:37,340
they're all obvious they're all all obvious so okay so if they don't you

1511
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:43,300
know what this has given me it's given me much more clarity as to what I'm

1512
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:53,440
looking at and shocking you know just how much the censorship is there and

1513
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:59,860
it's stuck it's just not gonna let up on them yes because the reason why is

1514
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:04,580
because they're stuck here's another reason why is because they're you know

1515
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:09,140
I say carnal you know the carnal mind you know carny meaning flesh because

1516
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:14,480
they're stuck in the material world they're stuck and you see when someone

1517
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:18,820
if it's blatantly obvious that the for example the intestines don't absorb

1518
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:24,800
anything that's blatantly obvious in any item anatomical reference right but

1519
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:28,060
they're stuck in believing and won't lift a finger even the people working in

1520
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:32,180
the field to see that it doesn't say anything that means that you're stuck so

1521
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:37,060
much in the material world that being able to cognitively rationalize what is

1522
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:42,040
physically going on is not possible that's how bad off you are it's like

1523
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:46,440
someone that is so drunk they can't walk three feet but they want to go to the

1524
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:50,160
store to get more alcohol because the the level of drunkenness they have is

1525
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:56,160
not enough it ain't gonna happen either and their desires are busy so you know

1526
02:08:56,160 --> 02:09:01,440
like once I think go with Ocelli I said that even the people that are called

1527
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:08,480
materialists don't know anything about the material world they don't so when you

1528
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:13,060
start putting at this bizarre perplexing condition that humans are in

1529
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:19,020
all because of the gods by the way we don't care about you by the way when I

1530
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:22,140
say that I mean the great majority I'm not talking about the elect and the ones

1531
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:26,580
that are tasked to do things right right this is the generals you know all you

1532
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:30,500
know I'm talking about all the talking about the beach and and all the grains

1533
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:35,620
of sand not the ones that get stuck in your shoe you know and here you know you

1534
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:38,240
can have a million people go into the beach and they all bring some sand home

1535
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,820
the beach will still be there you get it how many people have gone to Coney

1536
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:48,480
Island or big beaches in Malibu whatever and for a century now and brought some

1537
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:52,260
sand home in their panties or their pants or their sandwich cooler bag at

1538
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:55,740
home and the beach is still there you think after all those millions and

1539
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:58,640
hundreds of millions of people go to the beach over a century would have

1540
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:04,020
depleted all the sand you see what I'm saying right so scripture says you know

1541
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:06,960
the poor will always be with you I'm telling the morons will always be with

1542
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:13,380
you so when you're when you're dealing with a reality as such on this planet

1543
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:20,080
and remember this is planet wide right yeah they can't see anything how are they

1544
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:27,850
going to see something like that you know prophecy or what's coming next not

1545
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:33,350
possible and the ones that do see it what can you do about it nothing because

1546
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:37,830
how many times have I said if it's so explicit and let's say the book of

1547
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:40,970
revelation which we shouldn't read anyway you're not gonna understand it in

1548
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:45,750
its proper context but a book revelation it's so obvious that all these things

1549
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:49,930
are happening if if so many millions of people have access to it if they

1550
02:10:49,930 --> 02:10:53,110
understand on how to put it in its proper place aren't they gonna cry foul

1551
02:10:53,110 --> 02:10:59,270
when it's happening yeah does it say anyone's gonna cry foul no there are a

1552
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:03,770
few of the elect that do and they're put down very quickly beheaded and all this

1553
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:14,000
right but it doesn't change anything I mean how many people go to medical

1554
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,880
school that stay you know in the field and say your body doesn't absorb

1555
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:23,600
anything none now you know the dropout rate in medical school is very high

1556
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:29,240
right and you understand why yes that's a someone drops out of medical school

1557
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:34,560
that you should take that as a success and a moral lawful and ethical success

1558
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:43,280
by the way to stay in that and continue is a failure it's I don't same with law

1559
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:49,300
school someone to drop out of law school it should be considered a success so

1560
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:01,020
anyway I'm perfectly content with my my knowledge and getting better with my

1561
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:04,520
knowledge if I don't have to say it to another person because of their

1562
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:10,520
stiff-headedness so be it right but they're censored also and what happens

1563
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:14,420
is if you push against the censorship the other side can turn them into a

1564
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:19,040
werewolf an animal type thing tear you apart I mean physically and emotionally

1565
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:29,850
or spiritually yes yes remember the fact is this World War one hundred and

1566
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:33,110
something million people died right from the plague that the Americans

1567
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:39,450
engineered the Spanish flu World War two 150 million and we have about 20 or 30

1568
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:42,650
million people throughout the world every year I'd say about 15 million

1569
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:47,790
conservatively half of them if not more in the US being taken out by the medical

1570
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:52,550
industry chemicals and all that maybe more and and where that why aren't the

1571
02:12:52,550 --> 02:13:00,720
gods stopping them well because the fact is they're not stopping it now let's

1572
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:07,120
just look at the facts you want to look at the facts now cold facts right not

1573
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:10,800
what you think or what you want or whatever do the gods know this is going

1574
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:19,540
on yes are they doing anything about it no so someone knows something is going

1575
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:23,180
on that's bad and not doing anything about it this does not tell you like they

1576
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:30,880
don't care you get it or you could say they are do something about it Greek if

1577
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:35,700
they didn't there would be 300 million dead instead of a hundred million that's

1578
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:41,880
not the point the point is you are getting that you see 50 million hundred

1579
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:47,740
million whatever it is you see and the reason why they don't care is because of

1580
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:52,160
the carnal nature it's physical how many times have you read in Scripture

1581
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:58,680
you're just dust anyway right get over it now here's the thing no matter how

1582
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:02,560
sore people are and the reason I'm bringing this up at the way that I am

1583
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:06,400
this way is because I've heard this several times every time you heard me

1584
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:09,600
say if I hear something two or three times with an interim I'll do I'll talk

1585
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:13,560
about it on a sonic because it's like a little message being sent you know like

1586
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:17,640
maybe you should talk about this right when you hear from different sources so I

1587
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:21,020
did it recently a past week or two I've been hearing oh why does you know God

1588
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:25,260
allow this to happen I was okay that's it enough of this and I need to balance

1589
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,620
out the equation not because it's going to make anything better but just because

1590
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:33,840
you have to write it's kind of like the janitor solving the big problem at night

1591
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:37,700
you know that the physicist couldn't you just fills it in and walks away you

1592
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:45,620
don't want to take credit for it but essentially the carnal nature and how

1593
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:49,560
bad it seems because you are emotionally attached to it because of the physical

1594
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:55,730
if I were to say that the reward post-resurrection and when the gods

1595
02:14:55,730 --> 02:15:00,950
return to sort things out will be so great that will not only compensate for

1596
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:04,710
all this misery that humanity's been through but it will also overcompensate

1597
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:12,980
would you believe that and that would be a good belief by the way you know it

1598
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:18,440
would be it would be like giving you guys is a example I knew a bass player

1599
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:23,020
and he got a bicycle and he got hit by a car he left the bike shop and he fell

1600
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:28,640
down and he broke his thumb now for an ordinary person that would be you know

1601
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:34,540
ten twenty thirty thousand dollars right fifty thousand but but he's a bass

1602
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:39,100
player he needs it's for his livelihood right so he got three point something

1603
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:44,460
million from the insurance right okay because he was a bass player it took

1604
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:48,540
like five years you know they offered him like a quarter of a million he said

1605
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:52,280
no it was you know there's a quarter of a million in the first year or you just

1606
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:59,780
kept going right so imagine that you get a paper cut so that that's like you

1607
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:03,200
know because that's that's like something that makes sense right okay

1608
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:08,120
you can't work anybody could but okay so imagine you get a paper cut and you get

1609
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:12,620
a billion for a paper cut that would be more of an analogy of after the

1610
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:20,110
resurrection the compensation that everyone will get everyone right and of

1611
02:16:20,110 --> 02:16:22,790
course that doesn't make a good analogy because if you think it through if

1612
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:28,150
everyone got a billion a loaf of bread will be 500 million right so because of

1613
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:33,049
you know how the economics model works but I'm just saying all of this stuff

1614
02:16:33,049 --> 02:16:37,129
that people are asking and questioning and doubting and even though I come out

1615
02:16:37,129 --> 02:16:41,070
cold-heartedly and say because the gods don't care about you the compensation

1616
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:45,870
what I need to fill in the balance is the compensation later when they do come

1617
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:50,469
and take control and are at the top overtly because they're at the top now

1618
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:55,110
covertly when they're over the compensation for all of humanity will

1619
02:16:55,110 --> 02:17:02,490
be beyond compensation for all of the misery and shit that's happened that so

1620
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:06,150
much that you would even forget and not even see all the bad stuff that's ever

1621
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:10,450
happened to humanity is being bad because of the powers and the privileges and the

1622
02:17:10,450 --> 02:17:15,190
what you'll be enabled to do later and this is not like some hokey stuff will

1623
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:18,070
you have course it always sounds good when it's going to happen later what

1624
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:24,129
about now we've spent quite a bit time discussing what about now you know what

1625
02:17:24,129 --> 02:17:31,870
I mean and can't even realize the obvious what about now there is no now

1626
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:39,500
you're living in a fog in a dream but it's not you know not don't go that

1627
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:44,879
route that it's a fog or a dream either using it as a metaphor you know it's

1628
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:49,780
just would behoove anyone to study any field very quickly objectively with

1629
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:54,080
discernment and you can approach any of the entitled classes in any field and

1630
02:17:54,080 --> 02:18:04,290
and render them to bits you know so so let's say that's that's our sonic for

1631
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:09,150
now it's I'd say it's approaching midsummer we still have a I have to go I

1632
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:14,330
haven't been as diligent I need to also if I do a posting on a on the chat or an

1633
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:18,650
email on the date on the day not today I need to double check myself because

1634
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:24,129
sometimes I put up some wrong I've been doing it for so long that I haven't been

1635
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:27,930
taking measurements I just do a sighting I'm like okay I'll remember that and I

1636
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:36,549
don't you know and I'm often sometimes so I need to be more accurate not because

1637
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:40,230
not only for my sake actually it's good to be accurate but for others that ask

1638
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:44,910
you know or if I'm gonna throw what I what day I think it is so I just want to

1639
02:18:45,889 --> 02:18:51,709
defend my inadequacy will be more adequate in the future hopefully in terms

1640
02:18:51,709 --> 02:18:59,490
of you you weren't alone on that last one well it's it's interesting it is

1641
02:18:59,490 --> 02:19:03,170
good you know how the people you've seen the deserted island or the guy in jail

1642
02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:06,610
he scratches on the wall right you know how many days I've been here you know

1643
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:11,610
how they do that mm-hmm yeah just start scratching what's good is a dry erase

1644
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:18,010
board on the fridge chalkboards are really good by the way I actually from

1645
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:22,129
messing around with the dry erase marker boards I do prefer the chalk I you know I

1646
02:19:22,129 --> 02:19:25,070
think dollar stores get chalk now and all that right mm-hmm there's something

1647
02:19:25,070 --> 02:19:29,990
about the tactile feeling you know there's something neater and cleaner and

1648
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:33,670
more sanitary about a chalkboard a real chalkboard than the dry erase markers

1649
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:37,990
too I don't I don't know maybe it's just me yeah yeah maybe I'm just old-school

1650
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:47,450
so or a pad a notepad that you don't keep in a horizontal was personal

1651
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:52,450
experiences now if you have a notepad make a hole in it somehow it doesn't and

1652
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:57,870
hang it from a string instead of keeping it on a desk or a drawer because it's

1653
02:19:57,870 --> 02:20:01,890
there you know what I mean you're not going to use it for other stuff and when

1654
02:20:01,890 --> 02:20:07,470
the moon comes or you could have the Pope's work schedule and you know where

1655
02:20:07,470 --> 02:20:11,150
the lines are on the Pope's work schedule the boxes the day actually

1656
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:17,370
starts in the middle of the line you know so so in other words wherever there's a

1657
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:22,090
line on the Pope's work schedule calendar the printed calendar that's

1658
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:26,410
that's the that's the day see so the the day starts in the middle of the box

1659
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:31,250
right I'm sorry right mm-hmm right the middle of the box is when the day starts

1660
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:36,350
the line is the middle of the night and the middle of the next box is the next

1661
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:40,590
day so you almost have to put another set of lines through the lines that they

1662
02:20:40,590 --> 02:20:46,970
have right or a little dash or a dot you get it no because the the box

1663
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:51,130
delineation the vertical lines of the brakes are midnight which is the middle

1664
02:20:51,130 --> 02:20:58,130
of the day you know the you know in terms of time span till the from noon to

1665
02:20:58,130 --> 02:21:03,590
noon right mm-hmm so that's the other simple way to look at it and you can

1666
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:08,190
still use that as a because you're going to communicate for example if you mark

1667
02:21:08,190 --> 02:21:12,670
up a calendar a Pope's work schedule calendar and let's say you go in a chat

1668
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:16,570
you're going to look at the Pope's work schedule because on each chat line the

1669
02:21:16,570 --> 02:21:21,030
they do supply the date and time and that's not lawful they do it on the Pope's

1670
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:25,290
work schedule so you marking up a calendar is actually even more

1671
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:31,880
expeditious you know I don't even think they have the old plumbers catalog

1672
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,360
calendars with the women in scampi skimpy clothes anymore do they they still

1673
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:40,460
do those mechanics calendars and things remember that you know what I that

1674
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:48,520
started in the 40s oh yes yeah yeah yeah yeah I bet it'd be funny because yeah

1675
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:55,360
yeah going into the mechanic shops and all that these guys all have silly

1676
02:21:55,360 --> 02:22:01,260
phones you know so they probably yeah yeah they probably do like snap on or

1677
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:04,940
whatever I think I think I recently saw a snap on a reason maybe a year or two

1678
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:11,140
ago and they just show a tool a chrome socket or something right that you know

1679
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:23,460
anyway strange world of advertisements so I know the office supply places have

1680
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:28,480
calendars and all that now the ones that could be not very useful are the

1681
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:31,940
ones that you peel off remember the old-school ones that they those little

1682
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:37,380
pieces of paper you peeled off Oh sticky nose it yes yeah those are not it so

1683
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:44,400
timekeeping so there you go and we know we're in the the fourth month and we're

1684
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:50,500
in the second week of the fourth month now so I think the we're in the what is

1685
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:55,560
it the ninth day now or something yes no no one is lining up pretty good now

1686
02:22:56,340 --> 02:23:02,440
yeah I was off there for a while yeah let me see I'll double check my work here

1687
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:12,820
six 90 that's around the 10th 10th yeah 10th okay well I think it's a yeah the

1688
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:21,420
Sabbath was over at noon today I think right or something yeah either way yeah

1689
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:27,200
yeah and also I think I've mentioned before and people have guessed that

1690
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:33,280
eventually you won't be able to keep time at all right right right right yeah

1691
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:38,400
and you really won't want to keep time when the Sun goes really hot because

1692
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:43,760
you'll be just no you know yeah you'll be cooking in it yeah so you'll be

1693
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:51,180
keeping time with a convection oven essentially yes yeah not a lot of time

1694
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:55,420
left I mean I hate to hate to say it in a way that people have to believe it but

1695
02:23:55,420 --> 02:24:00,500
I have to say it in a way that people should hear it and if you you know just

1696
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:04,180
like I used to tell the young people if you're if you're not if you're not

1697
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:07,740
disgusted with humanity you're not paying attention you're believing some

1698
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:13,440
kind of mental model that people are good and things will be all right and

1699
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:18,280
all that and they're not and the only reason the only way all this what I'm

1700
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:23,400
saying is going to be passed off as being good or okay is because it's a

1701
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:32,800
deception just like you know anything toxic yeah I guess that key word would

1702
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:53,410
be toxic and all the ways around it yeah there's still a lot of going going on I

1703
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:57,430
would say and we're going to get off here shortly we've been quite a few

1704
02:24:57,430 --> 02:25:04,850
hours or maybe two hours something when you hear people saying we need to make

1705
02:25:04,850 --> 02:25:10,890
the world a better place by the way now you know past few years and now and we

1706
02:25:10,890 --> 02:25:17,050
need to fix this so it gets better and all that that's not just like fainting

1707
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:22,310
feigning altruism you know to make things better right now when you hear

1708
02:25:22,310 --> 02:25:27,530
those positive remarks about improvement and all that you know what that really

1709
02:25:27,530 --> 02:25:32,930
is if you put it in context that's the set I that's the setup for the

1710
02:25:32,930 --> 02:25:38,310
pseudo-perfect society that you're going to be taught is coming you're being set

1711
02:25:38,310 --> 02:25:44,330
up for that as well you know what I mean mm-hmm so the people that are saying we

1712
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:48,270
need to make the world a better place and all this other stuff that is not that

1713
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:53,030
is very different now than the apologetics or the altruism that you

1714
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:59,170
heard in the past now it's going to be attached to the fervor of this and

1715
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:03,490
instead of or anti-christ figure that's going to be coming that will usher in

1716
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:09,410
that sentiment you see that's another flavor yeah so the making the world a

1717
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:13,330
better place in the perfect society and look at all these improvements whether

1718
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:19,390
it's political scientific medical religious or whatever is not just your

1719
02:26:19,390 --> 02:26:23,450
run-of-the-mill stuff that people have been seeking it's this part of the setup

1720
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:31,610
for this specific section that's coming in the mid 2020s so it's not to be

1721
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:35,150
negated by the way you know very often say oh yeah I didn't want to go see that

1722
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:37,370
guy because it was the engine because you want to make the world a better

1723
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:42,950
place that was a decade ago now the people that are doing that are going to

1724
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:49,910
be crying ha see I told you later you see the difference yes because later when

1725
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:56,930
they get the big deception the ones that are spiking the interest in hope of a

1726
02:26:56,930 --> 02:27:02,450
better future will be satisfied will be granted that but not the real one

1727
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:08,590
they'll be granted that through the Antichrist you see so that's another

1728
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:13,050
level of discussion all together because you'll start hearing more of

1729
02:27:13,050 --> 02:27:21,270
that so you may not want to from let's say an indirect ounce of advice would be

1730
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:24,690
if you heard Greek speak you know avoid this crap about making the world a

1731
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:29,630
better place whatever but when you start seeing the majority or let's say a third

1732
02:27:29,630 --> 02:27:34,030
of the people saying that and if you start saying well it's not they're gonna

1733
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:37,350
kind of want to kick you in the nuts and knock your teeth out for saying it's not

1734
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:41,470
you see what I mean oh yeah because because they're going to be accommodated

1735
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:46,530
by the Antichrist on that so you might want to not now is no there's no nothing

1736
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:52,510
like that now but in the future when you start seeing that talk more and more I

1737
02:27:52,510 --> 02:27:56,890
wouldn't I wouldn't I'd stay seated on that and just watch it you know what I

1738
02:27:56,890 --> 02:28:03,790
mean all right don't want to be the tall nail no no the tall poppy syndrome or

1739
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:11,010
anything like that so so that you should do the you remember the book for

1740
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:14,090
dummies they don't really have that anymore because the internet killed them

1741
02:28:14,090 --> 02:28:20,250
over those yellow books how to computer programming for dummies internet book of

1742
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:24,790
for dummies or something yeah yeah I think the internet killed that because

1743
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:28,730
not people could search specifically right or they still exist I don't know

1744
02:28:28,730 --> 02:28:33,270
you need to do the end time for dummies you know they have the character the

1745
02:28:33,270 --> 02:28:38,850
figure guy it's a yellow and black go I know I know you already got the streams

1746
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:43,790
you've been very diligent behind the scenes but someone else out there you

1747
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:48,030
have to be more of a lackey because you're gonna have to do something is put

1748
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:55,450
to find out the template for the dummies for dummies thing and submit and times

1749
02:28:55,450 --> 02:29:01,950
for dummies and time scenario for dummies anyway I think they have one

1750
02:29:01,950 --> 02:29:06,610
already on biblical stuff for dummies of course it's all yes I think yeah I

1751
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:11,490
think they do think for every subject in the under the Sun pretty much so

1752
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:27,500
anyway they still have the book out the internet book for dummies yeah right I

1753
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:31,980
was discussing something for some reason we should do the inertial principles for

1754
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:35,140
dummies this at all I think the internet killed that and I kind of believed him I

1755
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:39,280
said yeah it makes sense because you know back 25 30 years ago I would have

1756
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:43,700
sought out one of those at a bookstore use bookstore you know where I did look

1757
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:54,810
at them they've been around for a long time mm-hmm there's not much you can

1758
02:29:54,810 --> 02:30:00,890
still get your copy for $2 here's and all the way up to 13 yeah oh my goodness

1759
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:09,650
yeah in credits yeah now it's regarding economics you can get a pretty good

1760
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:15,670
grip on what things are costing by looking at the price of silver and then

1761
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:24,410
the previous cost of things explain that if you want to make a determination on

1762
02:30:24,410 --> 02:30:34,610
the price of gasoline right go back to the silver cost and you can look up spot

1763
02:30:34,610 --> 02:30:39,770
silver right go historical back to when it was near a dollar like a dollar 12 or

1764
02:30:39,770 --> 02:30:46,170
something in the 70s or 60s right and look at the price of gas then what the

1765
02:30:46,170 --> 02:30:50,390
price of gas was when the silver was close to a dollar so what you do now is

1766
02:30:50,390 --> 02:30:55,990
you look at the price of gas for example gasoline and the cost of silver now and

1767
02:30:55,990 --> 02:31:02,570
you do the math so if silver is at 15 you take the price of gas now and divide

1768
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:06,670
it by 15 and then go back to when the silver was a dollar what was the gas and

1769
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:12,210
you'll see that the gas is actually cheaper now right okay like for example

1770
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:16,990
when silver was a dollar gasoline was about 30 35 cents a gallon you have

1771
02:31:16,990 --> 02:31:22,450
something like right now right now gas is about $3 a gallon and silver is at 15

1772
02:31:22,450 --> 02:31:29,970
16 so that means that if it was a parity it would be 450 a gallon I'm not talking

1773
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:36,910
about California now right California it's always 450 or $5 trendsetter you

1774
02:31:36,910 --> 02:31:41,610
see so in other words gasoline is in terms of lawful to silver remember

1775
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:47,050
silver is the money for people mm-hmm gold is the money for royalty and kings

1776
02:31:47,050 --> 02:31:55,770
and barter is for peasants right correct anyway yeah so so gasoline is about 30 or

1777
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:59,770
40 percent cheaper now than it was in the 60s and 70s do you see what I mean

1778
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:04,670
do the same thing with a gallon of milk you find out what a gallon of milk is

1779
02:32:04,670 --> 02:32:10,070
now and if it's less than 15 times what it was in the 70s it's cheaper now if

1780
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:15,070
it's more than 15 times what it was in the 70s it's more expensive but you can

1781
02:32:15,070 --> 02:32:18,810
do this at any time in history but silver an ounce of silver is a dollar

1782
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:23,730
period whether it was a 500 years ago or 200 years ago when they started that you

1783
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:29,170
know in 17 the Treasury Act right they determined that or you'll find that you

1784
02:32:29,170 --> 02:32:33,330
know pieces of silver are very close everywhere in the world was a day's

1785
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:40,570
wages was a piece of silver $15 most people make more than $15 in a day now

1786
02:32:40,570 --> 02:32:44,850
I'm using the credit analogy right right but you were three times that at minimum

1787
02:32:44,850 --> 02:32:48,790
wage so you so the average worker now makes two or three times of the average

1788
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:53,550
worker let's say 500 years ago so economically you're a lot better off

1789
02:32:54,670 --> 02:33:01,110
do you may not like certain things about the economy you know we can't afford the

1790
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:04,810
rent let's say or the bills or you don't understand you see that I'm not talking

1791
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:10,030
about that I'm talking about price to value index strictly you know and this

1792
02:33:10,030 --> 02:33:14,630
is a very simple way to look at it no one's talking about it you know so

1793
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:22,030
that's another thing having a I found in private a few years ago I just started

1794
02:33:22,030 --> 02:33:26,270
having economic discussions and we kept meeting after a while I said these

1795
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:29,430
people are really quiet I'm going to start quizzing them on what we talked

1796
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:33,090
about they didn't remember anything so if they're not adding or taking away

1797
02:33:33,090 --> 02:33:35,990
from the conversation and they don't remember any previous conversations I

1798
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:45,860
kept asking myself what am I doing here why am I talking right so you know I

1799
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:51,000
told you when you're doing a public speaking especially when there's

1800
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,200
question-and-answer at the end I look at everybody's faces and their look in

1801
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,880
their eyes when is this asshole gonna shut up and sit down so I can get the

1802
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:03,840
microphone and quote-unquote there are people that have moat when you have

1803
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:08,420
hosts and guests even I hear it a lot on the internet and listen much but when I

1804
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:13,180
inquire any show I notice that the guests not listening the host the host

1805
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:15,660
not listening to the guests you ever notice that if you're listening to

1806
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:19,420
internet the alternative medium ones mm-hmm because they're all waiting oh

1807
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:23,820
when is this guy gonna shut up so I could say what I want to say you know

1808
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:28,320
this is human you know this is not really human nature but this is how

1809
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:33,180
humans have been raised and they are inspired or censored or all that other

1810
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:42,600
stuff the headhunters yeah so yeah there's no reason to get into depth in

1811
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:47,280
many things before if anyone wants to reach me they can go to the uncommon

1812
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:53,000
sense or uncommon radio there's the email on there just go to the uncommon

1813
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,480
radio it's the first site that comes up you contact me I had gotten a contact by

1814
02:34:57,480 --> 02:35:01,660
the way for someone wanting a water project it was an international project

1815
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:06,800
and see how I so see how that goes yeah it's a foreign country it's pretty I

1816
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:14,520
wouldn't say as high as corporate government and hmm I usually don't

1817
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:17,120
mention I try to keep these things covered but the reason I'm bringing up

1818
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:21,820
because nothing will come out of it not because I'm because I know what will

1819
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:31,040
happen the moment you get in there and make real improvements and changes it's

1820
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:36,780
it steps on too many toes in other words if you if you're doing ears this is for

1821
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:40,680
anyone that's I don't know many people working consulting or you can put you

1822
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:45,440
know have extraordinary stuff to help other people with if you get contacted

1823
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:50,820
by let's say a well you know high net worth or well it financially endowed

1824
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:56,680
group to join them or help or consult if they have more than three or five

1825
02:35:56,680 --> 02:36:01,020
people it's not going to work out if you're doing really got the goods

1826
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:06,200
because you're going to step on their toes because of the ego and all the

1827
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:10,380
other the conformity and all that but if it's less than three to five people

1828
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:15,420
chances are you might go you might actually develop something because

1829
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:20,800
there's not that many people to step on right so let's say this is let's say get

1830
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:25,020
to Greek we want to know about but your water stuff we this is our problem and

1831
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:32,360
their problem is pretty big it's not you know it's a large-scale stuff if they've

1832
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:36,520
got 50 people 100 people in the in the brain trust you know the people at

1833
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:40,320
engineers and all that and you start pulling shit like why does a bucket of

1834
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:45,760
war water way more than a bucket of air and you have a hundred people saying we

1835
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:50,220
can't be that stupid it's better off getting rid of this guy than admitting

1836
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:55,060
we're stupid right yeah this is how they do it they'd rather sink the ship then

1837
02:36:55,620 --> 02:37:00,400
but if you got three or three four or five people and they all admit they're

1838
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:04,440
stupid they're like okay we're not you know we didn't admit it to everyone no

1839
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:09,460
you don't learn something new so yeah so yeah so maybe maybe we should keep

1840
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:14,020
going but I'm telling you this is a lifelong experience folks anybody out

1841
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:19,900
there doesn't matter what it is any field yeah imagine going to the a large

1842
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:23,720
hospital in a city with hundreds or thousands of doctors and saying the

1843
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:28,520
intestines don't absorb we need to absorb re-examine this methodology you're

1844
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:32,580
gonna get booted so fast you're you know you may not even you it'll be like three

1845
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:35,760
minutes before you land on the sidewalk that's how fast they're gonna throw you

1846
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:39,600
but if you go to let's say some backwoods place with three doctors or

1847
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:43,440
five doctors and you tell them that they might say wow you know we should

1848
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:48,580
consider that you see what I mean yes right you get it yeah yeah yeah and

1849
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:53,980
that's how it works Wow but you know I think you remember in the the new order

1850
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:57,680
of barbarians the whole thing is about industrialized medicine now institution

1851
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:02,340
and I was watching a Star Trek the other night I've been trying to because I

1852
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:05,380
don't do drugs so I need something to just dumb you know a chemical

1853
02:38:05,380 --> 02:38:13,420
lobotomy watching right here and there and they had an ad there said do you

1854
02:38:13,420 --> 02:38:16,840
ever have an intuition or whatever you know there's gonna be two million people

1855
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:20,280
added to the health industry in the next five years don't you want to be a

1856
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:24,180
part of it like whoo that sounds like major institutional shit like we've

1857
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:31,220
been hearing about you know yeah Wow anyway yeah it's it's it's so

1858
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:39,120
unpredictable I mean you know let's say before I go let's say in a hypothetical

1859
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:43,400
world that's really far off imaginary you know how I give the analogy of the

1860
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:46,740
Kevlar underwear because of the thumbtacks on the seats right mm-hmm

1861
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:51,220
let's say you were turned into a mouse or a rat not not to put down mice or

1862
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:56,860
rats they've done anything wrong and you were stuck in that world with what you

1863
02:38:56,860 --> 02:39:07,640
know now what the hell are you gonna do right think about it or how about you

1864
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:11,600
want to end it right here there's a certain there's something called a dung

1865
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:17,000
beetle you know why they call them a dung beetle because they eat dung they

1866
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,360
actually stand up on their rear quarters and they roll the dung into their nest so

1867
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:24,480
let's imagine now you know what you know now and you were turned into a dung

1868
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:29,640
beetle coprophagia in living with other dung beetles what are you gonna do now

1869
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:37,840
hopefully the tractor will run you over and squash you as quickly as possible so

1870
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:41,140
you don't have to put up with it and this is what it's like to be on planet

1871
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:46,640
earth sorry guys I say I hate to break it to you but if that's news if you're

1872
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:53,760
older than six years old or eight and that's news to you I'm really sorry so

1873
02:39:53,760 --> 02:40:06,620
anyway well thank you yeah it's just Sam comes around I'll yeah tomorrow maybe

1874
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:10,980
for double or whatever it doesn't sure sure it's coming up the middle of

1875
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:14,880
summer I think everyone got a pretty good taste of what happened in the

1876
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:18,920
springtime and what to expect and the next big changes are to be viewed in the

1877
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:23,880
fall and then eat this reason then we've got a few more years to see how

1878
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:36,960
things fall together well I got it yeah yep so sorry about the dog that's yeah

1879
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:44,200
and and of course get knowledge it's reward and learn how to pray because they

1880
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:49,740
they you know the the gods especially the most high he does he does watch the

1881
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:54,000
back of those that are his own and he I'm not saying it because I'm saying it

1882
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:04,080
I'm just reporting for careful what you pray for you know yes get it yes you

1883
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:08,160
might get it or even if you don't get it that's big that's okay too right that's

1884
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:12,960
the other but this is the thing that people have fall amiss there is no such

1885
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:19,660
thing as why does God do that there are gods and the thing to remember is that

1886
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:24,660
he does take care of the most high does in the Christ do take care of their own

1887
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:30,960
and if you're not being taken care of and you feel like you're out of touch

1888
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:36,960
guess what you ain't one of his right now that's okay too you know what I mean

1889
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:42,320
this is real talk people are not used to this kind of bullshit I mean this kind of

1890
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:48,560
the kind of bullshit that they hear it does not conform or does jive well with

1891
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:53,940
this kind of talk you know when you read scripture he says these are my people or

1892
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:59,620
my people will know this or that if if you don't qualify you ain't one of his

1893
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:05,380
people I'm sorry and the proof is all the misery in the world so so it's okay

1894
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:10,540
either way everyone here's the point that you should always communicate if

1895
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:14,800
even if you just had a moment all of humanity anyone that's ever been born

1896
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:21,500
lived and died and will be born is going to be rewarded so when the gods are

1897
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:30,320
finally settled in and overtly at the top and and again the reward will not

1898
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:36,380
only compensate for all the evil and the misery and the sadness it'll over

1899
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:41,660
compensate if that makes any sense mm-hmm so that's what you look forward

1900
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:47,500
to but in the meantime the reason I speak the way I have been lately is

1901
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:52,800
because you ever you ever go to a party or a group of people and they're all

1902
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:56,960
drunk but they're not just buzzed they're drunk drunk and you can't

1903
02:42:56,960 --> 02:43:01,960
rationalize with them and you tell the guy you know the bathrooms over there

1904
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:05,380
and he's going the opposite way and he starts peeing and you know in the

1905
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:12,320
hallway you got it yeah you got to physically grab him and take some of his

1906
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:17,520
weight and bring him you know to the you know because they can't rationalize

1907
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:21,920
anymore you know it doesn't doesn't mean that you couldn't always rationalize

1908
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:27,980
with them but they're stone drunk now you see now it's purely beat him up sock

1909
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:31,120
him up knock him down get away or whatever cuz they're drunk you see and

1910
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:36,040
this is the condition of mankind always and this is the way I will be talking to

1911
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:39,440
people probably pretty much from now on as if they're just a bunch of drunks

1912
02:43:39,440 --> 02:43:43,740
don't pee in the plant don't pee in the pot right go to the right and you

1913
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:48,220
shouldn't have been so drunk in the first place so you know or sleep it

1914
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:54,840
over you know it's gonna hangover in the morning so and boy they're gonna have a

1915
02:43:54,840 --> 02:44:06,220
hangover yes yeah yeah yeah and again just to be apologetic to defend the way

1916
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:10,100
the style that I've been incorporating and speaking publicly is you don't have a

1917
02:44:10,100 --> 02:44:16,600
lot of time left so you know when you know how people again when they're

1918
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:19,060
getting drunk you know they play all nice and nice they have a drink they're

1919
02:44:19,060 --> 02:44:22,540
like I think you're an asshole right right yeah you know how people do that

1920
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:25,740
get him drunk so he tells you what he really thinks well I'll tell people what

1921
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:29,840
I really think you're all bunch of jerks well nothing personal but you know what

1922
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:36,420
I mean it's just humanity you know so get over it then what are you gonna do

1923
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:43,840
now food clothing shelter study like Bruce says you say even if no one

1924
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:48,040
listens to you when you know you know right and that's the reward itself that's

1925
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:55,760
the reward in itself yeah I am rather comfortable with just that aspect of it

1926
02:44:56,360 --> 02:45:05,580
yeah because I tell you I made the rarity it just ain't there that's just

1927
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:11,860
nothing you could do so right I'll sit back and enjoy the comfort of

1928
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:18,760
understanding right food clothing shelter so the piss-poor pathetic lives

1929
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:22,680
and good water you gotta throw that good water in there oh yeah that's part of

1930
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:28,260
food and it's also part of clothing and it's part of shelter you know like the

1931
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:32,960
way for example I do water here if you put the tiniest amount I LG Trom except

1932
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:37,920
no substitute by the way you know what I'm talking about LG's a company they

1933
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:40,880
make a washing machine they don't stop making that's called Trom they have

1934
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:44,580
other ones but it's a front loader and if you if you modify it so it doesn't do

1935
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:47,700
the water conservation which actually uses more water remember the water

1936
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:50,740
conservation toilets you flush two or three times so where's the water

1937
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:54,700
conservation the way to do water conservation there is you know you have

1938
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:59,460
the sink water going to the toilet you see so instead of telling people to

1939
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:04,440
conserve water you make you make it so they can only but anyway when the water

1940
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:08,360
here like the way the soaps are now if I use the tiniest amount of soap it's like

1941
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:12,220
super sudsy and you go to someone else's you know because they haven't

1942
02:46:12,220 --> 02:46:17,020
modified the water condition of the water they pour all this soap you see

1943
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:22,420
because you know when you're when you're washing you want the water to carry away

1944
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:29,680
you know so if you know how to modify water so it does that you a better water

1945
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:35,280
will clean better right clean clothes better clean your car better clean your

1946
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:40,340
body better right real clean right and having good water running through the

1947
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:44,140
house changes the vibe like if you ever go to a like hospitals have the worst

1948
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:50,580
quality water I had you know and changes the the vibe for very various reasons

1949
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:57,100
yeah but like you said the water as well and all of that food clothing shelter

1950
02:46:57,100 --> 02:47:06,320
it's all attached yeah yeah so 14 years man keep saying it pretty soon it'll be

1951
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:12,580
13 and then 12 and yeah I don't know how much I'll be discussing or doing

1952
02:47:12,580 --> 02:47:18,620
anything anymore much after that we'll see I'd you know I don't think I'm not

1953
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:22,180
gonna say now I need my words later but I don't think after 2020 I'll be around

1954
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:28,140
to say anything I mean if I am around I won't be talking you know I mean I think

1955
02:47:28,140 --> 02:47:33,240
it's best to sit back and watch the train wreck which is not gonna look like

1956
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:37,020
a train wreck at all it's gonna look like a brand new supersonic jet coming

1957
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:44,380
out of its hangar everybody want to take a ride right right Wow all right watch

1958
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:51,480
what I'd suggest is you got till now to the fall you got um watch Jordan watch

1959
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:55,520
Assyria watch Lebanon it's not this year next year and you got three and a

1960
02:47:55,520 --> 02:48:01,100
half to five years before the discussion we had regarding the cities mm-hmm to

1961
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:05,800
look up in the scriptures all the cities that are I think it was a Wikipedia was

1962
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:10,400
just as good as anything else right yeah I mean you can't fudge too much I mean

1963
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:13,920
I'm sure there's a few errors and some of the names I've noticed I was looking

1964
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:18,420
at my chicken scratch I have to relook the city because you know spelt it wrong

1965
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:22,540
maybe I was taking it off of an interlinear off the Hebrew letters but I

1966
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:31,500
would say get a list of all the cities and the ones that have to have any

1967
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:36,440
involvement to biblical cities between judges Joshua judges Chronicles Kings

1968
02:48:38,860 --> 02:48:43,700
that's yep you get the point right we've discussed before that's where Israel is

1969
02:48:43,700 --> 02:48:49,120
going to be and I think I dropped the map or maybe I didn't is go do an online

1970
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:55,440
search under maps or just do a browser browser search map of Israel during time

1971
02:48:55,440 --> 02:49:02,860
of judges and then go to images and what you're going to see is quote-unquote

1972
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:08,580
tribes of Israel over the Jordan River on the other side of the Jordan River the

1973
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:17,440
eastern side what's that now that's Jordan now isn't it so yeah have fun and

1974
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:23,640
that's that's how it's that's how it's going to come that's how it's going to

1975
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:30,560
be right I'm gonna I actually have to run attend to some things I just realized

1976
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:35,460
what time it is to Bruce I appreciate the all the behind-the-scenes stuff I'm

1977
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:48,040
going to do a one-handed clap for you and yeah I'm actually if you didn't do

1978
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:52,120
that because I'll tell you sure sure is whatever I'm not doing it I haven't

1979
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:55,940
archived anything I neither do I care I don't have anything if you any of the

1980
02:49:55,940 --> 02:50:00,920
computers that I use I don't have anything archived or whatever if

1981
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:06,980
someone asked me send me an audio of whatever I don't have anything yeah I'd

1982
02:50:06,980 --> 02:50:11,880
have to go to archives and AFR what you're doing right right it's like

1983
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:17,540
someone says I don't even before I keep all this every all the past sonic events

1984
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:24,720
streaming 24-7 and I catch myself I'd rather listen to that than have that

1985
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:29,980
crap that's out on the net you know they're all a bunch of assholes yeah the

1986
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:34,380
whole is a whole they're all assholes out there you know I'm not mincing words

1987
02:50:34,380 --> 02:50:38,860
anymore no no they're all assholes I mean not not only do they have assholes

1988
02:50:38,860 --> 02:50:45,500
they are assholes the entire internet thing and yeah and even when you try to

1989
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:52,000
brush them up in your own mind you know like fresco and these other guys they

1990
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:56,060
say good stuff you're like wait a second there's no way this is going to work

1991
02:50:56,060 --> 02:51:02,200
without so much more you know none of it is it's just it's just a freaking dump

1992
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:06,380
but look it's the same thing you know if we went back to when the printing

1993
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:10,700
presses or even before that people were bad-mouthing the monks you know they're

1994
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:14,360
writing all this bullshit you know this is you know a hundred thousand years ago

1995
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:19,220
right mm-hmm it's still it's been going on for for the longest time you know the

1996
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:24,080
even if you go back to biblical days first century the Sadducee men that

1997
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:28,580
perishing the fat Pharisees and the Sadducees they were not liked our mixed

1998
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:32,200
feelings you know the rich people like them because they could wield power with

1999
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:38,600
them you know so they were all it's all been messed up and if you even if you go

2000
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:43,500
back with Israel left Egypt they're in the wilderness within the presence of

2001
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:48,440
the Most High's proxy and they got used to it to the point where they were still

2002
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:53,980
making pagan altars and sacrifices to pagan gods right there when when it

2003
02:51:53,980 --> 02:52:01,260
would that you see right so it's never been the scripture does say a fool

2004
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:06,820
romanticizes about the past right this year this is the best this is the best

2005
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:10,660
time right now because it's almost over is that when you go on a long what's the

2006
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:14,620
best part of the long road trip is the arrive right before you get to where

2007
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:22,610
you're going right right is the best part of the road trip so okay so again we'll
