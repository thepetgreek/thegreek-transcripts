1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:31,040
There we are, greetings Greek, and greetings everyone, yeah, okay, we're here again, yes,

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,020
it's just the first week of the sixth month, right, yes, correct, apparently, yeah, I believe

3
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,740
it's the fifth, if I'm not mistaken, yeah, I think it ends around what they call Thursday,

4
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Thursday, Friday, I think is what they call the day of rest, around there, yeah, so, okay,

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,360
any questions in chat, I think you were asking me if I got any response, right, and do you

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,260
want to, yeah, a response to, you mean the last sonic event we had with, have you noticed,

7
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,380
yes, you, I believe you want, oh, there was good feedback on that, it was meaning the,

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,000
you wanted to get suggestions, topics, subjects, and I was wondering how that panned out, oh,

9
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,400
nothing really, just the usual one paragraph to one page emails that I answer back with

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,500
two words or three words, okay, and then I get responses back, they had to think about

11
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,680
my response for a week until they got it, right, I mean, this is planet Earth, you

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,480
know, I mean, right, yeah, you know what's going on on this planet, so, yeah, oh, yeah,

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,900
yeah, she's not doing it, yeah, no, the planet is fine, it's just, yeah, right, oh, yes,

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,740
the planet is beautiful, yeah, well, you know, it's pretty, nature gets pretty wild, so,

15
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,540
but, yeah, all right, if there's nothing in chat, I guess this isn't a very short sonic,

16
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:10,260
right, yeah, all right, I don't know, I'm not in front of the computer, doing some minor

17
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:18,560
chores at the moment, right, so, is there anything going on, not much, let's see, just

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,060
like I mentioned, one from a person that was in the channel, mentioned about memory,

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:34,200
and improving memory, it's communication, that all has to do with communication, yeah,

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,140
and there's many levels to it, and that, I think, is gonna, that's kind of like years

21
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,180
ago, when I was younger, and dumber, and more naive about speaking publicly, you know,

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:56,720
giving at least hints to get into things, so, and that's good, you know, with the possible,

23
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,000
you know, endeavor in mind to expand subjects further, but I don't see that it's necessary

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,720
to expand on anything, just give a few hints, and then go with it, well, the memory aspect,

25
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,880
you know, memory only, well, let's just look at it real, basically, it works when you're

26
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,580
conscious, right, and dreams, when you're getting a dream, it doesn't work on memory,

27
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,960
it works on, you're being plugged, right, it's external, that's, even that could get

28
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,420
in, more elaborate into dreams and stuff, but let's just go back to, so what we call

29
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,660
consciousness, and there's, I still get some emails about consciousness, and I stay away

30
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,120
from them, because they're, 99% of the time, if not all the time, the people, morons, I

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,700
should say, that approach regarding questions about consciousness is 100% from the new age

32
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,480
mindfuck perspective, and you can't, you can't take that fecal matter and wrap it up in something

33
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,020
and give it to someone as something good, because it's just crap, the new age, right,

34
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,400
stuff, and you know, the ancients talk about the new age being crap, you know, meaning

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,019
of the human secular one, right, because there is going to be a new age when the gods rule,

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,839
and that's not what I'm talking about, but, so, again, about memory, when you're conscious,

37
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,580
and you're recalling, you typically, you know, it's all external input, right, even the scientists

38
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,520
have looked at it, and said that we don't see where anything in the brain is doing anything,

39
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,740
so again, you're tapping into an external source, but you are given the, let's say, more

40
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,220
than the onus, and more than just the responsibility, the actual mental or spiritual facility to

41
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,100
have retainment of memory, and you know, the brain being an antenna, if you rip off a chunk

42
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,620
of the brain, you might lose that, right, or damage it, just like, anyone who knows

43
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,640
about radio, what happens when you change your antenna once it's been tuned, but nonetheless,

44
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,200
that's like a very basic aspect of let's just talk about what we're talking about, which

45
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,460
is memory, and then the next aspect is how do you improve it, well, first thing is you

46
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:19,500
have to have good communication, a poor communication is not going to allow one to set things in

47
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,700
priority where good communication allows one to set the priority of that communication,

48
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,320
and I've noticed that most people don't know how to communicate, they just utter, they make

49
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,640
sounds, you know, and other people, and people respond to those sounds, and we think we're

50
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,840
communicating, and that's not really the best, most optimized communication, so once these

51
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,760
communications impart an idea, information, and influence, cognitive, you know, we tend

52
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,640
to recall them using various things, we can call it a trigger, is one aspect, another one

53
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,360
is we, you know, when you file it away, you know, what separates, you know, a file cabinet

54
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
from just a big pile of papers, it's really the same thing, you know, it's just ones in

55
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,380
a metal box, maybe ones, you know, if you just took a big metal box and stuffed it with

56
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,500
thousands of pages of paper, you can't really call that a file cabinet, it's more of a storage

57
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:21,220
area, what makes something a file cabinet is it's broken down by, in some order, you

58
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:28,540
know, or some form of, you know, when you study categories, indexing, appendices, things

59
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:37,000
like that, so the way to improve memory is by optimizing that indexing system, and the

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,060
easiest way to actually show that is by association, even with indexing, if you're not familiar

61
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,200
with the indexing system, it doesn't make any sense, you still can't find anything,

62
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,080
you have to have the primer, or understand how the indexing system works, like remember

63
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,460
in the old libraries, they had developed what's called the Dewey Decimal System, you actually

64
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:06,560
had to memorize certain rules, so there are many, up until the, I'd say, 17th, 15th or

65
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,840
16th century, there were many memory schools throughout Europe, and then they were banned,

66
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,160
of course, because the elite, you know, you can't be an educated and well-thought-out

67
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,320
thinking or thought-out person and be controlled, so they started banning all these things, but

68
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,440
one of the more popular things regarding memory was like the memory palace that the Greeks

69
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,640
instilled as one of the basics of the teaching memory, and that's basically by association,

70
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,600
you know, you, when you, let's say you go visit someone's house, or you live in a house,

71
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,620
and you have different rooms, you can actually recall what's in each room, and you know,

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,900
and again, even that is a form of indexing, you know, second floor, back room, front room,

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,500
things like that, so memory palace is where you basically look at things and you remember

74
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,420
how you're going to remember them, okay?

75
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,140
Another way is by association, when someone is very

76
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:18,960
familiar with a term, and then you can associate the familiar terms with things that are unfamiliar

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:28,700
by the hominized, when something sounds the same, like that's a very easy way that I just

78
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,960
show people how easy it is to learn, let's say, Hebrew, and I'm not a Hebrew conversationalist,

79
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,140
there's other people that I've encouraged to learn, and they are, they have learned on

80
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,780
their own, but you can do it by association, we could do it real quick, you know, when

81
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,300
I ask someone, do you want to learn how to speak some Hebrew, you mean you already know

82
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,360
some words already, like what's that animal that lives in the desert that has a hump on

83
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,500
its back, a camel, right?

84
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,480
Well, in Hebrew it would be Gamal, with a G instead of a C, right?

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah, because they're really good camels there, so they're good camels, so you think of it with a G.

86
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,100
Another one is like, well, how do you say yes in Hebrew?

87
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:25,980
Well, I'll say, you know that toy, what's the most famous little doll that they give, we're talking about western culture here, girls, it's the Barbie doll, right?

88
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,600
Right.

89
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,120
And Barbie is a ho, so she always says yes to, what's her mate?

90
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, Ken.

91
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,500
Ken, right.

92
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,520
Okay, so she never says, she always says yes to him, so Ken is how you say yes in Hebrew.

93
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,440
Oh my, wow.

94
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,460
So you see how easy it is to remember now?

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,740
Yes, yes.

96
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Because Barbie, she's really easy, right?

97
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,480
So she always says yes to who?

98
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Ken.

99
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,100
Okay, there you go.

100
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,180
Okay, when someone says yes, you feel high, but when someone says no, you feel low.

101
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,940
Right, now that's how you say no in Hebrew, is low.

102
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,340
Oh for goodness sakes.

103
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,140
So do you see the associations here?

104
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, yes.

105
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,380
Now these are long, now this

106
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:21,380
is not necessarily memory per se, but it is, because what we did here is we've fitted

107
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,160
some presumptions and assumptions that you're a westerner, and you're familiar with certain

108
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,120
western things, so I'm giving you western examples, mainstream, that's very easy, that

109
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,000
you won't forget, and actually even if you try to get it out of your mind, you couldn't,

110
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,000
Barbie, you can, right?

111
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,560
Right.

112
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:55,000
So you make these associations, and you run the person through a short exercise where they actually have a working model of what you're trying to illustrate, and they actually produce and remember the associations as well.

113
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
And you do the same thing with memories.

114
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,260
Okay, I just showed the language, so you probably will, how do you say yes in Hebrew?

115
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,340
You just think of Barbie, right?

116
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,280
And her mate.

117
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,000
Because she's easy.

118
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,800
Right, because Barbie is easy, and she never says no to, she always says yes.

119
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:25,660
And you know, when someone says yes, you feel high, but when they say no, you feel low.

120
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,040
And you could go on and on and on.

121
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:47,660
You know, like in Spanish, you know, anatomy, for example, you know, like skin, right, you know, skin, you know, when you get a sunburn, what happens after it dries, what does it do?

122
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,180
It peels, right?

123
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,740
So PL, or when you're taking, when you're peeling something, what are you peeling off on a fruit?

124
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,620
The skin.

125
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,980
So that's how you say in Spanish, skin is PL.

126
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,820
But you know, you think of a Spanish accent, right?

127
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,520
Right.

128
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,480
So like, lips are very easy.

129
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,440
What do they call them on a woman's genitalia?

130
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,540
Labios, or labias, right?

131
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,260
Labios, right?

132
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,240
Okay, right.

133
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,740
Okay.

134
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,640
So you go on and on and on with making associations like that.

135
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,840
So, yeah.

136
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Very clever, yes.

137
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,220
Yeah, I mean, you know, like your face is wide, but your nose is narrow, right?

138
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:46,960
And it's at the end of your face, like the, what's the last letter on the end of the alphabet is Z, and it's narrow.

139
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,120
So nariz, like narrow and with a Z, nariz, you know, it's your nose.

140
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,120
So you can, so what I mean here is these associations are not only for learning, but for memory.

141
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:18,860
So to actually create an optimum memorization system, you have to have an optimum communication and an optimum learning system, because when you're presented with something or that you decide to retain in memory, you must also learn how you're going to put it in memory.

142
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:28,400
Just like, for example, if before the Windows systems, when you had worked on old computers and you wanted to put something in memory, you just didn't say, click save.

143
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,620
You had to go through protocols, right?

144
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,520
To put it in memory.

145
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah.

146
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,360
Okay.

147
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,000
And it's still done.

148
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
It's just that you don't see it.

149
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,900
Right.

150
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,480
So the same thing where you have to develop the protocols to develop memory, think of it like canning.

151
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:50,160
You know, you just don't, you know, if you grow a bunch of string means and got more than you'll ever need for a while, you want to can them and preserve them.

152
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,100
You just open a jar and throw them in and put them in the closet, right?

153
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,060
No.

154
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,580
What will happen if you do that?

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,440
It will spoil.

156
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:58,720
Yeah.

157
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,800
And explode.

158
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:08,960
So you have to learn how to basically put the stuff in a can and canning is a skill.

159
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,920
So in other words, if you get a sense of the various metaphors, there's no free ride here with memory.

160
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,560
There's nothing you can do other than develop the system or the tools to associate good communication with good learning and then storage.

161
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,700
And the storage is the association.

162
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,780
You know, how many times have you heard someone said, you know, I think I have one of those.

163
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
I just don't know where it is.

164
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,300
Right.

165
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,740
Right.

166
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,640
Right.

167
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,780
You have to go look for it.

168
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:46,940
So what you do is you try to put a logical sequence, you know, when you have, for example, tools that pull and tools that push, you don't want to put the tools that push with the paintbrushes together.

169
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:57,000
You want to put, you know, tools that grab and squeeze with tools that grab and squeeze, like your C clamps, your vices, your channel locks go together, you know, like your scrapers.

170
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,280
Right.

171
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,860
Something like a chisel.

172
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,300
You know, does it go with woodworking or does it go with scrapers?

173
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,580
Well, you know, you might want to have do you see the dual purpose one purpose, right?

174
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,880
Things that cut well, you have scissors, you're pivoting shears and you have saw stuff with teeth like various saws.

175
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,180
Do you want to put a wood saw with a hacksaw?

176
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,600
Very different.

177
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,020
But you could be working with wood and have a nail that you want the hacksaw for.

178
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,380
Right.

179
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,280
So then you have to make these fine decisions that are personal and also how specialized your memory wants to be.

180
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,400
And then there's there's actually a whole aspect to this that you can there's exercises and all that.

181
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:45,820
But I think right now I gave a tremendous amount of just ideas in just the introduction to the subject and a skill set.

182
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,220
Yes.

183
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,380
Yeah.

184
00:15:48,560 --> 00:16:01,620
Because in order to discuss these things in a framework where it could be done, you have to really again, I'd have to sit down and think about writing something and like other people have said, well, let's do a podcast and let's structure.

185
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:15,780
It's just not a matter of doing, you know, I've got to collect myself, maybe take a few days or weeks to put this or at least quite a few hours to assemble this, see what's on the rectangle about it, which is probably a joke and just put, you know, references together also.

186
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,540
And, you know, yeah.

187
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,560
So but at least I think the hint is good enough for now.

188
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,160
Right.

189
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,680
Yeah.

190
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,900
Pretty nice.

191
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,660
What else you got?

192
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,140
Yeah.

193
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,120
Not a lot here.

194
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,840
Not not much in chat.

195
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,260
OK.

196
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,720
Let's take a picture.

197
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:53,080
Was there some requesting discussion sort of feng shui Greek style about home interior and exterior?

198
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm not an interior decorator.

199
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
No, that's fine.

200
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,300
It's a it's a valid question.

201
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,160
But you just be glad that you got something that's better than a cardboard box.

202
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
It doesn't get soggy when you rain.

203
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,680
You don't have a lot of time right now.

204
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,579
I think you've got 13 years and six months or so.

205
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:27,660
We never talked about one probably never will, as I'm getting time, the detail on biblical chronology and figure out why I say the things that I think I've been over it before in various sonic events here and there.

206
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,080
But when is the exact within a time frame?

207
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,340
We know we know when the gods will return within three days, like three days before it happens.

208
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,400
You will know for sure.

209
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,060
Three and actually three and a half days.

210
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,120
OK, so that is your your your minimum amount of prep time.

211
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,640
I mean, or maximum, I should say doubt.

212
00:17:51,340 --> 00:18:00,280
There'll come a time in history where there will be at three and a half days before the gods arrive.

213
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,000
There'll be no doubt that they're coming at that time.

214
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:11,580
So there's a bit, you know, there's a chronology and actually then and then there's another time where we know 40 days.

215
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,280
It'll be 40 days before those three and a half days come.

216
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
We could say with 99 percent assurance in 40 days they'll be here.

217
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:30,940
But when and then, you know, at the 36 and a half day mark rate at that point, then it'll be totally clear that you were really on or off on that 40 days.

218
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,740
You see, if you're right.

219
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:42,640
And then if you go back, sorry, if you go back from there, you've got three and a half years before they come that you'll be pretty close to saying when they will come.

220
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,720
And then back from there, you could easily say seven years before they come.

221
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,600
And back from there, we could say 13 years and six months, which is right now.

222
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,200
Oh, yeah.

223
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:05,020
And it's funny when I this kind of discussion makes people very nervous because sometimes they catch them on these nervous twitches.

224
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,440
Sometimes I say, well, Greek, first you said it was this amount of time.

225
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,860
Now it's this.

226
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,080
I said, no, I never said that.

227
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,680
Right.

228
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,100
I'm very sure about it.

229
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm very sure about the chronology.

230
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,740
Mm hmm.

231
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,180
It's just that people can't listen to this kind of stuff.

232
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
It's just difficult for them.

233
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,460
And they're censored, of course.

234
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,320
It certainly is an eye opener.

235
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,240
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

236
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,700
All right.

237
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,220
So in terms of interior, yeah, decorating or whatever.

238
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,460
OK, now anything else?

239
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,680
No, that looks to be the long and short of it.

240
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:35,900
Greek.

241
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,000
OK, well, let's wrap it up.

242
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Oh, go take a nap.

243
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,620
Was this last one.

244
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,700
Can the relationship between leaving and sin be discussed or leavening?

245
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,060
The what?

246
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,440
Leavening and sin be discussed.

247
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:51,860
No.

248
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,700
Well, how do you know it's leavening?

249
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,860
That's the New Testament questions.

250
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,760
Anyone asking stuff in the New Testament means that they're an expert in the Bible.

251
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,780
And have pretty good comprehension.

252
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,220
And publicly that doesn't exist.

253
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,840
A little bit of yeast leavens the whole thing, I see.

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,260
But what is it about the wheat or the bread?

255
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,860
But here's the thing, that was stuff that the Christ told his disciples and his apostles.

256
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,980
If you think you're in that level, that that's worth discussing.

257
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:39,640
You know, Euphorus, but just open and I'm telling you, there's no public discourse on that because the people are not at that level yet.

258
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:58,760
So that's why, for example, when you when you're around what's called the Hebraic or Jewish traditions, they never discuss the New Testament and things like that.

259
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,220
It's not because, oh, it's not part of our religion or this and that, you know, actually, you know, that's the public side.

260
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:06,980
Right.

261
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:17,440
But on the private side, these people that are grew up with scripture and actually have a pretty decent comprehension of it, see it as being a very advanced level.

262
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:32,240
And I don't like getting into when I discuss stuff from the New Testament, it's the premise of who the Christ is to at least go after and get away from the deception and start to get a handle on what his true identity.

263
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,660
But in terms of what the Christ said, forget about it.

264
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,080
That's not for public discourse.

265
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,060
That's kind of arrogant when people come either.

266
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,120
The two types people ask those questions.

267
00:21:42,220 --> 00:22:08,240
One is the the brainwashed moron that is in churchianity or Christianity and has got one foot in that and one foot in the other or in the or in the other one is, I don't know, I was still brainwashed, whatever, is that, you know, they're linked to popular culture, they have no understanding of, of the, of the aspect of what's going on in the New Testament.

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,780
So that's, I've brought I've, you know, I'm guilty of volunteering a lot of explanations regarding that, right?

269
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,460
Right.

270
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,920
But when I when I do that, it's not just what about this?

271
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,300
What about that here and there?

272
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,900
It's to underpin the identity of the biblical Christ, the Mashiach that they say in Hebrew, right?

273
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,700
Right.

274
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
Because it's their Mashiach, right?

275
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:31,760
Right.

276
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,220
Because why is it because very simply, most of the world was pagan, and they came out of, you

277
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,000
know, various cultures with many, many gods, but the the one of the of Israel, they had always in their

278
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,540
back of the minds, the concept of resurrection and a Mashiach being the one that's going to show them

279
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:59,120
that no other the Christians don't have that, don't have that, by the way, right, they because they teach

280
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,380
either when you die, you go to heaven or hell, which is pagan, right, right.

281
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,080
And they in the circus and all that there is no church with the Christ at all.

282
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,240
You know, there's no circus with him.

283
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,920
So yeah, I don't I don't like left field.

284
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,460
It's not like they're not it's not appropriate to answer that, by the way, publicly.

285
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,200
Because the background in that is is is.

286
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:37,060
And it's funny when you go online and try to look up what these things mean that you get the you're going to be swarmed with Christian churchy entity crap, because that's where it belongs.

287
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,980
That's part of the deception.

288
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:46,540
And not to dissuade or be pejorative to the person who asked that question.

289
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:57,980
But I think as we get more serious through this society about the crap that's coming, I think that's that's kind of like a brunt of a joke to ask a New Testament question that's like that.

290
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,240
I'd rather ask, you know, say joke, like, what did the squid say to the bagpipe?

291
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,460
I'd fuck you if you took those pajamas off, right?

292
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:08,940
Yeah.

293
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,600
But anyway.

294
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Oh, my.

295
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:28,320
Yeah, the whole only thing people got to know when they look at the New Testament is, well, they got to know is very simple.

296
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
There's something called the resurrection.

297
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,540
And it's been proven.

298
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:41,120
You don't have to think about heaven or hell or born again, this or this and that, you know, just basically tells you what happens after you die.

299
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,860
And it's been proven.

300
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,920
That's all.

301
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,840
It's kind of like when they, you know, they do a nuclear physics or atomic physics, and they're all talking and doing and doing and doing and experimenting.

302
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,340
And then one day they finally do ground zero test site and they blow one up and they're like, OK, we did it.

303
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,940
You know, it's done.

304
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,500
Even though it was just a test, you know, it worked.

305
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,440
Right.

306
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,420
You know, we had all these presumptions before that.

307
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,940
No, if we do it, we'll destroy the whole planet because of the credit chain reaction.

308
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,080
The whole atmosphere will burn.

309
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,160
No, no.

310
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,760
You see.

311
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,020
So all those things are dispelled.

312
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,660
You know, they proved what they did to prove.

313
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah.

314
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,540
Yeah.

315
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,340
That's what the New Testament is.

316
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:36,520
And the other thing about that is it's monkey business at this point, because the what Christianity has put forward, you know, through the state and through the adversary and all that, through Hollywood and the church, the circus and through tradition.

317
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,560
It is thick out there.

318
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:40,660
Oh, yeah.

319
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,200
You cannot.

320
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,020
The truth about it is so contrary to that.

321
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah.

322
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:55,100
You know, because the Christ, if it was the peers, nothing in the New Testament was meant for people to discuss, he would have said so.

323
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,250
Right.

324
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:58,970
Right.

325
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,390
So and and what he what he came to do, he did.

326
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,650
And that was the message that was supposed to go out.

327
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,730
So because also he respected the leasehold that Satan has on this planet.

328
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,110
You ever hear about like tenants have rights?

329
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,750
If you're if you're a landlord, you can't go open and, you know, go into a tenant's house, right?

330
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,510
Right.

331
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,150
Say they have tenants rights.

332
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:36,630
So so the landlord comes shows humanity or some of the humanity that knew not the ignorant because the Christ hated ignorant people, by the way.

333
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,110
If you don't know that, you could read it yourself.

334
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:56,750
And he's not going to come as the landlord and start showboating around to the children of the tenant, who is the Nakash or the Satan or the adversary.

335
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,870
This is his children on this planet.

336
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,650
Now, spiritually, you know, right.

337
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,650
So.

338
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,470
Hmm.

339
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,070
Yeah, it's pretty interesting stuff.

340
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,650
People very often, even fortunately, not much, because I give the same answer.

341
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,590
Unless I volunteer the information from the New Testament, don't ask me about it.

342
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,990
All right, because the problem is, you were not talking about the same thing here at all.

343
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,090
Right.

344
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:35,410
Let's say you're walking on the street, Bruce, and we're let's you and I are a street and someone bus stop, you know, says you're into the Bible and ask me a New Testament question.

345
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,190
Do you think that person knows who the Christ is?

346
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,890
And he knows the chronology of things and knows his purpose?

347
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:49,950
Anything I say he's gonna that person's gonna have to make it fit into the they're, they're distorted, twisted, you know, church entity, Christian crap.

348
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:50,590
Right.

349
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,010
And it's not something that doesn't.

350
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,110
You're in the middle of an argument.

351
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,130
Right?

352
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,570
Yeah.

353
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:58,970
Yeah.

354
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,590
So good.

355
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:05,470
You know, so the whole thing is to, to wait and study.

356
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:22,110
And I've been say, if you've heard of my earliest sonic events, there's a graduation, a graduate of order to anything New Testament is graduate level, like you would have kindergarten through 12th grade, undergraduate study, master's and doctorate study.

357
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:22,850
Right.

358
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,630
So you're at 21 years now in school, you know, from K through 12.

359
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,790
So anything New Testament is graduate level.

360
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:48,910
So to discuss that properly is to presume that you are past the kindergarten past the grade school past the high school level past the grad, you know, bachelor's and past the graduate level, you're a doctorate level to discuss that some of the New Testament is on a master's level.

361
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,630
But most of it's on the doctorate and master's and above.

362
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,050
Yeah.

363
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:02,250
So it has nothing to do with people who think, first of all, it has nothing to do with them.

364
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:23,010
Well, you know, then the people on this planet directly, it's a very indirect thing to show those who know about or yearn to know about what who the gods are and their purpose and interacting with this whole saga, what we're going through, right.

365
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,970
And also what happens after you die.

366
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
It's only for those people.

367
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,350
He the Christ even said that he said, I came for the lost of Israel doesn't say lost.

368
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:40,750
Like, you know, when you lost a sheep, you're lost the horse because the doors open any, you know, when you get lost, you don't have anybody any before GPS.

369
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,890
I don't know where I am.

370
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,350
No, it's not.

371
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,750
The actual word is perished, the ones that have died.

372
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,810
Right.

373
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,230
The one you know, to in other words, because that resurrection has to do with dead people, you can't be resurrected if you're alive.

374
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,350
That's why it born again, Christianity crap is the most ridiculous.

375
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,810
That's like a joke that they put on the people.

376
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,090
And then it stuck.

377
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,770
I can be born again when you're already born.

378
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,450
Right.

379
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,650
Or you haven't died yet.

380
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,110
You know, you know, and then they try to use the metaphor of the spirit.

381
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,870
They don't even know, you know, it's a big man.

382
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,890
Isaiah talked about it.

383
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,650
It's a stumbling block to them.

384
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,350
Hmm.

385
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,530
It's shocking.

386
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,050
You know, here's the other shocking point.

387
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,930
How many people that actually respond to Greek speak and still don't know the identity of the Christ.

388
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,750
They still wrestle with it.

389
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,650
Like, Oh, you mean he wasn't crucified?

390
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,050
Oh, shit.

391
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:38,990
Yeah.

392
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,990
Yeah.

393
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,470
You know?

394
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,110
senseless.

395
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,490
Yeah.

396
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,550
You're on the humanities on the tail end of a project right now that's about to end violently, because there's no other way.

397
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,770
The gods are very efficient.

398
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,430
So imagine that.

399
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:00,950
Yeah.

400
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,090
Yeah.

401
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,050
Was it the church lady and Saturday Night Live?

402
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,310
It was a guy Dana Carvey.

403
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,490
Yeah.

404
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,970
Yeah.

405
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:14,790
Yeah.

406
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:16,670
Yeah.

407
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:16,770
Yeah.

408
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,270
Dana.

409
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,530
They need a data Harvey to do the thing.

410
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,930
He was he was quite the fellow.

411
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,230
The only thing people need to really relax and meditate on is things are much worse than they perceive them to be.

412
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,030
And they just don't perceive them.

413
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,670
Because they're normal.

414
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,270
It seems like there's no sense of urgency or alarm.

415
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:45,110
And there shouldn't be a sense of urgency or alarm because you'll be singled out and you know, as an as a madman, right?

416
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:45,870
Right.

417
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,470
So no, doesn't mean live on edge.

418
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,110
Really easy to do these days.

419
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:05,190
Well, that's the modus operandi for the gods when when when you are given something to do, and it's time to take you out, they get the other people around you to take you out, lock you up or whatever.

420
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,990
That's your read that scripture.

421
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,450
Yeah.

422
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:22,910
By example, you know, even even the king, you know, has some of his family revolt against him temporarily, you know, David, and like Jeremiah was thrown into the dungeon, basically, you know, by his own people.

423
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:32,730
So yeah, it's a very fine line, you know, well, it's a very fine line with everything, right.

424
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:41,490
But in terms of discussing the gods, you know, like, again, any biblical question is about the gods, right?

425
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,970
Essentially, because anybody could discuss anything in scripture on different terms and secularly or whatever.

426
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,210
But when you bring up a scriptural question, usually has a context and a subject to it.

427
00:32:52,170 --> 00:33:01,630
And and guess what, whatever the context or subject is, is referred to and what is brought up in scripture is what the gods think of that, not you or someone else, right?

428
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,630
Mm hmm.

429
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:45,950
So, yeah, the thing is, just wait, there's not much time, you know, think about it like someone like old farts, like I'm in my sixth decade now.

430
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:46,770
Right.

431
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,410
Mm hmm.

432
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,290
Mid, you know, half a century and half a decade almost.

433
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:58,650
So, so since my sixth decade, so what I would suggest is, you know, anyone, you know, figure out how long you've been on this planet.

434
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,610
And how long have you been gone without, let's say, biblical knowledge, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know

435
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:02,710
...

436
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,030
Like what kind of information, what kind of knowledge, you know, the things like that.

437
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:04,470
Alright.

438
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:16,969
Most of it most likely, right, actually, I'll be cocky here, but if you haven't heard Greek speak, you probably don't know, you know, you, you might've heard other people discuss it's important, but I'm sure, surely not with accuracy.

439
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:33,110
So think about how much time you spent on this planet without this any point of view, let's just say, and you only had this point of view or in pursuing whatever you might be pursuing after listening to this kind of stuff for a very short time.

440
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:41,550
So the remainder of the time that's left might seem kind of long, because you've only been perceiving it for a short time.

441
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,090
But the time that you didn't have this perception is much longer than the time that's left.

442
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,989
So you can balance all that out, you know what I mean?

443
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,190
So I mean, let's take Bruce, for example.

444
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:58,590
You've had probably half a century without this kind of perception, right?

445
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,250
5.5 centuries.

446
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,170
That's a long time.

447
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,690
Yeah, 0.55 of a century, yeah.

448
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,150
Right.

449
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,570
Right.

450
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,570
So now you have, let's say, a couple of years or so of it, and the time that's left is seven times that amount, let's say.

451
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,050
But the time that you went fine without, seemingly fine, was much, much longer.

452
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,230
So these are the things to think about.

453
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,030
Right.

454
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:26,450
Yeah.

455
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,580
Yeah, and you just be aware.

456
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:45,240
So far, I could tell no one within reach that I know of is being called or chosen to do anything special, or promote anything, or keep it going.

457
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,560
I don't see it.

458
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:54,980
And I don't mean just the people in chat and emailing or in this, whatever, like Vandy said, the mob.

459
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm talking about on the internet completely, too, and in the world.

460
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,960
I just do look up what's going on.

461
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,000
There's no talk.

462
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,480
There's nothing.

463
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,400
It's still very quiet.

464
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,380
I mean, there's like nothing about the Pope's work schedule, or how the body works, or lawful timekeeping, or anything.

465
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,760
Not a word.

466
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,880
Still just, still just, no, not time yet.

467
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,420
Hmm.

468
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,140
Interesting.

469
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,360
But it is rather, from, let's say, geopolitical, it is rather still.

470
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,360
That doesn't mean that there's not much going on.

471
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,040
There's a lot going on if you know what to look for.

472
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,460
So as a matter of fact, you should be concerned when it's quiet like that.

473
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:53,340
So, I mean, like, I don't know if you remember in the late 90s with Clinton, I think, they said the deficit went to zero and it got really quiet, right, in the 9-11.

474
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:54,920
Yeah.

475
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,200
Yeah.

476
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,520
I remember the debt clock went to zero in like less than a year.

477
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,960
And it got really quiet.

478
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,880
You know, they did a couple, they blew off, was it the USS Cole, they tried to blame it on some radical group, right.

479
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,920
You notice when they said, yeah, anyway.

480
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,180
That was an introduction, yeah.

481
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,260
Yeah, yeah, and then, yeah, so.

482
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,920
So right now is a quiet time, and I've been talking about this.

483
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:33,840
This is the time period now to start seeing things be put in place where there will be no doubt that by 2025, around that time, mid-2020s, there will be a Middle East Union in place as a power base.

484
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,480
So this is an interesting quiet period.

485
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:48,680
For me, it's not quiet at all because I'm contemplating and seeing the timing and I'm seeing really how just by it being quiet doesn't mean that there's not much going on.

486
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,660
The deception and the ignorance is being upheld.

487
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,060
Right.

488
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:01,540
So there's still nobody talking about, you know, about what the hell's going on, you know, with the most basic stuff that we never looked at before.

489
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,160
Right.

490
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,620
So we should.

491
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah.

492
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,140
Mm-hmm.

493
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:05,800
Wow.

494
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,460
Mm-hmm.

495
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,680
Yeah.

496
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
It'll come.

497
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,260
All right.

498
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,840
Nothing else?

499
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,520
If nothing else, we'll just make it a short one.

500
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay.

501
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,720
I don't see anything else there.

502
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,240
Yeah.

503
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,620
Okay.

504
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,380
There's tons of stuff to talk.

505
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,220
Yeah.

506
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,400
Just why volunteer stuff when, you know.

507
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,360
Right.

508
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,720
Just look for where the need is and we'll see what happens.

509
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,600
Okay.

510
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,400
Well, thanks, Bruce.

511
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,400
You're welcome.

512
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,100
And you have yourself a good night.

513
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,500
Yes.

514
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,300
Thank you.

515
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,720
You too.

516
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,280
Take care now.

517
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,420
Okay.

518
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,520
Bye.

519
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,140
Bye-bye.

520
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:54,980
Bye-bye.
