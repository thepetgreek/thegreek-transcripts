1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,360
There we go.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,260
Good evening, Greg.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,140
How are you doing?

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,500
Good evening.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, okay, we'll do this for another week.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,980
People are getting used to it, I guess.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,720
I certainly am in a way.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,760
Regularity, if you know what I mean, but without the poop.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,520
Yeah, and the corn is always fresh and clean.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,200
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:38,080
So, yeah, I only have got less than an hour, so I might as well just touch base with whoever, you know, it's a unilateral, meaning there's only one, I guess.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,220
Got a bunch of emails.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,020
Actually, I'm making a little bit of coffee now.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
I might be out for a second to grind those beans.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:44,800
Certainly.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:54,620
And I would just want to address, I've been getting quite a few emails, and most of the questions are pertinent.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Rehashing stuff, but, you know, at least it shows that people have heard and are listening slightly, so.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,220
Right.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Anything on your end?

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,240
Anything you want to bring up?

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:21,540
I was just noticing the uptick in Turkey, and as I venture around, you know, during the week when I get a little bit of time, I'll pop in on different radio stations to see what's going on, and maybe pick through some media quickly.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,780
I noticed a little Israel bashing starting to go on in Turkey.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,780
The fall would be.

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,140
Turkey as in, not the bird, but the country.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,020
The country, yes.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,580
Yeah, I like to say it like they do there.

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah, okay.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,880
The tariffs, and the Daher war against everything in the bank.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,500
And you noticed a subtle little hint of the bankers in the background in what they're playing.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,540
It's rather interesting, yeah.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,180
Well, the banking is interesting.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,920
Let's just cover that.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,580
Sure.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,460
For a very long time, over 500 years, the conquering and the conquest modalities have changed.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:31,940
Okay, it wasn't, it wasn't, well, let's just say it wasn't popular to do conquest the way conquest was done up until, oh, 12, 13, 14, 1500s, and they settled into the new modality by the 1700s, which kind of went a little askew, which it always does, and then it settled really well by the 19th century.

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,020
And, you know, that's where you had the American Revolution, French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars towards the end of the 18th century, and all that.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,140
All that's backwards, by the way, it's not what you think.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,540
You almost have to go back and look at contemporary writings.

39
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,220
Don't look at, don't look at what is written later about it.

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,880
Try to pick up, you know, stuff that was contemporary, written at the time while it was going on, right?

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,380
Very different.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,480
The other thing is, the money system is tied into that, because that's what commerce is.

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,240
And unless you're dealing in an isolated commune, you're going to need means of exchange.

44
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:35,360
What happened with the new modality of conquest is they developed forms of monarchy and forms of parliamentarianism and forms of governance that incorporated constitutionalism and various isms, you know, socialism, communism, various modalities.

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:49,040
All of those were basically set up to be a good curtain or a hiding place for those that really were in control, publicly, where prior to that, those who were really in control were more public.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,700
Now, this

47
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,620
new system of constitutional government or socialist government or the new monarchy, ministerial

48
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,600
government, and all the various modalities that came out were so successful, and it got the people

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,880
so enthralled into what you might call in a chattel state, or a slavery state, or just in a

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,880
worthlessness state, that it was time now to pull money and to pull knowledge, to pull science, to

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,520
pull all kinds of things that most people would say are integral aspects of the human community.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,540
Now, when you look at the money system, it's very, very simple.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,660
I've tried to give some information that's not out there, because that's all.

54
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,460
Otherwise, I just sound like everybody else.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,320
A bunch of morons repeating what, you know, what moron said, you know, to the other moron.

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,940
In essence, imagine you are in prison, and with no chance of ever getting out.

57
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,060
And the way you engage in exchange is by playing a board game called Monopoly.

58
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,160
And you have a player, a thimble, a house, whatever, and you have this monopoly money.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,520
And you use this monopoly money to get drugs or pay for sex or whatever in the prison.

60
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,140
That is the money system.

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,960
It does not exist anymore as it is.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I've even, I remember a decade ago, even asking an assembly-type politician, you know, I set them up.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,220
And I'm sure other people have done it, and I've discussed it with other people who have.

64
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,020
When they get on an economic discussion, you just say, well, money's Federal Reserve.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,000
And they answer, yes.

66
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,800
You know, you do the old car salesman stuff.

67
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,220
You get them to say yes enough times, and you close the deal.

68
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,440
And they say, well, Federal Reserve is a fiat currency.

69
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,600
You're like, well, not exactly.

70
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,260
Well, is it a fiat currency or is not?

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
Well, yes, it is a fiat currency.

72
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay, then they say yes.

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,720
And then you say, well, the government can pretty much, with the Federal Reserve, print as much money as they like.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,440
And they say yes.

75
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,500
So then why do you need to collect taxes?

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,580
Oops.

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,660
Right.

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,740
Big problem.

79
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,120
Subject to insert.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,440
Yeah, it's because in prison and lockdown, they do whatever they want to do.

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,460
It's because actually, that's what gives the money the value.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,200
When they, when you, when you engage, when they say you have to pay taxes or you get in trouble, well, now it's worth something.

83
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,800
Right.

84
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:26,760
Because through penalty, not because the taxes are, I assure anyone that not one penny, not, not one iota of any tax money anywhere has ever paid for anything in the past, let's say, minimum 40 years, maybe realistically 80 years.

85
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:38,220
Not one, even a button in a, in a government or a line painted on the street, one line, nothing, not one penny ever at all.

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,400
They even tell you that when you're driving down the street, it says, thank you for the roads, all you idiots.

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,260
It's the bonds that paid for it.

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
What is a bond?

89
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,600
A bond is an indenture agreement.

90
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,900
Right.

91
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:05,760
If I mow the lawn for you and you can't pay me, let's say you write me an IOU for 10 bucks, if we agreed on it now and you can't pay me for another month, but I could take, I need something right now.

92
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,060
I could take that IOU that you wrote and give it to, let's say somebody else for five bucks.

93
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,480
And I'll be, I'll be happy with five.

94
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,580
Now they, now they can either try to get the 10 bucks from you later, or they might sell it for six or bundle.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
They might have so many of them.

96
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,860
They could leverage that for something.

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,960
You see, that's, what's paying for or not paying, but it's an exchange.

98
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,300
You know what a helicopter is like a money scheme.

99
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,360
It needs to keep moving.

100
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,020
Right.

101
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,280
You know how immigrants do that?

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,860
They put a pool.

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,740
So you put in a hundred, everybody puts in a hundred dollars and once a week, someone gets a thousand.

104
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,380
Right.

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,040
Sounds good.

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,920
You get enough people.

107
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,480
It's bigger.

108
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,760
That, that has to keep going.

109
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,780
And it can't stop.

110
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
It's a Ponzi scheme or whatever.

111
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,000
Right.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,460
It's a helicopter thing or whatever.

113
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,480
So the money system, there is going to be no collapse.

114
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,640
There isn't going to, because no one knows how it works and it's going to keep going as long as whatever, as long as there are roofs on buildings.

115
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,860
Right.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,040
And there's going to be a time period before that, when the roofs are

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,980
removed from all the buildings, even the chicken coops, where the people will say, Hey, we're no

118
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,940
longer going to use this money system, but that's going to be, you know, irrelevant at that point,

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,940
because even if there's less than three days food in the store, it doesn't matter because

120
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,960
you don't have more than three days after that point anyway.

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:23,860
You see?

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,160
So, okay.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:42,220
So out of memory, I'm not in front of the computer now, but I've got a, like I mentioned earlier, there's a bunch of emails and not much talk like what you brought in looking at the news about the Middle East and all that, because it's a growing period.

124
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,100
And if it's for real, you're not hearing about it.

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,580
You see, other than little hints.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
So you're going to, right.

127
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,220
Because what they put out there is, is for the more on public consumption, whether it's mainstream or alternative media.

128
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,680
And the alternative media is more of a joke because they have an inferiority complex.

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,980
So they have to scream louder.

130
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,780
You know what I mean?

131
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,700
They're like Fox news doesn't have to scream as loud as, I don't know.

132
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,900
You could pick any of the alternative idiots of choice, right?

133
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,440
They have to try harder, you know, because they're in Fox news and CNN and me, MSNBC or the government websites.

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,420
They don't have an inferiority complex, right?

135
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,960
They're well-endowed where all of the other idiots with a website, I have an inferiority complex, obviously.

136
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,620
I mean, the thing that kind of took me notice was how many of them went to the Turkey story.

137
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,840
Um, and, and they really pumped it.

138
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,660
They pumped it up as much as they could, which.

139
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,780
Yeah.

140
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,140
Turkey is the Australia.

141
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Turkey is the Australia or the New Zealand of that part of the world.

142
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,980
You know what I mean by that?

143
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,220
Right.

144
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,500
Okay.

145
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,800
Yeah.

146
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,340
Yeah.

147
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,300
They experiment.

148
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:01,220
Like if you, if you're a New Zealander or an Australian, you're being experimented on your, your only, only reason you have a society is to be experimented on.

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,140
It's like when you go into a building and there's rats on cages, you're like, well, what's this for?

150
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,940
It seems like he's standing up against the, uh, um, no, he's not.

151
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:24,880
He was one of the Turkey was one of the few nations to turn into this new system with using, they didn't use the Pope's work schedule and they didn't have surnames and they didn't have fiat currency.

152
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,760
They didn't have a constitutions and they didn't have all that stuff and they were given an ultimatum.

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,660
You either turn over to this system or we destroy all of you.

154
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,140
And when they did turn in, they turned in more than anyone else ever could have.

155
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,860
So that seems like he's backstepping now and that's given him some, some real trouble.

156
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,560
He's just, he's being like the alternative media.

157
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:54,760
He has an inferior, you know, they're, they're poised there because they're the gateway from the east to the west, um, without going through that dark continent.

158
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,920
And I mean, dark, literally it is a dark place to go through there, uh, to go through what they call the continent of Africa.

159
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,280
Um, dark spiritually.

160
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,000
Right.

161
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,140
So, uh, yeah, that's another discussion now.

162
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,720
Um, so Turkey is interesting.

163
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,300
They experiment on them.

165
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:23,140
Uh, and like I mentioned down under they're quiet, um, right now, but what's really going on is the time period.

166
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,900
I would suggest, uh, when I say really, if, if this time period is accurate, usually by the midpoint in the three and a half year period.

167
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:44,520
So 2021, the fall, the summer, there'll be no doubt that there, that there's a, uh, a, um, an assembly or an effort to create a middle east union and more of the effort will be done.

168
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:54,080
And of course, 2026, it'll be in with many other things that correspond to that spiritual ones, scientific ones, social ones.

169
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,420
Right now, uh, the, the agenda that's in place, uh, like give you an example.

170
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:11,520
I just looked at a bridge, the big bridge that fell in Italy, you know, people say it's a tragedy, but from those that own Italy, that as a company, they're like, fine, these idiots will never figure out.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
They're letting everything crumble.

172
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,640
There isn't going to be any, uh, and even the new stuff that's being built, it's because, you know, it was a previous promise, you know?

173
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,340
Right.

174
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,620
Uh, so yeah, but nonetheless, okay.

175
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:37,560
To some of the emails, um, I just want to, before I get in front of the computer here, uh, mentioned the last one I got just maybe about 20 minutes ago was a talk about a lawful, what makes a lawful society?

176
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,220
Well, that's easy.

177
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,340
Law, right?

178
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,400
Not policy, not opinion, not politics, right?

179
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,240
If you actually look up the definition of a politician, do you want to look it up?

180
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,860
It's not good.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,060
It's very bad, actually.

182
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,360
If you want to look it up, etymology or definition.

183
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:56,680
Yeah.

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:09,660
If you want to get it and, and just get to the juicy parts, if you want to read it, because some of the definitions are paragraphs long, but essentially it's someone who has a career of lying, deceiving for their own personal gain.

185
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,620
That's the definition of a politician, right?

186
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,060
So yeah, all of them, you know, doesn't matter.

187
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,940
Even you can go back 500 years, they're jokers, you know?

188
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,120
Uh, so they're not the leaders that are spoken of in scripture.

189
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,120
They, they do speak for the leaders on occasion, which is interesting because you'll have, let's say the current Trump, you'll say, I'm going to do this.

190
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,940
And then they, I don't.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,140
And then he says, I'm not going to do it.

192
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,900
Well, he's not, he's speaking for his boss, you know, his boss is telling him, this is what I want you to say and do.

193
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,320
Don't worry.

194
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,980
We'll take care of you.

195
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,140
See?

196
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,960
So yeah, he is the mouthpiece, but he's not an agent.

197
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,340
That's another thing I want to bring up.

198
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,900
They're just jokers, but you, even though they're just agents, I mean, they're not agents.

199
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,900
They, that's the best you're going to get.

200
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,700
You see until you have someone until you know how to discern someone who really is.

201
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,320
Right.

202
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,580
And that's a, it's not going to be found in a constitutional Republic.

203
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,200
I'll tell you that for sure.

204
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,800
Right.

205
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,440
Constitutional Republic is a joke, you know, cause they, their God is justice.

206
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,900
Right.

207
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
So, yeah.

208
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,720
So the lawful society basically, and also the other part of the email is, I'll read it here in a second.

209
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,300
Okay.

210
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,260
I get back in there, but let me know what you're doing on the politician.

211
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,240
You're going to find anything there, or does it look possible?

212
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,420
I'm getting there.

213
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,460
My computer was running a little slow.

214
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,860
So bear with me.

215
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,080
Okay.

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,880
Let's see.

217
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,340
All right.

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,320
Okay.

219
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,880
Let's see.

220
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,260
Okay.

221
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
This one was hi, Greek.

222
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,340
I had an idea for a Sonic.

223
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,960
What is a lawful society based on question mark, perhaps approaching from the bottom up elevates thinking and set it from the top down.

224
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,100
Just a thought.

225
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,480
Well, it's all from the top down, meaning that we have external input, right?

226
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:27,340
Your actual thinking process is happening on a cloud, you know, using the computer analogy and the thinking, you know, it depends on what the gods want to do.

227
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,440
Like, well, first of all, you know, your law comes from your God, your God, or the God that society is based on.

228
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Right.

229
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,900
And in this case, it's the goddess and she's based on destruction of all things living.

230
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,420
That's why seeds are made now not to sprout.

231
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,680
You know, I mean, plants are fertile, you know, male with male in female, female union, children are basically worthless.

232
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,520
You know, their value in terms of the position in life, you know, all the various chemicals, drugs, science that you taught, right?

233
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,880
It's anti life.

234
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:09,360
So, well, the thinking you see, when I hear I see a question like that, that lends me to think of good things being better, or whatever.

235
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:21,440
And it's not necessarily true, because top thinking, it's all top thinking from top thing from the top down, or the bottom up, it's because it's external.

236
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
So let's say it's time for the gods to put evil on a society.

237
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,460
Right?

238
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,340
Right.

239
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,640
What they'll do is they'll get the people or the leadership or whoever to guide them into doing evil.

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,720
That's still from the top.

241
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,780
You know, not this email doesn't say good or evil, but I'm presuming.

242
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,220
So, for example, the situation that the world is in right now goes all the way back to Genesis, right?

243
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,300
That's a really long time that you really didn't miss anything.

244
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,780
You know, a little bit, maybe at a certain time period.

245
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,020
And if you missed anything, it was something you would have done different in your life yet, if you had believed it, or had information.

246
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,760
That's the only thing you really missed in your own personal life.

247
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:11,220
And if you do get the information and the opportunity later, then, you know, be seize the day, seize the moment, seize the opportunity.

248
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,300
Carpe diem, like, I don't like to use Latin terms, because that's, you know, the adversary's language, believe it or not, so is English.

249
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:31,560
So most people, and I'm bringing in the good and evil part, they think that when it's due for a society to go down and evil brought upon it, people think that's bad.

250
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,180
Yes, it is.

251
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,080
But it's actually an accomplishment that has to be done from the other side.

252
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,340
So in a sense, their will is being done.

253
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,120
So it's good.

254
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,120
You see what I mean?

255
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,760
It sounds kind of crazy.

256
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:52,040
But essentially, let's say, for example, many times I've spoken of how this society is unrehabilitatable, that means you can't fix it.

257
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:04,960
So then it has to be destroyed, or cleared out, clear the board, whatever, you know, like, when there's a bunch of gibberish on the blackboard, the teacher or somebody comes clean the backboard, you don't save it, you just wipe it off, you know, it's done, right?

258
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,320
Clean the site, right?

259
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
So right now, you're at the clean the site point.

260
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,920
So would the end of the society be a good thing?

261
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,880
Absolutely, without a doubt, definitely, no option, of course.

262
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,380
How else can you say it positively?

263
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,300
Yes, has to be done.

264
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,320
What does that mean?

265
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:34,540
Well, cleaning out the physical presence of the majority of the humans and most of the wildlife and all that, because wildlife is corrupted, and a lot of the natural features, and really cleaning it up.

266
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:42,420
And then the universal representative sample that's left over is then tuned up and then given an upgrade, you see?

267
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,280
Marine.

268
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,480
And that's how it's done.

269
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,740
Now, is that going to be pleasant?

270
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,660
No, it's not.

271
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,240
Well, if you're a corporeal being, no, it's not going to be pleasant, right?

272
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,860
But if you're a non-material being, of course, it's a will that was written about thousands of years ago, it should be done.

273
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,120
So, you know, the other thing is, is an unlawful society really unlawful?

274
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,900
Yes, it is.

275
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,460
But it's also by design.

276
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,840
And then you have the free will within that unlawful society.

277
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:21,180
Many years ago, it was correct to move if it was, you know, if you wanted to be lawful, and you lived amongst the Canaanites or the Philistines, right?

278
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,100
Or the Hittites, you would want to leave.

279
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,480
You wouldn't want to be there with them unless you're into the child sacrifice and all that other crap that they did on a daily basis.

280
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,480
Right?

281
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,800
Yeah.

282
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,360
Yeah.

283
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
So but now it's everywhere.

284
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,380
Now there's nowhere to go.

285
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:49,980
I can't suggest, even now, even if you go back 20 years ago, 30 years ago, I can't say, well, go to Australia, I mean, or New Zealand or some part of the Dark Continent or Asia or an island by yourself.

286
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,840
You're not gonna know it's not gonna, right?

287
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,180
It's not gonna help.

288
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,560
They'll just, you know, now if you get, you'll, if you try to live on a deserted island, you'll get in trouble.

289
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,140
Well, years ago, they said, Well, I was a madman, leave him alone, right?

290
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,700
Right.

291
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,420
So now it's a spiritual thing, meaning of the mind.

292
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,560
And how much can the mind take before you check out?

293
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,280
Right?

294
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,780
Another email was going from memory here, regarding the gods.

295
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,400
And I had mentioned divination to a certain degree regarding casting lots.

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,520
Right.

297
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:41,140
And the person also made a list about, yeah, the person also made a list of like, what about tarot cards, this, this, that, and the other things we, and that's bad, you know, the Bible Scripture says it's bad, don't do it.

298
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,900
Well, here's the interesting part.

299
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,500
And this I have to tie in with many other aspects of things that I've said in the holistic concept of what Greek speak is about.

300
00:20:51,540 --> 00:21:00,060
It's anything that you can think of or do, regardless if you think is morally moral, good or bad, it's who are you doing it for?

301
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,300
And are you doing their will, meaning your spiritual father, you know, your God?

302
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,100
So here's an example.

303
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:18,780
People find a total offense and a gas to go for a morning jog in the local city park and find a headless goat or a chicken head.

304
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,420
Right?

305
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:28,280
And then they find a bunch of candles in a circle and some maybe red scarves and some herbs and oil and a campfire from the night before.

306
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,240
Totally.

307
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,680
All right.

308
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,540
So what am I saying?

309
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,300
They did a animal sacrifice for their deity, right?

310
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,060
Right.

311
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,240
Well, if you read the scripture, you were to bring an animal sacrifice for the head deity, right?

312
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,980
What's the difference?

313
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,880
You're killing an animal for a deity, aren't you?

314
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,820
What's the difference?

315
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,360
It's which deity are you doing it for?

316
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:50,940
Right?

317
00:21:51,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Then you can get into the history and look at, you know, for example, the priests were given the umbremum thermum, which are like basically like dice, right?

318
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,920
A stone, one side, yes, one side, no, let's say, and then they were, they had the vestments, right?

319
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,700
Right.

320
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,220
Very thick linen with stones on it.

321
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,960
Things like that.

322
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:20,100
Now, things like, for example, that were mentioned in the email regarding like tarot, that the history of tarot is something that came out a few hundred years ago.

323
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:30,840
And that was basically like the wealthy people needed a new card game to bring in a lot of the cultural influence that they got from the East, like Turkey or whatever, right?

324
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,240
You know how you hear when I say, oh, man, I'm going to the bridge club.

325
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Are you thinking about a bunch of bus drivers and people on section eight?

326
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,260
Or are you thinking about wealthy people, the bridge club, right?

327
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,080
Yeah, right.

328
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay.

329
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:53,600
So the bridge club of those days were the tarot readers, because that seemed a lot neater than the palm reader, gypsy, right?

330
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,540
And that goes back to the days of table turning and all that other kind of stuff and more mystics kind of behavior, right?

331
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah.

332
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,020
And also they all have specific gods.

333
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,480
I mean, you can get this long list, like the Ouija board is for one particular deity.

334
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,740
And actually, that deity, his name is on the Led Zeppelin album cover.

335
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,680
They use it a lot.

336
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,620
If you're familiar with the Led Zeppelin album covers, you'll see as part of their logo, that deity, I'm not going to say it.

337
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,380
That's the deity from the Ouija board.

338
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,480
And they all, I mean, all they all have their ways.

339
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,500
Now, the most high was like, for example, if you're in the book of Kings and Chronicles, whatever, people were told not to do that.

340
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,080
And they were told not to do it in the law is because they didn't have to.

341
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,120
He was, let's say, use the term, the Elohim or the God of openness.

342
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,140
He sent prophets.

343
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,000
If he wanted you to know something, he sent you a prophet.

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,600
He sent you someone who, a message and he, and it was signed and, you know, you knew who, you know, right.

345
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,620
It was none of this stuff going on.

346
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:58,840
Right.

347
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,540
So right now we've got so much information about what his will is and his law and what he's going to do.

348
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,460
Do we really need to do like big evocations and, you know, all that stuff?

349
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,760
No, not necessarily at all.

350
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:23,620
Because if you've got half a brain and you have at least the Old Testament and a good interlinear and good discussion about it, you get a really good sense of what's going on and how to act accordingly.

351
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,360
Now, the New Testament is a whole other mess.

352
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:52,880
I don't bring any of that up often unless I choose to my own volition, because there's no access to the original text or anything that resembles it unless you're going to start digging so deep and working on it so hard that you're going to go back to the Syriac, Aramaic, Peshetto, which is Eastern Western, which means simple, and have a firm understanding of the law.

353
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,520
Recently, I had someone who was a Christian say, you know, do you want to come to a Bible study and talk to people about that?

354
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,100
And I told him that would be like an alcoholic telling me he's drunk and he wants to borrow my car.

355
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,520
But that doesn't mean the answer is no.

356
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,580
Right.

357
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,280
But it's that bad.

358
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,780
There's no, you can't.

359
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,520
No, forget it.

360
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,720
No, that's not going to happen.

361
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:26,700
You are so far, so many layers removed from anything real that you might as well just stay in your fairytale complex for another decade or so, and you'll be fine.

362
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:40,160
It's not, you know, that's the kind of thing if someone professes that kind of religion, it's like you either have to run with your hair on fire and renounce it, or before you even get anything going in a positive direction.

363
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,660
Otherwise, that's secular.

364
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,760
Secular just means dumbed down, stupid stuff.

365
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,820
You know, stay there, you know.

366
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,520
There's no way I could talk to them if they're Christian.

367
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:56,860
Getting back to what you're just saying, though, about all these different rituals and things, you know, this goes back to the communication aspect.

368
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,820
You're using a technology, prayer.

369
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,540
Right.

370
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,920
Yeah.

371
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,360
But they recognize it as direct, yeah.

372
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:13,180
And they have no clue in what the power in all the manifestation crap that goes along with that.

373
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,100
My god.

374
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:26,540
No, there is a lot of power in all of it, historically and through urban legend or whatever, because once you establish that the gods exist, then of course there's power in it.

375
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,940
That's what I mean by that.

376
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:39,600
But on the other hand, gods have been so hands-off that enough time of their hands-offishness has passed that there are some species called atheists, right?

377
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,380
Right.

378
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,100
And that they're just a product of the show-me, you know, I'm from Missouri kind of thing.

379
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,060
That's all the atheists is.

380
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,760
They have no knowledge base.

381
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,320
They work on the show-me thing.

382
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,320
And then when you try to show them things that are memorialized, they can't see it because they're looking for it right now.

383
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,860
So that's how long the gods have been hands-off overtly.

384
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,100
Right.

385
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,540
I mean, you know, overt.

386
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:11,880
That's why the wisdom thing is very different than the knowledge thing, but it ties in together because you need wisdom to know what to do with what knowledge.

387
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:12,760
Right.

388
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,380
All right.

389
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,500
So yeah.

390
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:27,540
So the idea of divination and all that, again, one of the earliest things that I'd say in public was the animal sacrifice, all these things, blood and gore and temple procedures and all that.

391
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,020
Yeah, it's all lawful depending on which god you're doing it for.

392
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,100
Now, if you're stupid enough to want to do it for a lesser god, well, that's your prerogative.

393
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,640
You know, and also on the...

394
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,180
Well, yeah, you're kind of lucky.

395
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,520
Yeah.

396
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:58,140
But the thing is, if you understand the highest god, he's eliminated the venue for that, so there's no need for that because there's no venue for it, unless you have a personal message from him.

397
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:07,200
And to do that, and most likely these days, meaning past couple thousand years, if you were to get a personal message from the most high, you probably won't survive it.

398
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,340
So it wouldn't matter anyway.

399
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,440
You get it?

400
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:10,820
Right.

401
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Not in this society.

402
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,220
No, no.

403
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:28,340
So the lives are too short to understand these things, but it's very simple, meaning the lives are too short, meaning 70, 80, 100 years, because, you know, doing the same thing over and over again long enough, you see a pattern.

404
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:37,880
And I don't think 70 or 80 or 100 years is a long enough time to develop the pattern as a fact or say things are this way with knowledge based behind it.

405
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,120
And also people are encouraged that knowledge is unpopular and being stupid is popular.

406
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,700
So that right away, that tradition is, you know...

407
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,840
Now, no one will say that stupid is popular, but everything they do sure shows it.

408
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,440
So that's what I'm looking at, not what they say, what they do.

409
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,320
Right.

410
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,940
Yeah.

411
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,320
So those are basically the two messages.

412
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,860
I'm still...

413
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,760
I'm just going verbatim.

414
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm not verbatim, but from memory.

415
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:23,380
And then I got a couple of other messages regarding water and whatever aspects of early on Bereshith or Genesis, you know, talking about the name, use the name of the adversary and man and sons of gods and all that.

416
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:30,360
And that's a very big open subject because, you know, do you want to discuss the details of that alone?

417
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,340
Do you want to discuss the historicity of Genesis and the rest of it?

418
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,420
You know, you can't just look at Genesis by itself.

419
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,140
Genesis has three parts, by the way, actually five parts, but...

420
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:49,000
And then you go back to the other texts that support it and get the mindset together.

421
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,420
If you get an idea, you know, the two major parts in Genesis are very simple.

422
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,480
It's before flood, after flood.

423
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,900
That's like a central division.

424
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,520
Now, regarding that, there's a beginning that we are to know about, you know, which is the remodeling.

425
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:18,460
Basically, the centering of Genesis is the flood, essentially, because before that you have the various aspects of man, man society, and after that you get into the patriarchs, right?

426
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,440
Right.

427
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:37,780
So, and then there's parts, the patriarchs have divisions and so do the historicity of Genesis has divisions as well, but in essence you have the two parts before the flood and the three parts after the flood, which is the flood and the two sections of patriarchs, right?

428
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:44,360
Because you have the establishment of promises to Abraham and the promises to Israel, you know, and as that develops, right?

429
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,460
So those are the three parts.

430
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:56,700
And the first two parts, obviously, are the two men, the two types of men, the two various times of creation of the two types of men, and all the other infiltrations, right?

431
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,080
So...

432
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,260
Does this lead into the possibility about the fourth species?

433
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,510
The rest are hybrids.

434
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,030
Well, the other species, what do you mean by the fourth species?

435
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:20,670
You made mention, I believe, a sonic event or goal about a possible fourth human.

436
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,010
That's right, right.

437
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,030
And that would be a hybrid type, yeah.

438
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,370
Okay, that's...

439
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,830
I just wanted to clear that up, yeah.

440
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:47,950
Because, you know, when you look at types of people, like when he talks about the nations, look at, for example, South America, you know, where the indigenous people really no longer exist as a majority, or I don't even like to use the word majority minority, because it actually means things very different than what people think.

441
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,390
But by number, you know, like there was no Puerto Rico.

442
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,330
What do you do with a Puerto Rican at the resurrection?

443
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,030
Where do you send them?

444
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,650
Right.

445
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,610
I mean, there was, you know what I mean, the Puerto Rican Indians, you know, that got...

446
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:02,710
Right.

447
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,330
Or Brazilians, you know, I mean, or, you know, the mixture of the various people.

448
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,690
What do you do with the Mexican?

449
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:20,950
You know, that's one third Mestizo, Indian, Aztec, or, you know, and one third, you know, Ashkenaz, and one third from Spain.

450
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,230
What do you do with the mixed groups?

451
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,930
You know, because there is an aspect of returning people back.

452
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,490
So maybe these are new establishments, we don't know.

453
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,750
We're not given the small little things.

454
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,050
It's very easy.

455
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,270
What do you do with an Israelite?

456
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,690
What do you do with a Philistine?

457
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,690
What do you do with a Greek?

458
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,930
I mean, you go back to, you know, where time immemorial.

459
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,470
So there's many, in other words, the fine point about the other species of man gets down to that.

460
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,330
When and how, you know, did they come into history?

461
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,330
And why that little aspect is the optional appearance in historicity is not addressed.

462
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,050
Okay.

463
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,570
Right.

464
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,210
Yeah.

465
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:13,370
And but also, you could look at that as a mirror image back to when, in very early man, how they developed into various mixes like Brazilians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and so on.

466
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:26,050
And I think Australians and New Zealanders are now a new species on the map because, you know, the Aussies say g'day, and the Kiwis say mate, oh bro.

467
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,150
And so they're another species now, right?

468
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,770
That's another thing, how different styles infiltrate into a whole society.

469
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,030
And I've been noticing that quite a lot lately.

470
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,210
You know, there are some that walk around.

471
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,910
Go ahead.

472
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,170
No, go ahead.

473
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,190
What do you mean by that?

474
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:59,310
Well, there are just some that walk around like, the walk, the different styles, I guess.

475
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,730
Some are more harsh.

476
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,909
Even the music, which always astounds me, you know, who could be the loudest?

477
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,889
Oh, that's just a...

478
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,510
Very intrusive stuff, you know.

479
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,850
Whose dick is bigger.

480
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,150
Correct.

481
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,310
Whose tits are bigger.

482
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,650
But, you know, the overall fashion sense is the poor.

483
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,250
Like, the pants hanging down and the hat to the side.

484
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,489
That's the poverty mentality.

485
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,850
No one is aspiring.

486
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:35,489
And well, the thing is, I mean, the upper classes, which are still slaves, they're now aspiring to that poverty class fashion.

487
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:44,429
You know, I recently saw a photo of a black billionaire, and he's wearing like one of those wrappers as a clothing company.

488
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,610
Looks oversized t-shirt with a big stupid logo on it.

489
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,550
I mean, it's really stupid.

490
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,050
So, you know, so even the wealthy are aspiring to the poor fashion.

491
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:01,450
It's just amazing how that's infiltrated into the whole gamut of things.

492
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,090
Well, that requires meditation, you know, a history of it, you know.

493
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,450
And you're really breaking up there, Bruce.

494
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,970
So those are just...

495
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,470
Yeah, it sounds like you're underwater.

496
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,090
I don't know.

497
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,550
I just went, I just got rid of the wireless.

498
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,950
So I'm wired in, plugged into the internet.

499
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,070
So I should be fine.

500
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,830
I don't know if it was on my end.

501
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:30,950
So if there isn't anything else, I don't, is there anything in the new Greek speak chat?

502
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,610
Let's turn that on and see.

503
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,370
It was on there before now.

504
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,880
And I just got an email.

505
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's see what it's about.

506
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,600
Okay, well, the emails get into it all.

507
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,180
Well, yeah.

508
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:57,120
Actually, if you've been, quote unquote, following or listening to Greek speak for a while, you have plenty to chew on.

509
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:07,680
Always studying and learning about how piss poor the internet is and information, especially when you go back more than 50 years.

510
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,280
And I'm still wondering what's going to happen with what's quote unquote, the New Testament.

511
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,000
I still don't see any movement.

512
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,420
There's a bunch of stuff regarding Aramaic primacy, back and forth.

513
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
There is a lot that's been done, but not enough.

514
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,960
So we're going to have to look and see because that's one of the promises, right?

515
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,540
Whether you know the New Testament or not.

516
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
Well, you cannot know, let me just say it this way.

517
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,600
There is no New Testament, right?

518
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
It's all one continuous document.

519
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:58,620
So, and again, everyone in any character or event in the biblical text has been subject to identity theft and misrepresentation.

520
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,140
So, and I don't mean Gnosticism, which is bunk, or all this new age philosophy or astro theology, which is garbage.

521
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
I'm not talking about that.

522
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,900
I'm talking about just the story has not been told yet.

523
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Whether it's what you call Old or New Testament, it just has not been told, just corruption and distraction of it.

524
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:49,500
So, you know, what's interesting is when you, if you in the past had spoken to anyone, if you discovered that the New Testament had nothing to do with Greek until later, right, much later, when you start researching it and you start telling people what's really in the New Testament, most people that are familiar with the contemporary lie will say that can't be because it sounds too Jewish, right?

525
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,880
So, and they don't even know that Jewish is not Jewish.

526
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,620
So it's not biblical, let's say.

527
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,240
So there's still a long way to go, but I think a lot of stuff can be put together very, very quickly.

528
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,400
And one day, maybe when more things are out, there could be some more viable discussion.

529
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:29,320
But again, the discussion cannot proceed or even start if the mentality or the imagery in the story is wrong.

530
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:45,960
You know, if you bring up Adam and Eve or the Satan or what they call God or the gods or anything in the Bible, Abraham, Moses, Noah, all the way down, the people's concept of it is incorrect.

531
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,040
It's not scriptural.

532
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,360
And it's not that you have to make something up.

533
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,220
It's just that it has, the original stuff has not been examined as it should be.

534
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:03,000
So, all right, with that said, I think I'm going to just kick off a little bit early, less than an hour, if so.

535
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,600
I made some adjustments.

536
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,460
Okay, you're really low.

537
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,100
Yes.

538
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,080
Anything else you got?

539
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Okay.

540
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,120
Okay.

541
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,340
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

542
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:14,720
Yeah.

543
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,140
All right.

544
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,820
Well, we'll do it again next week then.

545
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,320
Okay.

546
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
You take care, Greg.

547
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,880
Okay.

548
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,100
Thanks, Bruce.

549
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:22,660
See ya.

550
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,340
Okay.

551
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:23,880
Bye, everyone.
