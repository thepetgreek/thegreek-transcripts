1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,770
And good evening folks, we're live with the Greek and how are you doing tonight, sir?

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,270
Greetings.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,850
Okay.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,550
Well, yeah, we're doing another sonic what they call Totten's day or death day or Tuesday.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:24,610
Yeah Yeah Sure, so our all of Satan's sons and daughters on this planet doing for you know, that's the question sometimes, isn't it?

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,750
That's too stark of a question.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,530
You know what?

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,650
I mean sons and daughters.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,390
It's who's William

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,110
Actually doing

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,170
You know, so and some people actually come back when I explain this to them like well, it ain't so bad

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,990
Is it and I said no, it's not I guess

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,370
so

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,970
That's that's the mindset

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,270
It's really a harsh reality, but is it so harsh if you it's if that's all you know, so yeah

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,670
Yeah, but the pricks I

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,690
Like to call them pricks or scumbags or morons the average human and it sounds misanthropic, but it's actually quite accurate

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,030
It's very objective

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,470
They're going to be you know going to the next level which we don't after they're taken out

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,030
Which is why I think you said there was a question in the chat about post-resurrection

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,910
Yeah, and I don't know if there was any other there's I posted earlier just a few minutes ago or a half hour hour ago

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,110
Someone put about veganism.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,790
Do you want to start with the veganism one?

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:50,490
And then we'll get into post-resurrection Touch base on a few things Okay, give a little bit of a formal introduction if people understand that's a of the Hindi or Hindu culture If you're familiar with the old Prakrit Pali Mahabharata Rick Vidas the there was an emergence of a culture that anything that anyone that kills anything is a murderer and even if you You know do it for food.

25
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,670
You're still a murderer and if you buy Food that has been an animal and killed you're partaking in murder.

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,890
They're a very extreme group not well liked at all

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,630
in ancient times

28
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,230
But this was also contrary to the people

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,810
Which are discussing veganism now, which which is basically no animal products whatsoever

30
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,610
And the question was something about you know is it is it good or bad as it's definitely not good

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,010
But that doesn't mean that the concept is not

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,730
But let's so but

33
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:30,370
Contrary to the cult of the vegans or the or actually I say the Vedic's I should say which is where it came from

34
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,850
There was an occult it were actually the priesthood.

35
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,570
I have a certain

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,430
Group that had said that any animal product is not to be taken by man for spiritual reasons

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,970
That is a completely different thing that the V the vegans are not familiar with at all

38
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,990
Most of them are not there a couple old guys maybe that do but most of the it's an urban phenomenon

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,550
I think I put down in the

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
chat, it's a vegan usually

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,890
Some underprivileged people find something to latch on to whether it's 5% or

42
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,170
vegan

43
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,370
Communist Party

44
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,930
You know you just go on and on you know there's always a group emergent for those that feel disenfranchised, right?

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,970
Yes, so that's the sodomites the lesbians all that you know there's always

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:27,890
Some something for everyone, so that's really where it how it holds its own right now the true understanding of it is lacking

47
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:35,010
Amongst those that consider themselves vegan, and I'll tell you what it is very simply and I learned this maybe 30 40 years ago

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,110
Speaking to someone who was an old Krishna guy

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,510
And he was explaining to me the purpose of the food not having any animal is to elevate the spirit of the man basically

50
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,630
You eating something that is so unique that only men would eat not anything else

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,810
Like he gave the example like if you were if prepared a proper meal with no animal product

52
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,070
It wasn't that it was just lacking animal product

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,270
It was it was spiced a certain way

54
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,710
to elevate your mind and your spirit and your being and if you're eating that meal let's say on the beach and

55
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,810
You threw your meal on the ground

56
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,470
The seagulls wouldn't come and eat it the crabs wouldn't eat it the dogs wouldn't eat it and only you would eat it you see

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,470
It was very unique

58
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,430
Flavored and spiced and tailored so only a human would eat it.

59
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,690
Let's say you understand

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,370
Yeah, we're right now if you took like what these vegans call whatever and you threw it on the beach

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,550
You know the crabs would eat it the seagulls would come down pick it up and go so this is this is a different level

62
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,270
Of it, which is not no very interesting concept

63
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,690
Right and then there's the other I was like, you know, no onion, you know, they got into more stuff because onion is to base

64
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,990
No, you know, it brings your spirit down.

65
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,370
So they had this thing called hin

66
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,370
H I n which is a substitute for onion flavor, you know

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,430
This is this is all lacking in the in the urban vegan community and I put in the chat

68
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:01,710
Yeah, it's it's it's just a thing that you see a dummy load and in one of the comments I put there under vegan rules

69
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,130
If a baby is suckling on its mother a newborn is suckling on its mother's

70
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,250
Breast for milk is that vegan and the answer is no because right?

71
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,090
So where's the option?

72
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,170
They don't understand what?

73
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,730
They don't know what they're just like anyone, you know ask so a Democrat.

74
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,490
What does that mean?

75
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,070
They don't know if you ask a you know, Russia Soviet, you know back in the day.

76
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,570
What does it mean?

77
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,170
I don't know.

78
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,130
That's a Christian.

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,650
What does it mean?

80
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,170
I don't know.

81
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,170
It's a Right ask a vegan out.

82
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,950
Oh, it's just animal.

83
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,470
It's bad.

84
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:48,290
You don't know you don't know Right now your scripture is very clear That the dead flesh makes you unclean drinking milk It doesn't make you unclean scripturally Because it's not dead right right now, of course, they come back and say well the milk is poison.

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:58,430
The cows are mistreated That's not the point If I have a pet cow outside that I love and adore and treat Well as a cow should be and drink its milk.

86
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,170
Is that vegan?

87
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,590
No Stupid is what right?

88
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:11,750
So there's a whole other level to it, you know, well, then again, I would rather have sheep or goat milk so Right.

89
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:23,830
So either way Because of there's many reasons for it not necessarily Fully, you know Applicable because cows milk doesn't harm but is you know a smaller animal better?

90
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,810
Yes, that's still a clean animal So the whole thing about the veganism, can it be usable abuse?

91
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,090
Yeah.

92
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:38,670
Well anything will be used I mean, we don't know for sure, but I would say I would put it on the list as a dogmatic Behavior that could be manipulated towards people.

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:46,650
I think that what will go beyond vegan is in the future They'll be feeding people to people likes member Charlton Heston Soylent Green.

94
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,950
He's like Soylent Green is people, right?

95
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,950
They're doing that now And if I say they're doing it now, it's a Greek.

96
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,550
Where's the proof?

97
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,590
I say we'll just sit back you if you're a pork eater.

98
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:09,890
You wouldn't matter to you anyway so Because it wouldn't you wouldn't couldn't tell the difference now, you know madness that sets in is different So the vegan movement any any unacknowledged?

99
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:32,330
See the only thing like if you look at veganism what's acknowledged about it is that it's very different and it's very good But when you start to question your typical vegan why they do it The reasons they give you again are very contemporary and politically and socially motivated You know, yeah That's the 99% of them now.

100
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:56,310
There's a small percentage that don't consider the sums vegan that do practice That type of eating because let's say they found that if they didn't if they ate Food that was completely devoid of any animal product their cancer went away the cancer they had were diagnosed with diminished or vanished Right, right So and that's very true.

101
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,630
Like there's a dr.

102
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,170
Gerson a Gersen and if anyone knows about him, they killed him.

103
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,010
They tried to kill him a couple of times.

104
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:15,170
I finally succeeded He basically said you got cancer just eat raw foods and do coffee enemas and cancer goes away and in 90% of the people it did They and he moved to European.

105
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,290
He moved to New York and they killed him in New York, right?

106
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,690
19 this is 1950s.

107
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:45,430
He killed him So and the purpose of the coffee enemas is the the coffee coming in the backside like that stimulates the gallbladder which releases certain hormones and Enzymes that inhibits inhibits tumor growth or an unusual growth in the body You see so right yeah, so that from there and I know from direct experience if you go with a Non animal based diet you you you know, everything improves.

108
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,210
I mean physiologically for sure.

109
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,250
That's without a doubt

110
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,930
Especially if you understand how to tailor your intake with your activity like there's people that say raw food

111
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,530
Well, if you sit at an office desk all day and you eat raw food, you're going to be miserable

112
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,830
Because you look at the animals eat raw food they jump around and play and run and those like a sloth

113
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,710
that doesn't jump around and play and run that it's only one specific type of

114
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,810
Raw food that it is very specifically

115
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,810
Adjusted to eating and aggressively digests it, right?

116
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:29,430
But typically apples that eat raw are very active so someone that's a UPS driver a postman a construction worker a Full-time athlete can eat raw.

117
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,050
They'll be fine.

118
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:42,630
They'll have a little time adjusting But if you're an office worker or sedentary type individual, whatever, you know, you'll be miserable eating just raw All right, so you have to incorporate Right some cooked food.

119
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:58,330
That's why for example in traditions when someone isn't feeling well, they make a soup or a stew You ever notice that why because it's already booked down and broken down so the body can induct it induce it much quicker Right because they're not active when you're not feeling well, you're sedentary.

120
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,550
You see where people that are very active.

121
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,250
They prefer salads and fresh food.

122
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,270
So The the vegan aspect of it.

123
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:21,290
I know there's someone in the chat that I'm fond of And if a correspondence who does profess being vegan and this is not directed what I'm saying the negative aspect of it directly to them Some of it might be but it's not directed towards them.

124
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,790
That's okay.

125
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,890
I think they're part of their

126
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,850
Journey of developing their themselves and their character anyway as we all are hopefully

127
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,810
But I'm that's just the hard truth, you know

128
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,350
I'm just dropping the truth and doing giving you the math behind it

129
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,390
The other thing I put in the chat is typically I've noticed for 30 years

130
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:47,670
People who can't cook and but have a desire to but are too lazy and stubborn to learn how to cook and prepare good tasting

131
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,750
food usually adopt veganism

132
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,370
So when they taunt and try to stuff their crappy food to people and they say this food tastes terrible they say it's because it's vegan

133
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,890
Right, so it's it's fun for years.

134
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,630
I'd go to health food stores and I'm like, why is this cookie taste so bad?

135
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,130
It's vegan.

136
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,410
That's why what's wrong with you.

137
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,950
Don't you know?

138
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,410
Like what do you talk?

139
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:19,590
Whoa vegan the vegan food diet is delicious It's usually why I say why people that want to cook and taunt people they switch to veganism So now they have an excuse why they're so lousy at at performing the culinary skills, right?

140
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:39,630
Yeah, and usually most people I run into that are vegan don't know anything about cook Usually or how to prepare and construct meals or the flavors and all that Usually not all of them But actually all of them that I've met in the past 10 or 20 years other than the old You know the Krishnas from back in the days that I knew some of them they knew how to prepare food So it's not a good thing.

141
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,090
No, it's not veganism

142
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,550
I would avoid it as a whole as a philosophy as an ideology and avoid the vegans themselves

143
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,730
Because you're you're not dealing with rational people usually

144
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,970
Why would you just say, you know, why would you say I'm vegan would just say I don't take on animal product

145
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:03,830
You know, but you get they people are always trying to brand someone like when I'd go out and you know restaurants

146
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,210
I said, well, I don't dig on swine anything about pork and like what are you Jewish?

147
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,670
I'm like, no, I just don't dig on swine.

148
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:31,050
Right, you know, you see they can't they always have to pigeonhole you and You know, whatever So they don't know So if you consider yourself a vegan that means you fell for the pigeonhole get yourself out of it If you got any substance left to you Otherwise, you'll be you'll be dressing up in the vegan substance, which is crap.

149
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,990
So That's my part on that.

150
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,450
I think some of it sounds a little opinionated

151
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,250
but if you look up what I've said and are objectively noticing and looking at everything you will find that

152
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,730
What I said is true, unfortunately or fortunately

153
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,230
Not to discount the benefits of a non animal based diet just to throw in a you know

154
00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:01,150
You can always make fun of people for their stupidity whether they're vegans communists Christians Jews Muslims, whatever, you know, you could go Republicans

155
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,210
Doctors lawyers you could always make fun of anyone.

156
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:22,370
So after you get that out of your system You know if you want to be sarcastic or snide or you know Get that out of your system you realize the best thing to do is nothing just sit back and just go the other way a Little bit, you know if you can if it takes too much energy to avoid these types And obviously you're gonna have to do a slight encounter, right?

157
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,130
so Because you can't avoid the idiot on the on this planet.

158
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,450
That's just the nature of it right now.

159
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,470
It's what comes natural But again, I want to bring up another point.

160
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,230
I was at a vegan restaurant, New York City quite a while back and Lady the waitress says welcome.

161
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,870
There's a new restaurant, you know, we're vegan.

162
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,450
I'm like, yeah.

163
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,790
Yeah.

164
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,350
Yeah So there's no animal product in here at all whatsoever.

165
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,950
I let her go on and on and on I said the more she's saying the more rope she's gonna give me I'm gonna hang this idiot, right?

166
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,450
And she goes I said, well, this is a new building.

167
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,630
She stopped speaking and I'm like, okay, this is new Isn't a new construction.

168
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,050
She goes.

169
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,450
Oh, yeah.

170
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,050
I said is this drywall or like plaster?

171
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:10,570
She was always dry Well, I said, you know that drywall has animal glue in it It's animal byproducts in it All their walls are coated in animal byproducts.

172
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:18,490
You got leather shoes on How are you talking about And the food wasn't that good either and when I complained about I wasn't good.

173
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,770
She's was vegan bunch of white people can't cook Yeah, so it's really not good.

174
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:32,710
It's really it's a bad situation Anything with a label on it, you know, it's kind of like years ago people, you know, I talk about scriptures They you're too religious.

175
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,130
I'm like what makes you do all yeah, maybe but not what you think

176
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,250
You know like the Christian people thought I was Jews and the Jews thought I was messianic and

177
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,630
You know, they can't they don't understand

178
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:52,230
so for those that need the pigeonhole the the simple idiot definition call yourself a communist a Democrat a vegan a

179
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,050
Jew a Christian a Muslim whatever if you need that well, obviously if a shoe fits wear it

180
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,290
But I'm telling you it's not nothing good will come out of it

181
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:06,610
Because all it can be it'll be used as an ideological tool when necessary and

182
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,750
the reason I say nothing good will come out of it from a social point of view is because it'll be used as an

183
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,310
Ideology to go after those that are mistreating animals or how it's this and that you see it's not gonna be you know

184
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,830
It's not going to be fashioned as something

185
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,930
That can benefit, you know any any group, you know

186
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,010
I wouldn't say elevate because you're not going to get elevated here unless you got an elevator, but

187
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,350
the

188
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,670
The no, it's not a good.

189
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:46,050
It's another ism And most people again like Christians don't know anything about their Christianity or what they profess to know vegans Don't know anything about food or what they profess to know really?

190
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,710
There's just it's a political thing

191
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,850
And you know, maybe I'm harping a little bit too much on it

192
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,870
But I assure you that you'll find it to be true if you're awake and aware and looking at things objectively

193
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,730
not-good any ism

194
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:06,590
You know and the thing about the ism and and not only the vegans but most vegetarians if you ask them about

195
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,350
From whether it's cosmic or secular psychosis means dumb to me

196
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,790
They don't know why they're vegetarian.

197
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,210
They just say well, it's Animal look good to eat animal meat, you know, whatever.

198
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,410
That's about as far as they go or they'll pull some

199
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,670
You know tradition or of a religion or something, but they really don't know the lawful aspects to it

200
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,450
and then of course you have the aspect of

201
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,850
The which is a very effective

202
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,830
You could say the underpinning

203
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:42,290
Fact that most cancers can be reversed or eliminated through, you know vegetable based diet

204
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,530
Vegetable and grain that's a fact that's well quite well known for many many years

205
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,670
But then again, you're like well, why do you do it because I don't want cancer.

206
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,030
I mean my cancer go Oh, why are you talking about in such context, right?

207
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,650
Oh That's a cancer-free diet.

208
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,590
That sounds so appetizing, doesn't it?

209
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:17,329
right Not really So there's nothing good really out of it other than what you make of it if you can if you take something Let's say again the concept of being a vegan which is no animal product and you can use it in a joyful Way and in a lawful way.

210
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,930
Yeah, of course, it's good But what I'm discussing is the group as a whole as an ism as an ideology.

211
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:33,970
No, it's pretty foul like any other thing right So and the the farmers that are cruel to the animals don't give a shit about how many vegans there are I don't care about you.

212
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,750
Just like the Democrats don't care about the caught the Republicans.

213
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,170
They'll fight with you

214
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,030
That's not gonna stop them from doing anything

215
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,770
so anyway

216
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,330
that's what I have to say about that and

217
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,510
The part that rubs me the worst about the vegans is they don't know how to cook and they lack finesse and skill

218
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,110
Not all of them, but just about all of them

219
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,730
I mean, I'm sure there's some vegans out there know how to cook, but I haven't seen any

220
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,490
Or tasted anyone's food other than the old old Christian is from back in the day 30 years ago

221
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,910
You know or some Indian place, right?

222
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,370
So It's just another ism Not good now, is it going to be used?

223
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:29,370
Yeah, it can be but I would suggest that it's People are so vile That if you're going to push veganism on them, it's not vile enough I think what will be pushed on people is a deception that their food is good when it's actually other people You know or baby parts or you know what?

224
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,210
I mean, right?

225
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:37,030
That's that's more in line with the human Human what do you call it experience?

226
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,970
right, so And again just to wrap up on the vegans.

227
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:52,150
I have personally given and created more recipes and Suggestions to vegans and they've ever given to me and I'm not a vegan.

228
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,510
So what does that tell you?

229
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:54,990
anyway

230
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,470
in other words vegans come to me for

231
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:04,430
For and have for developing flavor and developing recipes and I've never gone to a vegan for anything

232
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,330
What does that tell you and I'm not even a you know in that business of food

233
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,670
So it's not good

234
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,290
So in other words

235
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,750
They're trying with our whole life and they can't come up with crap and I'm not trying on

236
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,770
Veganism and I come up with more stuff than they do.

237
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,030
What does that tell you?

238
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,770
Yeah It's it just doesn't make any sense.

239
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,510
So

240
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,370
All right, what else have we got

241
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,590
I

242
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,030
Think I might have commented on that I think

243
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,090
Now what people you know, I attribute everything to the gods

244
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,910
I recently got off a conversation regarding that what we can't just contribute all to the gods

245
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,450
But you know at the moment I'm like, yeah, but you have to but either way

246
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,170
One thing that people forget is, you know when you read something in Scripture, you know

247
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,010
Look a demon for example cause stuttering

248
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:12,830
But then you have other people that it wasn't attributed to a demon, but it was it's just that the anatomy was changed

249
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,750
Like for example, let's say, you know, there's a god of the sunflower.

250
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,170
There's a god of the cabbage There's a god of the mountain.

251
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,230
There's a god of the river.

252
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,370
There's a god for stuttering There's a god for every aspect of human behavior The Greeks are quite good at that back us Dionysus, right?

253
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,430
Very those are the various balls or Lords of various human behaviors.

254
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,390
The Hindus always did that

255
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,690
You know when you we did something bad, they said well, it really wasn't you

256
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,210
You're appeasing the God of doing that that day, but you have to do penances

257
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,590
I've said we're gonna charge you with a social debt put you in a prison

258
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,150
That's why you know, the prisoners are an orange, you know, they wear the Hindu garb of orange

259
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,610
anyway

260
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,910
So

261
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,430
There's a spirit behind it

262
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:02,390
But the thing is is there always a spirit behind it not necessarily after the fact because they could actually change and rewire you

263
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,850
Whether it's from the womb or later to be stuttering you see

264
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,270
So it could be mechanical

265
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,910
right

266
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,970
In mechanical meaning nervous muscular

267
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,570
Physiological anatomical, right

268
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,550
Well, either way it has to be addressed from the spiritual side to acknowledge that you know

269
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,930
There is a overall primacy to everything and then move down the line

270
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,790
There's several ways to look at it.

271
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,390
One is there's the conventional way

272
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:37,670
I you know, whatever they discuss, you know in the conventional idiot, you know, the average medical technician or academic

273
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,290
whatever they've researched go on the

274
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,650
Whether it's a mini television or the stupid rectangle computer or whatever see what they talk about it avoid

275
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,590
of course anything pharmaceutical or anything that the medics say regarding any kind of

276
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,390
Treatment that they consider conventional because obviously there's still people stuttering some of the stuff doesn't work, right?

277
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:16,770
All right, so you can look into something that's more evolved And other than that, I really haven't researched it and I can't make any suggestions on mitigating a stuttering you know condition Had a friend of mine that had that problem and hummed.

278
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:52,430
He loved to hum and it seemed to help him Especially if he was If he was listening to an audiobook he would kind of mimic with humming The actual kind of like retraining oneself to rebuild that You know something that we take for granted Like a tone producing a tone, correct and and it went into farther things like that where he had like a Slight tone in the ear and it seemed to help a bit too.

279
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,270
And then finally he overcame a lot of it

280
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,430
there would be

281
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:03,430
Occasional times the thing I found interesting is it would it came and it left it came and it left

282
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,790
That's how he was kind of describing it when I was so so that could be

283
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,790
So it's a it's of the mind or you know

284
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,310
If it's if you don't if you let's say did a cat scan or an x-ray didn't see he had a deformity

285
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:21,990
You know in the actual body and anatomical then it would be a spiritual thing of the mind, correct?

286
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:29,570
I think the person also put it in the chat that they tried speaking with their mouth shut or many other techniques or whatever

287
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,210
Yes, there there is an aspect to

288
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,650
Making efforts and exercises that are known to improve

289
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,770
And at the same time, I don't like to use this word because most people don't know what it means is the concept of prayer

290
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,050
Right because that's my word that's been hijacked by many religious groups, but asking

291
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,970
Especially if you can go high up the ladder

292
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,230
For it to be mitigated.

293
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,490
Now.

294
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,770
One thing I didn't mention is the other side of it

295
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:04,050
Is that that might be your quote-unquote, you know cross beam to bear in this life to learn from it or to show others

296
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,990
You know, right, so I'd say make the best of it, you know

297
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,410
And always practice but but if it's easy, yeah

298
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,430
Sure, but you know the words you're gonna see someone that is stuttering that's trying to figure out how not to stutter is gonna learn

299
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,050
More about it than someone who does it.

300
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,970
Oh correct.

301
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:48,710
So so in that aspect, you know well, I guess we're all learning about it, but I would suggest there's there is a Supernatural divine nature to it and that has to be addressed first at least that'll bring peace to the mind so you don't have worry and Right worry and stress and whatever the doubt In other words, you should be without any doubt that there's a spirit behind it Period that's for sure.

302
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,810
And most people of course would balk at that.

303
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,990
That's what most most people though.

304
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,230
So And then take it from there.

305
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:09,130
So you should not worry about it or stress whatever There's the you know and ask for help and say if it's meant for if it's the will The most high for you to stutter then make you know, make everything else Accommodate for that, right?

306
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:15,370
There's many so many things to do it you one might consider it a handicap, you know I don't know how bad it is.

307
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:29,520
Like some people just can't get a word out Yeah, and other people it comes in like you said the guy who was humming so either way There's a primacy to it But that now that was the one that he brought anything else.

308
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,240
I Don't see anything else since then.

309
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:44,240
No Actually been very quiet Well the first question One of the first question you said what happens after the resurrection the post-resurrection?

310
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,960
Yes post-resurrection.

311
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,700
Well, there's post-resurrection And there's post-resurrection.

312
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,460
Well, which one right this post-resurrection post-resurrection is the first resurrection

313
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,880
Which is when the gods right become overt

314
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,220
You know and then there's the resurrection in a thousand years or nine hundred and some odd, you know

315
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,720
980 something year X 70 something years now

316
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:15,320
There's going to be the second resurrection for everyone and then the earth gets cleaned up and really seriously terraformed

317
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,720
You know, there'll be no oceans.

318
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
No mountains as such, right?

319
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:32,320
There'll be enough landmass to support trillions of people, you know thousands of billions, which is trillions Quite harmoniously versus the satanic Concept or ideology that the earth is overpopulated, you know, what is it?

320
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,220
Less than 5% of the usable landmass is being used at the moment.

321
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,160
Yeah something like that Yeah usable not unusable rate, right correct.

322
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:59,740
So yeah, so these are just another satanic thing You know adversarial to what is true So, uh, so I didn't get to that what happens after the resurrection Well, what does scripture have to say about it is all we have then you could venture off and study any other ancient witness I you know was a way to call it right the ancient witnesses, right?

323
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:23,260
What's written down and try to See if it's bullshit or not because for example you go into Gnosticism That's straight-up bullshit right or a Mormonism or whatever, you know, but they do you know because the subject matter of that is Regarding the gods, you know to some people Gnosticism and Mormonism and whatever other doctrine you see out There is not bullshit.

324
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,980
So how can you say it's bullshit Greek?

325
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,740
Well, then you have to go into hierarchy of order and the highest order again is the scriptures, right?

326
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:54,700
Which by the way is still a secret There is no one place you can go and get the lowdown on who the Christ is or anything About anything like that without being drifted off into some other thing because you know, we've discussed why past But essentially when people call it, you know the day of the Elohim, you know Lord for the Christians or when the Christ returns and all that.

327
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,740
Yeah, they call it, but I'll tell you what it really is

328
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,980
That that the end of days what's known as the end of days or when the rest the first resurrection starts actually the first

329
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,560
In mass resurrection because the first resurrection already took place with Christ the prototype and that one counts the most

330
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,580
But it's not counted as when the resurrection start you see, let me tell you really what's coming

331
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,460
Whether the for many religious point of view or there to what's really coming, okay?

332
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:32,020
I mean the real reality of it not whatever what people want to call it the end of days or whatever the return of the Christ or no, no, no, that's not what it is.

333
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:39,980
The real reality of what's coming is the overt Versus covert the overt presence of the gods on earth.

334
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Let me say that again in case you missed it What is referred to as the end times the beginning of the resurrection the return of the Christ the all these things is none of that Because it's some of that but none of that none of that meaning you can't just pin it on one thing But I'll tell you what it is.

335
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,980
It is the overt presence of the gods on earth Period Because when the you could take one thing at the end of days, what do you mean?

336
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:19,560
Like there isn't going to be any day No, of course, it's the end of the days that were given on the lease that was given to Satan All right, his days are up right right the return of the Christ.

337
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,220
Well Yeah, you could say that also, but does he come alone?

338
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:49,620
No comes with all the other gods Right, and it's overt Right end of days the day of the Elohim or the day of the Lord is the idiot it's a Well, yes, because the time is up of a certain period right but what's interesting From that period on there will be no atheists anymore Right, there'll be no argument.

339
00:29:49,840 --> 00:30:00,940
In other words, there'll be an overt presence of the gods on earth where it never has happened Well, I if you go back to the days of Abraham, it was fairly overt Right, right, you know what?

340
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:09,840
I mean the days of Noah would suggest in all that back to the page It was pretty back to the time of the recreation of the earth.

341
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,960
That was fairly overt to most

342
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,820
But what's interesting about but you see that was still under the auspices of Satan

343
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,240
the lease of the earth and this

344
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,660
reality given over to him

345
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,260
We're now oh, it's and it stopped and you know, of course, you know, if you understand some aspects of Scripture

346
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,820
Supposedly he's brought back to and then humanity rejects him completely because they're aware

347
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,040
right

348
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,400
So that's what the end of day is about the overt presence of the gods and I've said this many times

349
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,360
I've never emphasized it, you know, some people want to say it's the end of days the last day is the return of the Christ

350
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever

351
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,760
It's not really the return of Christ because he doesn't come along

352
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,500
You can't just say that

353
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,280
Right, right

354
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,800
Comes with it with an entourage of millions of spiritual beings

355
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,260
So it's basically the overt presence of the gods on earth and one of the promises that was made

356
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,660
to mankind if not the promise is what happens after you die, which is the resurrection and

357
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,780
Post resurrection at that time after that happened with the gods are over

358
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,640
They have the the resurrection of the patriarchs and the early people

359
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,640
that you read about in Scripture right and the

360
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,440
Apostles right and many others that are not whose names are not written to us but are written in the book of life

361
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,500
Let's say right and they will rule the earth

362
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,080
Which will still be a bunch of 5% of the population is left is not going to be

363
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,340
The surviving people that are on the planet are not because they're worthy of it.

364
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,440
They're just a representative sample

365
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,700
They're just going to be just as evil as you know, the rest are

366
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,260
right, and they're going to be ruled over and

367
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,320
You have a lot of things changing

368
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:02,280
In nature, so life human life on earth will no longer be the same even just the over presence of the gods

369
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:09,160
Cannot you know, you won't need fighter jets or nuclear bombs and electricity and there won't be any grid

370
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,620
Right satellites and all that stuff, right?

371
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:18,540
It's going to be very different Because you want to go to space you don't build a spaceship you go with the God he takes you there you see, right?

372
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,040
Anyway, anyway, you want to light up a house.

373
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,040
You don't need a wire bringing electricity Right you the God you see lights it up for you.

374
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,340
So we very different world But what's interesting?

375
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:54,700
I've stopped looking at it for a little while Which I'd like to resume is the actual technical aspects that we know That a group of people is led out of the Levant Back into the wilderness, you know, like for example, the Exodus scenario is revisited and They're held for a generation 40 years and trained and let's say I'm using paraphrasing here, right?

376
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah, that's when you read in the Psalms.

377
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,320
I will not fear as I pass the valley of the shadow of death is behind me Right.

378
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,120
Mm-hmm.

379
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,740
It's a shut, you know, they're seeing the shadow.

380
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:28,080
So there's the that's the lake of fire, which is the Dead sea, right that will be ignited all right, so they're gonna pass that and they're gonna so we're talking about 40 years of coping with Post-destruction earth society You know, what would be on a quote-unquote used in modern Hollywood terms apocalyptic scenario, correct?

381
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,720
You know the other day I brought up but there will be no roofs He is a house a house, but doesn't have a roof on it.

382
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Or is it just a bunch of walls you see, right?

383
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,480
So

384
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,000
so what you're going to see is

385
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,900
If you survive it is basically a 40-year period of what the hell happened here

386
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,360
that's how drastic and devastating it will be and

387
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,980
then you you you

388
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,700
You can imagine the over presence of the gods filler fulfilling human requirements

389
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,980
right

390
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,800
Because the idea is not to completely wipe out humanity or torture humanity, but to sustain them

391
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,560
Right, so, you know, you won't need water pumps the gods will provide water.

392
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,920
I know it sounds kind of crazy, right?

393
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:26,060
So but I just needed to voice that out and it's right again what the purpose of declaring something as the return of the Christ or the end of days or the day of the Elohim or all this is not that at all.

394
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:43,320
It's the overt presence of The gods on earth is what it really is It's like does the Christ exist in a spiritual form and as the head deity right now, of course, oh, yeah Show me prove it to me Right.

395
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,679
I guess it's a matter of belief now, isn't it?

396
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,580
It is You know, where are all the gods, you know, they can do anything or I prove it to me Well, I guess it's a matter of belief now, right?

397
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,900
You see the difference mm-hmm when it's overt no one's gonna ask prove it to me

398
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,760
in your face

399
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,640
They'll be in your face

400
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,240
That's what happens after the resurrection

401
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:13,300
So after the resurrection if you are one of the first to be resurrected you will be amongst all of this and you will be like

402
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,820
a god

403
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,100
Essentially, I don't know how else to say it

404
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,060
And that's pretty much it in other words if you want a physical body

405
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,660
You shall have one if you want to sit down and eat with people, you know

406
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,140
Look the King James says you want to sup with them, you know

407
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,680
What a ridiculous document by the way King James or people actually

408
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,280
Still think it's the what they call the Bible and it is the Bible, but you know, it's not the scriptures, right?

409
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:50,740
But if you want to sit around let's say you Some people that have not been resurrected and survived this and you want to be around them Well, you might want to take on a physical body and eat some Hebrew national hot dogs with them or something.

410
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,700
I don't know if you're white people You probably eaten some tuna casserole or whatever, right?

411
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:25,600
But anyway and string bean casserole but anyway Yeah, you might want a physical body you may not and it's your will hmm, you see all right and These people that are resurrected, you know, we can go down the line who they are you get anyone can it's for sure the prophets and the patriarchs and the Apostles right and those that were that were Considered in what's called the book of life, right?

412
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,800
Sephirot I am right.

413
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,460
That's in Hebrew would be the scroll of life.

414
00:36:31,000 --> 00:37:00,080
So so so You have a group of people that are now dead that the first waking the next thing other than them remembering they had died the next moment is Consciousness of being resurrected or you know the resurrection So Like Woody Allen says if dying is so bad How come no one has come back to complain about it, right, right?

415
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:26,400
So Adam the next, you know, whatever last memory he had the next memory he has Is the resurrection and there is no memory of death being dead for so long You see so then you now you're God you have godlike powers and if you want to understand Well, you know how to say people are fallible.

416
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:36,940
You still are even at the resurrection One of the scenarios is in the book of Zechariah where the high priest is held and his mouth is shut You know, that's why I keep saying at the resurrection.

417
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:53,000
Just keep your mouth shut It doesn't say in Scripture keep your mouth shut at the resurrection It implies that very strongly and it shows examples of it So but I don't know why people haven't pieced that together and tell the public at large that it behooves Anyone to wonder how stupid?

418
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,940
Any any kind of discourse on Scripture has been For so long.

419
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,760
I think time for that kind of ridiculous Discourse is over.

420
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,820
It's why I sometimes dare say like to speak on these things.

421
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:20,380
Well, just essentially historical looks at history Wow Where do you know the history is written by the winners and what if the winner wants to be written as a loser?

422
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,440
Because there's benefits into being a loser.

423
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:31,800
Yeah, just like yeah, you know Like people do that on what they call so-called tax forms put on you have more dependence You know, I want to look like I'm in bad shape, right?

424
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:45,080
Right Proforma accounting makes you look either good or bad depending on what benefits you book in the book Yeah, so the books are cooked That's why I say lately for a couple years.

425
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:56,980
I say why bother do nothing Do nothing just get out of their way They want to live in paradise tomorrow and create a paradise they can do it That's fine with me if they want to just kill each other for no reason.

426
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,960
That's fine with me either way I want to stay away from them You know in the state that they're in right, right.

427
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:14,140
There's no benefit in anything here So anyway back to the resurrection I think in the past five ten minutes about that I've painted more of a picture than you've seen anywhere ever ever.

428
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:25,500
I hate to be arrogant about it You're spot-on, buddy If you study scripture and look at the intent This is what I just said in the past ten minutes has never been said before in this way.

429
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:39,620
So succinctly And it's sad to say that it's pathetic It just makes me think like why don't I just get off the stream right now and make a delicious dinner You know and throw my feet up on the air and watch some Netflix for four hours.

430
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:57,660
Why bother, you know, even though You know, I mean, I'm just an example actually, I've got plenty of stuff to do but Mm-hmm, my list grows, too Yeah, so so Post resurrection is not going to be all that honky-dory, you know, like they say it's a little white people phrase.

431
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:07,320
Yeah, I would suggest that The best way to go as stated in scriptures to be part of the first resurrection Right.

432
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:26,420
Oh you're speaking about Zachariah in the mouth shut Yeah, yeah The priest was You could read that yeah, I don't like to get into what I like to paraphrase because you know Most people still don't want to study scripture.

433
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,980
They're they're censored.

434
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,140
They can't they look at it

435
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,460
That's whatever, you know, unless it's a laundry list of stuff

436
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,100
They like to listen to what other people have to say about it, which is fine

437
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,580
That's just the condition of man right now because if everyone was able to study scripture and comprehend it

438
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,080
It might be enough to screw up the plan you see I'm not saying that I

439
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,500
Study scripture and comprehend it

440
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,600
you know, haha, so that sarcastically but

441
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,740
Because to say that sounds kind of arrogant to most morons, but if if you have a propensity for studying

442
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,740
By the way, not only other people

443
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,420
Try to say scripture don't comprehend it because they're censored

444
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,220
But from a cultural point of view it is written in a way that they are not

445
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,060
Able to handle like people don't speak like that people don't think like that anymore

446
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,500
Because you're you know, you think in the manner of a slave or a serf

447
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,580
Mm-hmm, you see

448
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,520
see if you look at old depictions of

449
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,500
human society in the Western world 500 years ago the slaves and the serfs or the you know, the

450
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,860
whatever the

451
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,540
plebeians were never

452
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:43,020
Considered highly and even if you read any old literature, they want to slave a serf or a plebeian speaks

453
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,630
It's like blue blue blue blue blue, right and they were never thinking of highly at all

454
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,820
Right because it's like the brains have been garbled up

455
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,220
And this is the norm

456
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,380
now

457
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,610
When you're reading a works of the ancient witnesses to the gods

458
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,450
You're reading

459
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,250
Something that is a highly ordered mind

460
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,500
You know and I've maybe met two people in the past 10 or 15 years that have a highly ordered mind

461
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,980
right

462
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,840
So you're not it's not gonna you know, so forget it.

463
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,700
That's why I said don't why bother studying scripture?

464
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:28,580
You're not gonna understand it and I've never really gotten into why other than well just now You're censored.

465
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:45,440
It's not meant because if if it was too many did it the plan would get screwed up And the other thing is you you were raised in the manner in a culture and tradition of a serf or of an idiot of a plebeian You can't think clearly enough for that.

466
00:42:45,540 --> 00:43:02,860
It's way beyond your pay scale as they say right So and also I think I've mentioned many times in the past when you read scripture, it's what the gods are writing the those Most of scripture if not all of it.

467
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:15,820
I should say I could say all of it is is Dictation given to quote-unquote scribes or prophets and which who had scribes Dictation they were it's all dictation, right?

468
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,080
It wasn't written on their own behest.

469
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,760
It wasn't written.

470
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,100
It wasn't creative writing Right, you know what?

471
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,300
I mean?

472
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,880
So it's what the gods think of you and what the gods are seeing and what matters to them.

473
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:46,140
It's about the gods really I mean, that's what it's obvious To see why there's no airplanes and rockets and power grids and stuff in there You don't have any talk about any human inventions in there other than all things were and they just Memory of them has been forgotten.

474
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,020
You know, there's nothing new under the Sun, you know implying, you know reference to these things, but there's no

475
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,880
Fascination of anything that we're fascinated about in there because it's just basically a very rote dictation from the gods

476
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,180
Especially the most high

477
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,540
it's really the Christ who's doing it, but the one that's

478
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,400
dictated by

479
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,280
The Christ from directly from the father is the last book

480
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,680
Right, which is the first book.

481
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:29,300
Mm-hmm so As you noticed I've lost my as time goes on I lose more of my enthusiasm to explain these things For obvious reasons, but right Yeah, they've been said already.

482
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:44,920
So if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's tough shit, but on the other hand Again just to stick to the topic Post resurrection It will be a tough period for sure for 40 years or so though.

483
00:44:44,940 --> 00:45:07,840
You will have the teachers pet Who is we were called call them the Israelites they are the teachers pet That they're called the chosen people because they're chosen with a laundry list of deeds and acts and things that are going to happen around these people so you have a Reference or a time clock to watch right?

484
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:32,540
Mm-hmm, and they're the teachers pet Doesn't mean when you say teachers pet that should evoke the concept of a classroom also, it doesn't it or it does The teachers pet if the teacher has only one then it's not the teachers pet It's just the only student but if they're not they are the favored ones, but it doesn't mean that the rest of the class is not Addressed either, right?

485
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,140
So

486
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,500
so the

487
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:42,400
Survivors or the chosen of the chosen people will be the ones that go into a let's say

488
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,000
crash course

489
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,100
training of roughly 40 years as they did

490
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,580
You know

491
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,800
before

492
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,200
You know, I was in a conversation recently about speaking just a little bit about the patriarchs

493
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,860
And what one day I'll get into it more, but I just give a little bit because I'm very weary of

494
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,420
Discussing scripture you have to be you have to really want to do it publicly.

495
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:28,200
I'll do it privately but publicly I I don't think there's much reason for it anymore because I think I'm waiting for to see signs that Something called the New Testament or the writings of the witness the ancient witness to the Christ on earth will be provided somehow You know instead of their ridiculous New Testaments that you see out there now, right?

496
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm always looking for you know Is there a project to bring it forward what was really said and start discounting all the ridiculous notions that are around that?

497
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,420
So and that's not happening yet.

498
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:46,160
So I don't see it right now so there's no reason to start talking about scripture in detail, but a Little bit.

499
00:46:46,320 --> 00:47:09,600
I do like to give a little bit of things that I've meditated on and contemplated that are in scripture And one of the things that I brought up recently in conversation regarding the patriarchs since I brought up, you know, the Israelites if you were example got into the mindset of Noah or Abraham and you presented Which happened much later the exodus?

500
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,940
Which was the Israelite slaves?

501
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:22,160
leaving Egypt Okay, if you presented that them let's say in that state to Abraham or Noah.

502
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,200
They would come back and say Those are Israelites.

503
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:30,840
Those are just a bunch of Egyptian slaves You get it, right?

504
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,520
Okay.

505
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,340
Yeah Because let me just put it this way.

506
00:47:35,440 --> 00:48:01,240
Let's say your fourth generation German Swedish Swiss German Swiss, let's say Italian in America, you know, they emigrated here in the 1800s Right now if you presented this third fourth generation American To someone, you know, you know other than that would say this is just an American You're not gonna say oh, this is a German Swiss, whatever.

507
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,100
No, they're not.

508
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,760
Let's say this is an American ugly American, right?

509
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:16,020
Look at him, you know, the Europeans used to say, you know, they're American You could hear him from a block away and they got terrible dressing Sense, they they look terrible.

510
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,360
You know, they wear sneakers.

511
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,440
They don't know how to dress their fat They they're obnoxious loud.

512
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:34,080
You always you always come uninvited in and stay too long Yeah, that's also yeah, they have no sense of hospitality, you know was it all no no Greek you're off because they're German you see They emigrated here yet.

513
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,260
No.

514
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:44,020
Well, okay so if we if you in the mindset of the patriarchs and you saw who came out of Exodus or Egypt is Nothing more than a bunch of Egyptian.

515
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,600
What?

516
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:52,240
Not plebeians Egyptian slaves Talking ghetto Okay.

517
00:48:52,820 --> 00:49:00,580
Mm-hmm When you go to the American ghettos that are mostly black I assure you whether you thought of that or heard of this or not.

518
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:21,960
That is still the same slave mentality from the 19th century Mixed in with the prison drug rape population mentality The fashion the style of speaking food the culture they have not recovered from that slave shit That's I mean, I know some people industry that are older black people.

519
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,080
I bring up the word slavery.

520
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,420
They freak out It's like a very touchy subject, right?

521
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:41,660
Yeah, they can't handle it because they think it pertains to them only, you know But I'm saying if you the modern American black ghetto is is this if you go back pre-civil war There's no difference other than radios and and Nikes Same mentality.

522
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:55,680
Yeah You see they're not it's not that's not a quote-unquote African Negro If you go to the continent of Africa all the various countries, they're very very different Those are people.

523
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,640
Let's say that if we're not and did not have that slave Mentality, right?

524
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,420
You see what I mean?

525
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:17,760
And also they've been given this see fortunately I was exposed at a young age Semi-culturally, I say we're not as prejudiced as others Like for example, the Greek culture is not prejudiced against black people like other cultures are believe it or not, right?

526
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:30,720
But but let me just say it this way if you Let's say they've been given a bad rap like 3040 years ago.

527
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:44,880
I remember going to black neighborhoods that were middle class and upper middle class and like in places like Queens New York City and northern parts of new northern New York and parts of what's called Long Island.

528
00:50:44,880 --> 00:51:08,600
They were middle-class black Predominantly black like black and predominantly like it was all black really Middle class and upper class and they were there for many many years So this the bad rap about quote-unquote the African American Negro ghetto is a very bad rap It's a very negative almost rat when you what do you call it when you rational when you when you?

529
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,040
Marginalize someone.

530
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,720
Mm-hmm.

531
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,460
It is not true.

532
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:38,720
There have always been affluent Negro Why a black American You know of African descent communities in America always Have been those types of communities, but they no one in the popular movement and the popular mindset does not consider it That's why when I said earlier when you look at the modern culture of the black culture That is prevailed in the American mind in the Western mind.

533
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,720
It is not that culture

534
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,960
It is the slave culture the prison culture

535
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,280
the with the sneakers and the music and the those that you see

536
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:57,680
Okay, there are of course there have been prejudices and and marginalization and all that but that's not what I'm addressing here

537
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,960
I want to go back to addressing what the patriarchs how they would have you viewed the Israelites as

538
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,280
Nothing more than a bunch of Egyptian slaves

539
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,680
Yes

540
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,380
The blood that's running through their veins the majority of them also were Israelite

541
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,500
But not all of them because it says a great multitude also left, right?

542
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:22,260
So you had Greeks and Philistines and you know Canaanites and others that left to right right Egypt Would be Keftari.

543
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:40,540
Let's say what they were called They were not called Greeks or Hellenes then but let's just sum it up as it was a mixed group of people but if you had the mindset for example of Noah or Abraham or any of the patriarchs and You viewed, you know hundreds of years later who left Egypt that would be an indiscernible from any typical Egyptian slave.

544
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:50,240
So Go back to post-resurrection the people that would be brought into The wilderness again to be reworked.

545
00:52:50,240 --> 00:53:17,480
These are survivors now not resurrected people To be reworked To be leaders in this new social order on earth with an overt presence of the gods They will be viewed as just nothing but Satan's slaves Satan's children that need to be reworked and retrained you see Because the if you look at the majority of people that call themselves Israelites today, they have no clue of what's going on.

546
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,600
They they're they're

547
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,660
spiritually culturally and traditionally they're in a part of their

548
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,180
down to the bone satanic

549
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:32,120
In virtue, you know, they've been beaten down by different books just like everybody else

550
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,600
It's the culture and tradition cultures traditions

551
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:41,980
Yeah, in other words the people the Israelites now they are only familiar with the current world culture

552
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:47,160
Whether it's a world culture Western Eastern or where particular country and that is downright satanic.

553
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,320
Yeah, you know, this is Satan's I'm you can't escape it.

554
00:53:50,340 --> 00:54:02,400
That's why I've said many times If you're passing through this in a starship the earth and you point and say this is where Satan rules and everyone on there is his children and his sons and daughters.

555
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,240
That's very accurate There might be some exceptions, right?

556
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:26,000
Mm-hmm Meaning the Sun and or meaning that's that's where you get your direction from, you know, not your biological Right, so we're in a very very sad state of affairs But you know most people don't see it because that's all they know again just to go harken back to Jack Fresco's analogies with culture Yeah, does it upset you?

557
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,060
You know, I mean, yeah, of course, they're gonna be upset cuz they don't have enough shrunken heads

558
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,220
So it's the same here now

559
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,380
So, you know, it's gonna be a harsh reality, but I guess I don't know hope that I

560
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:43,500
don't know if I performed an answer or performed a thought on the question about post-resurrection life because

561
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,760
The resurrection is the promise to mankind about what happens after death and

562
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:57,980
What that doesn't happen until there's an overt presence of the gods led by the Christ and the angelic beings

563
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,940
Right, and it's not only to quote-unquote like many people might think which is not incorrect to defeat Satan.

564
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,780
It's not He was ever in a position to win.

565
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:17,780
Anyway, this was a lease that was given to him So when a landlord comes to evict or clean up a place that was let's say the one-year lease is over a tenant Does he defeating the tenant?

566
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,520
No, there's no defeat there.

567
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,580
The lease is over That's why if you look in Scripture very closely Satan knows what his time is what up?

568
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,480
Coming to an end doesn't anyone who is renting an apartment know?

569
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,400
Well, my lease is up in a week or a month.

570
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,360
How many times do you have you heard that right?

571
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,360
All right, I got to find some place to live you hear it's a very it caught they're very cognizant of what's going on

572
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,920
There is no battle between the Most High and Satan is a joking just like there's no battle

573
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,840
I mean actually there might be a battle between a tenant and the landlord, but this is not this is even beyond that

574
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:56,740
It would be the difference between a battle of a landlord and a little tiny ant on the front lawn

575
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,820
There's no battle there

576
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:04,320
You see, yeah, I mean could a landlord lease a building or a place to a little ant

577
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,320
Yeah, sure in a Disney kind of concept may you can't but is there ever gonna be a battle?

578
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:14,540
No, I just squash him There's no battle there So we are we looking at the clues?

579
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:29,460
No, we're not I mean generally as a whole as I don't want myself into the way it's ridiculous to think that even for one's own well-being you want to separate yourself, but You know He knows his time is up His time is up.

580
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:51,580
Well, there's no fight It's just a matter of you were given dominion over a certain amount of time even the Christ respected that When he came here how he was here in secret Right, right the price didn't you know have Fanfare around him all the time.

581
00:56:51,740 --> 00:57:08,480
No, it was unrecognizable The only and so as well, what about the people that came to listen to him at the with the crowds You know at the thousands of people by gal, you know, they wouldn't that wouldn't have happened if he didn't have his followers They recognized his followers You know what?

582
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,460
I mean, right?

583
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,400
You're like who's that?

584
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,860
Well, those are the followers of the Christ.

585
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,860
Okay, that means he's here You see.

586
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,000
Mm-hmm.

587
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:28,940
So and there's no discussion of any of this yet It's sad but true, so I would suggest that When you consider something about the resurrection, it's good to know about it.

588
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,520
The promises will be fulfilled

589
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,500
The ones that are resurrected when the gods make their overt presence will be as gods

590
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,260
you know the words you will have all the power that a god does and

591
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,900
It's going to be pretty crappy place to be on the planet because it'll be like a post

592
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:53,820
War scenario, that'll just there won't be enough people and resources to rebuild it

593
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,280
You're gonna have to rely on the gods to do it

594
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,060
You see

595
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,320
So you're seeing the films where people come out of there was a famous film action

596
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,420
I don't know if it's all famous, but I'd seen it several times.

597
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,480
I still can't remember the name.

598
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:28,280
I have to look it up it was in Europe and people were in a it's a little movies about them being in a bomb shelter overnight and That towards the end of the movie, you know, they come they come out and they're walking through the city Everything's blowing up and they're in like they're in shock, you know, they're physically unharmed, you know, but they're in charge a Complete shock.

599
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,660
Well, that's how it's going to be for you know, quite a few decades after the gods appear

600
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,240
So anyway, there's a roundabout

601
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,660
Just drop drop in the hat kind of explanation of it

602
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:49,060
But the the most honorable thing that gods can bestow on a human is the first resurrection by the way

603
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:58,360
The highest honor right now everyone will get the honor of being resurrected but the highest honor is the first resurrection

604
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,820
And sometimes if you're if someone in some cases I should say not sometimes but in some cases

605
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,120
If you are chosen to partake in the first generation and you are alive as the gods are returning

606
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,560
They will take you up with them.

607
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:26,840
And as you go up you will be killed like Enoch was Right, and you will be resurrected immediately It'll be and then you know, then you have a resurrected body.

608
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,620
You're in the sky.

609
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:47,700
Well, it's no big deal It's not like you're gonna fall, you know, because you can choose to fly or whatever Yeah, there's also a thing that still the people don't understand that it's people think Enoch and Moses and these guys are alive No, they're not Enoch was taken up, but it doesn't say he was resurrected No, no, it doesn't say he's still alive.

610
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,560
As a matter of fact in later writings.

611
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,960
It says Enoch was and now he isn't Whenever you see that means that he's dead, right?

612
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:14,100
The only reason he was taken up and spared He was very well liked to be spared death by the flood Because he wasn't to be in part of in in the in the boat with Noah, let's say in the ark You see the gods don't have any privacy people are afraid of death And all that the gods are not afraid of that.

613
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:23,780
I mean unless it's to them, but they're not afraid for you You know if they like you and they're like man, we like you a lot, you know, you know Why do you have to hang around for the stupid bull?

614
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,080
Come here.

615
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,780
Come up with us I'll just kill you on the spot.

616
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:31,980
You'll be you'll be spared the stupid bull or the next election or this plague or whatever, you know Right, they have no problem.

617
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,040
That's no big deal.

618
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,220
You of course you have no choice, but to go along with it.

619
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,660
I'm sure that there's a

620
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,660
the possibility of negotiation like Abraham did regarding the survive

621
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:45,720
You know sparing Sodom and Gomorrah that you can negotiate with the gods to a certain extent

622
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:51,360
But if it gets extreme and if it's definitely determined is they have no problem killing you

623
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,020
And he did try

624
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,740
Yeah, yeah, well Abraham did but the yeah, we're going to get over the thing about death

625
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,400
The gods don't see that as any as any.

626
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:11,700
I don't know how you'd say it They don't view it like we do Because they know that you're going to be resurrected.

627
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,600
It's like no big deal.

628
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,040
It's just we like this guy Let's just kill him on the spot.

629
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:31,440
You know, the next thing he's gonna know is yeah the next thing he's just gonna know is gonna be a Resurrected, you know save the poor poor guy, you know Satan's Whatever fun, you know Why should we subject them to the satanic world?

630
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:47,810
Very interesting Yeah, I've got to go out and grab something I'll be out of reach I'll be back in 30 seconds.

631
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:50,970
If you want to maybe take up a few minutes be right back.

632
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:51,470
Okay?

633
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:41,520
Well, I don't know about you folks, but that was a whole interesting Bit of Conversation there And as always if anybody ever wants to call in we have all the information in the chat feel free All right, I'm back, okay Okay So what I miss Nothing much.

634
01:02:41,580 --> 01:03:01,760
Just mentioning that if anybody wanted to call in they could feel free What an interesting and precise Yeah, the interesting thing is This is very very rarefied this information again.

635
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,120
Most people that are interested in this

636
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,720
Cannot and will not or won't for many reasons study scripture to get it out of it

637
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:16,900
the other thing is they're looking to other people historically have written about it and you're going to have that mixed with a lot of poop and

638
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,160
Omission

639
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,220
And yeah, so that's the biggest tool that they have is the omission

640
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,080
in the rewriting of

641
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,360
History or they include or they include too much.

642
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,340
They might use a Christian perspective.

643
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,360
Then I you just ruined the whole thing right there

644
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:40,080
You know, they'll tell you this is the good Christian thing or this is the you know, this is the whatever

645
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:46,240
Or an academic might say well, there's a mythology, you know, or mm-hmm

646
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,220
There's always some flavor with some tag

647
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,660
Yeah, you know, you're gonna get poo and corn pie

648
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:55,540
So it was it's like succotash or something like that

649
01:03:55,540 --> 01:04:00,280
You're gonna get when you see the word Christian or they use the Jesus name

650
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,020
Yeah, or you know, as soon as you see that it's poop.

651
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:20,260
This is that's might sound dogmatic But if you hear a Christian or God or Jesus that is shit sh ITT Now You're going into shit and you better find some edible corn.

652
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,340
These are people that are out for the culture

653
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,020
They'll also find

654
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:34,900
Most of the people in the Western world that do use the Jesus and the Christian way to teach what's in Scripture

655
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,060
condone or actually they praise

656
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,480
constitutional republics and

657
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:47,800
You know leaders so-called political leaders and science hand-in-hand

658
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,180
Yeah, and the current scientific stuff backing up what's in the Bible, which it doesn't by the way

659
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,240
Very little of it other than a little bit of biology does

660
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,000
So you'll always find all that and it's just bizarre and it's been going on for a very long time

661
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,340
Actually only in the late 20th cent mid to late 20th century in the 19th century

662
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:16,160
It was more about leaning towards the what the secret societies adopted as deism that you know

663
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,940
There's a cover

664
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:23,680
Let's say the owners of the sovereign states use that as a cover deism like the American

665
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,420
On the dollar bill and God we trust and the GOD.

666
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,480
That's all deism.

667
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,000
That's a public Cover for in private.

668
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,100
They're all Satanists, you know, meaning not Satanists.

669
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,260
I'm just using that should have retracted that but

670
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,940
Because most people people are Satanists

671
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:47,360
But they are doing the ancient occulted rituals out of Egypt and the Druids the ball where you know, the Canaanite rituals

672
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,180
You know child sacrifice and all that

673
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,180
but

674
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,940
in every case

675
01:05:52,560 --> 01:06:00,660
Yeah, like the American founding fathers were deists they basically say there is a creator architect of the universe, but he's hands-off

676
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,840
It's up to us.

677
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:16,260
That is the cover for them You know, they're pretty vile like when you look at the monarchies and the what they call the American founding fathers and You can look this up on your own Haven't researched it in over a decade.

678
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,280
But if you look at it's pretty overt.

679
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,200
It's not hidden It's in other words mainstream knowledge.

680
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:37,400
If you look at the lives of the what they call the American founding fathers Many people would call them Satanic like they would have pet names called Satan and they would do all these rituals and all that You know, they're pretty sick a bunch of people.

681
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:59,500
Yeah, but you know and and they were not well liked by the way They're only well liked hundreds of years later They were very well disliked because they knew what they were doing to the country So one of your hints you see in a lot of the popular quote-unquote Christian movements is to praise the Constitution And the founding fathers and all that and right away.

682
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:05,560
That's like, you know really bad poop So you want to venture off?

683
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,940
There's lots of movements.

684
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,760
There's lots of websites through history that are supposedly

685
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,200
Telling you what's in the Bible and I just can't stomach it

686
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,900
I have got a lot of those books here that were given to me by others and after a beam from the beginning of my

687
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,760
study I was like this is just

688
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:29,480
Garbage but there has to be something good in it, you know, so you to save you time and

689
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,220
This has been going on

690
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,040
More in the American side in the European, you know, they're mostly Catholic

691
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,200
So, you know forget it, you know, we're Protestant.

692
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,280
There's no knowledge.

693
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:44,460
That's just That's like the bottom of the barrel.

694
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,180
That's where you know, they need to put

695
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:52,660
You know how you go into a Walmart or a Target they have a McDonald's in the lobby, you know

696
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,400
That's that's the same, you know, it's McDonald's

697
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,200
They're just there to socialize and if you try to speak on anything

698
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,080
I just like not to use the word scholarly

699
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,540
But edifying to a Catholic or Protestant or whatever they they don't want to hear this say well that goes against the tradition

700
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,000
You see and the culture

701
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,540
Recently, I was looking up some stuff and I came across some

702
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:24,700
Christian stuff and some people doing research in let's say Aramaic texts and finding different stuff and saying oh, this is very scholarly

703
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,899
But it sounds anti-christian so we can't accept that.

704
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:43,359
You know what you're saying about the ancient scrolls, you know So that people are still stuck in that crap It's very and anything biblical is anti-christian anything in the Koran is and I French awesome Culture and tradition.

705
01:08:43,580 --> 01:09:12,140
Yeah Those are the satanic masses That people will never see as as they should or could because of the censorship Yeah, so in short humans are a very vile bunch offensive and vile and all that.

706
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:26,640
That's why it's very hard for them to reckon Scriptural knowledge with sec, you know, they're stupid secular knowledge because in order to do that You have to be able to objectify the state or status of humanity and they never will they never can they still?

707
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,200
Go around telling each other.

708
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,779
They say this is a good person.

709
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,960
There are good people You know me times you heard that or he's a very good per, you know, no, there are no good people.

710
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,500
Sorry You've got really bad.

711
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:42,540
You've got shit people and you've got really shitty people, right?

712
01:09:43,580 --> 01:10:03,160
So this is a general rule on the planet, you know Yeah Yeah, yeah, you're only good if you're made good You're inherently born into you know, evil You know You know still people complaining about political educational health systems.

713
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:16,560
It's your own parents that messed you up You know get to it so And then you have the biological parents and mess up then you have the spiritual parent right which is the leaseholder the leaseholder.

714
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:29,980
Yes So, you know, how can you expect how can you be optimistic the the most optimistic thing you could do is when is this going to end It's like being in the dentist's chair What's their optimistic about it?

715
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,040
Well when it ends, right?

716
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,140
What's so optimistic about getting your tooth drilled or capped or whatever?

717
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,480
There's nothing good about that.

718
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:41,960
Actually even when they're doing it in the dentist's chair What if the power goes out and they have to stop right there?

719
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:51,420
Yeah You're worse off than you were before they started you bet you little more anesthesia Well, yeah in the dark.

720
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:59,880
Yeah, so well Little nature's oxide Yeah, and if the lights don't come back on in a month, you're screwed.

721
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:12,480
So you're screwed So this is yeah, this is a really bad scenario, but it's a you could rest assured It's been planned and thought out for a very long time By super efficient super of a benevolent beings.

722
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:23,880
You don't see it because you lack the knowledge most people So what it's called tolerance and suffering to suffer something means you do it willingly Well, I don't have a choice.

723
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,040
Well, if you know trace and go jump off a bridge Right.

724
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:35,940
Yeah Yeah, of course you have a choice you suffer it So that's pretty much it Right.

725
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,640
What else you got?

726
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,560
What's else going on?

727
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,440
I have nothing in chat whatsoever.

728
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:55,520
No Collins We've pretty much just And Well, we've been speaking to a few there's a a bunch in the channel listening or I mean in the stream They're hearing things.

729
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,600
I don't know who's listening.

730
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:08,920
We really don't know who's listening yeah, this we've a number just as they're possibly hearing it, which is a series of tones and and sounds Yeah, that's you know what?

731
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,140
I mean?

732
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:16,660
This is you know, I said recently when I'm in public I you know, I know there's a conversation of Greek speak is going to ensue.

733
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:22,180
The first thing I asked the victim Is have you been on this planet for more than 15 minutes?

734
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:31,480
Then you're probably and you should they should have noticed what I'm about to tell you yeah, you know Because you're a victim.

735
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,880
I don't think there are any more

736
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,680
if you're partaking in Greek speak, you're a victim of it at this point because

737
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,220
the

738
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:43,880
The rationale to say how many people really understand what's what I'm saying

739
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,560
What's being said is so small and rare that you you're just actually sometimes I would say dare say this

740
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,180
You're probably better off not hearing it

741
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:59,620
You know, yeah, all right, so let's see

742
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:06,470
All right, that's it let's wrap it up I'm gonna go make some some

743
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:10,310
Some supper and we'll do it again next week.

744
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:11,010
Yeah.

745
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:34,370
Well, thank you very much for for everything Thanks for doing outstanding job that you did done this one Okay, that's well, that's wasn't even trying but thanks actually, but let me I'm gonna log on to the email to see if there's an email Okay in the meantime This is nothing like doing it live, right?

746
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:37,070
Well, yeah, I know it's being put into a can right?

747
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:58,580
It was it uncommon sense radio, I think I'm common sense radio one at gmail.com and Let's see if anything pops up on the emails Usually if you send an email probably get back to you and then a week or so.

748
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,560
Oh Here I got a whole bunch.

749
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,600
Okay live stream.

750
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,820
What's going on?

751
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,600
Credit system.

752
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,020
Okay.

753
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:30,630
I've got three emails from someone sent in the past few minutes, I think What's up with the way people I don't know man tell me in a casserole Who is the Christ?

754
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,190
Mr. Greek is another one.

755
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:36,510
This guy's funny What part of the credit system will play in the Middle East Union?

756
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:37,270
Yeah.

757
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,470
Well, it's credit Think about it.

758
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,610
Yeah, and who is the Christ?

759
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,750
It's a secret.

760
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:49,210
I mean if I've never met him.

761
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:55,830
I was not on the earth when he was here All I can do is do I have access to what everyone else has access to?

762
01:14:56,310 --> 01:15:10,290
Which is what the ancient witness is what they've written But you have to do it with discernment, right if you watch What's that ridiculous Hollywood guy makes movies of passion movies Gibson already, you know Gibson, you know, it's Catholic.

763
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,430
Yeah No, you're misled.

764
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,050
There's a church.

765
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,470
All of the churches are wrong.

766
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:19,750
Not some of them all of them How do I know because if they were right, there wouldn't be a church They wouldn't exist.

767
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:47,510
No, they also make also you're gonna make yourself a subject to Satan big-time You know so Credit system is very interesting because Let me just say before we go years ago when I started doing the research on the credit system I'd say what they call 2005 2006 on the Pope's work schedule.

768
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:56,710
I was quite dynamic and active about how trying to have correspondence with the Treasury the Comptroller of Currency Federal Reserve, right?

769
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:06,070
Right and Literally you it takes about a year because I wanted to do it orally whenever you send an email you get a form letter Back or no response, right?

770
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:14,710
So I wanted to get a live person on the phone and record them which I didn't record because I realized that this was beyond Ridiculous the reality of it, right?

771
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:37,190
so It took it took about a year to get to the Treasury and the Comptroller of Currency Federal Reserve It took about a week a year of being on hold In other words you call the numbers and you ask you ask about these questions and they shuffle you around and then they put you On hold literally for four hours and you have a charger and all that and you hang up and you try again next week Right.

772
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:47,310
Well with the Comptroller of Currency and the US Treasury when I did get through to someone and I knew I got through to Someone not just like when you call a government agency you ask what's your give me your employee number?

773
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,110
They give you like this 14 or 20 digit number, right, right?

774
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:53,050
This person says I don't need an employee number.

775
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:56,590
They were pretty high up also someone high up in the IRS Okay.

776
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,910
Well, I explained to them.

777
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:04,610
This is credit and basically it's a social security number The banks don't lend money the whole spiel, you know when bank transfers are done.

778
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:13,530
They're not transferring They're basically need the signature the Federal Reserve note title toll check for one is illegal, you know, not lawful to use So, what do we do?

779
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,250
And you know what?

780
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:30,160
They all said to me the Treasury the Comptroller of Currency Federal Reserve just denied and lied just like they did They said well then don't use it then Social Security I say well the banks are not really lending money.

781
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,620
There is says well, then don't use it

782
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,060
In other words, you're saying it's okay to be criminal

783
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,560
In other words, it's that's why I use the analogy with Ocelli bags when the hot dog

784
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,660
manufacturers the Frankfurt manufacturers in the US

785
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,900
When they were getting health inspections and they found it was rat feces in all of them

786
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:53,120
Well, they couldn't shut down all of them because there'd be another American Revolution, right?

787
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:53,900
No hot dogs.

788
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:54,440
Are you joking?

789
01:17:54,740 --> 01:18:05,200
So people are fueled on So they said well, let's just change the standard and allow more of rat feces in the hot dogs you see And they jacked up the values.

790
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,540
Yeah, so the entire system whether it's the religious system scientific system.

791
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,100
The money system is so criminal

792
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,140
That asking what to do

793
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:21,000
the only answer is don't use it avoid it because in other words the US Treasury the Comptroller of Currency of

794
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,220
Arizona and the US their offices and other people and Social Security other that I've spoken to

795
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,560
Admit by not saying it, but they admit then yes, we know what you're saying

796
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,900
But so then don't use it in other words

797
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,960
Then it's not okay to use it.

798
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,780
If someone tells you then don't use it, right?

799
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:55,880
But this is the norm If you understand scripture, it goes back to why this destruction see I don't call it a lot of people call it about the destruction of the it's not the destruction I don't never really say it's destruction of society.

800
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:05,880
It's what the mop-up crew It's the cleaning up of it So when you do when you call the Treasury in the Comptroller of Currency of Arizona and you explain to them what you found out They don't deny it.

801
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,940
They just say well, yeah, basically it is a criminal society

802
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,700
You're living in if you know about it

803
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:15,420
You have two options one is be a criminal like them or don't don't use it

804
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:22,030
Right and just say this is an observation

805
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:27,290
I want to take notes on like happenings not like a diary, but historically give an example when I was on

806
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:34,310
AFR and we were asking for donations raised on the average about 400 a week

807
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,470
right for AFR

808
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,750
But after that I said well if their donations you have to send it in the mail

809
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,070
There's like nothing coming in.

810
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,410
I know you sent Bruce and a couple other people sure, right?

811
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:55,030
Why Because it everyone even listeners to this are used to oh, I have a card I could do it electronically digitally I like what the group is saying.

812
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:57,410
I like you know, I don't care about the system.

813
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:09,910
I'm just going to use it right Danny Afr was like man, we've got like it was like third week over a thousand bucks from you, you know coming in You know, I'm just saying, you know, whatever, you know, it kept going up and up as are you getting it?

814
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:12,970
He's well, just you know, there's using the electronically, right?

815
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:18,770
So how many people actually listening to Greek speak that are you know, it's like they don't care no one cares

816
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,010
Yeah, I know for sure

817
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,830
Not for sure because it hasn't happened

818
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:27,070
But if I had a PayPal and all that stuff saying asking for donations, I'd be doing that

819
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:34,390
you know for cigarettes and coffee and all that but because because the people have to actually if they want to donate a

820
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:37,790
Contribute they actually have to get go to the post office

821
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:41,210
Sometimes it doesn't happen right because just show you how entrenched

822
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:47,130
Society as a whole is even the quote-unquote people have professed Greek speak, you know, it's it's what why bother

823
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,490
right, by the way, I want to thank

824
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,890
someone out in Oregon who sent a

825
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:57,750
Kilo and a half of some super premium coffee and a 36 page letter

826
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,210
single spaced

827
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:07,970
Well, I don't know if you've ever any writing before but it's 18 pages double printed printed on both sides single space very dense

828
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:10,430
Yeah, so

829
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,350
Anyway

830
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:17,950
I've started reading it and and the coffee is very much appreciated if you're listening.

831
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:30,350
Thank you very much We did I've never had anything from you know lost in the mail or anything But again, how easy would it be to go quote-unquote get a bank account start at PayPal and ask for donations?

832
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,410
So I could at least get coffee and cigarette money, right?

833
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:46,550
Very simple and very simple, but I don't do it because I've been told by the authorities don't use it then right and you tried Unsuccessfully PayPal Well, I know how to be.

834
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:53,450
Yeah, I know how to be successful by just being an idiot or more or one of these other people You know, which is I'm not idiot.

835
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,870
I'm not saying you're an idiot for using the banks I'm just saying I can't go back.

836
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:02,390
In other words people who Work in sausage factories Can't eat sausages.

837
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:07,490
I mean you go to a party where everyone's eating sausages enjoying them You look at you look you're like, oh, that's so gross.

838
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,070
Yeah, that is so gross, dude Like what do you mean?

839
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:38,670
It tastes good You know, yeah This is not a but I'm not trying to guilt-trip anyone for using BAM I mean you do but do because you know, whatever but I'm just saying as an example in The past when asking for AFR donations, everyone was quite happy to do it electronically But when it comes to putting something in the mail, yeah We don't like that We want to do what Satan set up for us.

840
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:42,750
We're not talking about people that profess to like Greek speak now, right?

841
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,670
Right.

842
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,330
So why bother?

843
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,250
Yeah, why bother?

844
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:47,230
Okay.

845
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:53,830
Well, that's pretty much it for now and Very much.

846
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:54,950
Thank you.

847
01:22:55,110 --> 01:23:12,410
Yeah, hopefully given some really good fresh corn Before you do and you got the yep good and you got the rest of the week to sift Corn out of poop because that's all that's out there guarantee like we say down so That's all you're gonna get for sure.

848
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,770
