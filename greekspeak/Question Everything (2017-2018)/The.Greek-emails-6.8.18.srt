1
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,860
Greetings folks, and we got Greek on the

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,220
line here tonight.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,420
How are you doing sir?

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,180
Oh okay, I was thinking we would do

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,940
a short sonic just specifically to answer some

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,320
emails.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,360
I've been getting questions.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,320
Believe it or not, I even have one

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
fellow who sends YouTube video messages.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,860
So yeah, so I guess yeah.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,940
So I might play some of that.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,820
Basically it's a question about lawyers.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,600
The questions that I want to address I

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,760
think will work well with things that I've

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,360
been speaking on for a long time, and

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,519
there's two sides to it.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,380
One is, well, you know, if I'll read

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,380
actually maybe one or two of the emails.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,200
Other ones get really personal, let's say, and

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,000
I'd rather just I'll just bring up the

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,640
subject matter.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,820
But my answer is always I have discussed

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,460
that in the past here and there, but

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,280
maybe I'll do a sonic on it as

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,320
a specific segment on this question again.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,080
Yeah, one thing I've noticed your streaming.

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,060
I put a link on Common Radio for

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,940
the stream.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,440
You said there's about 200 hours roughly so

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,380
available that's playing on the archives that you

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,260
have, Bruce.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,840
So are you still there?

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,740
Are we still on?

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh yep, there I am.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Sorry.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,800
Okay, that's fine.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,680
So with that said, I mean I think

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,580
there's a lot of stuff there and actually

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,860
it's a very small percentage of what can

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,040
be said, what I've discovered.

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,480
But at the same time it's 200 hours,

42
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,700
so the ability for people to go through

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,880
all that and pick out what they need

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,500
specifically and have it be very usable is

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,320
the way I try to always speak.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,920
I try not to leave a point hanging

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,660
unless I say I am, right?

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,080
Right.

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,300
And yeah, if I say I'm gonna leave

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,500
it hanging till later, that's fine.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,240
Most of these questions again were covered before

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,020
and I just figured in my reply I'll

53
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,980
just do a specific segment on a sonic

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,840
because there are things that anyone and everyone

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,340
listening, you know the three or four people,

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,360
can benefit from.

57
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,080
Right.

58
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,200
So yeah, the first one was regarding nightmares.

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,400
Okay.

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,740
And the person that heard what I discussed

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,200
the source, you know, of its external input

62
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,520
and essentially, just to recap here, you're being

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,500
messed with, right, by spiritual beings and they're,

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,240
you know, there's such a mass plethora of

65
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,360
variety of gods and demons and imps and

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,740
angels that I wouldn't be surprised and I'm

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,760
highly inclined to say as a fact that

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,680
there are specific demons or imps or angels

69
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
that their job in a lot in life,

70
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,680
let's say, is to give people dreams, right?

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,560
Right.

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,400
So keep that in mind, you know, just

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,920
like you have a painter who paints and

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,380
a carpenter who works with wood, you have

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,760
angels, spiritual beings that just give dreams.

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,740
So what I want to suggest here is,

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,420
without giving too much information about the recent

78
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,960
one, because I know there are a few

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,920
people that have tackled successfully or reduced the

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,480
dreams, in this case it did not go

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,040
so well and my answer, they gave me

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,760
a pretty good synopsis on what they did

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,260
and my answer was reflecting why it didn't

84
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,000
go so well.

85
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,200
They were a little aggressive against the entities,

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,660
almost in a threatening way, and you don't

87
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,580
want to do that unless you have the

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,320
firepower to back it up and it's kind

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,500
of like one of those movies where you

90
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,720
shoot at a hologram and it doesn't matter,

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,020
right?

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,100
So my suggestion there to terminate the cycle

93
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,320
that was happening, because essentially if you threaten

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,940
or too aggressive with the, let's say, the

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
demonic world, all they're going to do is

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
say, oh, we got a tough one here,

97
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,000
let's get the colonel down here, you know?

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,700
They're going to have your artillery.

99
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,700
So now you've attracted a worse demon.

101
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,080
So what I would suggest, just like recently

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,220
I kind of discussed a professional way to

103
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,740
unhaunt a house, is essentially not address anything

104
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,940
that they're doing, just address that you know

105
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,880
what they're doing versus being, you know, steeped

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,360
in the ignorance that the rest of the

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,380
society is, right?

108
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,960
You do it in a humble way.

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,660
Situation.

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,560
Yep.

111
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
That's all you have to do.

112
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
So we'll see how that works out.

113
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,760
Yeah, so right.

114
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,340
So essentially, you know, like even on with

115
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,200
Seth and, you know, because he mentioned it

116
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,820
at Benefit People that he knows personally that

117
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,340
had nightmares and we discussed it.

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,580
So but one of the things, you know,

119
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,420
is a gesture to even just close the

120
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,540
door, slam the door, tell them to get

121
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,320
out and slam the door.

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah.

123
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,560
Right.

124
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,060
You know, but that's not even necessary.

125
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,380
All you have to do is acknowledge verbally

126
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,740
or in writing or both that you know

127
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,060
who they are in terms of their position

128
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,060
to affect man and you'd prefer not to

129
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,480
have it.

130
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,720
That's all.

131
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,100
You know, just it's the simplest and that's

132
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,220
the that's how hard on a personal note.

133
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,360
I only had one probably all within the

134
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,720
last six months, seven, maybe even.

135
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,980
And it scared the bejeebies out of me.

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
It literally caught my attention.

137
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,820
And I got up and I'll do that.

138
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,640
I got up the next morning and said,

139
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,880
well, that was a pretty good one.

140
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,160
Oh, yeah.

141
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,940
They have real high.

142
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,420
They have some super highly specialized ones that

143
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,100
work with, let's say, the notion of getting

144
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,520
you to the point in your dream that

145
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,700
you don't know it's a dream.

146
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,820
You think it's real life and you could

147
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,100
actually be killed in your dream.

148
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,320
You see.

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,820
So it is pretty dangerous.

150
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah.

151
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,880
If it scares you.

152
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,740
But the ninety nine, nine, nine, nine percent

154
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,140
of the people on the planet don't know

155
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,060
what what's going on.

156
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,400
Right.

157
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,840
You know, so the there's a free for

158
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,520
all on the other side to just they

159
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,620
look at, you know, they look at people

160
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,440
as I call it nickname demon, demon food.

161
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,540
And someone says, what do you mean by

162
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,220
demon food?

163
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,900
Greek?

164
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,400
It's as well.

165
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,260
You know, if you're raising snakes, you also

166
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,660
raise mice or rats because they're snake food.

167
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,220
You know what I mean?

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,420
Right.

169
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,040
Right.

170
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,840
So people are being raised as demon food

171
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,060
for these demons to play with.

172
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,360
And they've gotten to the point where they

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
don't have to go hunt anymore or deal

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,980
with any adverse responses because people don't know

175
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,780
what's going on, though.

176
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,140
You know, that's basically a pagan or atheistic

177
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,600
or science, you know, bad science, BS mindset.

178
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,180
They wake up and they said, I had

179
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,600
a dream and all everyone runs or what

180
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:15,960
was it?

181
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,480
I want to know, you know, they don't

182
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
know that it's a prank on them.

183
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,160
Right.

184
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,660
The majority of the time.

185
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,340
So especially when it comes to children, the

186
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,720
reality with children is there should be you

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
should have worked out everything with that, you

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,900
know, with children before you had them.

189
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,040
It's not about having a good time and

190
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,400
oops, you know, now you're pregnant.

191
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,340
You know, that's that's the way society goes.

192
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,060
No one really discusses what happens to a

193
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,680
woman's genitalia after she has a baby.

194
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,460
Yeah.

195
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:48,960
Right.

196
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,540
You know, no one ever discusses, you know,

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,360
it takes a woman weeks and months sometimes

198
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,940
to recover.

199
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
It's quite disgusting what happens to a woman's

200
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,460
body internally.

201
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,140
You know, some women die from it.

202
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,400
Yeah.

203
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,760
So, yeah.

204
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,660
I think what children know, they're unprepared for

205
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,060
most everything in life because they're, of course,

206
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
being acclimated to it.

207
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,340
And they're going to be hit with a

208
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,000
dream, you know, straight off the get go.

209
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,420
And they're not hip to it or, you

210
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,180
know, that's got to be a horrible thing.

211
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,920
It's up to the parents to create the

212
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,840
environment where that is mitigated or doesn't happen.

213
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,700
That's the point.

214
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,400
Because let's just put the children are pathetic.

215
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,580
If you don't change their diapers, they will

216
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,280
die from having feces on their diaper, you

217
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,179
know, pathetic in a sense that they're completely

218
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,040
helpless and they're pain in the ass until

219
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,880
they learn how to speak and behave themselves

220
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,500
and do basic chores.

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,800
Right.

222
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,440
Right.

223
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
You know, they basically pick up after themselves

224
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,420
and not run in front of a car

225
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,540
and get run over or.

226
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,520
Yeah.

227
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,320
So it's not a joy.

228
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,120
I think the idea that people say they're

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,300
such a joy is an absolute lie because

230
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,960
the majority of the parents that I've seen

231
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,500
raising children are always in some form of

232
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,520
tension or stress.

233
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,260
And then, of course, I've seen the ones.

234
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
And the children are as well.

235
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah.

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Are we breaking up or is it just

237
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
you that's breaking up?

238
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,080
That might have been just me.

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,000
OK.

240
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
I'll keep an eye on.

241
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,380
Yeah.

242
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,640
So.

243
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
So I'm making a rant on children.

244
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,200
It's part of the the existence that we're

245
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,440
in.

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,720
If you haven't had any, get your tubes

247
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,300
tied, get a vasectomy or use a hat

248
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,440
or, you know, I don't recommend making children.

249
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,980
That's if I were to just say maybe

250
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,800
just one thing tonight, don't have any children.

251
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,420
Right.

252
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,820
All right.

253
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,500
You get that.

254
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,620
I'm not saying don't have fun.

255
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,300
You know, friction is good, but children are

256
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,660
not.

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,100
Yeah.

258
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,380
So.

259
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,140
OK.

260
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,420
So from that perspective.

261
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah, it's very plain and simple.

262
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,040
But what I wanted to say earlier, people

263
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,340
raising children, just a thought there before we

264
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,480
broke up is there are I know people

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,940
as well who don't raise their children.

266
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,240
They have nannies and maids and babysitters full

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
time, you know, and the stress goes off

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,600
of them.

269
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
But it still is a stress to them

270
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,180
mentally to know that they because if they

271
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,700
didn't have children, they wouldn't need a nanny.

272
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,340
Right.

273
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,360
Or a full time maid and all this

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,840
other stuff.

275
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,980
So either way.

276
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,120
Now, the again, just to finish off on

277
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,300
the topic with the dreams.

278
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,880
From from looking at it from both sides,

279
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,860
from the spiritual side, looking in and then

280
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,800
from being in and in the material world

281
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,360
and looking out, there is ignorance on humans

282
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,260
part regarding what's going on.

283
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,900
So, again, just to close in conclusion, I

284
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,040
would suggest that just acknowledgment that your dreams

285
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,500
are not your own and they're actually you're

286
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,540
being planted with them should suffice.

287
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,300
OK.

288
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,960
And this is going to tie into the

289
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,520
next one.

290
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,800
I don't know if there's anybody in chat.

291
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,280
Let me I think I go back in

292
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,480
there.

293
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,940
So regarding dreams, because dreams are pretty I

294
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,260
mean, they could mess up your day if

295
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,000
you're susceptible to them and they have a

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
negative impact on your psyche, on your spirit.

297
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,380
So, OK, nothing on that.

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,980
The next thing was a fellow sent me

299
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,560
the video message regarding lawyers.

300
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,560
He says, I've heard he's heard me speak

301
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,700
poorly about them.

302
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,820
Well, if you know, if you don't, he

303
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,180
was raised, you know, in a certain Christian

304
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,180
backing, which it's funny that you would bring

305
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,060
that up because it's actually a negative, but

306
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,600
that, you know, the lawyers review poorly also.

307
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,640
That doesn't mean that he was raised right,

308
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,940
but that that aspect is right.

309
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,100
And the other aspect of it is, you

310
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,380
know, if you don't have an attorney in

311
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,820
many cases, you're you're going to be shafted.

312
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
So he's in kind of like in an

313
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,340
immature way, he said, what do you I

314
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,860
want to know what you think about that.

315
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,020
So, well, that means that question is overall

316
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:13,840
very typical, human, unstudied, meaning that, you know

317
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,720
how we discuss any subject, you have to

318
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,100
go look at where it started, right?

319
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,560
You know, I think I've mentioned back to

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,700
the children, I do some fraternal twins, a

321
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,760
boy and a girl that were brilliant.

322
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
And I was I noticed they're watching TV

323
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,720
all the time, one of these nannies that

324
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
were raising them.

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
And they felt that they had no history

326
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,260
on the television.

327
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,100
They thought the TV was around for thousands

328
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,640
of years, since the time of Noah or

329
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,220
something, right?

330
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,420
Because they had already seen the Walt Disney.

331
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
So I had to explain to them, you

332
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,760
know, about Charles Farnsworth and the 20th century,

333
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,120
you know, the because there was a mechanical

334
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,060
television before the electric one.

335
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, like half the size of like a

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,080
size of a shed, right?

337
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,100
So yeah, or half the size of a

338
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,320
house.

339
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah.

340
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,120
So once they got that, so what do

341
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
we know about lawyers?

342
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,240
Well, first of all, we could just throw

343
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
a couple of points down.

344
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
There are no more lawyers, which are people

345
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,220
learned in the law, there are just attorneys.

346
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,580
The first thing you have to remember when

347
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,200
you see the title lawyer or attorney, now

348
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,540
they interchange them, but they're attorneys is they

349
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,320
only represent corporations or legal fictions or people

350
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,700
who are wards of the incompetent.

351
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,440
Like if you're a ward, which, you know,

352
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,160
which is an interesting thing years ago, people

353
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,540
didn't want to live in the city because

354
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,940
they were divided in wards.

355
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,440
A ward just means an incompetent, right?

356
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,620
The second thing is you will not find

357
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,280
any legislative act anywhere in any state or

358
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,420
any country that created or allowed the Bar

359
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,960
Association to operate the way that it does

360
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,400
today.

361
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,860
You could look up what the Bar Association

362
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,340
is.

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,140
There's a lot of patriotic conspiracies back and

364
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,340
forth.

365
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,380
That's not what I'm discussing.

366
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
It's a private organization.

367
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,540
There is no such thing as a license

368
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,480
to practice law.

369
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,720
They only have a bar membership card and

370
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,680
that supposedly is their license, right?

371
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,800
Which it's not a license, right?

372
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,140
Okay.

373
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,500
The other thing is what the legislature later

374
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,600
did do is they created the courts, right?

375
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,280
You could read it in the constitution and

376
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,800
the constitution actually tells you they have no

377
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,220
power in law or equity, right?

378
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,780
So what do they have power in?

379
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,160
So what they did is they created the

380
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,680
court building and then if you start looking

381
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,520
at the early definitions of who was to

382
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,220
operate in the law, it was someone learned

383
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,900
in the law.

384
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,020
So the Bar Association in America was created

385
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,360
around the 1870s.

386
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
Didn't really start taking effect until turn of

387
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
the century and now it's spread like a

388
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,480
major disease.

389
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,900
Now you have more regarding the legal society

390
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,140
there.

391
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,560
Imagine a dog with more tics than dog,

392
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,520
right?

393
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,580
It's a really bad situation.

394
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,360
The other thing is you have to understand

395
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,340
that it's a mild theocracy, okay?

396
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
Because it's justice, right?

397
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,740
It has nothing to do with law.

398
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
There are no attorneys that know any law

399
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,460
in context or by definition.

400
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,300
That's a fact.

401
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,280
And there might be some that do but

402
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,040
they don't last.

403
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,180
They usually get disbarred and they become car

404
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,240
salesmen, right?

405
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,700
And I'm saying this right in a way

406
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,720
because it's pretty sad.

407
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,320
This is just the same with priests and

408
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,540
doctors and all that, right?

409
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,600
So essentially if you have a situation where

410
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
you're going to need an attorney, it depends

411
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,040
on what it's going to, you know, is

412
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,320
it a hill you want to die on,

413
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,760
right?

414
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,060
Recently I've had discussions about a parking ticket

415
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,500
or a traffic, just pay it, because it's

416
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,420
getting worse and worse and worse, right?

417
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,020
You remember the medical is getting worse, the

418
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,840
religious is getting worse, and this is religious

419
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,560
by the way.

420
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,960
Essentially if you spend an hour a day,

421
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,520
the thing is I've spoken to people studying

422
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,300
what's called law, which an hour a day,

423
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,800
in three months you'll know more than any

424
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,080
attorney on the planet, right?

425
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,580
I'm not talking about case law and all

426
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:00,680
that.

427
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,700
And by the way, you know, this can

428
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,180
be an eight hour conversation about what attorneys

429
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,620
are doing wrong and in five minutes I

430
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,760
can tell you what they're doing right, which

431
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,500
is basically what they're doing correctly is they're

432
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,260
part of a mild theocracy, unacknowledged, unspoken, but

433
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,060
in your face, right?

434
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,040
It's kind of like, you know, people look

435
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,120
at, let's say, the Dodge logo now, the

436
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,880
Ram, and they say that's a Dodge logo.

437
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,640
They don't really stop and think it's a

438
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,540
Ram, an actual effigy or image of an

439
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,580
animal, right?

440
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,100
They don't talk about that, right?

441
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,400
Or whatever.

442
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,320
So what you're dealing with here is a

443
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,500
society that is a mild theocrat, it's theocratic,

444
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,540
but the problem with it is they're sort

445
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,140
of on autopilot where you go in an

446
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,640
airplane or and the airplane's flying was full

447
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,100
of passengers and there's no pilot.

448
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,840
No one, you know, there's no one there

449
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,680
piloting it, right?

450
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,440
So that's what's going on in a sense.

451
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,400
It's a free-for-all.

452
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,319
It goes the same with, basically, it's lawless.

453
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,240
What you have is social control, which is

454
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,800
necessary.

455
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,619
I'm not saying there should be no attorneys

456
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,780
because, you know, if you lived in a

457
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,440
society of headhunters, you need certain control because

458
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,680
if they're running low on shrunken heads, they

459
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,400
might start trying to get it off of

460
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,440
each other versus the ones they conquer, you

461
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,619
know.

462
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,260
So like, for example, in Western society, if

463
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,960
you just announce on the telly or the

464
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,020
news that there is no more emergency services,

465
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,420
if you dial 9-1-1, no one

466
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,900
shows up.

467
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,360
They'll be just random wanton rioting for no

468
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,580
reason.

469
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,060
If you ask people why you're rioting, it's

470
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,660
because they can.

471
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
So this is a savage society.

472
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,940
What do you expect?

473
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,640
People that administer your law to be in

474
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,560
like kind.

475
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,900
So you're not dealing with a civilized group

476
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,920
in the legal society.

477
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,520
You know, the oxymoron is police or law

478
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,980
enforcement.

479
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,380
They don't know how can they enforce something

480
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,400
they know nothing about, you know.

481
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,860
So it's like going to a shoemaker and

482
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,640
saying, I want a strawberry milkshake.

483
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,820
You know, he doesn't know anything.

484
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,560
He's not set up for that.

485
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,680
So yeah, it's basically a sick, crazy society.

486
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,860
And you have, you know, the like, controlling

487
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,260
it or keeping it in check.

488
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,400
But I do enjoy watching sometimes a sci

489
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,980
-fi movie when they show like the Klingons

490
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,620
or the Romulans, and they're really brutal, you

491
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,320
know, to each other.

492
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah.

493
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,480
And I don't like watching brutality.

494
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,980
But this is what's going on now.

495
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,600
And you love it.

496
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,040
I mean, people, no one's complaining.

497
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
It's the way it is.

498
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,460
You know, I'm like, yeah, it is.

499
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,340
But, you know, the other thing, anything in

500
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,060
the legal society, by the way, just to

501
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,160
leave off maybe something you could research on

502
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,780
your own, anyone can is all by presumption.

503
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,100
So simply denying everything, anything they say categorically

504
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,680
or specifically piece by piece or countering it

505
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
is the is how they operate.

506
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Right?

507
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
And the evidence doesn't matter.

508
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,760
It's what it's, you know, the posture that's

509
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,120
taken.

510
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,280
So it's all presumptive.

511
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
Everything is by presumption.

512
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,740
You know, even people that are discussed on

513
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,820
the television show, they call the news, they're

514
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,000
still suspects, right?

515
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,640
They, you know, they read the guy was

516
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,260
wanted for robbery, and they beat him up

517
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,840
through him in jail.

518
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,520
He's a suspect.

519
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,540
Well, why do they have, you know, why?

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,040
Why do they do all that to him

521
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,940
if he's just a suspect?

522
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,960
And if he spends five years in prison,

523
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,800
he's still a suspect.

524
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
It's all presumption.

525
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,180
I've seen attorneys in many cases, they're state

526
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,040
attorneys, they railroad someone in a prison, and

527
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
someone approaches that all this stuff is false

528
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,920
as well.

529
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
Yeah, but he agreed to it.

530
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,560
You see what I mean?

531
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:43,960
Right.

532
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,200
So this is the, the, you know, let's

533
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,420
go from that.

534
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,900
They, they work very much hand in hand

535
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,840
with what's called psychiatrists or psychiatry.

536
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,880
Which is really screwed up.

537
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,440
The psychiatrists are there to adjust you to

538
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,080
a, to a fucked up society, like Jack

539
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
Fresco says, basically, they're there to adjust you

540
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,640
to that.

541
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,660
They don't know anything about anything.

542
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,960
They don't even know what the, the word

543
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
psychiatry means.

544
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,540
It's at a malad, you know, it means

545
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,520
spiritual, you know, spirituality or spiritualist or psychiatrist,

546
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,740
they can't even define anything.

547
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,360
They're just pawns of that system, just like

548
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,040
the police are and the attorneys and all

549
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,320
that.

550
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,420
Right.

551
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
So and they're put there, usually when psychology,

552
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,960
psychiatry is brought up, it's usually a threatening

553
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,520
remark.

554
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,780
Usually, when you threaten someone in this cannibalistic

555
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,400
society, whatever you want to call it, savage,

556
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,980
uncivilized, not just America, but the whole world.

557
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,180
Generally, you know, if you have like a

558
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,840
traffic light, and some asphalt on the ground,

559
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm talking about you, your society, right?

560
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,860
You know what I mean?

561
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,080
Right?

562
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,940
Just one traffic light will make you qualify

563
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,000
for this bullshit, right?

564
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,160
Right.

565
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,820
Basically, people in these societies are threatened with

566
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,560
legal action and psychiatric action, and then medical

567
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,900
action, and then imprisonment.

568
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,580
That's those are the threats put on people

569
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,400
in the society generally, and on a nationalistic

570
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,300
level, it's war, which is again, the same

571
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,620
thing.

572
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,460
And by the way, one of these days,

573
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,760
I might have briefly, I think with Ocelli,

574
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,860
which it's like talking to the straw man

575
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,960
from the Wizard of Oz, but you can't,

576
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,800
most people can't grasp what I want to

577
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,100
say.

578
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,100
I have no one really to discuss it

579
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,780
with, but I have insight on how war

580
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,680
is actually done in modern times.

581
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,060
And no one's speaking on it.

582
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,080
I don't know if I want to be

583
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,680
the first.

584
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,540
But let's just try a little bit.

585
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,780
The presumption.

586
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,580
Before these wars happen, this a lot a

587
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,000
little bit of this broke out, by the

588
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,620
way, when Israel went into Lebanon in 06

589
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,160
or 05.

590
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,280
Okay, what the Americans, let's say the Americans

591
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,500
want to attack Iran.

592
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,460
Now, what they do is they send them

593
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,740
a bill for whatever.

594
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,400
That's why they're doing those court cases with

595
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Saudi Arabia and Iran that, you know, they

596
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,880
have to pay for billions for the violent

597
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,340
victims, put it out.

598
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,700
People say it's absurd.

599
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,180
No, it's not.

600
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,000
What they do, like Israel back in 06

601
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
sent Lebanon a bill for like 5 billion

602
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,700
and Lebanon says, screw you.

603
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,760
Well, they have three days to pay it

604
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,540
or we're going to attack.

605
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,120
And then once you attack, you send them

606
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,940
another bill for the bombs that you dropped.

607
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:15,740
Right.

608
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,940
That's all it is.

609
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,860
That's how war is done.

610
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,480
Yeah, the legal people in the military know

611
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,820
this.

612
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,360
It's not spoken about in any history book,

613
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,540
but this is how it functions.

614
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,300
They're always in communication.

615
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,440
They did that with Iraq and Saddam Hussein,

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
you know, and most of those governments, you

617
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
know, are puppet governments, by the way, you

618
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,800
know, in the Middle East, except for the

619
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,300
Saudis.

620
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,160
Right.

621
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,040
I would say.

622
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,300
So, yeah, it's basically a pretty sick world.

623
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,960
Like I mentioned lately, I've been getting into

624
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,940
watching old Star Treks on TV because I

625
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,920
don't like doing drugs.

626
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,740
And it's good to just zone out other

627
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,640
than sleeping or studying or, you know, whatever

628
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,440
else I like to do.

629
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,100
It brings me pleasure.

630
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,760
And it really is a potent drug when

631
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
you turn on TV between the flicker rate

632
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,180
or whatever.

633
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,280
And it's hard to imagine that the majority

634
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,960
of the people find that to be, you

635
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,820
know, there's, you know, it's normal for them.

636
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,820
They don't think about it.

637
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,180
You see.

638
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,420
So in essence, studies done back in the

639
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,380
day on the flicker rate and all that

640
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,040
and putting people into kind of like a

641
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
state.

642
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,640
And it makes you wonder now with the

643
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,020
new and improved TVs on the newer refresh

644
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,440
rates, how much better, faster.

645
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,820
Yeah, they can do a carrier.

646
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,160
They could do like several frequencies, you know,

647
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,960
easily.

648
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,180
And I sense it.

649
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,180
Yeah, I sense it.

650
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,320
So basically, you know, the majority of the

651
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,040
people are basically what I call demon food.

652
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,380
You know, if you're raising a bunch of

653
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,000
snakes, you have to also raise rats and

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,360
mice.

655
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,160
So when you go through the turmoil, the

656
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,080
spiritual turmoil that's going on in the universe,

657
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,780
you're going to have to raise a lot

658
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,460
of humans to keep those demons busy.

659
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,340
I know it's kind of a harsh statement

660
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,740
to make, but I assure you it's true.

661
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,700
So how do I know it's true?

662
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,420
Well, look around you.

663
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,240
You know, basically, you know, the snake metaphor

664
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,140
would be the spiritual world and the rat

665
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,560
or mouse metaphor would be the human at

666
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,000
this point.

667
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,080
And I'm not just mean on a physical,

668
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm purely on a spiritual because they're feeding

669
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,940
off of your mind and your actions and

670
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,120
you're quite deplorable as a species and have

671
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,660
been and it's just meant to be that

672
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,260
way for now.

673
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,260
So yeah, so the dream thing, just to

674
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,160
make, make, let it be aware that you

675
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,280
know what's going on.

676
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,220
And you don't need the dreams.

677
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,960
No, thank you.

678
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,240
And with the attorneys and the lawyers, sorry,

679
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,460
it's just like anything else.

680
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,600
The question regarding the lawyers is the same

681
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,320
question as well.

682
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,500
Why shouldn't I go to church?

683
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,620
They talk about God.

684
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,060
You see, it's almost a question like that.

685
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,420
Well, you know, if you don't want to

686
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,080
study anything, you don't want to learn anything

687
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,140
and you want to do it, you know,

688
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,540
what's fed in front of you, then you

689
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,200
do that, right?

690
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,540
But of course, the church isn't going to

691
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,720
stick it to you as much as they

692
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,980
used to back in the days, right?

693
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,980
By the way, a lot of state attorneys

694
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,020
do admit that they're like the Spanish Inquisition,

695
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,380
by the way, which was part of the

696
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,100
church system.

697
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,520
By the way, they do admit it privately.

698
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, and I'm not making this up.

699
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
So if I search several people negotiated this,

700
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,900
well, I didn't you know, they're like, well,

701
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,440
this is basically the Inquisition.

702
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,920
They're like, yeah, basically, they're not shy in

703
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,260
private.

704
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah.

705
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,860
So tying all that together.

706
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,720
The next thing I wanted to bring up

707
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,540
was more of a general email, several questions

708
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,720
about being lawful.

709
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,580
And of course, if I've spent any time

710
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,760
discussing anything in the past, or even now,

711
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,900
it's about being lawful.

712
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:53,860
Right.

713
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,460
So let me just bring that up.

714
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,700
This is a fairly long one.

715
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,780
And this I left this for last because

716
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,760
it says I'd appreciate if you could discuss

717
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,560
finance lawful, lawful jobs in the modern world

718
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,960
raising your children properly.

719
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,540
Stuff a man could use to get his

720
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,280
house in order without sacrificing the safety of

721
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,780
his children.

722
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,100
Excuse me.

723
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,800
Practical strategies of finding ways of living lawfully

724
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,980
in a world seems to be against it.

725
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,280
So it was finance work, I guess, job

726
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,000
or you're a J.O.B. not Y

727
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,520
.O.B. So but you know, the Y

728
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
.O.B. is also spelled with a J.

729
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,400
Yob.

730
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,100
Right.

731
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,640
Yeah.

732
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,840
Like like Juan is spelled with a J.

733
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,640
Anyway.

734
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,740
What do you call two Puerto Ricans playing

735
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,340
basketball?

736
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,140
Juan on Juan.

737
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,700
But anyway.

738
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,040
Anyway, let's see.

739
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,380
So, okay.

740
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,820
In terms of lawful finance, anyone could look

741
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,040
up.

742
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,760
Let's just go down the line here, because

743
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,000
this is really simple, but it's as simple

744
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,320
as you as as simple as it can

745
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,480
be.

746
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,220
It's not easy.

747
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,660
Right.

748
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,080
The easiest part of this is going to

749
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,660
be the money part, believe it or not.

750
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,820
Not in an altruistic way that it's going

751
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,880
to make the world better.

752
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,220
Are you really better off?

753
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,680
But at least you'll be as lawful as

754
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,220
you can be, according to the law.

755
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Again, like I mentioned earlier, this is not

756
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,440
a joke when I say attorneys don't know

757
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,000
any law.

758
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,600
It's I'm not joking about that.

759
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,200
It's kind of I want to go back

760
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,140
to this again.

761
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,820
Two things.

762
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,240
Just like doctors don't know anything about the

763
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,840
human body.

764
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
So how can they not know anything about

765
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,100
the human body?

766
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,060
They have neurosurgeons and be able to do

767
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,480
transplants and limbs.

768
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,960
I said, yeah, but the way they've learned

769
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,620
to do those things is really slow with

770
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,900
a lot of trial and error.

771
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,880
You know, if you can go to one

772
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,720
of these special ed schools, you know, where

773
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,780
they have people that are really functionally because

774
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,580
their brains are damaged at birth or whatever

775
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,600
from learning, you can turn those people into

776
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
surgeons given enough time.

777
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,280
They're not that smart.

778
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,220
You see what I mean?

779
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,760
Because their brains are physically, the brain can

780
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,980
be physically impeded, you know, with drugs, with

781
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,580
lobotomies and or born, you know, you know,

782
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,240
like sometimes I joke around with people, you

783
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,020
know, your mom is lying, you know, lied

784
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,400
to you about what when when you were

785
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,060
born, you fell on the floor and you

786
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,660
landed on your head first and the doctor

787
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,160
picked you up real quick as if nothing

788
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,560
happened.

789
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,880
But now I can tell, you know, I

790
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,720
could be talking to you.

791
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,520
But anyway, I tell people, so is it

792
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,280
obvious that you were dropped on your head

793
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,920
when you were born?

794
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,260
But anyway, so you ever hear about with

795
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,900
doctors?

796
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,040
Oh, there you know, we had a long

797
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,120
procedure and there were some complications.

798
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,900
And the complications could have been, you know,

799
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,680
with medication, prior treatment, blah, blah, blah, blah,

800
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,180
you hear all that stupid stuff they say

801
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,700
right in their language or legalese medical term.

802
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,400
Okay, but how about this?

803
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,180
That's the way to cover up their ignorance

804
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,320
when they say they have complications, right?

805
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,060
That's it sounds plausible.

806
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,020
It sounds okay.

807
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:09,980
Right?

808
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,680
Because they don't understand that the body is

809
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,480
under a vacuum.

810
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
You're going to get complications, duh.

811
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:19,820
Right?

812
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,140
If they understood how to work with the

813
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,460
vacuum in the body, the biological vacuum, they

814
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,560
wouldn't be using a word like complications.

815
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,400
It would be specific.

816
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,840
You see?

817
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,800
Yes.

818
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,840
It's like going the doctors are no different

819
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,140
than going to a mechanic and you leave

820
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,340
the car and you tell him you want

821
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,960
this stuff done.

822
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,140
And he's by the way, is this the

823
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,620
steering wheel?

824
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,760
How confident do you feel?

825
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,620
Yeah.

826
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,800
You know, this is what's going on with

827
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,640
the entire medical industry, right?

828
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,780
Now, I've had discussions with people that work

829
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,200
in the medical field in the past, I

830
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,320
bring up the biological vacuum in various modalities.

831
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,460
And they tell me, I don't fully understand

832
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,060
what you're saying.

833
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,320
But I know you're not wrong.

834
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,580
And they weren't placating me, because I had

835
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,900
given the examples, right?

836
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,720
Right.

837
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,500
So they're fairly honest.

838
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,700
I've had other medical people say, well, yeah,

839
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,960
they don't acknowledge that never, not, I don't

840
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,800
acknowledge it, or I don't, or I want

841
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
to learn more about it.

842
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,320
Some do some actually have had some that

843
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,140
do say, people have been practicing medicine for

844
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,840
30 years as surgeons and all this other

845
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,120
stuff.

846
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,860
I want to learn more about it.

847
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,140
And I'm like, but you're there, you'll get

848
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,100
fired, you have to, you'll kick you out.

849
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,140
Yeah.

850
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,240
I've had others fancy toilet paper certificate.

851
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,520
Right.

852
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,080
Jack in the box.

853
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,240
What do they call it the cereal box

854
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
diplomas, I call them.

855
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,580
The only thing they really they work on

856
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,920
cadavers, they have very little opportunity to comprehend

857
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,140
what a what a healthful or healthy body

858
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,040
is like, for example, I remember athletes saying,

859
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,820
should I go to a doctor?

860
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,660
I'm like, no, you better be.

861
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,900
No, you should go to a sports doctor.

862
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,440
Because the regular doctor is used to looking

863
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,220
at sick people, you'll walk in and you'll

864
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,900
look totally fine to him.

865
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,060
He won't be able to diagnose your you

866
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,020
know, your your tendon or, you know, like

867
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,840
a professional cyclist or swimmer or something that

868
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,100
has a knee pain, they that doesn't look

869
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,040
apparently damaged, they can't tell because they're looking

870
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,760
at old sick Americans, right, which is not

871
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,520
much to look at.

872
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,300
You know, barely resemble a human figure anymore.

873
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,520
You know, so yeah, so it's really so

874
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,760
when you see words like, you know, this,

875
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,440
that and the other, like I mentioned, like

876
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,740
complications in medical terms is to cover up

877
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,280
their ignorance and they're blatantly ignorant.

878
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,000
You know, one way to do it is

879
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,360
watch.

880
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,080
There's plenty of stuff on the Internet.

881
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,740
And by the way, people have asked me,

882
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,300
where do I go online or whatever to

883
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,260
find out on the rectangle more about biological

884
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,720
vacuum?

885
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,860
I said, I haven't found it.

886
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,400
The only place that I found it a

887
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,840
little discussed slightly is with Victor Schauberger, but

888
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,400
he uses his own language again, and people

889
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
can't see the crossover.

890
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,720
So this is where I speak because there

891
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,360
is no support in this direction.

892
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,420
And I have, excuse me, I have in

893
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,660
the past gone and not directly solicited, but

894
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,700
I'd say as directly as one could without

895
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,240
making it his life endeavor, indirectly soliciting support

896
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,940
to further on this research, and there is

897
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,700
no interest, right?

898
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,040
Whether it's from the common man or the

899
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,420
upper.

900
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:28,880
Yeah.

901
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,280
So yeah, that's why very often when, you

902
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,520
know, I get into the rent, like Sam

903
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,280
would say, and I, you know, everyone's an

904
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,040
idiot or a moron.

905
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,400
It's don't don't do anything.

906
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:39,940
Why bother?

907
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,860
That's that's because I'm slightly further ahead than

908
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,660
most people that are listening to this down

909
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,360
this road, right?

910
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,960
And that's not because I'm jilted.

911
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
And not because I'm pessimistic.

912
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,760
I'm actually very optimistic, just like you've heard.

913
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,380
The optimist said, this is the best the

914
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,200
world can be.

915
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,560
And the pessimist says, Yes, I'm afraid you're

916
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:58,880
right.

917
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,240
Right?

918
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,100
So, yeah, like, today is worse than yesterday

919
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,500
by a little bit, but tomorrow is going

920
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,360
to be a little worse.

921
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,540
It's not as bad as it's going to

922
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,080
be tomorrow.

923
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,780
And after tomorrow, it's going to get a

924
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,180
little worse, you know, and you know, it's

925
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,580
the frog in the pot, right?

926
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah.

927
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,720
So until you get the break, I've discussed

928
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,380
in the 2020s, where you're going to be

929
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,320
led very dynamically by a group of young

930
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,200
people from the Middle East and everyone else

931
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,920
is going to follow.

932
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,180
And you will all proclaim that you've made

933
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,220
it, you know, peace for the next 1000

934
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,980
years and all that.

935
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,360
And once that settles in, you've got less

936
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,180
than three years left.

937
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,240
So as a society, you know, and after

938
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,880
that, it'll be like, you know, post Dresden

939
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,920
bombings for 40 years, you know, you see

940
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,620
the world, the old war movies, people come

941
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,580
out of the survivors, I guess, come out

942
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,540
of the bomb shelters, and they're walking around.

943
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,120
And there's, you know, the middle of the

944
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,860
city in Europe, and see elephants and tigers

945
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,100
in the sheet, because the zoo was blown

946
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,340
up.

947
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,220
Also, you know what I mean?

948
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,480
Sure.

949
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,040
Sure.

950
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,160
Yeah.

951
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,220
Actually, I'd gotten a woman firsthand during World

952
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,179
War Two, a while back in the 80s.

953
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,000
She was in her 80s in the 80s,

954
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,300
when they bombed, the allies were really the

955
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,840
axis of evil, by the way, if you

956
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,360
really study the history, it's backwards, bombing Europe,

957
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,199
and they came out of a bomb shelter

958
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,920
in Austrian Hungary area, outside of Budapest.

959
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,820
And there were elephants and lions in the

960
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,179
streets.

961
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,659
I said, Wow, what a visual, you know,

962
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,900
imagine hearing that from someone who stood firsthand,

963
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,360
you know, with a heavy Hungarian, you know,

964
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,460
Magyar accent, Magyar is how you say Hungarian

965
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,040
in Hungarian.

966
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
And yeah, it makes it gives you chills,

967
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,500
you know, so yeah, but yeah, so got

968
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,679
this is what you guys are going back

969
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,580
to the children, by the way, it's those

970
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,500
places in the scriptures should regret the day

971
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,739
you were born into this mess.

972
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,660
But this is not this is these talks

973
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,800
and gaining knowledge, of course, you know, gaining

974
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,940
knowledge is its own reward.

975
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,460
And these sonic events, I should say, are

976
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,200
there to help navigate how well you navigate.

977
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,160
You know, there's an old metaphor about being

978
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,560
up some kind of creek with a paddle

979
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,120
or without a paddle, that's up to you,

980
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,340
right?

981
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Yes.

982
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,480
And the creek, the creek is that what

983
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,960
they say in the metaphor, right?

984
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,520
So, yeah, you're gonna have to figure out

985
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
the paddle and the navigation on your own.

986
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,940
But I would suggest the to go back,

987
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,140
I guess, to recap, none of the entitled

988
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,260
classes know anything.

989
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,880
They know what you know, through the media.

990
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,620
Okay.

991
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,220
Including the medical and the legal and the

992
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,180
religious, especially.

993
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,520
And of course, we've gotten through the political,

994
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,860
they know absolutely nothing.

995
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,640
No politicians or government people.

996
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,060
They're just fulfilling.

997
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,680
I'm going to just this ties in again,

998
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,640
with much of the other stuff about being

999
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,140
lawful or what the contrast of being lawful

1000
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,420
is.

1001
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,140
They talk about it being a democracy where

1002
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,260
you participate, right?

1003
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,600
And like Fresco says, Did you participate on

1004
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,280
deciding the way the highway is going to

1005
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,460
go?

1006
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:12,800
No.

1007
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,240
Did you participate on the color of the

1008
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,600
flag?

1009
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:15,900
No.

1010
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,200
Did you participate on the what the Capitol

1011
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,940
building looks like?

1012
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,180
No.

1013
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,740
Did you participate on who's on the dollar

1014
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:20,960
bill?

1015
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,080
No, you're not participating at all.

1016
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,240
And most people say, Well, that's for them

1017
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,180
to do the experts.

1018
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,660
And here's the thing.

1019
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,520
It's crazy.

1020
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,640
But it would be even worse if it

1021
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,360
truly was participatory, because have you met your

1022
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,660
average citizen in any country?

1023
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,220
Yeah, yeah, it would be even worse.

1024
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,660
But what makes it bad saying it's a

1025
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,380
democracy and precipice participatory is that it's an

1026
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:49,960
outward lie.

1027
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,980
It's a demonstrated outward lie.

1028
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,280
And no one sees it.

1029
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,600
They all agree with it.

1030
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,720
But I'm telling you that it shouldn't be

1031
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,380
because the average idiot or moron couldn't, you

1032
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,780
know, poor, you know, the piss out of

1033
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,280
the boot with instructions on the heel.

1034
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,480
So it's kind of good that it isn't,

1035
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,580
at least the chaos is limited.

1036
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,440
You see, so I wanted to throw that

1037
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,600
in because it ties into being lawful and

1038
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,140
asking for the attorney and I brought up

1039
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,300
what the doctors are and all that.

1040
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,240
The first thing was the finance that's really

1041
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,720
simple.

1042
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,520
In America, and perhaps it needs to be

1043
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,940
tried in other countries because of reciprocity.

1044
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,280
In America, there's a law under US Code

1045
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,020
Title 12, section 411 basically tells you you're

1046
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,440
not authorized to use the money.

1047
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,960
And instead, if you do have this Federal

1048
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,920
Reserve note, you're to go and get lawful

1049
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,240
money.

1050
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,720
You'd make a demand for it.

1051
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,240
It doesn't say they have to give it

1052
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,480
to you.

1053
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,960
That's why you still don't you don't get

1054
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,680
any lawful money.

1055
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,380
But you have to show that you made

1056
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,960
a demand.

1057
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,680
So the way you interact, like, for example,

1058
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,440
with the money, right now, the majority of

1059
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,640
it is very little cash.

1060
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,360
It's either checks or electronic transfer with signatures,

1061
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,880
and, and you're bonding instruments with your signature,

1062
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,440
right?

1063
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Those are bonds that you're issuing.

1064
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,740
That's why when you go down the street

1065
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,460
and the county or whatever jurisdiction you live

1066
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,980
on doesn't say thanks for all the taxes

1067
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,880
you guys paid to pay for the bridge

1068
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,740
or the roads, does it?

1069
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,880
No, it says bonds.

1070
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,880
You get it?

1071
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,960
Birth certificates, prison records, those kinds of things

1072
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,020
are the bonds, right?

1073
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,340
So essentially, when you have a financial instrument,

1074
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,200
you are bonding whatever they want to do

1075
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,480
without any attachments.

1076
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,740
And it basically the old uniform commercial code

1077
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,220
laws stated that if you unilaterally sign the

1078
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,520
name, your full signature on something without any

1079
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,600
conditions, that means you're never looking to redeem

1080
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,840
anything, to get anything for it.

1081
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,700
Think about that for let it sink in

1082
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,140
for a minute.

1083
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,080
And you were never taught to understand how

1084
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,200
to put conditions on things growing up because

1085
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,540
why should you?

1086
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
You're just demon food.

1087
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,640
But anyway, you're here to be fed, you're

1088
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,120
being raised to be fed spiritually to another

1089
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,960
entity, which you know, not you will never

1090
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,300
know anything about, by the way.

1091
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,660
Years ago, I used to tell people, you're

1092
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,860
being controlled by forces you will never understand.

1093
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,760
Now, I still say the same thing.

1094
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,380
You're being controlled by forces you will never

1095
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,620
understand in the ever that you have left,

1096
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,660
right?

1097
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,040
Because you're getting really close.

1098
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,700
Essentially, so whenever you sign anything, you would

1099
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,020
write demand for lawful money or per U

1100
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,780
.S. Title 12 Section 411 and sign it.

1101
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,480
Now, you've created a condition that you're operating

1102
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,080
lawfully.

1103
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,420
And one of these days, if I can

1104
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,640
get other people perhaps to come together, we

1105
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,960
could discuss, you know, how you get from

1106
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,540
underpaying the use fee from the IRS, you

1107
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,020
know, and if they do do that, you

1108
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,380
have records that you've been always endorsing the

1109
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,180
checks, even if it's electronic check, you know,

1110
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,000
they like to do no more paper.

1111
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,260
If it's an electronic check and the boss

1112
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,860
says, well, I can't give you a paper

1113
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,200
check.

1114
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,100
Well, what you do then is you just

1115
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,920
close the account.

1116
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,420
And then when he tries to transfer it,

1117
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,520
it bounces back to him.

1118
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
And he's going to come to you and

1119
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,040
say, well, the check, your funds are bouncing

1120
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,680
back to me.

1121
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,220
What should, you know, you got to do

1122
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:25,560
something.

1123
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,900
He says, no, you got to do something,

1124
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,340
asshole.

1125
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,160
Get your, how's your check writing hand?

1126
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,120
Write me a check.

1127
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,600
And then you can endorse it, right?

1128
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,920
And then you keep a copy of all

1129
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,940
that and send it to the IRS.

1130
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,400
You get all the, not a return.

1131
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,800
They shouldn't have taken anything out.

1132
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,080
See the, the accountants, again, they don't know

1133
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,440
anything.

1134
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,200
I've met plenty of accountants.

1135
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,620
I've had corporate accountants for that company that

1136
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,940
makes the hamburgers with the clown.

1137
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,380
They don't know anything.

1138
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,000
They don't even know anything about this.

1139
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,320
They, just like I said, attorneys in the

1140
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,300
Supreme, like if you ever listened, for example,

1141
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,820
a Supreme court judges, what's their purpose is

1142
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,540
to, is to work with people in the

1143
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,340
bar association.

1144
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,620
It's on YouTube.

1145
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,840
Don't even, don't believe me.

1146
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,480
They don't know any law, you know?

1147
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,000
So, I mean, just look at the characters

1148
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,720
that are up there.

1149
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,500
I mean, it's, it's, you know, you couldn't

1150
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,400
make up how, how ridiculous it is.

1151
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,560
So the way to do that is non

1152
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:18,820
-conditional.

1153
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,700
And the other thing that you remember how

1154
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,580
I mentioned when you do a signature, just

1155
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,480
a signature with no condition in the old

1156
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,280
law, it means that you don't want anything

1157
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,220
in return for it.

1158
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,420
And you're never going to, you're never, you're

1159
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,920
not intending to ever redeem it.

1160
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:32,840
Right.

1161
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,640
You get it?

1162
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,060
Okay.

1163
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,140
Why do you think they switched over to

1164
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,360
electronic pads?

1165
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,460
You ever, you ever returned something?

1166
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,060
What they're doing is harvesting your signature and

1167
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,000
putting it on blank contracts that you know

1168
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,760
nothing about.

1169
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,220
You don't believe that, do you?

1170
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,100
Oh, well here, I'm not going to say

1171
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,500
I'm indicting them for it, but do you

1172
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,180
remember about a year or two ago, Wells

1173
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,600
Fargo had opened about 2 million or 3

1174
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,720
million credit, credit card accounts.

1175
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,460
How did they do that with signature?

1176
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,120
They already have it on electronic files.

1177
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,840
Can you cut and paste or move over

1178
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,280
a signature, you know, to another contract flawlessly?

1179
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

1180
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,820
Has it been done?

1181
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,280
Yeah.

1182
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,480
It's being done all the time.

1183
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
So, you know, that's all I'm going to

1184
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,200
say on that.

1185
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,100
The rest are like, you know, more and

1186
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,460
more and more.

1187
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,900
I don't think I felt if I think

1188
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,920
the people that are listening, these Sonics were

1189
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,520
more receptive.

1190
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,980
I could get into more detail, but I'm

1191
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,120
going to just stop right there.

1192
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,080
Okay.

1193
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,840
In essence, the rest of it was how

1194
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,460
to a lawful job or a job.

1195
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,760
Well, why are you doing a job?

1196
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,620
Why are you doing a job to get

1197
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,380
that right?

1198
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,940
To get what we just discussed, some kind

1199
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,180
of credit or something that at least you

1200
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
show you're not endorsing fully that you can

1201
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,920
pay, you know, attempt to settle all of

1202
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,880
the other requirements that are put on you.

1203
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,480
But, you know, because all you know, the

1204
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,440
thing is, the more you learn about how

1205
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,840
the society functions, the more disgusting it really

1206
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,980
is on every level.

1207
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm not just talking about the American society,

1208
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,820
talking about the Canadians, the Iraqis, the Colombians,

1209
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,220
the Guatemalans, the Mexicans, the Brazilians, the Russians,

1210
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,420
you know, the Koreans, you get you get

1211
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,520
my point, Malaysians, the whole, you know, whole

1212
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,800
200 and whatever countries there are, they're all

1213
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,220
operating in some level of vulgarity and criminality,

1214
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,820
all of them.

1215
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,460
Okay.

1216
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,080
Is it something you can change?

1217
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,260
No, because it's been operating for so long

1218
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,280
this way that it cannot be changed.

1219
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,580
It has to be eliminated completely on a

1220
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,800
global level, on a complete social and cultural

1221
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,600
level, because it's part of the culture.

1222
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,940
What I mean by that is, let's say

1223
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,040
America was taken over by the Chinese.

1224
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,520
You know, through military loss and the Chinese

1225
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:53,860
won.

1226
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,260
No matter what, how much of occupation the

1227
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,340
Chinese do in America, the Americans are still

1228
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,160
going to retain a certain amount of American

1229
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,840
culture.

1230
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,660
You see what I mean?

1231
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,440
Yeah.

1232
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,400
So that also has to go.

1233
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,740
So there is no possibility of change under

1234
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,240
the current conditions.

1235
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,940
And I don't mean one condition or two

1236
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,720
conditions or three.

1237
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,760
I mean, all of the conditions do not

1238
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,840
allow a lawful, smooth transition.

1239
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,040
Even Jack Fresco said it has to collapse.

1240
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,200
Right.

1241
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
He says, how do we transition from this

1242
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,220
to the Venus Project?

1243
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,780
You can't.

1244
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,280
Right.

1245
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,780
So and you know what?

1246
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,700
The ancient Ritz say you can't either, do

1247
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:31,900
they?

1248
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,440
Don't they?

1249
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,340
You see?

1250
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,600
Dug in like ticks.

1251
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,440
You cannot transition.

1252
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
There is no transition.

1253
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,040
It's like the old miners said, you fix

1254
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,860
it or blow it up.

1255
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,920
And it can't be fixed.

1256
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,360
So this is humankind.

1257
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,560
I mean, this has been preset, pre-willed

1258
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,440
and functioning and manifesting every day for the

1259
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,940
past few thousand years, mostly the way we

1260
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,480
know it now.

1261
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,340
So in other words, a lawful job or

1262
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,440
a job would be what the end result

1263
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,600
would be for getting what people call some

1264
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,080
kind of payment or satisfaction for their time

1265
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,820
compensation.

1266
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,120
You see?

1267
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,240
Now, there's an interesting slippery slope with that,

1268
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,760
which is and it isn't about doing the

1269
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,160
right thing with a job.

1270
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,380
Right.

1271
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,740
So would you want to be an attorney,

1272
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,760
accountant, a doctor or a priest or a

1273
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,040
lawyer?

1274
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,580
Well, none of those are attorney or doctor.

1275
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,540
None of those are lawful or being done

1276
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,040
lawfully.

1277
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,420
But if you it depends on how what

1278
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,780
level you view humanity.

1279
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,180
If you view them as a bunch of

1280
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,520
lab rats, well, then who cares?

1281
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,560
So what?

1282
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,000
You throw your railroad a guy, throw him

1283
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,360
in prison.

1284
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,880
So what?

1285
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,380
Just a lab rat.

1286
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,580
But if you value the man or the

1287
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,740
woman or the human being, then you can't

1288
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,320
be any of those things lawfully, because you're

1289
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,480
going to be part of a machine that

1290
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,420
is there to destroy people, not help them.

1291
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,040
You see?

1292
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,040
Right.

1293
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,580
So and what I mean by destroy people,

1294
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,320
the Greek, the doctors help a lot of

1295
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,440
people.

1296
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Attorneys help a lot of people.

1297
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:10,920
Oh, really?

1298
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,420
This is the analogy on that.

1299
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,100
The military, the military helped me out a

1300
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,320
lot.

1301
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,940
I get paid for my college and I

1302
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,620
get a pension.

1303
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,860
And you see, I remember going through that

1304
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,040
same subject with my daughter when she turned

1305
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,820
about 18.

1306
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,980
The purpose of the military is to kill

1307
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,400
people.

1308
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,500
Yeah, I told her that was the first

1309
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,580
thing to watch people being shot.

1310
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,140
And picture you doing it.

1311
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,500
If you can most of them will be

1312
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,220
right and most of them will be your

1313
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,360
own done by your own, especially if you're

1314
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,080
in the American arm.

1315
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,800
40% of the Americans that are injured

1316
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,740
or killed by them are done by their

1317
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,220
own kind.

1318
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,500
By the way, this is a majorly hidden

1319
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,920
thing.

1320
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,320
So that's not good.

1321
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,780
Right.

1322
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,100
So they you know, the member patriotism is

1323
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,440
a disease regarding regarding any country during any

1324
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,020
time.

1325
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,720
Right.

1326
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,940
There's so much psychological disease.

1327
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:12,680
Yes.

1328
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,640
And some spiritual.

1329
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,560
Yes.

1330
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,040
Yes.

1331
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,080
So these entitled classes are just like that,

1332
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,580
you know, and there's still people that aspire.

1333
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,060
You know, I once I once said years

1334
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,560
ago when I was younger and dumber, I

1335
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,500
went around interviewed people in the entitled religious

1336
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,060
classes.

1337
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,960
And one of the priests was proud.

1338
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,720
He was an orthodox priest.

1339
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,320
He says, I used to be an attorney.

1340
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,100
Now I'm a priest.

1341
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,960
I was like, everyone's like, wow.

1342
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,260
And I'm like, wow, that is really bad.

1343
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,600
Shit, man.

1344
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,700
That's like really bad combination.

1345
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,780
I mean, but it's perfect.

1346
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,800
It's perfect transition.

1347
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,500
You know, you learn to live from one,

1348
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,960
you know, then you learn to lie again,

1349
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,180
you know, it's perfect, you know.

1350
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,180
So that is the job part is is

1351
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,680
anything I think I think the easiest way

1352
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,880
to be lawful is it's not time for

1353
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,020
humans to change.

1354
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,420
So in the meantime, no matter what the

1355
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,080
trends are, whether you're in the industrial age,

1356
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,960
the space age, information age, you know, when

1357
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,320
the pipe breaks, all that other shit goes

1358
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,380
away and you need a plumber.

1359
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,880
When the electricity doesn't, the electricity doesn't work,

1360
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,520
all that other shit in your life goes

1361
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,960
away and you need an electrician, right?

1362
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,240
When the car breaks down, all that shit

1363
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,080
in your life goes away.

1364
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,480
You need a car mechanic, right?

1365
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,320
Right.

1366
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,040
So yeah, regardless of who you are, where

1367
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,340
you are, how much money you have or

1368
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,060
little money you have or what type of

1369
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,900
house or where you live, whether you're renting

1370
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,740
or, you know, your own house or whatever,

1371
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,280
right?

1372
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,320
Pipe breaks need a plumber.

1373
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,660
Everything else stops.

1374
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,340
Movie stops.

1375
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,920
Stop contemplating everything.

1376
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,240
Right.

1377
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,000
So you see, your hair is always going

1378
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,400
to grow.

1379
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,340
Hair cutters.

1380
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:53,640
Right.

1381
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:54,580
Right.

1382
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,880
So dry cleaning isn't a profession that used

1383
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,100
to be as much because of the clothing

1384
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,000
styles of changes like haberdashers.

1385
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,200
Right.

1386
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,040
So, you know, so and there is there

1387
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,320
is.

1388
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,340
Yeah.

1389
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,620
So, you know, food, people got to eat.

1390
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,320
Right.

1391
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,020
But the thing is, the restaurant business is

1392
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,340
a very piss poor business.

1393
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,980
One thing in the restaurant business is if

1394
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,660
you need 10 people to do the job

1395
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,880
to run the restaurant and you hire 10

1396
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,900
people, you're overhired.

1397
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,800
You get it?

1398
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,060
Everybody has to do like the work of

1399
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,180
two people in order for a restaurant to

1400
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,420
be the way the economic model is.

1401
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,600
If you need 10 people to run the

1402
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,620
restaurant, you hire five.

1403
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,940
What does that mean for the five people?

1404
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,340
A lot of work and not a lot

1405
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,680
of pay.

1406
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,220
And they're used to high rotation because they

1407
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,320
usually specialize the job.

1408
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,640
And when they need to replace you or

1409
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,160
make a replacement, they have, you know, a

1410
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,080
narrow field compartmentalized, you see.

1411
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:48,440
Right.

1412
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,200
And then, you know, they're constantly training.

1413
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,620
Right.

1414
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,580
And that's the brilliance of the fast food

1415
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,500
that Ray Kroc did with McDonald's about how

1416
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,620
to automate and all that.

1417
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,800
It's totally for that.

1418
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,520
But the food is, you know, very low

1419
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:00,920
quality.

1420
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,520
I remember eating, for example, McDonald's back in

1421
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,120
the 60s and 70s was delicious because it

1422
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,640
was mostly organic back then.

1423
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,300
OK, so the lawful job or job either

1424
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,900
way is, I guess, it's what sense of

1425
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,840
morality you have.

1426
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,720
Remember, the gods don't think much of people.

1427
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,640
That's why I put that in the personal

1428
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,080
sense.

1429
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,360
If you think people are crap or whatever

1430
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,640
and you don't mind putting them in jail

1431
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,760
or injecting them with vaccines or poisons or

1432
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,660
flying a plane that sprays them, that's fine.

1433
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,040
That's up to you because the gods don't

1434
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,900
care much about them.

1435
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,140
I wouldn't do it, though.

1436
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,180
You know, personally, I couldn't be an attorney

1437
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,860
or a priest or a doctor.

1438
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,460
If you're going anywhere in life, if you've

1439
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,080
got better knowledge of what's going on, is

1440
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,660
it going to matter at the job anyway?

1441
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,660
You're there to work.

1442
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,560
You're not there to make friends and convey.

1443
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:55,980
Sure.

1444
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,700
I find that once if your mindset is

1445
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,540
advanced and you know what's going on on

1446
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,140
this planet and you're acting like you've been

1447
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,960
here for more than 15 minutes, because most

1448
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,740
people on this planet are acting like they

1449
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,600
haven't even been here for 15 minutes.

1450
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,080
They're completely shut down.

1451
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,700
Completely.

1452
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,180
You know what I mean?

1453
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,500
That's why I use the pun.

1454
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,260
You know, now I shifted it to about

1455
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,700
an hour to give a little more leeway.

1456
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,900
Have you been on this planet for more

1457
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,360
than an hour?

1458
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,280
OK, that means you see how screwed up

1459
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:22,860
it is, right?

1460
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,180
Well, no, I don't see you.

1461
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,940
Well, you're not looking hard enough.

1462
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,960
Yeah.

1463
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,240
If you've been here, all it takes is

1464
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,640
an hour to figure that out.

1465
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,000
Right.

1466
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,560
On this planet.

1467
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,620
I know I'm being a little harsh, but

1468
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,020
this is the reality of it.

1469
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,640
That's how screwed up it is.

1470
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:34,860
Right.

1471
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,520
But, you know, to the headhunter, he's not

1472
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,500
going to realize the headhunters are bad, whether

1473
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,340
he's there for 15 minutes, an hour, all

1474
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,880
of his life.

1475
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,600
You see what I mean?

1476
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,660
The point there also.

1477
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah.

1478
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,200
So the thing with the job is very

1479
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,620
simple.

1480
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,420
When you you're advanced in your ability to

1481
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,260
see what's really going on, the best job

1482
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,520
or occupation is when you don't have to

1483
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,600
deal with people like, you know, where you

1484
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,700
work by yourself, you know, whether it's packing

1485
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,760
envelopes in a room by yourself all day,

1486
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,480
listening to Greek, speak 24 seven or whatever

1487
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,240
or whatever.

1488
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:06,960
I'm just joking.

1489
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,660
Or, you know, a chef or a cook,

1490
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,600
you don't have to deal with people like

1491
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,320
the worst thing would be like a waitress

1492
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,300
or a cop or an attorney, you know,

1493
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,220
again, not in title class, but where you

1494
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,220
have to deal with people.

1495
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,700
If you know what's going on now, if

1496
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
you know a little bit about what's going

1497
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,680
on and you still want to work with

1498
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,840
people, fine, work with them.

1499
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,940
But there's no way you could know a

1500
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,500
lot of what's going on on this planet

1501
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,340
and work with people.

1502
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,980
That I have never seen anyone be able

1503
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,320
to do.

1504
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,620
So that would be one way to alleviate

1505
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,640
the occupations.

1506
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,680
It does touch the spirit when you, well,

1507
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,780
I think privately you and I, I mentioned

1508
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,800
where I'm at and I see a lot,

1509
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,860
but I tone that down with my own

1510
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,280
spirit.

1511
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,040
I mean, it's not my concern.

1512
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,220
My concern is me, my knowledge, my way.

1513
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,720
I'm going to run my life.

1514
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm not there to evaluate and that's somebody

1515
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,300
else's.

1516
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,080
Well, or the way I do if I

1517
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,180
have to be around people, like sometimes I

1518
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,400
have to be around them and not in

1519
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,500
mass anymore if I can choose not to,

1520
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,460
but you know, a three, four, five, I

1521
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,020
know they're vulgar and offensive and what they

1522
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,940
think and do is criminal, even the best

1523
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,280
of them.

1524
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,920
And it's temporal, meaning there's not a lot

1525
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,720
of time left where in the future, the

1526
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,160
society will be structured to what their, the

1527
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,800
way they think, act and behave now will

1528
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,480
be in the future considered outwardly vulgar, offensive

1529
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,360
and criminal and be able to be enforced

1530
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,000
as such.

1531
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,020
Right now they're just, you know, like I

1532
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,480
said, don't take offense, just get, understand the

1533
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,780
cross between an insane asylum and a pig

1534
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,120
farm.

1535
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,720
If you know you're in an insane asylum

1536
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,800
and a pig farm, you know, how can

1537
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,080
you take, you know, you know, you're, you

1538
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,600
know where you are, you know what's going

1539
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,380
on, it stinks, it's crazy, get over it

1540
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,900
until you're not there anymore.

1541
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,420
Sure, sure.

1542
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,460
So yeah, don't, you know, the thing is

1543
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,720
that when you get to the point where

1544
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,780
you start to see more and more, without

1545
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,800
a doubt, the people around you are vile,

1546
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,700
offensive and criminal from a, you know, a

1547
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,560
lawful perspective, all of them, not some of

1548
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,360
them, you know, majority.

1549
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,600
So, but you, you, you negotiate with your

1550
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,280
own self on that as it not being,

1551
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,740
you know, terminal in, in the big picture.

1552
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,420
Yeah, it's terminal for them and this, they're

1553
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,080
not going to, you know, make that kind

1554
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,520
of stuff isn't going to make it over

1555
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,860
to the next society, but it's just right

1556
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,260
now, you see, it's just small.

1557
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,620
But the other, the main suggestion there would

1558
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,440
be just avoid them, you know, stuffing all,

1559
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,500
what are jobs you, you know, you can

1560
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,000
do in, you know, solitude, you know, working

1561
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,240
a machine, stuffing all envelopes, janitor late at

1562
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,440
night, without a crew, let's say, I wouldn't

1563
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,140
say menial.

1564
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,340
For me, I work in receiving, so I'm

1565
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,800
constantly drivers by myself.

1566
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:10,220
Yeah.

1567
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,180
Yeah.

1568
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,020
And you interact with momentarily with people that

1569
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,560
are exactly you're receiving from, right?

1570
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,040
Yeah.

1571
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,800
And the machines will probably be involved.

1572
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,080
Yeah.

1573
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,940
They'll look at you.

1574
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,280
This is what you got.

1575
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,820
Let me see the paper and then machines

1576
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,540
or take effect.

1577
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,340
You take effect.

1578
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,700
Yep.

1579
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,280
Yep.

1580
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,820
So very, very little interaction.

1581
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,060
And when I do have to, you know,

1582
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,420
of course, I'm a polite, courteous person, and

1583
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,940
I'll share with it in that respect, it

1584
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,520
doesn't mean I have to be harsh to

1585
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:38,840
anybody.

1586
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,320
As a matter of fact, I have a

1587
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,300
compassion enough to say I truly do feel

1588
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,840
sorry, in my heart.

1589
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,200
Oh, yeah.

1590
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,660
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's fine.

1591
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,320
It's adequate.

1592
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,440
One, one way to to think about that

1593
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,720
also, like what I do is I, I

1594
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,260
provide really good water, really good food for

1595
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,220
people, right?

1596
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,140
You know, like, I think I've given my,

1597
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,900
a lot of the food sonics was when

1598
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,280
I was out at the mines, I was,

1599
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,940
everyone's running down to the 24 hour store

1600
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,260
to get microwave pizzas, and I'm cooking rice

1601
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,000
and beans and things on the back of

1602
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,360
the truck.

1603
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,680
And they're like, you can make rice?

1604
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,960
They were fascinated that I could even just

1605
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,940
make rice, you know, it was like, you're

1606
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,840
joking, you know, so.

1607
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,520
How did your, your new test on rice

1608
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,820
go?

1609
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,080
Hmm, still haven't tried it.

1610
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,700
I still haven't even purchased it.

1611
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,040
Okay.

1612
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,740
Where I, what was interesting, I was going

1613
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,960
to purchase it yesterday.

1614
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,180
And not only was the road tore up,

1615
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,200
road closed, you know, with all the, the,

1616
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,060
and there was actually a police action with

1617
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,020
a bad car accident on the other side

1618
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,380
of where I was trying to go on

1619
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:48,860
a detour.

1620
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,980
So I was like, Oh, it's not meant

1621
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,240
for me to get any rice today.

1622
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,280
But, but I've been trying to be a

1623
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,420
local vor, you know, what's growing route, right?

1624
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,440
And what's easily to reach, you know, in

1625
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,360
the garden, flatbreads, just simple fast food, food

1626
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,980
that I make at home, which rice is

1627
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,860
actually, you know, I call it quick rice.

1628
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,980
Instead of letting it sit for 10 minutes,

1629
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,020
you just rinse it in hot water, and

1630
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,200
then go ahead and cook it with a

1631
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,740
lot of weights.

1632
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,260
And it'll get, you'll have rice ready in

1633
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,260
less than 15 minutes.

1634
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,900
You know, real rice, you know, I mean,

1635
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,760
white rice, not converted rice and stuff for

1636
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,340
white people are told to get or whatever.

1637
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,980
I don't think it's converted rice still on

1638
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,360
the market.

1639
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,060
I don't even know.

1640
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,280
I've I remember that came out in the

1641
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,660
70s.

1642
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,360
I've had it once.

1643
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,720
I'm not sure on that one.

1644
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,960
I'll have to take a peek next time

1645
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,700
and go to the shops.

1646
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,100
Yeah.

1647
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,460
I know they have I've seen pre cooked

1648
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:40,120
rice and in vacuum sealed plastic bags, either

1649
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,980
frozen or on the shelf, which is scary.

1650
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:42,780
Yeah.

1651
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,380
I think you'd have to put a gun

1652
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,440
to my head to eat that.

1653
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,480
So yeah.

1654
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,340
And even then I would feign eating it.

1655
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,260
But yeah, so these things are easy.

1656
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,620
I mean, simple, but not easy.

1657
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,720
The other thing is regarding children.

1658
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,640
Well, children are a pain in the butt.

1659
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,380
I mean, they're just it's very difficult.

1660
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,840
It's a very difficult thing.

1661
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,220
One of the most understated things either with

1662
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,180
Greek speak or in the world, I haven't

1663
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,000
spent a lot of time talking about it

1664
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,060
is how difficult it is to raise children.

1665
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,100
Forget about raising them properly, just raising them.

1666
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,220
And if you're going to do anything, you

1667
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,060
should do it properly.

1668
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,020
So that word shouldn't be in there, you

1669
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,380
know, raising children properly.

1670
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,220
How about just consider raising them?

1671
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,720
Forget about, you know, focusing on the properly

1672
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,960
because you've got everything working against you and

1673
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,060
that even if you were in a proper

1674
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,700
society.

1675
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,840
Well, I shouldn't say that because in a

1676
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,820
proper society, you would have small things for

1677
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,440
small people.

1678
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:41,980
Right?

1679
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,360
Small chairs for small tables, small bathrooms, small

1680
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,340
sink, small clothes, small shoes.

1681
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,420
And most of the things I just mouthed

1682
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,680
off there listed off do exist.

1683
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,680
You know, when I found out when I

1684
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,900
was raising mine, time slows down.

1685
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,400
And you got a lot more of it.

1686
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,520
And you got a lot more of it

1687
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,300
with a young child.

1688
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,620
And that's a whole, whole different world.

1689
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,800
Yes, yes, it is.

1690
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,820
Yes, it's we've been also as humans in

1691
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,000
culture, through conditioning have been trained that it

1692
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,060
that it's pleasant to go through the maladies

1693
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,900
that you go through right with raising children.

1694
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,580
It's not pleasant in any way.

1695
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,620
And but people in discussion with their lip

1696
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,060
service say that it is.

1697
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,280
But what I see going on, I don't

1698
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,000
see it as being pleasant at all, either

1699
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,660
objectively or subjectively.

1700
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,120
What I mean, subjectively, especially when a parent

1701
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,060
says, I want to throw that baby out

1702
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,660
the window, I haven't slept in three months.

1703
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:47,920
Right?

1704
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,120
And not just one parent, but most parents,

1705
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,040
I haven't slept in three months, you know,

1706
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,720
we try to take turns, but we can't,

1707
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,820
you know, we both get up, right?

1708
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,240
Let's say mother and father, right?

1709
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,440
So there are there are better ways that

1710
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,300
will be in the future on how to

1711
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,800
do that.

1712
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,000
I think that the biggest detriment is the

1713
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,180
subculture, I call it the kids subculture, the

1714
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,640
goat, the baby goat subculture.

1715
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:12,560
Right?

1716
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,120
Well, they have, you know, stupid, like Jack

1717
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,960
fresco says, you know, there's the cow and

1718
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,660
the lamb, the cow went moo moo, the

1719
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,760
lamb went baa baa.

1720
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,580
Children don't want any of that Mickey Mouse,

1721
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,440
Disney, Sesame Street, all that stuff is rubbish.

1722
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,920
It's actually satanic if you really were to

1723
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,720
use a lawful yardstick.

1724
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,260
And one easy way to shed that, again,

1725
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,420
with children is say that's for babies, you

1726
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,480
know, once they start communicating, just tell them

1727
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,240
that's for babies.

1728
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,900
And they don't want to be a way

1729
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,760
to shed them, but make them familiar with

1730
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:49,900
it.

1731
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,740
It's the same with the King James, you

1732
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,220
know, people say, I don't want to read

1733
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:56,640
the King James.

1734
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,640
You know what, you have to, because you

1735
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,260
have to know it, because that's what people

1736
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:01,640
know.

1737
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,440
So the child still should know all that

1738
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,080
crap, but present it in a way that

1739
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,140
it's crap, but not in a way that

1740
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,240
the child feels bad if he likes it.

1741
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,620
Well, inspire them with knowledge, you know, to

1742
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,680
their own liking.

1743
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,320
Yeah, the child is going to ask, why

1744
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,200
does the airplane fly?

1745
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,200
Why does the car go?

1746
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:21,900
What's a horse?

1747
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,800
You know, that stuff.

1748
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,200
Yeah, how the TV got there, and believe

1749
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,440
it or not, back with how the TV

1750
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,860
got there, the parents didn't know.

1751
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,480
Right, right.

1752
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,920
Well, the parents didn't know.

1753
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:32,660
Yeah.

1754
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,660
You see, so many times I've said, well,

1755
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,000
if daddy has a plane, I don't know,

1756
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,160
like politicians.

1757
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,680
I don't know.

1758
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:39,940
I don't know.

1759
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,600
That's why there is no future in this

1760
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,180
society.

1761
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,260
There can't be, you know, the way that

1762
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:48,680
it is.

1763
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,240
But so in that sense, again, just to

1764
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,980
recap this person about discuss finance lawful jobs

1765
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,800
in a modern world and raising modern just

1766
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,100
means the end of the world, by the

1767
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,340
way.

1768
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,080
And raising children properly, and keeping a house

1769
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,160
in order without sacrificing safety of the children,

1770
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,420
that's an interesting thing.

1771
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,040
Because you're basically going to you've heard of

1772
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,120
the spies in the land, you're going to

1773
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,640
have to be very much aware of the

1774
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,420
offensive vulgarity and criminality of all the people

1775
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,020
around you, to the point where you don't

1776
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,140
want to be so right that you seem

1777
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,000
offensive, criminal and vulgar to them.

1778
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:28,840
You see what I mean?

1779
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,180
Right?

1780
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,620
Yes.

1781
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:30,780
Yeah.

1782
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,520
So that's the interesting part.

1783
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,100
But the other interesting part of this is

1784
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,640
I have yet to see a household survive,

1785
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,580
you know, like a normal, you know, which

1786
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,140
means fucked up household.

1787
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,260
When one of the either the man or

1788
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,860
the woman discover they want to be lawful

1789
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,660
from Greek speak or anywhere else.

1790
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,160
I mean, this is even before there was

1791
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,520
Greek speak.

1792
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,160
I've heard of this.

1793
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,220
It always divides the family.

1794
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,980
Yeah, very, very, very, very rarely harshly do

1795
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,880
they stay together.

1796
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,040
So if you want to be lawful, you're

1797
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,200
going to have a divorce or worse or

1798
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,600
whatever.

1799
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,300
Okay, unless you're truly fortunate to have a

1800
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:11,580
mate.

1801
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,280
That's right, because we're going to be interested.

1802
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,500
Yes, that is so rare that it's not

1803
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,740
even worth mentioning that.

1804
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,580
Yeah, yeah.

1805
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,480
Yeah, it does happen.

1806
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,160
It does occur.

1807
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,740
It does exist.

1808
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,340
But it's so rare that to bring it

1809
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,920
up is disservice.

1810
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,320
Because 99 999% if you told 100

1811
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,000
couples, a 99 and a half of them

1812
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,900
are going to get a divorce.

1813
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,140
Well, Greek had a half of them get

1814
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,040
a divorce, you'll see about all of them

1815
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,440
divorce.

1816
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,620
Well, this goes back to the time when

1817
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,280
you and Sam were talking about going out

1818
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,720
and talking to different people.

1819
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,000
You know, and it's the same thing with

1820
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,660
couples, you have to talk to each other.

1821
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,960
And it's how you bring the information about

1822
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,640
how you can articulate it to each other.

1823
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,840
And their perceptivity is receptive or not.

1824
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,940
You're a lucky man if that happens.

1825
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,980
Or woman, yeah, or woman.

1826
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,540
Yeah, yeah, either because sometimes a woman can

1827
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,100
bring it, which I would suggest is better

1828
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,420
in some cases.

1829
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,160
And you could use your imagination.

1830
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:14,680
Why?

1831
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,660
Because the power of a gentle, gentle touch

1832
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,860
in their aspirations when when truly wanting to

1833
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,200
bring another person in to the fold of

1834
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,640
things.

1835
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,380
And sure, well, the power of the woman

1836
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,920
as the chief economist, economists mean echo, meaning

1837
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,700
house and almost meaning law.

1838
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,900
That's why if you want an educated society,

1839
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,720
educate the women.

1840
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,080
If you need to educate a society in

1841
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,860
one generation very rapidly, focus on educating women.

1842
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:45,840
That's your focus.

1843
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,160
Yes, of course, you provide education easily accessible

1844
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,700
to everyone, but you have to make a

1845
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,280
focus on the women because that's where the

1846
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,380
children are going to look forward.

1847
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,540
You look at what society offers women just

1848
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,360
for jobs.

1849
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,340
They should have played dumb in the 60s.

1850
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,020
Yeah, yeah.

1851
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,340
Instead of instead of protesting, they should have

1852
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:08,780
played dumb.

1853
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,980
No, I don't know how to.

1854
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,600
I don't know how to write.

1855
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,920
I don't know how to go to the

1856
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,260
bank.

1857
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,000
I don't know how to use a phone.

1858
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:15,960
They should just play dumb.

1859
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:16,720
That would have been fine.

1860
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,020
Everything would have been fine.

1861
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:18,600
Yeah.

1862
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,060
Yeah.

1863
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,580
You still would have a sanitation worker or

1864
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,800
a guy working at McDonald's support supporting the

1865
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,400
whole family.

1866
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,640
Mm hmm.

1867
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,100
But but, you know, no, you know, so

1868
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,820
anyway, go and burn my bra.

1869
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,100
Yeah.

1870
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,520
Yeah.

1871
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,800
That was just a show.

1872
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,320
Actually, there was more plans.

1873
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,720
If you remember the new the New Order

1874
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,420
of Barbarians, the day the Dr. Day speech

1875
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,780
that was already set up.

1876
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,540
I know once in a while I revisit

1877
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,280
that just remind you.

1878
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,400
Yeah, just to remind myself.

1879
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,580
Yeah, it's true.

1880
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:51,800
Yeah.

1881
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,180
So that's the secular force.

1882
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,740
So here's the thing.

1883
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,560
You know how I say, never say make

1884
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,340
the world a better place because you have

1885
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,200
the malevolent against you because they never want

1886
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,320
it.

1887
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,940
But now you have the benevolent gods against

1888
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,660
you also because it's time to knock it

1889
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,840
knock it all out.

1890
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,580
But on top of that, you even have

1891
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,280
the entire the the ones that are ruling

1892
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,960
the world behind the scenes also doing it,

1893
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,340
you see.

1894
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:15,740
Right.

1895
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:19,060
So you have the the true, true power

1896
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,460
on the earth, the true power in the

1897
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,580
heavens on both sides.

1898
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,540
You see, as above.

1899
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,900
So that's right.

1900
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,680
And it's all against anything getting better, it

1901
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,500
will appear to get better, only to the

1902
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,880
point and it will be manifest to a

1903
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,160
degree.

1904
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,440
So humans are without excuse later, you see.

1905
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,260
So it's kind of like the last meal,

1906
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,460
someone on death row.

1907
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,080
So I think the children part on the

1908
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,660
last part of this email is the most

1909
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,240
difficult.

1910
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,080
If you really want to be pragmatic about

1911
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,600
it, what makes it more difficult, the more

1912
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,360
you learn is, you know, I'm one of

1913
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,480
the few people I know that could perhaps

1914
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,700
do this when I see someone with a

1915
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,200
newborn baby, I see that baby has no

1916
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,640
future.

1917
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,400
I said, What would you do if you

1918
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,500
only live to 14?

1919
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:07,980
Like, what do you mean?

1920
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,860
Like, well, if you only live to 14?

1921
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,420
What would you do?

1922
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,720
You live your life differently?

1923
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,440
Yeah, well, don't you don't have to make

1924
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,360
the baby do that.

1925
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,840
But make the baby aware of that.

1926
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,740
I mean, would you go to school?

1927
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,160
Hell no.

1928
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,740
But you still want to know how to

1929
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,540
read, don't you?

1930
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:22,620
Right?

1931
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,160
You want to know where televisions come from,

1932
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,400
you want to know where babies come from.

1933
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,900
So anyway, so that's, that's, that's one thing

1934
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,240
when you see these young people, you just

1935
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,860
add 14.

1936
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,540
You know, that's their age, you know, and

1937
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,180
of course, you know, it's going to be

1938
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,640
nine out of 10 that won't be here.

1939
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,080
But the chances, it's a lot, it's a

1940
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,420
lot safer to say, well, they're not going

1941
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,720
to make it, you know, if it's a

1942
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,860
10% chance, they're going to make it,

1943
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,360
I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't focus on

1944
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,900
the making it part, I would focus on

1945
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,240
you're not going to make it to that

1946
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:50,480
point.

1947
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,680
So live your life better.

1948
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,240
You see, right aspect, and if you do

1949
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,800
make it, you'd wish you didn't, in a

1950
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,740
sense, unless you're granted tremendous amount of protection,

1951
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,720
which is something I don't discuss, I haven't

1952
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,380
discussed much, but it is a spiritual thing.

1953
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,960
There's nothing you can do, you can't dig

1954
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,220
a hole in the ground, go join, you

1955
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,820
know, the guys that have the underground cities,

1956
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,580
that's not going to help storing foods, not

1957
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,020
going to help.

1958
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,319
Yes.

1959
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,160
Do you consider all of that?

1960
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,160
Of course, you know, it's just good common

1961
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,100
sense, right?

1962
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,520
It's to say it's the same common sense,

1963
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,340
preparing for a future 14 years plus from

1964
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,760
now is the same common sense that you

1965
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,640
have when you have a spare tire in

1966
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,120
a car.

1967
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,840
You don't you know, the only difference is

1968
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,140
you don't have a spare in a car

1969
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,580
because you're planning on flatting.

1970
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,620
It's just in case.

1971
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,740
This is different.

1972
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,640
This is going to happen.

1973
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:42,600
You see, it's a little different.

1974
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:48,920
So carrying a spare or backup, because of

1975
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,680
the way things are going to change, and

1976
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,520
when they're terminated is going to be so

1977
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,420
dynamic, your backups don't mean shit.

1978
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,080
You know what I mean?

1979
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:57,800
Right.

1980
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,720
So, but it doesn't mean don't have it

1981
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,260
in the meantime, or whatever, and just see

1982
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,060
what the gods do for you or with

1983
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:05,840
you, you know.

1984
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,399
This is an interesting thing, you know, and

1985
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,560
very often, just to maybe finish this off

1986
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,620
or wrap it up, the thought, you know,

1987
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,840
even myself personally, a personal thought, I question

1988
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,640
myself, so these are really 14 years, let's

1989
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,260
go back and check this and all this,

1990
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,279
and I, not self-doubt, but like just

1991
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:23,540
check it again, you know, like when you

1992
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,300
do a math test, for example, just check

1993
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,960
it again, check your answers, check all the

1994
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,319
answers again, and I'm sure.

1995
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,979
And then on the other hand, I'm like,

1996
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,319
well, how come no one else is giving

1997
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,000
any specifics?

1998
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,540
And I'm like, I got to, you know,

1999
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,800
remember the old V8 commercial?

2000
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,479
I got to slap myself on the head.

2001
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,340
They don't even know what day it is.

2002
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,979
They don't even know how the body works.

2003
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,319
They don't even know what money is.

2004
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,340
They don't even know this.

2005
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,200
They don't even know that.

2006
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,140
They don't know anything.

2007
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:50,300
So relax about why no one else is

2008
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:50,979
saying anything.

2009
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:51,779
You know what I mean?

2010
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:53,920
Relax.

2011
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:54,660
It's fine.

2012
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,320
It checks out.

2013
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,940
So everything checks out really well.

2014
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,240
And it can't go on for much more,

2015
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,280
and you'll see later on, it'll be more

2016
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:05,980
evident why.

2017
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,780
You've heard of rapid changes, rapid progressions, but

2018
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,760
this society is not going to end the

2019
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,060
way that you've been shown.

2020
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,020
It's going to end, like Seinfeld says, you

2021
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,840
end on a high note, really good, like

2022
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,840
good supper clubs.

2023
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,700
I remember you set them up, you run

2024
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,180
them for three years, they get really great,

2025
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,360
and you shut them down right at their

2026
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:30,640
peak.

2027
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,740
So no one will ever say, I remember

2028
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,960
when it used to be good, you know?

2029
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,180
Because if it shuts down when it's at

2030
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,820
its peak, there is no, I remember when

2031
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,480
it used to be good.

2032
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,500
Oh, it was great, and too bad they

2033
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,320
closed, right?

2034
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,300
But the thing with this society, it's not

2035
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,520
going to be too bad it ended.

2036
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,040
Well, it ended, now we better just shut

2037
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,740
up and listen, because we had it all

2038
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,660
and couldn't deal with it.

2039
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,080
You see?

2040
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:05,740
So from that point of view, another point

2041
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,740
of view would be, if let's say there

2042
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,920
was extraterrestrial intelligent life that came to Earth,

2043
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,660
they would figure out everything you've heard in

2044
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,460
Greek speak and more in less than an

2045
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:15,700
hour.

2046
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,460
And there are people that go from cradle

2047
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,240
to grave on this planet, and even if

2048
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,660
they do hear it, they still can't figure

2049
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,080
it out.

2050
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:23,760
You see?

2051
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:28,660
So that's how off humanity is at this

2052
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:28,960
point.

2053
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,880
And it's not going to get any, in

2054
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,100
other words, I was going to say not

2055
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,800
going to get any better, but it is

2056
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,540
going to get really good, because that's part

2057
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,120
of the setup.

2058
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,240
But in other words, you're not going to

2059
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,400
get any of the things that you've ever

2060
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,640
been made hopeful of in the past, which

2061
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,020
you are not being made hopeful anymore.

2062
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,660
An example of that would be, do you

2063
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,100
remember Bruce growing up and hearing about World's

2064
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,320
Fair, whether historically or presently, right?

2065
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,020
They had the World's Fair, the world's of

2066
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,280
tomorrow, and the world of tomorrow, you don't

2067
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,340
get any of that now.

2068
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,000
Anything you're shown of the future now might

2069
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,520
be only in Hollywood, and it's despotic, it's

2070
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,000
negative, it's violent, right?

2071
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,920
And that's it.

2072
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,800
I mean, isn't anyone paying attention?

2073
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,840
What happened to the World's Fairs?

2074
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,640
The Eiffel Tower was a function of the

2075
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,200
World's Fair.

2076
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,680
And it was temporary, by the way.

2077
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,760
It was built for the World's Fair, and

2078
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,960
it was supposed to be, they were saying,

2079
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,800
well, the architects were like, this has really

2080
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,760
disrupted the way the city looks, let's take

2081
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,140
it down.

2082
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,380
And obviously, they let it go, right?

2083
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,800
It became an icon for using that word

2084
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,180
loosely.

2085
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,060
So you're not getting any more World's Fairs.

2086
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,640
In any futuristic, there is no more discussion.

2087
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
Yeah, well, for a reason.

2088
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:48,400
Yeah.

2089
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,300
But you will have...

2090
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:51,880
Well, just like all the other fairs that

2091
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,740
did, you know, the ones that came and

2092
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:54,880
went.

2093
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,240
That's why one of the things is the

2094
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,480
setup.

2095
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,980
That's why you're all going to fall for

2096
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,780
the mid-2020s when you're told it's a

2097
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,460
perfect world.

2098
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,580
And they will start working on that.

2099
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,720
You're going to fall for it because you

2100
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,660
haven't had such endeavor or altruism or any

2101
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,960
kind of hope like that in such a

2102
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,460
long time.

2103
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,520
And you're all going to fall for it.

2104
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,100
Very simple.

2105
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,220
There'll be world peace and you'll have, you

2106
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,840
know, freedoms and liberties.

2107
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,700
Liberties just means time off from what you

2108
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,960
normally do or committed, pledged to do.

2109
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,240
It makes you wonder what the technique would

2110
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,740
be that they'd be using.

2111
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:31,760
Spiritual.

2112
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,840
Well, I realize that.

2113
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,400
It's going to be mind.

2114
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,940
Manifested on earth here.

2115
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,060
How would that manifest?

2116
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:38,700
Oh, yeah.

2117
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,060
You know, it makes you just ponder on

2118
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,780
that sometimes.

2119
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,440
And I've meditated many times on what could

2120
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,060
they have used that would be that profound?

2121
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,300
Well, the hints that we get is it's

2122
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,200
going to be of supernatural paranormal in nature

2123
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,940
on a terror, atmospheric and terrorist terrorsphere, right?

2124
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,160
Signs and wonders kind of thing.

2125
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,760
But it's it's it's going to obviously it's

2126
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,960
going to have to trump the effects you

2127
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,620
get from the rectangles, you know, phones, iPads,

2128
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,600
computers and movies.

2129
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,280
It's going to be more than that.

2130
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,340
But the but the technology that people focus

2131
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,340
on are the screens.

2132
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,020
You notice that if the resolution on the

2133
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,840
screens went to pot, people would think the

2134
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,940
technology is no good.

2135
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,040
The only reason they think the technology is

2136
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,920
good is because the resolution is getting up

2137
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,520
high depth.

2138
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,200
That's why, you know, not because the number

2139
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:32,820
crunching.

2140
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,600
Oh, it's faster to stupid to realize anything

2141
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,900
that's past their sensory systems, you know, the

2142
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,780
basic senses.

2143
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,580
So they think the technology is so high

2144
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,360
because of the resolution of the what they're

2145
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,780
watching.

2146
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,640
So this paranormal activity and supernatural stuff that's

2147
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,040
going to take place is going to mesh

2148
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,720
and dovetail very well with the media that

2149
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,420
they're using.

2150
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,030
You know, the media is not going to

2151
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:57,530
go away.

2152
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,350
You're still going to have the, you know,

2153
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,830
it's going to get even more intrusive.

2154
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,050
In other words, not intrusive, I should say,

2155
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,910
because most people don't consider intrusive.

2156
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,010
It's going to be more incorporated into your

2157
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,990
daily lives and into what you consider to

2158
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,470
be, you know, the go to thing.

2159
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,590
Yeah, so it's whatever it is, like you

2160
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:18,570
asked, I don't know specifically, but I know

2161
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:19,910
it's going to have to integrate well with

2162
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:20,830
the rectangle, right?

2163
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,770
Yeah, clearly, clearly.

2164
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,950
It doesn't integrate with, you know, like I

2165
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,510
said, the this is just a beta test.

2166
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,630
In the end, there are things that are

2167
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,530
going to be happening parts of the world

2168
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,150
that everyone will be able to see.

2169
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,930
Even though they're anywhere else in the world

2170
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:40,210
because of the the data transfer audio video.

2171
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,270
I caught myself I was going to say

2172
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:44,830
YouTube, but no, it doesn't have to be

2173
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,170
YouTube.

2174
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:48,550
It could be streaming from any platform that

2175
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,650
allows it and will be advanced.

2176
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:56,090
Well, something that would be uniquely available on

2177
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,930
every device where a new function could be

2178
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:03,610
displayed in real time.

2179
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,610
The Jesus app.

2180
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,430
Yeah, I don't even like this.

2181
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,790
I don't even like to use that word.

2182
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,170
The J-E-S-U-S app.

2183
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:12,730
He's coming.

2184
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:13,770
Yeah, you know.

2185
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,010
For the, you know, just like I said,

2186
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,230
if you if you lose some of the

2187
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,990
morality, take advantage of these idiots, right?

2188
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,030
You know, they're stupid, right?

2189
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:23,810
They're really dumb.

2190
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,090
You know, somebody wants to say, I don't

2191
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:25,710
know what to do.

2192
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,050
I could invest a little bit to start

2193
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:30,410
a church, start a church, and I'll get

2194
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,310
an earpiece and any question they answer you,

2195
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:32,870
I'll just have it.

2196
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,830
I'll just answer it.

2197
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:34,490
Right.

2198
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,210
You know, there's this I assure you, there's

2199
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,030
no question these any of these Christians could

2200
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,650
ask that could stump anyone that studied even

2201
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,450
just a little bit.

2202
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:45,050
And it's not like you're harming them because

2203
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:45,770
they're suckers.

2204
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,550
If you don't take their money, somebody else

2205
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:47,790
will.

2206
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,830
They're going to lose their money.

2207
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,410
In other words, they're going to lose their

2208
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,950
time, money and effort and where they're focusing

2209
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,070
their energy anyway.

2210
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:55,470
You see?

2211
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,930
Right.

2212
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,910
So might as well be you.

2213
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,370
You're just saying, you know, you want to

2214
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,230
you don't know what to do.

2215
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:02,330
You want to invest in something that's lucrative.

2216
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:03,130
Open a church.

2217
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,190
You'll be the only one that could answer

2218
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:08,270
all questions directly from any Christian, period, even

2219
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,910
the pope, even if you had the pope

2220
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:12,230
sitting there and all the cardinals and all

2221
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,730
the more, you know, high clergy, you would

2222
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,250
answer all their questions in a second.

2223
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:17,630
Just give you an earpiece.

2224
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,670
And as soon as the question is asked,

2225
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,010
I'll give you the answer right away.

2226
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,450
Not because I'm smart, because I'm just not

2227
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:23,110
that stupid.

2228
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:24,450
You see?

2229
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:28,850
But you see, that's they're like the sucker.

2230
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:30,910
You know, if you work, you know, been

2231
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:33,110
around mob and they and they mug someone,

2232
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,510
they're like, be glad as it was us.

2233
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:35,710
You know, you were going to get mugged

2234
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,130
anyway.

2235
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,970
Right.

2236
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,390
You know, you were going to get burglarized

2237
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,810
anyway.

2238
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:39,330
Right.

2239
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,870
Look at you.

2240
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:40,490
Pathetic.

2241
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:44,310
So here I give you a story.

2242
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:48,550
I know an old guy and he told

2243
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,350
me that his mom did he didn't get

2244
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,570
any inheritance whatsoever because she left it to

2245
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:53,910
this little church in Texas.

2246
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,770
And he felt bad about that.

2247
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,110
Well, I was in his car one day.

2248
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,070
He's like, I go to the mail and

2249
01:17:59,070 --> 01:17:59,770
guess what he was doing.

2250
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:02,310
He was giving a donation to that same

2251
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,610
church that got his whole inheritance.

2252
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:04,950
Oh, my goodness.

2253
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,090
This is how brainwashed.

2254
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,470
This is how screwed up they are.

2255
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:09,850
Oh, yeah.

2256
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,510
I mean, you can't like at that point,

2257
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:14,950
you're like, wow, there's no intelligent life and

2258
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,010
there's no morality in these people at all

2259
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,930
whatsoever, lawfulness or anything.

2260
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,330
I mean, it's just too far gone.

2261
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,970
And I had one more on one say,

2262
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,910
well, we do charity.

2263
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,750
I'm like, well, don't you think the Canaanites

2264
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,170
who ate who ate their children, dogs and

2265
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,250
pigs on a regular basis had charity?

2266
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,090
Of course they did.

2267
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,910
It's in their records.

2268
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:36,480
You know what I mean?

2269
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,680
You know, the Canaanites, you know, when in

2270
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,720
the Levant, when they do archaeological digs, you

2271
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,200
know how they say this was a Canaanite

2272
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,020
or a Philistine city because they find dog

2273
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,040
bones and pig bones and children's bones where,

2274
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,320
you know, the food would be thrown away,

2275
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:51,500
you know, the waste from the food.

2276
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,040
Sure.

2277
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:53,520
Yeah.

2278
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,060
They said, well, this can't be an Israelite

2279
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,240
one.

2280
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,880
This was I mean, later on, Israel participated

2281
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,040
in that kind of stuff.

2282
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,840
Do you get my point?

2283
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:03,080
Yeah, I do.

2284
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,340
So so when you read of how ghastly

2285
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,940
that is, I saw what this guy was

2286
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,620
doing was just as ghastly to me from

2287
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,380
a moral point of view, you know, and

2288
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,000
it's not like he was giving to some

2289
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,420
temple.

2290
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,600
These guys in this little church in Texas

2291
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,520
are all a bunch of liars.

2292
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:16,240
I don't have to go.

2293
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,800
I mean, I know they're because they're, you

2294
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,000
know, lying.

2295
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,840
So all of them are.

2296
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,780
How do I know they're lying?

2297
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,840
Because they're still in business.

2298
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,880
If they stop lying, no one will go

2299
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,120
there.

2300
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,400
It's very simple.

2301
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:30,800
Accommodations.

2302
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,200
It's like saying when is two plus two,

2303
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:33,900
not four.

2304
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,640
You could say two plus two is one.

2305
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,860
Like, you know, you take two pieces of

2306
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,620
butter and two pieces of butter and mash

2307
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,080
them together.

2308
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,500
Now it's one big piece of butter.

2309
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:43,880
Right.

2310
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,840
But other than that.

2311
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,040
Yeah, it's really, really I mean, the stuff

2312
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,740
that I've seen, I mean, I don't even

2313
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,580
very often I have thoughts like that pop

2314
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,740
in the head when I'm doing a sonic.

2315
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,700
I'm like, yeah, fuck it.

2316
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,780
I'll just share it with everybody.

2317
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,760
You know, so screwed up.

2318
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,960
They're so screwed up anyway.

2319
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,300
And from all sides, you know, it doesn't

2320
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:00,580
matter.

2321
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:01,580
Just throw it in the mix.

2322
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,020
So soup salad, like they say in the

2323
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,600
military, I'm a soup sandwich.

2324
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:06,500
Yeah.

2325
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,000
You know, you try to make right.

2326
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,520
As I say, in the army years ago,

2327
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,780
you just made a soup sandwich.

2328
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,160
Right.

2329
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,380
So that don't mean dunking your bread in

2330
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,020
the soup either.

2331
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:16,860
I'm pouring.

2332
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,980
They'll give the illustration.

2333
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,700
You're pouring a bowl of soup over two

2334
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,300
slices of bread and expecting it to hold

2335
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:21,640
together.

2336
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,560
So, yeah.

2337
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:25,920
Right.

2338
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,760
OK, so.

2339
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,000
So those were the emails.

2340
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,180
Basically, the dreams be easy.

2341
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,000
Just let them know that, you know, attorneys,

2342
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,440
lawyers, why do you need them?

2343
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,740
That's a that's like saying, why don't why

2344
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,660
shouldn't I go to church?

2345
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,600
They talk about God.

2346
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,540
You know, I mean, there's so many levels

2347
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,400
to all of that.

2348
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,020
And then lawful finances just basically are you

2349
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,020
unconditionally endorsing it?

2350
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,540
You know, conditional endorsement always on everything.

2351
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,520
And remember, whenever you sign anything electronic that's

2352
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,700
being harvested and used, I'm not saying every

2353
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,780
time, but you it's kind of like, you

2354
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,240
know, going to a bike.

2355
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:11,860
When you sign a electronic pad unconditionally, it's

2356
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,340
like having a 18 year old blonde take

2357
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,460
all her clothes off and walk into a

2358
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,660
biker's bar and think she's going to be

2359
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:19,960
OK.

2360
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,800
I know it's kind of a stereotypical scene,

2361
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,800
but I don't know what else.

2362
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,440
I don't want to get into racist scenes

2363
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,360
or too many of those.

2364
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,580
Yeah, there is.

2365
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,740
But you see, man, 18 year old blonde

2366
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,260
girl voluptuous walking naked into a biker's bar

2367
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,460
and she'll be fine.

2368
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,480
That's what happens every time you sign the

2369
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,720
name on either a government corporate hardware store

2370
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,720
bank on a pad.

2371
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:43,270
Right.

2372
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,290
So this is planet Earth, you know, and

2373
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,250
most people don't care.

2374
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:51,050
I mean, there's only maybe a handful of

2375
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:53,650
people on the planet that can even understand

2376
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:57,610
what I'm saying here or comprehend or find

2377
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,370
it, you know, cognitively acceptable.

2378
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,550
Like I remember the last time I was

2379
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,090
on with Ochoa, I was like, what is

2380
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:04,550
he say?

2381
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:09,470
Things I don't understand why it's the Greek.

2382
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:12,470
He keeps saying things that I don't understand.

2383
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:13,970
Right.

2384
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,330
So, you know.

2385
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:16,610
Mm hmm.

2386
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:19,540
All right.

2387
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,040
And again, with the job thing, it depends,

2388
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,520
you know, how you view humanity.

2389
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,020
Personally, I would say be compassionate, be helpful.

2390
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,920
If you don't be an attorney, be a

2391
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,760
doctor, be a priest.

2392
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,240
Who cares?

2393
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,440
But just, you know, you remember if you're

2394
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,060
the worst one of those is a priest,

2395
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,560
minister, pastor, you know, cardinal, imam, rabbi, any

2396
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,200
religious guru, because now you're you're using the

2397
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,220
gods, you're misrepresenting the gods.

2398
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,560
And how do I know you're misrepresenting?

2399
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:46,960
Yeah.

2400
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,580
Yeah.

2401
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,740
If you're misrepresenting the financial, that's the worst,

2402
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,880
absolute worst.

2403
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,300
And most people don't know that.

2404
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,220
And they will later.

2405
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,180
You know, someone said, well, you know, my

2406
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,600
granddad passed away.

2407
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,380
He was a pastor.

2408
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,280
I'm like, oh, shit.

2409
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,800
Oh, that's really bad.

2410
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,640
That's really bad.

2411
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:04,580
Yeah.

2412
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:05,640
Yeah.

2413
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,240
What was it?

2414
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:06,700
Serial.

2415
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,460
Serial killer is going to have it easier.

2416
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:09,920
Mm hmm.

2417
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,280
Charles Manson will have it better.

2418
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,280
Anyway, because Charles Manson never, you know, unless

2419
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,740
he did, knowing the way things are, Charles

2420
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,200
Manson, I think, was part of the process

2421
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:20,980
church anyway.

2422
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,100
So process church of the final judgment, which

2423
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,220
they run, they run a lot of stuff

2424
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,840
with people in the Mormons, Coca-Cola, and

2425
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,780
they used to, you know, all this stuff,

2426
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:35,160
the Mormons, you know, all these Scientologists, you

2427
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,440
know, subsects, these are all spiritual manipulations.

2428
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,680
And here's the easiest part.

2429
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,220
There's an old maxim that, you know, whose

2430
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,500
law, whose will you do is your father

2431
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,140
and you're their son or daughter spiritually.

2432
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,980
The majority of humans, if you could say

2433
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,140
safely, all humans are Satan's children because they're

2434
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,780
doing the adversary's will.

2435
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:56,500
Right.

2436
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,840
So how do you reckon with that?

2437
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:01,740
That's a very, if you had to say

2438
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:05,160
a spiritually poignant thing about this planet, that

2439
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,960
would be this is the planet where Satan's

2440
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,020
children, you know, his daughters and his sons

2441
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:09,440
live.

2442
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,360
How do I know that?

2443
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,300
It's very simple.

2444
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,140
Just research it a little bit.

2445
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:15,540
Yeah.

2446
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,460
And they don't even know.

2447
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,080
It doesn't matter if they know, don't know,

2448
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,600
you run a red light, oh, you get

2449
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,560
pulled over, let's say, well, officer, I don't

2450
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,060
know, that wasn't red, it was amber, you

2451
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:26,940
know, you gonna argue it?

2452
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,660
You know, no, you did it.

2453
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:34,760
So but the worst, absolute worst profession is

2454
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,460
the is the is the working in the

2455
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,800
religious fields, by far.

2456
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,080
It's not because I say so, it's because

2457
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,920
the gods say so.

2458
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,320
And those are the ones you're gonna have

2459
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,160
to contend with later, or the ones that

2460
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,700
you see as being the most favored.

2461
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,560
Now, on a descending order, you know, would

2462
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,240
be the worst.

2463
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:52,720
Yeah.

2464
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,440
So again, very simple.

2465
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,960
I think, like I say, if half the

2466
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,520
people in the world, each helped one person

2467
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,080
that would take care of everyone.

2468
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:02,820
It's very simple.

2469
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,500
You know, so I would be more into

2470
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,820
helping out and leaving people better off than

2471
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,760
you found them every time, whether it's a

2472
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,600
short time, or a long time.

2473
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:17,800
Yeah.

2474
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,100
Even I remember traveling, doing things cross country,

2475
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,340
when I have to stay someone's house that

2476
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,720
a leaky faucet, I fixed it.

2477
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:26,260
If the door wasn't closing, I rehung it,

2478
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,880
you know, or if the car wasn't working,

2479
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,720
I fixed it, you know, always didn't have

2480
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,660
to, you know?

2481
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,260
No.

2482
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,120
So just the nature.

2483
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:36,540
Yeah.

2484
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,340
Yeah.

2485
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,160
But either way, I would just the only

2486
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,520
thing I would again advise against is, don't

2487
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,320
call yourself a priest, a minister, pastor, imam,

2488
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:50,000
guru, rabbi, any of those things.

2489
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:53,080
I would avoid that, like the clap, if

2490
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,560
you're old enough to remember what that is.

2491
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,880
There are people that are proud of that,

2492
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,600
and people feel that that's a good thing.

2493
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,260
Yeah, that shows you how far gone they

2494
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,640
are, how far removed they are from any

2495
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,120
reality.

2496
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:16,340
But they don't know anything, and generally, anything

2497
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,240
about the money system, how the body works,

2498
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,260
about history, time, any of the ancient writs,

2499
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,840
any law, anything, nothing at all.

2500
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,120
No one does.

2501
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,620
And if you do meet someone who does,

2502
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,380
it's very, it's so rare that it's like,

2503
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,120
why don't you get a metal detector, go

2504
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,260
out your front yard right now, you're gonna

2505
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,420
find a big nugget of gold.

2506
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:39,060
Nah, it's not gonna happen, unless you're living

2507
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,700
near an alluvial flow, where there used to

2508
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,320
be an ancient river somewhere near Georgia, or

2509
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,500
Colorado, or Arizona.

2510
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,300
Even then, you're not gonna, it's not gonna,

2511
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:46,740
you know.

2512
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,360
That's planet Earth, folks.

2513
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,120
Sorry to break the news to you, if

2514
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,820
you've never heard this kind of stuff before.

2515
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,840
I'm sorry for myself more than for you

2516
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,720
guys, really.

2517
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,580
But yeah, there's nothing, and yeah, there's no

2518
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:08,480
reason to be pitiful, and you know, whatever.

2519
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,020
It's a battle, and I think how are

2520
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,300
you going to have peace on Earth, when

2521
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,400
there's no peace in Heaven?

2522
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,800
They're telling you there's a war in Heaven,

2523
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,200
so.

2524
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

2525
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,500
And we're caught in the middle of it.

2526
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,460
There you go.

2527
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,660
So, okay, those were just the emails.

2528
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,340
If there's anything else, I mean, I think

2529
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,640
we'll just wrap this one up.

2530
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,520
It was just addressing certain things that have

2531
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,180
come up, and keep coming up, and people

2532
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:37,860
keep asking.

2533
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,060
I think just focusing on one side of

2534
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,500
each question, and addressing it, versus, you know,

2535
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:47,300
including these answers over a vast plethora of

2536
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,140
hundreds of hours.

2537
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,180
Either way, they'll, you know, people will get

2538
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:51,520
it.

2539
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,920
Well, as always, thank you for sharing.

2540
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,400
That was most insightful.

2541
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,800
We had eight people listening out there, so

2542
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,060
they got to participate, and listen to all

2543
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:07,500
the thoughts.

2544
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:11,320
Twice as many as normally get it.

2545
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,900
Yeah, that's not bad, okay.

2546
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,860
Usually three or four people get it.

2547
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,180
And I'm not joking around, by the way,

2548
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,220
with the three or four.

2549
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,500
There's only three or four people that ever

2550
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,560
heard Greek speak, that can do anything with

2551
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,500
it, or comprehend it.

2552
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,020
Maybe five.

2553
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,080
I'd say maximum 10 for a few minutes,

2554
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,360
probably, and then it kind of fades out.

2555
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,240
You know, the amnesia and schizophrenia kicks in,

2556
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,480
you know.

2557
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,540
So, okay, it doesn't mean you shouldn't do

2558
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,120
it, because years ago I said if it

2559
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,120
helps one person, that's worth doing.

2560
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,320
Exactly.

2561
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,420
I think it has helped more than one,

2562
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,660
like I said, two, three, or four.

2563
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,940
Mm-hmm.

2564
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:54,560
Great.

2565
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,120
Thanks, Bruce, and we'll do it again soon.

2566
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,220
Well, thank you, sir, and you have yourself

2567
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,060
a great night now.

2568
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,380
You too.

2569
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:00,840
Take care.

2570
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,700
Okay, bye-bye.

2571
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,160
Bye.
