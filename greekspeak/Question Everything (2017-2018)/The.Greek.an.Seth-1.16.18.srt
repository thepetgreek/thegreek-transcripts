1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:10,170
Here we go, I'm going to pop us

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,230
on in right now.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,090
We had a little bit of that they're

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,030
going Hello folks and we're online with Greek.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,270
Good evening, everyone.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,730
Yeah, greetings.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,250
We might have some interruptions, so I might

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,110
if I do I'll just let you know

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,390
I'll be right back so at least for

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,450
the next hour I'm not sure.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,110
So, yeah, okay, well Sam's off tonight and

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,790
we're going to be doing a little bit

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,250
of a sonic semi solo because Bruce you're

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,870
just the producer right just the producer right

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,290
well I'm not a producer who doesn't mind

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,890
chiming in once in a great while.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,110
Silly as that would be.

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,750
Yeah yeah yeah no so what I'm saying

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,590
is, you shouldn't have to do everything so

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,170
I don't mind.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,270
I don't mind.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,790
That's good.

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,450
All good.

24
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,230
All good.

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,770
Why don't we.

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,310
Any questions anybody got anything to ask and

27
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,850
chat before I came out I'm outside right

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,310
now.

29
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,130
Greetings folk I'm currently in Tunisia.

30
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,270
Something about the moon.

31
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,150
Does Greek still suspect the 13th moon or

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,670
month, and interested in intercalation.

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,890
Yeah, it's possible, it looks that way only

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,610
because the moon has not been showing up

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,430
as it normally does it shows up more

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,270
now as it would when you're going to

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,170
have a 13th moon.

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,410
Now I've been kind of absent minded about

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,810
statements I've made about when the last one

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,310
was apparently it was last year, and then

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,190
it was not the one before but the

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,310
one before last.

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,590
So to have.

44
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,290
It doesn't say anywhere that there can't be

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,910
an ancient records two in a row.

46
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,910
I've never seen two in a row.

47
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,530
You know that that's 13 month moons.

48
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,070
So we'll just have to wait and see.

49
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,550
I remember.

50
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,070
Fortunately when I started getting into this around,

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,490
oh 203 or 405 that was pretty steady.

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,310
In terms of the way we're very predictable

53
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,610
and then things started getting a little shaky,

54
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,490
and then they stable stabilize and they got

55
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,170
really shaky.

56
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,070
Again, and now they're sort of stable.

57
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,730
In terms of the way appearances are what

58
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,690
I mean by that is if you photographed,

59
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,930
let's say, or recorded what the fourth moon

60
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,350
of a certain year was.

61
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,110
It's generally the, you know, the same just

62
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,630
like the pagans do they say they have

63
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,290
a wolf moon or a harvest moon or

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,010
whatever moon, you know the hunters moon you

65
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,530
know they have names for the.

66
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,970
It's by the way they appear, you know,

67
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,970
they don't know they don't know what they're

68
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,550
doing but they do have enough.

69
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,610
Let's say discernment to know that this looks

70
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,010
like this type of moon they don't know

71
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,970
what to do with it anymore.

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,710
So, yeah, so it's kind of something that's

73
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,550
basically, no matter what you think or do,

74
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,590
it's going to be observational anyway.

75
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,510
So we'll see.

76
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,670
Based on when the time comes.

77
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,870
So, still there Bruce?

78
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,430
Yes.

79
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,090
Now the the moon right now lined up

80
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,590
very neatly with the Sabbath.

81
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,530
Very neatly in the middle of the month.

82
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,670
So, I've got about the 16th day of

83
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,430
the 11th month.

84
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,350
Now is that still lining up with the

85
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,610
Sabbath.

86
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,650
Well, yeah, it always does.

87
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,090
Okay.

88
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,570
Because at one time, what was it last

89
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,350
Sabbath or maybe the one before was a

90
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,730
little off you mentioned and I thought so

91
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,210
also.

92
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,210
Well, it tightens up towards the end or

93
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,990
the beginning and or the middle.

94
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,770
Yeah.

95
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,890
But I haven't noticed, sometimes it would be

96
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,430
a day or two off a few years

97
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,130
ago and it's tightened up again, which is

98
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,930
to be expected.

99
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,750
By the way, this is a, it's been

100
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,790
written about the moon will, these astronomical bodies

101
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,170
are going to err in their ways.

102
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,310
Right.

103
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:13,950
Right.

104
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,089
Okay.

105
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,230
Yeah.

106
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,710
But overall, in terms of astronomical timekeeping, just

107
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,930
in a nutshell, the, the, well, let's just

108
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,350
call them the scientists and the astronomical community

109
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,590
does acknowledge astronomical time, where the day starts

110
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,770
at solar noon and the moon rules the

111
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,070
month.

112
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,170
But they don't know how to measure the

113
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,210
moon, because they're schizophrenic, meaning.

114
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,230
If you look at academic circles, they tell

115
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,830
you solar noon is when the day starts,

116
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,850
but when they start reckoning moon measurements, they

117
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,590
reckon it with, with civil midnight with the

118
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,950
clock.

119
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,970
That's why if you look up, still the

120
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,790
majority of people on the planet, when you

121
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,110
told them a lunar month, tell them a

122
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,730
lunar month, they think it's 28 days.

123
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,270
Or 28 and a half or 29 or

124
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,330
something, because it's 28.874, whatever.

125
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:04,990
Yeah.

126
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,290
You know, they, because they're schizophrenic.

127
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,990
It's very simple.

128
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,930
It's like, which, which one of them are

129
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,750
you talking to?

130
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,370
You know, which personality are you talking to

131
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,090
when you bring up a thing, you know,

132
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,050
like, bring up the sun and bring up

133
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,230
that thing, you know, so yeah.

134
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,370
For scientific and astronomical purposes, solar noon and

135
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,090
you bring up the month.

136
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,750
Yeah, that's the moon.

137
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,230
But the moon only got 28 days.

138
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,630
Well, how you just finished saying the day

139
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,270
starts at noon.

140
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,730
How can you have 28 days if, oh,

141
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,830
because you see, we measure the day with

142
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,050
midnight.

143
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,290
You just finished telling me.

144
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,690
You see my point?

145
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,810
They're completely.

146
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,070
Yeah.

147
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,950
So the purpose of these psychologists and psychiatrists

148
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,190
is to make sure you're crazy.

149
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,910
Right.

150
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,390
Right.

151
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,350
Keep you on your toes.

152
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,090
Yeah.

153
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,030
So it's just a pretty bizarre situation, a

154
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,870
bizarro world.

155
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,230
Anyone old enough to remember bizarro world, the

156
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,970
Marvel comics?

157
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,850
Oh, yeah.

158
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,370
Everything was backwards.

159
00:05:59,710 --> 00:05:59,810
Yeah.

160
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,810
Mm-hmm.

161
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,880
That was very pathetic.

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,180
Is there a technical term for when the

163
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,780
moon is at its peak?

164
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,160
Epigee, I think, or it's at zenith.

165
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,800
Yeah, zenith sounds correct.

166
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,680
At peak, well, its peak is only.

167
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
Well, that could be taken a few ways,

168
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,360
yeah.

169
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,460
Yeah, nothing exists as it is or appears

170
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
if you're off the earth.

171
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,860
That's a very simple and true statement.

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,520
Okay.

173
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,140
So all of this has to do with

174
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,340
this terrarium that you're on, that the gods

175
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,940
have set up, known as the planet.

176
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,340
Speaking of which, with the terrarium, I posted

177
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,260
that in the uploads about the 40 years

178
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,680
with that one fella from England.

179
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, yeah.

180
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,020
Good.

181
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,020
Fascinating fella.

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,800
I've personally seen them back east back in

183
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
the day, some really large ones as well,

184
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
bigger than his.

185
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,600
Bigger than his, yeah.

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,880
Not necessarily in a leader gen, that type

187
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,420
of vessel.

188
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,300
It was more like an aquarium type deal.

189
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,300
Oh, my goodness.

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,620
And they were about, I would say, almost

191
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,200
as old.

192
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,920
And I was not as familiar with the

193
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,980
importance of a completely sealed system relative to

194
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,820
what we're being taught generally, you know.

195
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,260
Right, right.

196
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,200
Yeah, that, you know, something like that.

197
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,720
Now, here's the thing.

198
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,980
If you piece together the science that they

199
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,540
use regarding how that works, like this produces

200
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,320
acid, that produces this gas, it's not true.

201
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,140
There's more to it that they cannot acknowledge.

202
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,240
Like, for example, with water, I think we

203
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,960
had Ocelli on and actually went into his

204
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,220
chat just to see what was going on.

205
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll admit that shamelessly.

206
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,860
And what was interesting is from all the

207
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,480
years of experience I had working with water

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,420
people in the industry, and not just the

209
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,180
regular schmoes at the whatever.

210
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,920
I'm talking about the people that design this

211
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,220
stuff and, you know, the top of the

212
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,760
water industry in the world.

213
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,800
And I've only had one or two people

214
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,760
not even admit, but they acknowledged that when

215
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
they put chemicals in water to get rid

216
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,660
of pathogens, right, it's to get rid of

217
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,600
known pathogens.

218
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,539
You know, your biggest waterborne ones are the

219
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,039
Giardia that they go after because that's the

220
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,440
smallest.

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,520
The eggs are like, you know, you need

222
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
less than one micron, but mechanically.

223
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,500
And then other things.

224
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,760
And they all admit, by the way, there's

225
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
no such thing as a virus, by the

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
way, once you push them to it.

227
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,160
You know, once they say they get rid

228
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,500
of viruses, they'll admit that no one knows

229
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,960
what it is.

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I say, of course, you're not supposed to

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
know because once you find it's fiction.

232
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,520
But anyway, I even have people, you know,

233
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,940
surgeons admit that this whole thing is something

234
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
wrong with it.

235
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,760
But essentially, when they put chemicals in water

236
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,220
to eliminate or eradicate certain pathogens, what they

237
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,860
do not want to acknowledge, secretly and openly,

238
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,600
believe it or not, is that these chemicals

239
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,000
like chlorine and things similar to that, chloramines,

240
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,060
which is ammonia also, to eradicate these pathogens,

241
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,160
they eradicate the targeted pathogens, but give rise

242
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,940
to a new set of pathogens that would

243
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,520
have not have been in the water without

244
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
those chemicals.

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,180
I know it sounds kind of sci-fi.

246
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,680
It sounds like a sci-fi thing.

247
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,860
But it would make sense.

248
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,640
In private conversations, I do get into more

249
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,220
detail on my experiences with water projects.

250
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,400
And the reason I don't do it publicly

251
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,100
is I'd say 75 or 90 percent of

252
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,140
them were based on NDA type stuff, nondisclosure.

253
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,020
Right.

254
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,840
And usually when I stop working with someone,

255
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,460
I return everything to them.

256
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,380
So later on, they can't say, well, you

257
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,080
know, you had, you know, this stuff or

258
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
whatever, you know, even if it's trivial.

259
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,420
Just like I have no Skype recording equipment

260
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,000
or anything to record anyone.

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,540
Oh, right.

262
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,460
You're preserving your integrity as well as theirs.

263
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,940
Well, they have very little, believe it or

264
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,200
not.

265
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,680
Technically.

266
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,800
So, yeah.

267
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,080
They cannot acknowledge it, secretly or openly or

268
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,560
publicly, professionally or personally, because they're sick.

269
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,660
Generally, humans are in a sick condition right

270
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,860
now.

271
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,100
Yeah.

272
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,520
So when I say sick, I don't mean

273
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,560
sicker than anyone else, just the general condition.

274
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,400
Yeah, so the thing is, you know, water

275
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,880
is wet and that's about as much as

276
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,140
you're going to get out of these idiots.

277
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,880
And I'm not speaking now of, you know,

278
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
high school science teachers.

279
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,380
I'm talking about the head of the top

280
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,780
field researchers in the world.

281
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
Yeah, they're in very bad shape.

282
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,220
And where does that leave the common pedestrian

283
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,880
plebeian?

284
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,780
Actually, the world is wide open.

285
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,160
I've always said that the world for, meaning

286
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,060
the aspect of living here, the aspect of

287
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,720
learning and doing research, really good research that

288
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,300
is effective, is wide open.

289
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,840
It's completely wide open.

290
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,100
Most people tend to focus on their job

291
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,220
or their job or whatever.

292
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,800
And they trust in any field other than

293
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
what they're exposed to.

294
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,180
And even the ones they're exposed to, they

295
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,040
know very little about.

296
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,820
Others to tell them what's going on.

297
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,560
And I'm telling you, they're not giving you,

298
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,840
you know, what's true and correct in its

299
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,040
totality, or at least impartial.

300
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,940
Very little of it is true and correct.

301
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,820
That's why I say that the world of

302
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,600
discovery in terms of what's going on in

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,260
any field is wide open.

304
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,780
And I've always been saying this.

305
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,940
It doesn't matter how many reams of paper

306
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,920
you see in research documents or whatever.

307
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,720
You know, every field is still wide open.

308
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,120
And the main ones would be, you know,

309
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,960
water, weather, energy, food.

310
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,860
You know, all that stuff is completely wide

311
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,120
open.

312
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,920
There isn't, the level of research, you know,

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,660
even aerospace.

314
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,160
These jokers, man, they're still packing metal tubes

315
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,040
with high speed chemistry to send them up

316
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,700
into the sky.

317
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,140
We'll get into the future as an experiment.

318
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,900
There's nothing on the internet, as far as

319
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,560
I know, demonstrating what they call anti-gravity,

320
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
even though it's not really gravity.

321
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,360
That we call, you know, no one can

322
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
explain gravity, and I'm going to show you

323
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,580
what it is.

324
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,280
What you do, basically, is you take, let's

325
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,880
say, two objects, and you weigh them separately

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,460
on a good scale that goes down to

327
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,820
a tenth of an ounce or a tenth

328
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,300
of a gram.

329
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,860
It should be, because it doesn't even have

330
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,340
to be that.

331
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,400
It could just be even any scale, really.

332
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,140
That's a good quality scale.

333
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,780
So, you take two objects, and you weigh

334
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,460
them separately, but when you put them together,

335
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,500
they're ten to twenty percent lighter, less in

336
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,840
weight.

337
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,240
Right?

338
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,290
And it's not a trick.

339
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,270
It's not, and these are metals.

340
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,510
Right.

341
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,950
Yeah, and you can see the levitation.

342
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,310
You can see it's going opposite the direction

343
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,550
of gravity.

344
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,650
Or it's still moving towards gravity, but very,

345
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,770
very slowly.

346
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,470
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,170
I mean, and some people say, well, that's

348
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,030
Lorentz's law.

349
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,730
No, it's not.

350
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,870
You know, the right hand rule.

351
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,090
Right, right.

352
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,350
That's not what's going on.

353
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,970
So, when you understand that gravity is a

354
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,690
push force, not a pull force, everything is

355
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,270
pushing against something else, right?

356
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,550
Even when you have a vacuum and you

357
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,330
have the illusion of it sucking, you're like,

358
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,810
well, it's a vacuum, so it's sucking.

359
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,930
Yeah, but really what's happening, the dynamic is

360
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,970
that the side that has more pressure is

361
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,850
pushing into the side that has less pressure.

362
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,870
So, once you understand that all materials are

363
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,030
unequal, right?

364
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,770
Like, for example, some iron filings are unequal

365
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,850
in property and weight to sawdust, even though

366
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,190
they look very similar granularly, right?

367
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,010
And even if you stain the wood to

368
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,790
be dark, you would see that if you

369
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,910
spun them in a centrifuge, the iron filings

370
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,830
will end up shooting to the peripheral perimeter

371
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,470
faster than the sawdust, right?

372
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,130
Right, right.

373
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,750
Okay.

374
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,950
So, when you design aircraft, what they want

375
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,050
is they're looking for thrust or rockets, right?

376
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,410
So, why are you brute force creating the

377
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,270
thrust through three or four stages of either

378
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,130
combustion or chemical reaction to ultimately get that

379
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,550
thrust?

380
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,790
Why don't you just rotate the ambient air

381
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,830
to a speed?

382
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,550
It doesn't matter what you use to rotate

383
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,930
it with.

384
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,070
So, you can have a low, you know,

385
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,150
the Tesla pumps, the flat discs that have

386
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,030
no distance to a medium.

387
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:22,970
Okay.

388
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,410
Why don't you take the air itself and

389
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,150
centrifuge it and you look at all the

390
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,650
various gases in the air.

391
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,070
They have different molecular weights, let's say, right?

392
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,550
Ranging from one to 17.

393
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,550
So, you have a gas and you have

394
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,150
another gas on the other end that's 17

395
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,850
times heavier, which is a good ratio, like

396
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,590
even cars, right?

397
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,510
Anyway, so cars use ratios like that, one

398
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,670
to 14.7, right?

399
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,310
So, when you centrifuge the air, what will

400
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,670
happen, the heavier gases will reach the periphery

401
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,870
of the device first.

402
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,170
But once they release and mix into the

403
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,090
atmosphere again, they're going to aggregate how they

404
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,450
were with polarity and other things, how they

405
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,510
are normally in the air, which is not

406
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,290
spaced apart but spaced evenly.

407
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,010
At that point, at that point, from centrifuge

408
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,390
to reaching, to going back to being in

409
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,190
equilibrium, there is a tremendous shockwave that's released.

410
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,150
That is the same thing that happens when

411
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:37,130
you have something designed to be called a

412
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,310
thrust generator.

413
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,450
When you design aircraft or rockets, they're looking

414
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,490
for thrust, right?

415
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,390
Right.

416
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,840
Where cars, they talk about horsepower and torque.

417
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,780
Correct.

418
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,800
So, there's your thrust element.

419
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,020
So, I sat down with some engineers a

420
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,620
while back and explained this.

421
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,860
I was fortunate enough to have doors open

422
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,300
so I can get to some people that

423
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,099
really were researching this very quickly.

424
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,520
And they said, well, I can't see why

425
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,440
that won't work, but we're not going to

426
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,339
do it because it runs totally silent.

427
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,089
Okay.

428
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,569
In other words, they have to have noise.

429
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,650
So, and then another guy, I told this

430
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,030
story a while back, a couple of years

431
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,849
ago, who is a patent engineer, a patent

432
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,210
reviewer, used to work for the Patent Office,

433
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,290
and an aircraft engineer.

434
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,610
And he says, yeah, there are some treaties,

435
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,930
I don't know if they're in effect, that

436
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,770
certain aircraft have to be noticeable.

437
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,170
And what does that do to the stealth

438
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,730
projects?

439
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,730
So, that's schizophrenia again, right?

440
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,890
Yes, it is.

441
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,070
The other side, they tell you they want

442
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,850
it to be stealth.

443
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,610
But anyway, if anybody knows John Arava, if

444
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,610
you've ever heard of him, there's very little

445
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,390
of him on the internet.

446
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,130
He developed a stealth paint.

447
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,230
You paint anything with it, and it's invisible

448
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,170
to radar.

449
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,790
And the formula is, and I'm not going

450
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,270
to say it.

451
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,850
And what's so cool about this is when

452
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,390
the stealth aircraft came out, he came up

453
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,450
with this in the 60s.

454
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,690
It's a very simple formula.

455
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,470
When he did this, when the Americans came

456
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,750
out with the stealth airplanes in the 90s,

457
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,610
the Israelis says, oh, we did that too.

458
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,190
We got some old F1s and A1s, really

459
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,730
like old 1960s planes.

460
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,650
And they're stealth too, with this paint.

461
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,390
Hmm.

462
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,990
And, well, I can tell you how it's

463
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,250
done.

464
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,310
It's basically a mixture of magnesium oxide, predominantly.

465
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,650
70% magnesium oxide with tantalum and barium

466
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,470
and a form of carbon powder.

467
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,150
And it's not a graphene.

468
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,350
Someone said, is that graphene?

469
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,350
I said, no, it's not graphene, because it

470
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,050
has like a rainbow color to it.

471
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,830
It's not black.

472
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,450
And then you have to put it together

473
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,170
in an attritor, which is, I had someone

474
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,430
look up a sonic attritor recently.

475
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,590
He said, I can't find anything on the

476
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:04,810
internet.

477
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,810
So, yeah, attrition is when you break something

478
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,250
down into a powder or a fine.

479
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,250
And sonic is when you do it using

480
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,670
sound.

481
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,570
So, anyway, there you go.

482
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,650
Oh.

483
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,370
Yeah.

484
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,410
Oh, my.

485
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,210
Okay.

486
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,850
So, I noticed, was it Seth or Dreadshoes

487
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,990
wanted to come?

488
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,230
Oh, this walked into the office there.

489
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,110
So, okay.

490
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,910
Anybody else?

491
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,950
Anything else going on?

492
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,390
Let's see.

493
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,470
I've always got a lot to talk about.

494
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,510
Looking at an engine tech from the German

495
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,410
aircraft research programs in the 20s and 30s.

496
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,310
Wouldn't surprise me.

497
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,850
Yeah, his stuff was actually being used by

498
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,770
the Schustafel.

499
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,830
He was, if you look into the story,

500
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,170
one of my mentors that passed away is

501
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,810
a guy named Joseph Blankenship.

502
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,090
Joe Blankenship.

503
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,950
There's a couple of four-hour videos on

504
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,170
him.

505
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,170
Blankenship with a K or Joe Blankenship.

506
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,550
He's pretty much met or known anyone and

507
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,950
everyone, believe it or not, from Tesla to

508
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,290
Howard Hughes to Victor Schauberger.

509
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,830
When they brought Schauberger over to Texas, he

510
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,370
knew someone and he went out there at

511
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,330
the steel factory where they kept Schauberger for

512
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:17,770
a few months.

513
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,070
And he spent every day of a month

514
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,750
with him, communicating and looking at stuff.

515
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,730
And Schauberger did not speak one word of

516
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:27,950
English.

517
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,730
He refused to.

518
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,690
You know how you spend time in a

519
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,990
country and you want to learn something.

520
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,530
He just said hello and goodbye and that's

521
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:34,650
it.

522
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,410
He had no interest in the English language

523
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:36,950
whatsoever.

524
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,530
So there was that barrier, but there is

525
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,150
no barrier.

526
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,270
When someone opens up a set of blueprints

527
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,770
and rolls them out and you're looking at

528
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,270
them, it doesn't matter what language that is.

529
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,450
You see what you see, you know what

530
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:49,630
I mean?

531
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,590
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,990
So his stuff, but he worked with the

533
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,710
Schustoffel or the SS predominantly.

534
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,430
He gained favor of Schauberger with the SS

535
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,010
by providing them the administrative side with really

536
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,010
good quality water.

537
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,450
He brought some water machines over there.

538
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,390
They drank up real good.

539
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,690
They got high from drinking this spring water,

540
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,650
came out of a ditch, basically processed.

541
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,390
Wow.

542
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,550
Right.

543
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,730
Very interesting, yes.

544
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,610
Oh yeah, there's lots of stuff.

545
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,150
But the thing is, you know, there's a

546
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,470
lot of talk around.

547
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,090
The thing is, can you talk about stuff

548
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,090
people can actually use?

549
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,080
Let's see.

550
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,860
Oh, you know, I could add.

551
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,500
Let's see, I should be able to.

552
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,520
Let's do it this way.

553
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
Let's see if he comes on.

554
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,000
An extra party there, right?

555
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,580
So.

556
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,540
Oh yeah, that's right.

557
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,960
You switch back to the old one.

558
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,340
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,100
Back to the old Skype.

560
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,820
Greetings, Seth, we have Seth.

561
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,160
Salutations.

562
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,340
Greetings, Seth.

563
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,680
Greetings.

564
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,260
I'm not causing an echo, am I?

565
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,940
No, you're very, very, very nice and clear.

566
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,960
And the honor is mine.

567
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,840
Oh, thank you.

568
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,660
Are you spinning metal?

569
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm just out of curiosity right now as

570
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,900
we speak.

571
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,440
Or are you not spinning metal?

572
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,940
I am not spinning metal.

573
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,380
No, I am in the comforts of the

574
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,740
home.

575
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,800
Sure.

576
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm still doing that for the job, as

577
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,140
you say.

578
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,600
But the hours that I do it have

579
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,180
changed.

580
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,860
So my local time that I get off

581
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,760
is 8.30 instead of midnight or 2

582
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,140
in the morning.

583
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,320
Right, right.

584
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,020
Okay, cool.

585
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,160
So you get to act more normal now.

586
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,180
Yeah.

587
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,860
Honestly, it's kind of a pleasant middle ground.

588
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm not and never have been one who

589
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,200
enjoys waking up early, I guess.

590
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,180
It's probably just a personal bias more than

591
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,820
anything else.

592
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,100
It's easier for me to stay awake than

593
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,060
it is to wake up.

594
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,220
Sometimes it's best to never have woken up.

595
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,400
Indeed.

596
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,560
On many levels that goes from just knowing

597
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
what's going on as well.

598
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,960
So anything you want to bring us up

599
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,300
to speed with in terms of stuff we've

600
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,580
spoken about in the past?

601
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,560
We haven't heard from you in a long

602
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,860
time.

603
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,640
Anything come up interesting that you want to

604
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,220
share with everyone?

605
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,100
It's been maybe a year plus, so go

606
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,220
ahead.

607
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,280
Oh, I'd say it's more of the same,

608
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,220
but that wouldn't be accurate.

609
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,440
It's always improving just on the personal level.

610
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:03,180
But beyond that, the world and by that

611
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,760
I mean the society of man is as

612
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,740
skewed as ever.

613
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,180
But it's interesting.

614
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,180
I observed that the date that they go

615
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,340
by has lined up with the moon for

616
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,540
the last few weeks.

617
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,580
I don't know if it's interesting or not,

618
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,140
but I'm always amused to see that.

619
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,920
Yeah, it does so logarithmically.

620
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,780
I've done this by looking at trying to

621
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,360
find the lawful day that people were born.

622
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,360
So sometimes you'll see it's off by a

623
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,920
week or two.

624
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,320
Once it goes past two weeks, then it

625
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,460
gets closer to the front again.

626
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,240
So it's still off by two weeks, right?

627
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,920
And then it tightens up.

628
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,220
I noticed that the logarithmic flux on that

629
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,620
is four to six years.

630
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,500
So every four to six years, it tightens

631
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,800
up real close and almost like spot on,

632
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,400
except for whatever arbitrary number they want to

633
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
put on their calendar, we'll throw it off,

634
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,220
right?

635
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,220
Because the number, yeah.

636
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,640
So yeah, this year it will be, well,

637
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,120
this year, I mean, well, yeah.

638
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,240
Seemingly so far this month, it seems, yeah.

639
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
So it'll be like that for a little

640
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
while, then it'll drift off again by fall.

641
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,620
By fall it'll drift off and then it'll

642
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,880
get really off in about a year or

643
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,400
two or three.

644
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,040
And it'll probably suck itself back in to

645
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,340
being somewhat lawful.

646
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But it never will be lawful the way

647
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,660
they're using it, you see.

648
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,280
Yeah, well, they've changed.

649
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,900
They've arbitrarily changed the times and the days,

650
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,180
right?

651
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,060
And the day into night.

652
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,640
Well, actually, what they've done is, that's an

653
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,340
interesting thing.

654
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,460
We'll get into certain writs in the future.

655
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,520
I think more time needs to be given

656
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,180
just a little bit to see how they

657
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,860
really apply.

658
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,500
But what I've garnered so far from that

659
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,220
is, where man is right now with their

660
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,520
time is that they're completely ignoring the ways

661
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,620
of the gods, completely.

662
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,220
The change in the times is going to

663
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,440
come when they acknowledge the gods again.

664
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,120
And what's unusual is, you know, when you

665
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,880
speak of anything out of scripture, it is

666
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,740
such a strong narrative with a narrow focus.

667
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,880
There's very little peripheral detail when you read

668
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,220
scripture.

669
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,560
And sometimes there is, but usually there isn't.

670
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,580
And what you'll eventually get out of it,

671
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,880
well, I should say what I got out

672
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,620
of it, when they're speaking on things, they're

673
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,740
speaking on things from their perspective, meaning the

674
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,660
gods' perspective.

675
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,700
And that hit me like a ton of

676
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,280
bricks a few years ago when I noticed,

677
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,240
it's like, well, how come there isn't anything

678
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,340
as important as grid living, you know, electrification,

679
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,600
and jet airplanes, and cars, and this crazy

680
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,490
medical system, and all this stuff directly.

681
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,780
How come there's no detail on that?

682
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
And I said, well, how can you just

683
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,060
write something about the future, or an all

684
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,040
-encompassing narrative like the scripture, and omit some

685
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,660
of man's big advancements outright?

686
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,180
And I'm like, oh, it seems like no

687
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,300
matter how advanced humans think they are, or

688
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,560
really do get, there's no mention of it

689
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,020
by the gods, because guess what?

690
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,720
It's not about us.

691
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,840
It's about them.

692
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,240
You see?

693
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,280
So on the peripheral, you read scripture and

694
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,720
you think it's about you, meaning mankind, but

695
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,120
it's not.

696
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,160
It's about them.

697
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,660
Yeah, that sort of seems to be a

698
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,920
relatively common, I don't know, trait among people.

699
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,220
I know I myself have certainly done that,

700
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,120
read passages and thought that it's speaking directly

701
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,380
to me.

702
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,800
And on further inspection, that's relatively absurd, unless

703
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,120
you're reading something that is written to all,

704
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,820
then it's pretty safe to assume that.

705
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,640
Oh, you mean like the ones that they

706
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,900
single out as being quote-unquote special in

707
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,280
a good way?

708
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,520
You mean that way, or just in general

709
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,120
in other ways?

710
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,300
There's not a whole lot of singling out

711
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,980
that seems to be good.

712
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,620
Yeah, I know, I said that sarcastically.

713
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,800
They don't speak good about anyone in there.

714
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,000
And even when people are held in high

715
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,260
regard, it's because they're being used to do

716
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,120
something for the rest of humanity and themselves,

717
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,480
you know?

718
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,460
Right.

719
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So, still not wanting to get into specifics

720
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,600
publicly, it seems, I know things are not

721
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,920
always as they seem, and you know, my

722
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,000
curiosity and what I'm trying to attain as

723
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,160
far as information goes, all kind of ties

724
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,100
into Scripture being the one thing that has

725
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,600
been relatively constant, even through its flaws and

726
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,200
whatnot, or not its flaws, but the flaws

727
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,500
of those involved in disseminating what we have

728
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,560
available to us currently.

729
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,260
Right, that's on many levels.

730
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,140
Yeah.

731
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,040
We don't have any New Testament writ, you

732
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,960
know, anything that we could say has fingerprints

733
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,520
on it.

734
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,380
We have Greek, and that's why I rarely

735
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,080
discuss the New Testament, because you're just going

736
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,380
to get a couple of books, probably the

737
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,560
closest you can get is 1st century, really

738
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,760
2nd or 3rd century Aramaic, and that's it.

739
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,360
And the rest you're beholden to whatever they've

740
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,540
put forward after that time.

741
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,020
And as time furthers and goes on and

742
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:05,760
passes, you know, the inconsistencies and errors in

743
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,940
the translations become more obvious.

744
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,150
Well, they're not even really translations.

745
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,020
Well, they were intended to be.

746
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,400
Right.

747
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,540
Well, there's some of it.

748
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,560
There's some of it that has been translated,

749
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,480
but it's even what it's just fraught with

750
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,900
errors.

751
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,580
Now, just to throw something in here, like

752
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,240
I did in the chat a couple of

753
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,380
days ago in a forceful way, is when

754
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,260
anything is brought up in Scripture, I always

755
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,760
suggest, well, it's actually the right thing to

756
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,000
do.

757
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,720
If you know something is erroneous, don't bring

758
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,000
out the erroneous stuff.

759
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,860
Like if you're going to buy a turkey,

760
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,320
you know how white people do at the

761
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
supermarket, you don't bring it home and throw

762
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
the whole thing in the oven.

763
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
You have to take it out of the

764
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,160
plastic first and clean it, marinate it.

765
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,380
If you cook it with the plastic, I've

766
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,940
seen, I've heard stories of people, they go

767
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,220
to what they call the Thursday Thanksgiving celebration,

768
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,900
and in horror, they forgot to take out

769
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,040
the giblets, and it's in the package still

770
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,720
baked, the organ meat's disgusting.

771
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay, that's when people are discussing Scripture, that's

772
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,760
what's going on.

773
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,580
So I found that I've been giving this

774
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,800
advice for over a decade, well, a decade

775
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,580
and a half now.

776
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,220
If you're going to bring up a point

777
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,640
in Scripture, or even consider Scripture at its

778
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,120
whole, then it's very difficult to do this.

779
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,980
But if you're going to bring up a

780
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,240
point, a book, or a verse, or whatever,

781
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,020
and it's something in your mind, and it's

782
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,040
finite, like let's say a particular situation, like,

783
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,940
you know, whatever, let's just say Exodus, you

784
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,920
know, crossing of the Sea of Reeds, or

785
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,060
they call it Ditsy Crossing, right?

786
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,940
Don't start kicking, you know, it doesn't matter

787
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,680
what version, King James, some people say Geneva

788
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,180
Bible was better, I've looked at it, it's

789
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,620
the same crap.

790
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,580
Go into the interlinear and inspect it, and

791
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,620
then your conversation will change greatly, and then

792
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,160
you'll be like, well, let's talk about the

793
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,220
Exodus of the Sea of Reeds.

794
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,400
And when you look at it, and what's

795
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,280
been preserved, you know, before the attempted translation

796
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,420
was made, it really has a very different

797
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,840
story, a very different meaning to what everyone

798
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,860
is pushing around.

799
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,440
And I feel that is, I think it's

800
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,960
the least toxic way, I'm not even going

801
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,860
to say holistic, or healthier, or wholehearted way,

802
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,960
but least toxic way to approach the subject.

803
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,920
So, when you said I don't like to

804
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,800
get earlier into a lot of specifics, I

805
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,700
don't because, well, for several reasons, I know,

806
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,420
number one, we're coming on a time period

807
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,480
where more understanding will come forward, but the

808
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,420
other reason I don't like giving more specifics

809
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,500
is because you have to assess the audience,

810
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,940
you have to assess the society at large,

811
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,900
and then the group that you're speaking to,

812
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,780
and then imagine what the individuals are like,

813
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,200
what level of study they have, let's say,

814
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,760
or whatever.

815
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,940
So, I think it's more, the mindset is

816
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,700
more important, it goes back to the, let's

817
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,020
talk about fishing instead of fish, because once

818
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,980
you become really good at fishing, when we

819
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,840
get to discuss the fish, well, you will

820
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,240
have a whole hell of a lot of

821
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,600
experience with fish by that point, you see.

822
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,340
Right.

823
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,000
But if we talk about fish and you

824
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,900
don't know about fishing, you probably have very

825
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,840
little experience with fish in the wild, unless

826
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,480
you're a scuba diver, or a diver, or

827
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,740
whatever.

828
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,280
So, I would rather talk about how to

829
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,420
get the stuff if that makes any sense.

830
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,060
No, it does, absolutely.

831
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,100
And even before you talk about how to

832
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,140
get the stuff, talking about the condition of

833
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,900
the stuff, so then you have a more

834
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,860
educated and a better way to approach the

835
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,540
stuff, right?

836
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,580
Right.

837
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,280
I've heard it prefaced many times in the

838
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,960
past, where, paraphrasing you, that we're dealing with

839
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,820
incomplete and erroneous translations to the point where

840
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,540
they are versions, and that's why it's stated

841
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,679
as such that they are versions, because we're

842
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,920
not dealing with translations, although the term is

843
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,940
thrown about in academia quite a bit.

844
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,300
But you're also dealing with crazy people.

845
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,920
Now, I keep saying this.

846
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,020
Now, recently I heard a conversation between someone

847
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,639
who's part of this black Israelite thing, which,

848
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,440
by the way, if you want to go

849
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,020
be part of a cult group or something

850
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,420
that makes you feel special, because you know

851
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,320
everything is full of deceit, so these guys

852
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,040
are telling you the truth, show me one

853
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,120
mummy with an afro, and I dare you

854
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,659
to show me one mummy with an afro

855
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,540
and a pic in it, but anyway, I'm

856
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,060
just joking.

857
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,820
So, what I mean is, let's get real,

858
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,400
you know, but I was listening to this

859
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,840
conversation, where this is a typical born-again

860
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,720
Christian moron, and he gave the guy the

861
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,840
floor for like 20 minutes, and he was

862
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,800
like, oh, and he was asking these dumb

863
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,560
questions and of course getting dumb answers.

864
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
Now, the guy who was part of the

865
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,860
black Israelite nation obviously was referring more to

866
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,100
scripture, where the born-again guy knows no

867
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,040
scripture at all, he can't, there's no way,

868
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,340
he would know anything in scripture, new or

869
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,920
old testament in context, it's impossible, unless he's

870
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,860
totally wicked, and doing it to just harvest

871
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,460
morons, but the interesting thing was going back

872
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,120
and forth, the born-again Christian guy is

873
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,480
like, you have a very interesting interpretation of

874
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,480
the Bible, and I forgot the answer that

875
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
the other guy was giving, so here you

876
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,980
have two people speaking on, this is an

877
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,940
interesting thing, you have two people that are

878
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,300
completely devoid of the truth, most likely in

879
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,040
any other subject, not even just this one,

880
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,500
and they're discussing something as if they both

881
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,960
know what they're talking about, and it's totally

882
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,700
accepted.

883
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,180
That's the society of man in a nutshell

884
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,680
right there.

885
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,960
Because they're crazy.

886
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,680
Easily.

887
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,580
Because they're insane.

888
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:20,540
You can apply that not just to the

889
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,380
study of scripture, regardless of what religious association

890
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,240
anyone claims.

891
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,260
Oh, it's the medical, it's everything.

892
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,820
Medical, government, economic.

893
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,700
But my point is, that's what I'm saying,

894
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,520
you're dealing with crazy people at large.

895
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,620
I'll be back, I've got to say something

896
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,680
for about 10 seconds.

897
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,400
All right.

898
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,440
To tell you just how goofy things are,

899
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,780
recently Seth I had busted a rib, and

900
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,580
of course I had to go hop through

901
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,440
different things.

902
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:57,700
A rib?

903
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,280
Is that what you said?

904
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah, a rib.

905
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,240
Yeah, that's what I said.

906
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,880
Not like Adam, but...

907
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
Yeah, exactly.

908
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,440
But anyway, the second visit that I had,

909
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,200
which was mandatory to go to, the kind

910
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,660
physician added the two words hopping and jumping

911
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,560
to my restrictions.

912
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,380
And I thought to myself...

913
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,680
Do you do a lot of hopping and

914
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:23,900
jumping?

915
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,820
Does that work?

916
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,560
No.

917
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,640
And I'm thinking to myself, boy, that would

918
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,900
have been a $20,000 diagnostic and treatment

919
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,700
plan there.

920
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,200
And I was set back, Seth, I was

921
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,840
just absolutely set back when I looked at

922
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
the paper and I seen that and I

923
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,240
was like, oh, for God's sakes, we've really

924
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,840
sunk to an all-time low.

925
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,500
Did they try to put the magic cuff

926
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,940
on you?

927
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,820
No, not the second...

928
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,420
Oh, yes, as a comforting and warm-up

929
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,900
for sitting on the thumbtack.

930
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,280
Yes, I do remember that.

931
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,200
The stichometer.

932
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,120
I recently, just as an anecdote, I've never

933
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,660
figured out the pronunciation of that word.

934
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,000
I had to take...

935
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,080
We got a puppy and to be a

936
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,660
friend of our other dog, my wife and

937
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,540
I are relatively fond of four-legged friends.

938
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,400
And through an unfortunate set of circumstance, the

939
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,440
front door of the house got blown open

940
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,020
by the wind, actually, and the new puppy

941
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,520
that we'd had for a month got out

942
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,380
and was hit.

943
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,160
And through the magic of the internet, I

944
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,520
was able to figure all of this out

945
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,360
while I was at work.

946
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,100
So, long story short, we ended up going

947
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,020
to two different veterinary places.

948
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,420
And looking at the bill for one of

949
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,140
those is just as infuriating.

950
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,340
Infuri...

951
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,080
I cannot speak this evening.

952
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,320
Infuriating.

953
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,640
It causes anger.

954
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,100
Maddening?

955
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,140
Maddening is okay as well.

956
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,720
I paid $80 for saltwater.

957
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:14,980
Oh!

958
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,440
I know that I didn't actually pay for

959
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,740
anything.

960
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,460
It's all just numbers in a computer.

961
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,640
Or what do they call it?

962
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,140
Saline.

963
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,120
Saline injection.

964
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,740
They had the chemical terms written out there.

965
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,360
I'm going, that's saltwater.

966
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,420
That's like one of the most prevalent substances

967
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,700
on the face of the planet.

968
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,720
And for like three ounces of it, I

969
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,160
paid...

970
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,320
yeah.

971
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,860
So, but what do you do?

972
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,300
Well, you train the dog not to run

973
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,880
to the street.

974
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,240
Right.

975
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,140
Yeah, that was...

976
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,520
That was...

977
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,140
he was...

978
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,020
The older dog is an escape artist.

979
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,040
Like I said, when it happened, there was

980
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,680
no one here.

981
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,300
There's generally, you know, we take preventative measures

982
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,020
to prevent there being...

983
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,640
to get out.

984
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,120
But the door blew open.

985
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,580
It was incredibly windy.

986
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,140
I'm in the middle of the continent.

987
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,380
No mounts to prevent the wind.

988
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,780
So, but that...

989
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,180
And that's just, you know, one example, $80

990
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,520
for saltwater.

991
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,160
People will buy anything.

992
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,120
Well, it's their overhead that...

993
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,040
And they end up paying more than it

994
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,440
should be from the beginning.

995
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,900
And they step on it and yeah.

996
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,040
But yeah.

997
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,920
Well, the basic thing is if these are

998
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,960
basic things, you know, how to treat injury

999
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,780
or harm to a physical living thing.

1000
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,880
Why don't they spend more time teaching everyone

1001
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,740
on how to do that?

1002
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,160
Why do they keep it specialized?

1003
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,600
Because it's their interest that they're looking for,

1004
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,100
not yours.

1005
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,060
They don't have your interest.

1006
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,700
Like I had a discussion.

1007
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,620
One of these morons who thinks that we

1008
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,480
should restore the Republic.

1009
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,140
I'm like, why?

1010
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,400
So you can start it all over again,

1011
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:02,700
you know?

1012
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm kidding.

1013
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,920
Yeah, there's no interest unless...

1014
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,340
If a government is a leader of a

1015
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,940
people, if he's really interested in his people,

1016
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,740
what he will promote or she or the

1017
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,480
body politic is self-sustainability, right?

1018
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
Not centralization of things, right?

1019
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,540
None of this should come to us.

1020
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,520
Also, it'll promote arming the citizens that you

1021
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,080
should all have arms, from light to heavy

1022
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,820
arms, right?

1023
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,800
So in case there is an invasion, there

1024
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,820
is no army to mobilize as a front

1025
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,360
because no matter where the invaders go, they're

1026
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,800
going to be met with fierce resistance, right?

1027
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,480
All of these things in terms of teaching

1028
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,680
people law, at least if you were to

1029
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,620
set up, let's say, a kindergarten through 12th

1030
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,700
grade, a third of that minimum, four years,

1031
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,380
should be completely dedicated to law, health, and

1032
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,780
protection, military-type protection because the rest of

1033
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,440
the world is crazy and violent.

1034
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,200
And clean water.

1035
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,720
Right, right.

1036
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,560
Well, the thing is, then the other third,

1037
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,060
the other four years would be basically how

1038
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,500
to live, how to cook, water, animal husbandry,

1039
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,280
building vocational stuff, building not only, knitting a

1040
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,320
sweater, building something out of yarn, right?

1041
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,720
The use of all things.

1042
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,480
Yeah, the use of all things.

1043
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,340
And the other third then would be the

1044
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:44,200
three R's, which would be the natural world,

1045
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,320
or the creation.

1046
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,540
Yeah, or the creation.

1047
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,920
I'd like to get away from that word

1048
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,000
nature eventually because there's some strong Egyptian, I

1049
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,460
know that sounds like Greek, you've got hang

1050
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,380
-ups on words now, but the word for

1051
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,600
these low-level gods in Egypt were Neters

1052
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,340
or Naters, that's where you get nature from.

1053
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,940
So, when you say nature, you're actually saying

1054
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,000
gods in ancient Kemetic.

1055
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:11,980
Nurture?

1056
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,620
Not sure.

1057
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,660
Could be.

1058
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,940
Yeah, that would be nurture or net.

1059
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,820
No, it would be Nater.

1060
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,200
NTR, there's no vowels, so it would be

1061
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,580
the word would be spelled N-T-R.

1062
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,500
So, yeah.

1063
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,860
But the society that we find ourselves in

1064
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,500
would have to be incredibly different than it

1065
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,360
is currently for these things to...

1066
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,980
Oh yeah, it'll be like that later.

1067
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I assure you later there'll be a real

1068
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,340
education on all of those things.

1069
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,700
There has to be.

1070
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,300
And that's why I assure you there would

1071
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,180
be because it's, you know, for example, if

1072
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,800
there is such a thing as an animal

1073
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,120
without a download and it has to be

1074
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,180
shown and trained by the mature animals around

1075
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,740
it, the mature animals around it would train

1076
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,420
it about what?

1077
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,700
The things that they need to do to

1078
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,260
not only survive but to thrive and live

1079
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,840
well in the environment as that animal.

1080
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,140
So a bird would have a different training

1081
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,220
to other birds than a fish would to

1082
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,840
other fish.

1083
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,560
And when you look at what people are

1084
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,220
being told, they're bait like fish out of

1085
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,460
water.

1086
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,980
There's no law.

1087
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,740
What's being done, of course, it's a cosmic

1088
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,640
setup, is that you have the great masses

1089
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,620
and then you have the entitled classes which

1090
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,740
take on parasitical and predatory positions.

1091
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,540
You know, the attorneys, the economic people, the

1092
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,600
doctors, the religious people, the government people are

1093
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,800
parasitical and predacious with almost no exception.

1094
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,800
There is almost no exception on that.

1095
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,200
Even if you look at the extreme separatists

1096
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,780
who want to form their own cults or

1097
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:21,340
groups, they become that way and so this

1098
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,520
is a cosmic problem.

1099
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,360
And in the future, when you have things

1100
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,260
being entropy and death and things that we

1101
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,380
consider to be the limits on humankind and

1102
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,240
nature being reversed, well, you can't just reverse

1103
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,900
those energies without getting people to thrive in

1104
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,060
it.

1105
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,320
And they're not going to be sitting back

1106
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,200
with some entitled class that's going to be

1107
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,240
predacious and predatory and parasitical on them.

1108
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,480
Predacious and parasitical.

1109
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,420
This goes back to the very beginning almost.

1110
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,520
This is not a recent or western or

1111
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,600
eastern thing.

1112
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,320
It's a cosmic thing for the whole planet.

1113
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,970
Certainly.

1114
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,270
I mentioned in chat a few days ago

1115
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,650
a book that I was reading that I

1116
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,390
just come across.

1117
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,250
You know, I work in the machine shop

1118
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,830
and I thankfully don't have to deal with

1119
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,470
many people so I am able to, you

1120
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,290
know, they give me the jobs that they

1121
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,890
want done and I do them and while

1122
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,450
I'm doing them I can listen to anything

1123
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,910
that I like.

1124
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,030
I like to listen to books which I

1125
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,430
suppose is sort of strange being that I'm

1126
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,270
a musician and I enjoy making music but

1127
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,990
I suppose I enjoy making it more than

1128
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,390
I enjoy listening to it.

1129
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,150
Especially while I'm working for whatever reason.

1130
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:56,410
But I listen to like LibriVox is very,

1131
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,450
very...

1132
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,630
Public domain people.

1133
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:00,790
Uh-huh, yeah.

1134
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,230
It's free audiobooks is what it is.

1135
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:03,710
Yeah.

1136
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,110
So I came across this book and in

1137
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,590
this book within the reason I actually made

1138
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,830
it through most of it, I was in

1139
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,310
a hurry and it was kind of a

1140
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,690
random download but within the first three chapters

1141
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:21,930
is...

1142
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,770
I'm just paraphrasing kind of glancing over it

1143
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:25,310
but this guy...

1144
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,130
Tolstoy guy?

1145
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,170
Uh-huh, it was Tolstoy, yeah.

1146
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,150
Okay, I remember you chatted to him.

1147
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,250
I should point out that I don't...

1148
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,130
The guy's character doesn't come into question with

1149
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,210
this because I don't know anything about him.

1150
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,690
I know that he wrote War and Peace

1151
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,630
and the book that I've read which is

1152
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,170
what I believe but what he was saying

1153
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,170
in there, what caught me was that he

1154
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,010
had a point of contention with a piece

1155
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,730
of scripture and he did a little bit

1156
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,810
of research and found that the point of

1157
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,490
contention wasn't actually a point of contention because

1158
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,310
the wording that he had an issue with

1159
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,850
didn't exist.

1160
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,510
It was something that was added around the

1161
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,190
5th century and it was just that struck

1162
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,290
me because our conversations that we've had public

1163
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,830
and private in the past we've talked a

1164
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:20,330
lot about some of the misconceptions on what

1165
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,470
is actually there is the direct results of

1166
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,210
errors in the translation or the version itself

1167
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:30,630
and the adding and subtracting of words.

1168
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,050
You know, there's the 8th that is in

1169
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,070
you know, occurs 6,000 times in what

1170
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,350
they refer to as the Old Testament more

1171
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,270
than 6,000 times.

1172
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,230
It's between 6,000 and 7,000 times

1173
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:45,930
in this particular...

1174
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,710
The aleph tav where you'll see in Hebrew

1175
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,690
but not in the Greek.

1176
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:52,830
Right.

1177
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:58,870
And I always go to the Hebrew interlinear

1178
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:03,430
because it's available in the old what they

1179
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,230
call the Old Testament.

1180
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,930
But even in the New Testament what is

1181
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:14,570
there in Greek is different than what is

1182
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,390
there in Latin and a lot of or

1183
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,470
at least a lot of what I've seen

1184
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:27,210
translated from the Latin and the Vulgate just

1185
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,350
referencing a Greek interlinear has been beneficial because

1186
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,770
again there are words that are just not

1187
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:38,810
there that change the meaning of a sentence

1188
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,450
quite significantly.

1189
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:43,930
Or let's say if the Greek is the

1190
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:49,370
commanded text to translate out of to create

1191
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,910
the version why do you have let's say

1192
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,150
a particular Greek word showing up the same

1193
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,230
Greek word let's say 10 times in various

1194
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,890
books and let's say the whole text but

1195
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,710
they use three or four sometimes I've seen

1196
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,670
as many as three or four different words

1197
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,250
for the same word like spirit will sometimes

1198
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,630
be soul sometimes soul sometimes be spirit sometimes

1199
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,550
that's one of the most aggravating things yeah

1200
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,810
yeah and various words are being used and

1201
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,750
translated in other words you'll see sometimes in

1202
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,390
you see this often in actually Hebrew and

1203
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,970
Greek you'll have one word and I can't

1204
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,610
bring this is so common I'm surprised I

1205
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,950
can't just bring anything to mind right now

1206
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,170
but let's not just say bring the specifics

1207
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,790
to mind but just the concept here you'll

1208
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,390
have one verse for example and the word

1209
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,690
will be used twice the same word but

1210
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,150
in the version they will not use the

1211
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,070
the same word twice they'll have two different

1212
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,930
words as if the meaning now changed you

1213
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,450
see so it's like imagine you have a

1214
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,990
string of numbers and the number two is

1215
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,070
used in the beginning and the number two

1216
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,050
is being used in the end well in

1217
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,470
the in the translation they use a number

1218
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,990
two on one side but a number three

1219
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,790
on the other right which is a totally

1220
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,350
different number or a totally different word so

1221
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,690
what they're doing is even though a particular

1222
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,470
verse just to recap here might have the

1223
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,490
same word being used twice in the version

1224
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,050
they use two different words and it changes

1225
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,770
the meaning regardless of what you think the

1226
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,810
intent is or it was a better choice

1227
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,170
to use that word or not they should

1228
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,970
have just kept that word they should have

1229
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,090
just stayed with it and used it twice

1230
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,730
in the version as well so if people

1231
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,090
want to study what the Aleph Tav is

1232
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,510
there's not much discussion and I have not

1233
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,670
done public discussion I do rant and rave

1234
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,890
in the past about when you do look

1235
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,750
at especially the Hebrew you'll see how they

1236
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,470
don't translate the Aleph Tav and the Christ

1237
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:56,930
identified himself with that phrase let's say and

1238
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,530
the significance of that and I stop there

1239
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,550
and I've never really gotten into what the

1240
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,730
significance of the Aleph Tav is in Hebrew

1241
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,290
alone it is always just dismissed as a

1242
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,910
grammatical function and I could just do a

1243
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,510
short thing here and I'll go into it

1244
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,350
more in the future what the significance of

1245
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:19,850
that really is in terms of the underlying

1246
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,490
meaning of the text but on the superficial

1247
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,970
meaning let's say on the overall just at

1248
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,450
a glance meaning of the text for example

1249
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,150
if you look at the first verse of

1250
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,450
Genesis you know you have seven words and

1251
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,090
the fourth word is the Aleph Tav and

1252
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,590
it's not being translated you'll have ten words

1253
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,710
in the English and by the way if

1254
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,730
you I had someone recently say well I

1255
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,550
can't find an interlinear that's got the Alpha

1256
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,110
and the Omega in the first verse of

1257
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,170
Genesis and it's like I'm not even going

1258
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,250
to address that it's just dumb but you

1259
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,810
know and I've used that as an example

1260
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,370
it's a miscomprehension yeah so I'm meaning that

1261
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,090
just turn off Greek speak because you can't

1262
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:08,470
follow so but here's the other thing when

1263
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,430
you look at this will help with that

1264
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,510
let's say add more meaning to it without

1265
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,650
getting into too much when you see the

1266
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,550
Aleph Tav like for example in the beginning

1267
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,210
God created the heavens and the earth is

1268
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,710
what you see in English but in Hebrew

1269
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,850
it'll be something like Bereshith bara Elohim at

1270
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,390
ha-shamayim v'het ha-aretz Bereshith bara

1271
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,050
Elohim et ha-shamayim v'het ha-aretz

1272
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:40,610
et ha-aretz okay right now Bereshith bara

1273
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:43,590
Elohim is in the beginnings the Elohim created

1274
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,530
and then you see the Aleph Tav and

1275
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,650
then you see ha-shamayim v'het ha

1276
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,730
-aretz which is created in the heavens and

1277
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,250
the earth now what the at does usually

1278
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,370
when you see it in Hebrew it means

1279
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,430
towards something so when you see the beginnings

1280
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,850
Elohim created what is it towards the Aleph

1281
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,710
Tav means towards created towards the heavens and

1282
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,850
the earth you see that's the grammatical purpose

1283
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:13,150
of that in Hebrew and other places you'll

1284
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,390
see like in Book of Jeremiah there's one

1285
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,390
chapter I think it's 17 it's a medium

1286
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,170
length or I would say short chapter and

1287
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,970
the Aleph Tav within those 50 words is

1288
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,610
used almost 10 times right because there's a

1289
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,950
lot of action there so you'll see a

1290
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,190
verb or an adjective something that's going to

1291
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,490
happen to either Israel or to something and

1292
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,530
evil will go and then it says where

1293
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,530
then you'll see towards what so you'll see

1294
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,410
the Aleph Tav when you see an action

1295
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,070
or a verb being brought into the text

1296
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,590
and with that action and verb being actionable

1297
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,630
towards something you'll see the Aleph Tav in

1298
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,870
between you see so it's sort of I

1299
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,450
got a question so what what's your take

1300
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,390
on why it's been removed or not I

1301
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,090
mean now it would seem like it would

1302
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,970
be an easy thing I'm giving you in

1303
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,390
other words yeah let's just recap for a

1304
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,570
moment if you were to do the first

1305
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,050
verse in Genesis you could say in the

1306
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,110
beginning the God's created towards the heaven and

1307
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:21,470
the earth that would be fairly accurate even

1308
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:26,190
just purposefully accurate from the grammar that's held

1309
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,730
within the text right I also yeah I

1310
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,890
also have a a question and I suppose

1311
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,150
it's it's a form of clarification as well

1312
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,350
because as I've read it and it's instances

1313
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,410
that I've found and those few that I

1314
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:45,230
have you know looked at not only that

1315
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,010
but it also seems in English there's a

1316
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:52,150
lot of it's not replacement it's addition of

1317
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,410
the word z because ok we have which

1318
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,070
is it's a single word but the at

1319
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:01,410
the beginning of it intonates another word in

1320
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,770
English which would be so it's in the

1321
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:09,970
beginnings or in beginnings created which a would

1322
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,970
reformed would almost be a better translation of

1323
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,750
the word which is at the sholoyim well

1324
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,770
hold on that yeah you could say but

1325
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,530
performed is another word ashay also which is

1326
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,970
another form which is more like form than

1327
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,410
bada I think I have to go and

1328
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,110
look at it there's a word in Genesis

1329
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,750
that's by the way I just interupt they

1330
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,110
do

1331
00:56:36,110 --> 00:57:06,090
interchanged,

1332
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:32,350
created, and formed very differently.

1333
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,250
So it's not just an at or a

1334
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,110
towards, but it's almost adding specificity.

1335
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:44,570
It's not saying, it's speaking to this earth

1336
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,170
and these heavens.

1337
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,910
It's almost like a Z, but in a

1338
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,730
context that we don't have in English, where

1339
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,890
it would be like a, you know how

1340
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,250
they will, this is just an example, but

1341
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,270
they will capitalize the beginning of a pronoun

1342
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,070
like him, like they will capitalize that to

1343
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:09,210
denote something separate from a regular pronoun, someone

1344
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:09,730
specific.

1345
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,030
It's almost as if the aleph and the

1346
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,230
tav as a word put in there, the

1347
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:20,610
et or eta, is set in there to

1348
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,910
denote specific things.

1349
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,830
And that could be simply a result of

1350
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,150
me, you know, going through the inner linears

1351
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:34,450
and specifically seeing it constantly and giving a

1352
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:41,130
new light or a new significance to the

1353
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,530
sentence or the phrase or the words that

1354
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,370
it is joined with.

1355
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,370
And so that's just kind of something that

1356
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,050
I've noticed.

1357
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,170
There's much to be considered also.

1358
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:03,610
It forms the, I wouldn't say a pointer,

1359
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,390
because the aleph and the tav also symbolize

1360
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,450
the written word in its entirety.

1361
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,070
Do you know how people say, well, you

1362
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,470
know, soup to nuts or A to Z,

1363
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,230
you know, it means it's all encompassing?

1364
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,910
Alpha and omega, yeah, certainly.

1365
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,230
Or alpha and omega, from the beginning to

1366
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,590
the end.

1367
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,770
So it has this definitive thing where usually

1368
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:25,690
you will see it when something will be

1369
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:30,830
brought up and the context that you're looking

1370
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,050
for in what is being written is complete

1371
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,590
when you see the aleph and tav.

1372
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,010
In other words, you're not really looking for

1373
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,810
more outside of that passage.

1374
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,080
Oh, wow.

1375
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:44,520
Yeah.

1376
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,140
But then again, all of the passages together,

1377
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,840
just like a carpet or anything that's woven

1378
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,520
together is what gives the article its definition.

1379
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,880
That's why, for example, yeah, it's a binder.

1380
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,480
You can also look at aleph, tav as

1381
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:00,900
a binder.

1382
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,680
And I would suggest that it would, that

1383
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,160
technique or that tool would have been used

1384
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,440
literary to, from a literary standpoint, also in

1385
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,540
what was written in the New Testament, if

1386
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,320
it was transcribed in Hebrew, which would have

1387
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,220
been considered a hieroglyph.

1388
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,840
And like hiero means holy or literally it

1389
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,560
means altar, and glyph means to write, right?

1390
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,040
So it would have been the higher form

1391
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,980
of memorialization.

1392
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,600
You know, like years ago, they hired calligraphers

1393
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:37,540
to pen, yeah, to illuminate or calligraphers to

1394
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,460
write a final text.

1395
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,140
Like you'll have a first or second draft,

1396
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,280
and the final draft, let's say a U

1397
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,740
.S. Constitution, you know, it'll be done with

1398
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,840
a calligraphy for final presentation.

1399
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,800
So there'll be a lot of dress rehearsals,

1400
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,720
but when it's time for the show to

1401
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,920
go on, not only will you have calligraphy,

1402
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,660
you know, it'll be written so it looks

1403
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,360
good, but you will also start implementing various

1404
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,140
literary tools like the aleph, tav in Hebrew.

1405
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,100
But, yeah, there's, but here's the thing, there's

1406
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,380
so much discussion through the years on these

1407
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,840
fine points, but yet very few people get

1408
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,460
the whole picture of Scripture.

1409
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,320
What's the purpose?

1410
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,540
What does it mean?

1411
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,740
For many years, and this is just a

1412
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,840
side note here to anyone listening to remember,

1413
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,060
I've spent, well, fortunately not too much time,

1414
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,060
but when I figured out that the Scripture

1415
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,920
was what they called the Bible at the

1416
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,320
time, what I thought it was called just

1417
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,020
the Bible, was important.

1418
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,920
I figured, oh, that's easy.

1419
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,480
I just need to seek out some Bible

1420
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,400
experts and hang out with them for a

1421
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,920
little while and I'll figure out, you know,

1422
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,440
just like they figured it out.

1423
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,300
And I found out they didn't know what

1424
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,600
the hell it was about.

1425
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,180
So I was going to ask how that

1426
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,380
went.

1427
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,020
Didn't go well at all.

1428
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,120
So I said, okay, it's something you got

1429
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,860
to do on your own.

1430
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,040
And then I figured out, you know, wait

1431
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,220
a second, you know, what's going on?

1432
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,340
Why are my fingers and toes shriveling when

1433
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,320
I put them in water and I got

1434
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,020
one of those vacuum pack machines and every

1435
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,600
time I fired it up, I noticed when

1436
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,260
I drew a vacuum on a soft membrane,

1437
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,080
it shriveled up around whatever was in the

1438
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,680
container.

1439
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,440
I said, okay, guys, there is a vacuum

1440
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,200
in the body.

1441
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,860
I would have a point on that.

1442
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,900
It would, and that is that if you

1443
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,920
have nerve damage in your hands, that won't

1444
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,340
happen.

1445
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,140
Hmm.

1446
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,200
Interesting.

1447
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,720
It's something that I've, because that's something that's

1448
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,160
stuck out, you know, the vacuum in the

1449
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,380
body is something that is, you know, relatively

1450
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,200
obvious once you're looking at it as such.

1451
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,860
What holds it all together.

1452
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:45,180
Right.

1453
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,620
Because structurally it's an impossibility.

1454
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,140
The mechanism for the, yeah, exactly, yeah.

1455
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,000
The mechanism for that, you know, the hand

1456
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,340
shriveling when you're in water is certainly the

1457
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:56,760
vacuum.

1458
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:01,200
Without the vacuum, that would be quite an

1459
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,320
engineering feat actually.

1460
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:08,020
But the, I've also read articles talking about

1461
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,280
it being, you know, nerves that your hands,

1462
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,380
there has been documented cases of that not

1463
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,780
happening to people and it being attributed to

1464
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,400
nerve damage.

1465
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,300
That's just.

1466
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:19,600
Yeah.

1467
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,160
Okay.

1468
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:20,820
We'll keep that.

1469
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,680
But we have, we, you don't have firsthand

1470
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,700
experience with that.

1471
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:24,920
No.

1472
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,780
Thankfully.

1473
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:26,800
Yeah.

1474
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,340
I don't.

1475
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:27,680
Okay.

1476
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,340
So we'll keep, we'll have to keep an

1477
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,740
eye on that and anyone who has any

1478
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,200
nerve damage, please report back.

1479
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,980
Like if anyone poops charcoal briquettes, let us

1480
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,780
know because then we can apply calories to

1481
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,020
food.

1482
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,140
Exactly.

1483
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:41,960
Yes.

1484
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,520
I mean.

1485
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,540
Now the nerves, the nerves are interesting too

1486
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,640
because they're the backup system.

1487
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,600
They have to be there if you're going

1488
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,300
to set up something as elaborate, you know,

1489
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,840
that's going to be reactionary, right?

1490
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,220
You're going to have structural evidence of it,

1491
01:03:59,220 --> 01:03:59,580
right?

1492
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,220
But at the same time, you got to

1493
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,160
look at this also.

1494
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,860
It's coming from the quackademic.

1495
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:08,420
Oh yeah.

1496
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,320
Cannot be trusted.

1497
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,980
You just got to take that with a

1498
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,260
grain of salt, you know?

1499
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:12,880
Oh yeah.

1500
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,940
I'm not, I didn't mean to make it

1501
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,820
sound like I was making the assumption that

1502
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,460
I have, you know, that I know what

1503
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,260
nerves actually are.

1504
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,100
No, but the thing is, hold on a

1505
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,240
second.

1506
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,460
The actual experience that people feel goes beyond

1507
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,780
the nerves themselves.

1508
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,520
The element is there and you see.

1509
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,900
So in other words.

1510
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,840
And there's a reactionary thing going on and

1511
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,340
you know, maybe that one thing causes another.

1512
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,080
Yeah.

1513
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,100
Yeah.

1514
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:44,480
Yeah.

1515
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,740
You just think of it from a rational

1516
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,280
perspective.

1517
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,860
You're going to create a being that's going

1518
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,480
to feel, move, repair itself and all this.

1519
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,820
You're going to always have some physical evidence

1520
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,180
of all of those factors, you know, in

1521
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:58,720
the structure.

1522
01:04:59,140 --> 01:04:59,240
Right.

1523
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,280
But most of those structures are operating outside

1524
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,460
just the physicality that's being probed and we're

1525
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,640
being told about exists.

1526
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,620
Because it's still, I have not found anyone

1527
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,840
in, whether it was scientific, medical or what

1528
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,880
have you, even psychological community that can tell

1529
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,500
me what life is, what, how can, what

1530
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,580
allows, and not even a big open question

1531
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,180
like that, but just what allows someone or

1532
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,420
permits or instigates the mobility from you to

1533
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,840
get up on your chair and walk across

1534
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,220
the room?

1535
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,420
Exactly.

1536
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,540
What allows you to do that?

1537
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,460
They cannot explain it.

1538
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,760
You know, let's say, well, the muscles contract

1539
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,540
and the nerve tells it, well, okay, that's

1540
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,220
a description.

1541
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:36,380
Right.

1542
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:36,720
Yeah.

1543
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,960
How does it all work together and how

1544
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,880
is it, how do you have all this

1545
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,700
soft stuff hanging on a skeleton and it's

1546
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,240
not drooping?

1547
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,820
I mean, everything starts to droop when you

1548
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,300
get over 60 or so, right?

1549
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,280
Or 70.

1550
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,500
Yeah.

1551
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,360
You know, you start to, your skin keeps

1552
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,680
growing and the skeleton doesn't, right?

1553
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,460
It's very simple why wrinkles and things.

1554
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,660
The skin grows, the earlobes grow, the nose

1555
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,800
grows, the brow bone on the skull keeps

1556
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,100
growing and the skull keeps growing.

1557
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,400
So anyway, so and.

1558
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,520
Yeah, it becomes very apparent as you, I

1559
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,740
don't know, looking at things with, through a

1560
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:24,780
different perspective that any, why is a question

1561
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,620
that we'll lump them all together and call

1562
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,860
them academia has a huge problem with.

1563
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,460
Because when you get into, as you were

1564
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,200
saying, you know, what makes this possible?

1565
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,020
They can describe the mechanism that is doing

1566
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:46,300
it, but not, not the spark, not the.

1567
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,800
Well, partially, they can partially describe it and

1568
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,140
also they don't see it as a problem

1569
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,860
because if you don't acknowledge it, it's not

1570
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:54,240
a problem.

1571
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,200
Like what problem, right?

1572
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,240
They don't acknowledge it at all.

1573
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,400
But there's a, you know, we, one day

1574
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,520
we'll do a discussion from beginning to end

1575
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,880
on the vacuum, the biological vacuums at large

1576
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,260
and anything that's living from the cell to

1577
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,260
a plant to a fish to a bird

1578
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,720
to the human and just all the various

1579
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,320
ways that it can be evidenced, right?

1580
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:22,080
In short, I always give the shriveling up

1581
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,440
of the membrane, right, and all of that

1582
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,360
as the easiest, but essentially also you have

1583
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,360
the fluids in the body, right?

1584
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,900
You also have the, you know, besides just

1585
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,580
the fluids, you have the gases, the fluids,

1586
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,800
the tension that's required to keep everything together,

1587
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:39,880
right?

1588
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:46,160
When you start factoring structures that are, that

1589
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,400
have a rigid structure with a lot of

1590
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,020
flexible membranes, you know, whether it's a building

1591
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,640
or a robot or anything, you start to

1592
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,020
notice a lot of problems, right?

1593
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,440
And, you know, let's say in buildings, let's

1594
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,280
say you put a tarp over a metal

1595
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,880
frame, right?

1596
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,740
You have a lot of problems unless that

1597
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,260
tarp is under a lot of tension, mechanical

1598
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,420
tension, it's stretched, the wind will shake it

1599
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:07,820
and all that.

1600
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,960
When you look at the human body or

1601
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,420
anything that's alive, there's very little mechanical tension

1602
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,020
holding it all together.

1603
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,640
So then it can't be mechanical in that

1604
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,279
sense, you know, within the structure itself.

1605
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,520
It has to be a pressure, a batho,

1606
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,979
what would be the various terms that they

1607
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,040
use for pressure, right?

1608
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,279
So, or barometric issue.

1609
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,680
Once you figure out that it's barometric, let's

1610
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,920
say, then everything works very neatly together as

1611
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,260
it does.

1612
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:48,160
I'm curious, and this is kind of going

1613
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,819
back to what we were talking about a

1614
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:55,600
few minutes ago, about what would you say

1615
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,979
about the word, the Hebrew word, Badrach?

1616
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:03,340
And the reason I ask is because, as

1617
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,180
you know, you know, I'm learning to speak

1618
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,180
and comprehend Hebrew.

1619
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,399
And my- Modern Hebrew is very different,

1620
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,560
but that's okay.

1621
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:15,899
Certainly.

1622
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,420
Absolutely.

1623
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,420
And I believe that that's probably a factor

1624
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,520
coming into this and, you know, causing this

1625
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:23,899
question.

1626
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:28,200
But my question is, Badrach, you know, Rach

1627
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,100
is bad, evil, Rach, right?

1628
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:39,060
And B is in or at, depending upon

1629
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:42,600
its inflection, essentially, how it's pronounced.

1630
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,180
The B or the B, you know, there

1631
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,160
are subtleties in it.

1632
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:52,500
So in just reading Bereshit Badrach, you know,

1633
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,160
Badrach, and admittedly, this is, you know, the

1634
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,260
type of Hebrew that a college student would

1635
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,600
be speaking over there, is my comprehension of

1636
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:04,780
it.

1637
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,960
And it is spoken.

1638
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,620
I cannot read Hebrew.

1639
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,300
I don't mean to misrepresent that.

1640
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,420
But the Badrach would be, you know, in

1641
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,080
bad.

1642
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,180
So I'm just curious as to, and I've

1643
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,600
read, you know, the Interlinear and the Strongsteins

1644
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,460
and what is readily available.

1645
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,440
But I'm just curious as to, just on

1646
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,980
that one word, what is that one word?

1647
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,080
Well, and an easy way to look at

1648
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,300
it, as I always suggest, get a handle

1649
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,480
on letters, right?

1650
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,920
Because the reason you have a finite, you

1651
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,680
always know which culture promoted literacy because they

1652
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,220
had a finite alphabet versus, you know, 2

1653
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,960
,700 pictographic characters.

1654
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,200
So the Greeks and the Hebrew, you know,

1655
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,680
I think cuneiform also had 22 characters.

1656
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,760
The reason why you reduce it to those

1657
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,240
characters is so it's compact and easy to

1658
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,940
apply and anyone can learn it.

1659
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,660
So when you look at what the letters

1660
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,360
represent, because, again, you don't have to use

1661
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:07,580
letters.

1662
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,760
You could use pictographic symbols to do it,

1663
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,520
but what's, there's a more, when you reduce

1664
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,740
something down to a letter, right, and you,

1665
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,560
let's say you're creating the alphabet versus just

1666
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,260
doing pictures, you still have, that letter still

1667
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,660
has to retain and have a meaning.

1668
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,600
You know, they're not arbitrary, right?

1669
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,840
It's not like the Pope's work schedule, Gorian

1670
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,260
calendar.

1671
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,400
When you- Tie that in, tie that

1672
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,720
in not only for me, but for anyone

1673
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,560
else who's listening, because I assume, and assumptions

1674
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,780
are horrible, but that most of the people

1675
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,320
that are listening are at least English speakers,

1676
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,880
if that's not their native language.

1677
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,940
And this is kind of a foreign concept

1678
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,180
to English speakers, because A could have the,

1679
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,820
you know, a meaning, but what does B

1680
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,020
mean other than, you know, the flying insect,

1681
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:56,480
like?

1682
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,860
Well, the house.

1683
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,900
A house, or it could mean the house

1684
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,380
in a sense of something that is intentionally

1685
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,060
a house.

1686
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,580
You know, it is made where things of

1687
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,260
authority or things come out of.

1688
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:09,940
B?

1689
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,560
Uh-huh.

1690
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,260
In English, how, like, where, like, how does

1691
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,800
- Well, what's, English is interesting, because is

1692
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,320
it really, is the English alphabet really English?

1693
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:23,560
Well, no.

1694
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,660
Is it the alphabet, or is it the

1695
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:26,220
alephbet?

1696
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:26,940
Yeah.

1697
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,060
If it was English, we probably wouldn't call

1698
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,080
it, you know, the alphabet.

1699
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,540
Well, what's the seventh letter in the English

1700
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,100
language?

1701
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,360
What is it?

1702
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,200
G, isn't it?

1703
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,400
Well, let's see.

1704
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,580
A, B, C, G.

1705
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,140
No, you're right.

1706
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:38,420
G.

1707
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:38,860
Right.

1708
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,420
I was off by- Yeah.

1709
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,100
That's why you ever notice the Masonic symbols,

1710
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,940
they have a G on the ring, typically.

1711
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,680
Not always, but- Uh-huh.

1712
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,960
When you show the G to, you know,

1713
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,760
that's like the big, you know, the big

1714
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,280
honcho, el jefe, right?

1715
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,320
So, they play around with certain things in

1716
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,960
the English language that is a road that

1717
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,000
you don't want to go down without frequent

1718
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,120
showers, I should say, if you know what

1719
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,480
that means.

1720
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,040
It's dirty.

1721
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:13,480
But, nonetheless, let's just look back to what

1722
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,120
things, well, okay.

1723
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,260
When you ask, let's say, a word, bada,

1724
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:17,900
what does it mean?

1725
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,200
Okay, well, how do we know what it

1726
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:20,460
is?

1727
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,600
Well, it's a word, and it's made up

1728
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:22,960
of what?

1729
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,800
It's made up of letters.

1730
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,380
And why are we using letters?

1731
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,500
Why don't we have a picture?

1732
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,200
Why don't we have a different, well, because

1733
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,980
there was a decision or a standardization or

1734
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,720
form that was used, and when you make

1735
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,660
a word, because words can be made still

1736
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,700
today, you choose them basically on what other

1737
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,380
words that sound similar or mean, and with

1738
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,380
changing the prefix and suffix to be for,

1739
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,500
against, or with, right?

1740
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:51,000
Or, when you're looking at times of antiquity,

1741
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,400
these words or these letters that made up

1742
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,060
these words themselves had a meaning.

1743
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,140
So let's, if you want to just take

1744
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,080
bada apart really simply, it would be something

1745
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,100
coming out of a house or a central

1746
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,000
place, right?

1747
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,760
And it would be the head of it,

1748
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,560
the R, right, rosh, you see?

1749
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,940
You see how it works on that aspect

1750
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,000
of the letter signifying the meaning of the

1751
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,960
word as well as the word being placed

1752
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,960
to have a meaning within the context of

1753
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,440
the sentence?

1754
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:24,340
Yeah.

1755
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,370
Now, what's very interesting, like, I was recently

1756
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,670
listening just to give just more of a

1757
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:31,350
roundabout thing.

1758
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:34,550
When you're learning Hebrew today, it's very different,

1759
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:36,710
because recently I was listening to a conversation,

1760
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:39,410
someone speaking Hebrew, and he was basically asking

1761
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,890
the person, you know, did you do this

1762
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:42,990
for yourself or did you do it for

1763
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:43,370
everyone?

1764
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:44,630
And he says, oh, well, you know, olam,

1765
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,870
you know, basically he says he did it

1766
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,710
for everyone and he used the word olam.

1767
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,630
Now when you look at scripture, olam is

1768
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,310
typically being used to mean the age, meaning

1769
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:57,710
this time period, or it could also mean

1770
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:00,510
the world, the world at large, right?

1771
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:03,030
But what's interesting about that is when you

1772
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:04,550
look at the meaning of it meaning the

1773
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:08,390
age, right, it's finite, number one.

1774
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,530
Number two, when you look at the world

1775
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,170
at a certain age, well, it's discerned at

1776
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:14,810
the world of that age, and then at

1777
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,610
a different age, the world is very different

1778
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:16,990
again.

1779
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,810
But in modern Hebrew, they use the word

1780
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,110
olam to mean everyone, like, you know, not

1781
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,310
only did I, you know, have a piece

1782
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:29,010
of chewing gum myself, but I gave the

1783
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,450
rest of the chewing gum to olam.

1784
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,650
In modern Hebrew, they would say that, you

1785
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,790
know, to everyone around me, right?

1786
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:35,890
Okay.

1787
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,890
You see what I mean by this?

1788
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,510
I'm unfamiliar with the word olam in that

1789
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,970
context.

1790
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,390
I would say a ten.

1791
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:45,870
Okay.

1792
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:49,090
But that's not necessarily everyone.

1793
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,290
That's more like many.

1794
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,570
So the interesting thing here is, how much

1795
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,710
can we read out of what's there, and

1796
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,230
how much do we want to read into

1797
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:02,850
what's there in scripture?

1798
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,790
Right.

1799
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,750
Well, we don't want to read anything into

1800
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:06,750
it if we could avoid it.

1801
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,190
Sometimes you have to, and the only time

1802
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,210
that it's viable, and I've said this before,

1803
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:16,990
I've said it more lately than before because

1804
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,890
there's more of this topic going to be

1805
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:22,270
coming up, it's safe to read into scripture

1806
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:27,170
when it comes to archaeology, right?

1807
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,890
Because you have a finite, provable, you know,

1808
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,270
what are they going to say?

1809
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,310
Can you provide an example?

1810
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:35,690
Sure.

1811
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,930
Like the Mesha Stele, for example.

1812
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:42,610
The Mesha Stele, which is a stone that

1813
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:44,610
was, I think it was a Canaanite stone,

1814
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:48,470
it dates back to around 1000 BC, a

1815
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,830
little after that, probably.

1816
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:53,810
And actually before that, and it uses the,

1817
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:57,550
it has the name of Yahweh in there.

1818
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,150
Like the king went and raided the temple,

1819
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,390
and it was actually after that, it was

1820
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:05,730
maybe 700 or 800 BC, and he got

1821
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:10,710
the utensils from the house of Yahweh, right?

1822
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,270
So if you have, like there's a bunch

1823
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:15,730
of German scholars in the 1800s and 1700s

1824
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:17,510
that wrote, oh, all that stuff in the

1825
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:19,630
Bible, that was all written around 1000 AD

1826
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:24,290
by a bunch of mystics, you know, that

1827
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:24,810
were in mythology.

1828
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,030
So here they find like a, I think

1829
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:30,230
it's the Mesha, M-E-S-H-A,

1830
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:33,370
Stele, S-T-E-L-E, it's in

1831
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,710
a museum somewhere, in London or in France,

1832
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:36,530
I think it's in the Louvre.

1833
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,290
And you will find that.

1834
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:41,870
There's also other artifacts that are found from

1835
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:44,210
that part of the world that have...

1836
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:44,550
Mesha.

1837
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,170
M-E-S-H-A.

1838
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,190
You found it?

1839
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:47,450
Okay.

1840
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,550
I'm just going from memory.

1841
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:53,370
So, archaeology is a bitch when it starts

1842
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,510
to prove out things that people say did

1843
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,190
not exist.

1844
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:57,490
You know what I mean?

1845
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,770
So in that case, like for example, right

1846
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:05,210
now there's, for the past 10 years, there's

1847
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,190
a fellow Collins, he's been digging up the

1848
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:11,910
Sodom and Gomorrah, and anyone who knows scripture

1849
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,770
knows that Sodom and Gomorrah was never at

1850
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,510
the location where they tell you on the

1851
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,090
southwest east end of the Dead Sea.

1852
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:22,790
It's not possible, because that was the land

1853
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,210
of the...

1854
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,210
South of that was the land of the

1855
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:28,790
Edomites, let's say, and it was nowhere near

1856
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:30,350
there, especially if you look at the story

1857
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,110
between Abraham and Lot, and also Abraham's experience

1858
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:36,010
with it, it had to be seen almost

1859
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,370
from the hills of Jerusalem.

1860
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,130
So there's no way you could see that

1861
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,090
far down the Dead Sea.

1862
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:44,190
So they're uncovering Sodom right now, and they're

1863
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,950
finding artifacts, and what's interesting is they're finding

1864
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,350
artifacts that are directly connected to the Minoan

1865
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,590
civilization, right?

1866
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,470
Or the Minoans actually, they were not called

1867
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,430
the Minoans by that part of the world,

1868
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,030
they were called by something else, but I

1869
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,330
have to go through my notes for that,

1870
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,650
because there's like three levels, or actually almost

1871
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,090
four names, almost for every society that we

1872
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:09,290
can refer to, right?

1873
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,510
They were not called Minoans.

1874
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:15,950
So the interesting thing about archaeology is that,

1875
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,270
well, you know what the prime artifact of

1876
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,450
any archaeologist is?

1877
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:22,470
Well, this is not really even discussed anymore,

1878
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:25,050
because they make these things fit how they

1879
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:25,470
want them.

1880
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:28,550
But the most significant artifact an archaeologist can

1881
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,470
find is what?

1882
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:32,090
Is an artifact that has what on it?

1883
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,710
Writing, right?

1884
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:42,910
So, in order for these archaeological finds that

1885
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,570
have been found, and the ones that will

1886
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:49,130
be found, to bear significance on turning the

1887
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:54,790
archaeological evidence into something that can back up

1888
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,590
what the scripture says, even though there is

1889
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:59,350
no direct reference in scripture to it, is

1890
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:02,250
an allowance that can easily be said, can

1891
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,190
be read into scripture.

1892
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:06,750
Okay.

1893
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,350
But in other words, taking a book that

1894
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:13,190
someone wrote about commentary, or whatever they think,

1895
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,630
and reading that into scripture, especially religious doctrine,

1896
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:19,730
I recently wrote in chat on how to

1897
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:24,070
do study, how to research things, whenever you

1898
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,670
want to study scripture, if you go online,

1899
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:30,670
let's say, or in a library, and there's

1900
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:34,330
a scriptural commentary or information about quote-unquote

1901
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,270
the Bible, and it's in a religious context,

1902
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,970
it's generally wrong.

1903
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:48,710
Or, generally, they're wrong, because it's

1904
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:49,230
propaganda.

1905
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:53,350
So the allowance that I like to, I

1906
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,010
actually enjoy reading into scripture when it comes

1907
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,570
to archaeology, you see.

1908
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:00,450
Yeah, okay.

1909
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:04,710
So, an easy thing for that, an easy

1910
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,950
way to look at that, let's say, put

1911
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,630
scripture aside, look at written history, look at

1912
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,910
the archaeology that has been found and can

1913
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,350
be shown to match up with, let's say,

1914
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:16,450
Greek writings, or other parts of the world.

1915
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:21,270
For example, Troy, Troy has been taught as

1916
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,390
a mythological, the whole Trojan War, and the

1917
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:26,510
city of Troy, and all the things around

1918
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:29,090
it was mythical, because much of the story

1919
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:31,890
of Troy was intertwined with the Greek pantheon.

1920
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:34,030
So I said, well, the Greek pantheon is

1921
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:37,230
mythology, so anything within that, it comes even

1922
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,390
proximity is mythology.

1923
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:42,790
Well, Schliemann, there's a lot of those guys

1924
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:44,650
from that part of the world, Germany and

1925
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,810
such that were very interested in antiquities, he

1926
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:50,450
uncovered Troy, and when they uncovered it, they

1927
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:53,810
uncovered Troy by basically reading the writings of

1928
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,690
Homer and others on where they said it

1929
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,550
was, you know, mythological documents, right?

1930
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:00,450
And he just followed, just like this guy

1931
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,130
Collins, he just followed what the Bible said

1932
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:02,950
to find Sodom.

1933
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,970
So anyway, Schliemann finds that, you know, the

1934
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:11,350
best geographical markers or points of interest that

1935
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:13,270
we have to find it on the map

1936
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,710
is here, and he went and dug, and

1937
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,450
guess what they found?

1938
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:16,570
Troy.

1939
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:23,050
So now, do we take that archaeology and

1940
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,770
say, well, that Troy that they found has

1941
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:28,750
nothing to do with the mythological Troy that

1942
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,330
the Greeks spoke about in Homer and all

1943
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:30,750
these others?

1944
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:34,510
Or is it okay to take the evidence

1945
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,370
that Troy has been found and now put

1946
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,210
it together with the writings, and now what

1947
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:39,730
have you got?

1948
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:43,510
Even though, you see, now it comes together

1949
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:44,470
and it confirms.

1950
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:49,330
And this works with pretty much anything.

1951
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,630
For example, I hate to use anything in

1952
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:54,270
legal society as an example, but the creme

1953
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,890
de la creme of a quote-unquote investigation

1954
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:02,010
in the legal world, or supposedly law, is

1955
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:07,230
when a case is being argued or needs

1956
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:10,330
to be solved, and they find evidence that

1957
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:12,990
supports the outcome of the case.

1958
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:15,310
And I mean in truth, not with the

1959
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:16,310
way they're doing it.

1960
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:20,570
So you go to the scene that's described,

1961
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,570
and you look at the evidence to see

1962
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,850
what's going on.

1963
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,190
And it's physical evidence.

1964
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,270
So the same thing goes back, if you're

1965
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:30,110
going to look at, like, what does bara

1966
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:30,450
mean?

1967
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:35,850
Well, at that point, we're looking at, I

1968
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,830
would say, a semi-formalized, if not a

1969
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:41,750
formalized form of text from the time of

1970
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,010
Ezra and Nehemiah all the way to, let's

1971
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,010
say, 1000 AD, where they kind of left

1972
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,550
it alone by that point, you know, to

1973
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:49,690
what we have today, right?

1974
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:53,050
That was the Masoretic text, was pretty much

1975
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:53,970
left alone around then.

1976
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,530
With minimal transition in and out, you know,

1977
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,710
some things added, some things taken away minimally,

1978
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:05,750
you can see that the architecture of the

1979
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:10,610
letters forming, you know, the word still hold,

1980
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:14,750
the meaning of each letter still holds a

1981
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,030
significance within the word itself.

1982
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:20,450
Just like when we were speaking of the

1983
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,870
aleph and tav earlier, if you're going to

1984
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,370
look at a case in point, well, what

1985
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:25,490
is aleph, what is tav?

1986
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,650
It's the first and the last.

1987
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,170
It's an all-encompassing thing, right?

1988
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,370
So when you go back to bara, what

1989
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:34,010
is be, what is bet, what is rush,

1990
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:34,510
right?

1991
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:35,790
Right.

1992
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,250
These things come together.

1993
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,990
I mean, this is an interesting thing that

1994
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:44,430
I've always looked at, modern, like with edeb,

1995
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:45,810
right?

1996
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:47,590
It needs to emanate from the top of

1997
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:48,730
the house, literally, right?

1998
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,270
The ERB.

1999
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:55,030
But in Hebrew, modern Hebrew, any time after

2000
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,030
noon, it's edeb tav, right?

2001
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,890
But they have a different name for noon,

2002
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,810
and they have a different, and it's edeb

2003
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,510
tav all the way to the time you're

2004
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,210
ready to go to sleep, then it's lilatav,

2005
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:04,510
right?

2006
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,830
Edeb, lilah, boker.

2007
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,850
Right.

2008
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:12,410
And what's interesting in scripture, it doesn't get

2009
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:15,370
into the breakdown of edeb, but we know

2010
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:19,450
there's a boundary layer between morning and edeb,

2011
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:21,590
and that boundary layer has to be noon,

2012
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:24,530
you know, even though it doesn't mention noon,

2013
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,910
right?

2014
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:26,150
Zowain.

2015
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,270
Zowain.

2016
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,670
I remember it was a word with a

2017
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:29,830
Z.

2018
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:30,650
Yeah.

2019
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:35,810
So, you see how it's easy to see

2020
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:39,970
that transition, that, well, what comes between morning

2021
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:43,770
and afternoon, if you're a day count, well,

2022
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:44,870
what comes there, you know?

2023
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,850
And the thing is that when you understand

2024
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:52,530
human justification of human actions, it's not, when

2025
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,050
you look at things like, for example, the

2026
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:59,170
day starting at noon, to justify human action,

2027
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,690
people don't operate like you're on a, everyone's

2028
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,590
on a starting line at a racetrack, you

2029
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:04,770
know?

2030
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,550
It's like, go!

2031
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,050
You know, like you're on, you can't, you

2032
01:26:07,050 --> 01:26:07,770
know, as soon as you go over the

2033
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,410
line, the race starts.

2034
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:11,310
It's not, see, human behavior, if you know

2035
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:13,850
the day, let's say, ends at noon, you

2036
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:16,610
start acting as if the day has ended

2037
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,910
an hour before, you see?

2038
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:22,430
And also, even an hour into the day,

2039
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:25,570
you see, it's not exactly at, even though

2040
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:27,530
the marker and the measurement and the time,

2041
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,110
it starts exactly at noon, we don't live

2042
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,810
our lives like we're on a racetrack, you

2043
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,090
know, for the day, let's say, and I'm

2044
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,690
referring, let's say, to the Sabbath, right?

2045
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:36,690
Uh-huh.

2046
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,510
That's why you heard of preparation before that.

2047
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,030
So, let's go back to the word bara,

2048
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:42,890
when you consider all those things, you know,

2049
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:45,030
what is the head of the house, something,

2050
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,770
you know, the top, yes, basically bara would

2051
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:52,290
be the top authority in the house, would

2052
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:56,330
mean to, basically, a loose examination of that

2053
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:56,630
word.

2054
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:00,210
The house, the top of the house authority.

2055
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,250
What does that have to do with create,

2056
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,080
you know?

2057
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,460
How do we define it?

2058
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,240
Is it like a line that we start

2059
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,220
and stop, like, what is creation, why did

2060
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,120
we use the word bara?

2061
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,840
It gets philosophical very quickly, doesn't it?

2062
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:24,640
Most of it does in, I would say,

2063
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,280
not in the way that the term is

2064
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:33,220
used colloquially currently, but in the actual, in

2065
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,860
the philosophia, certainly.

2066
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:40,160
So, the thing about the literacy and promoting

2067
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,140
literacy is when we see the word being

2068
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:48,040
used and it means a certain thing, does

2069
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,160
it mean that because we've been told it

2070
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:50,740
means that?

2071
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,780
Or does it mean that because of the

2072
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,660
words around it?

2073
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,060
Right?

2074
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,020
And I think it's a combination of both.

2075
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,900
And also the architecture of the word, which

2076
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,460
are the letters.

2077
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,120
Right.

2078
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,080
Well, there are those that would say that

2079
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,840
it's not what you say, but how you

2080
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,260
say it.

2081
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,880
And there are those that would say that

2082
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,480
it's not how you say it, but what

2083
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:10,920
you say.

2084
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,520
And if we're talking in absolutes, they'd both

2085
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,020
be wrong.

2086
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:16,900
Sure.

2087
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,120
Yeah, no, of course, because it's human.

2088
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,320
That's why, you know, like, let's say the

2089
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,000
beginning of one day to the next, there's

2090
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,380
a transition period, there's a threshold moment.

2091
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,080
So all of these words that we've been

2092
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,960
told what they mean, for example, an interlinear,

2093
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,720
they work that way.

2094
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,380
It works very well.

2095
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,900
But if to go back and look at

2096
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,620
the architecture of the word, and study what

2097
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,280
each letter means and putting it together, I

2098
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,000
think gives you more of a deeper meaning.

2099
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:51,600
And does this open us up to really

2100
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,060
getting even more meaning out of what's been

2101
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:57,020
said and really not accepting what we're being

2102
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:57,920
told that it means?

2103
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,740
Yeah, it does.

2104
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,540
Yeah.

2105
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:00,700
Mm hmm.

2106
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,020
It's almost 11 here locally, and I still

2107
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:09,260
have to take care of two physical bodies

2108
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:09,500
here.

2109
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:10,760
We got to we're going to eat dinner

2110
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,700
here in a little bit.

2111
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,400
So I'm probably going to leave you here

2112
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:14,980
in just a moment.

2113
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,940
But one other word, significantly off topic, but

2114
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:23,400
maybe not at all, would be mime, which

2115
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,320
is water in Hebrew.

2116
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,420
Yeah, isn't that interesting?

2117
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:27,620
It is interesting.

2118
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,940
Because it's motherly, and there are a lot

2119
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,120
of mother stuff in there.

2120
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:38,060
And bringing the modern Hebrew in as well,

2121
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:45,040
mime, literally taking it apart, the ma is

2122
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,780
how you say what.

2123
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,640
It's like, what?

2124
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,440
Like matadrodze would be what do you want,

2125
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,120
matadrodze.

2126
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,400
I say the m letter is one of

2127
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,320
the most frequently used letters in Hebrew.

2128
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,640
And the e is the plural.

2129
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,980
So an interesting way of looking at that.

2130
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,740
It's probably relatively inaccurate.

2131
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,920
But water is something that you've spoken about

2132
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:20,820
that modern, we'll call them academia, is they

2133
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,860
don't know what it is.

2134
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,540
They're going off of what they've been told,

2135
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,660
you know, hydrogen and oxygen.

2136
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,640
And in Hebrew, mime, water, would be the

2137
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,100
many whats, or the plural.

2138
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,120
And when you ask what, you need to

2139
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,740
see or discern or comprehend.

2140
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,680
That's why you're asking what, right?

2141
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,140
And that's what the middle of the word

2142
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,020
means, basically.

2143
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,010
It's interesting.

2144
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:56,970
There is still information there, but it takes

2145
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:59,790
some doing to get at it.

2146
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,870
Well, this is what the mystics were chasing

2147
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:06,550
down, and it's interesting in itself.

2148
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:12,090
But there's nothing wrong with the, like you

2149
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,410
said earlier, is it how you say it

2150
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,410
or what you say or both?

2151
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:18,250
There's nothing wrong with studying.

2152
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,870
Are we deriving the meaning that we should

2153
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:21,990
be getting out of the word?

2154
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:24,190
And the answer to that is a wholesale

2155
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:27,710
no when we start looking at the words

2156
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:28,150
deeply.

2157
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,690
But when we put everything together and see

2158
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:34,010
the purpose of why it's put together, does

2159
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:34,850
it change the meaning?

2160
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:36,190
It shouldn't.

2161
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:38,950
But we should have an understanding of how

2162
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,230
everything is strung together.

2163
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:43,210
Like just, like you said, bara and mime,

2164
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:45,650
right, looking at those two words together, you

2165
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,650
see there's more going on within the word

2166
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,630
that we use as mime or bara, right,

2167
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,170
or even aet, right?

2168
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,230
And believe it or not, there's, you know,

2169
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,270
the mystics, what were they called, the Hebrew

2170
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,170
mystics, the, not the Tamurists, the...

2171
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,250
The Mejai?

2172
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,930
Yeah, well, not even, yeah, they're just...

2173
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:06,090
I mean, that's, it's a horribly, it's inappropriate.

2174
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:08,090
No, the Kabbalistics, yeah.

2175
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,970
They get into this stuff and they could

2176
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,590
sit there and tell you what each letter

2177
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:13,650
means for hours.

2178
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:15,930
But if you ask them what, tell me

2179
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,310
about the gods and what are we in

2180
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,210
for, they don't know.

2181
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:20,150
You see?

2182
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:22,450
It's that, it's that censorship.

2183
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:24,530
Well also...

2184
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:26,270
That, going back to that book that I

2185
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,250
was talking about, the censorship is evident because

2186
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,250
you have this guy, regardless of whoever he

2187
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:36,210
is, who finds that, a point of contention,

2188
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,750
and he does a little bit of research

2189
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:41,510
and finds that the words aren't even actually

2190
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,970
in the text, but he doesn't apply that

2191
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:48,510
to his own perception of the text or

2192
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:50,030
existence as a whole.

2193
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:53,970
And it's something that he obviously saw as

2194
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:56,690
important enough to write his own book upon,

2195
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:01,890
but at the same time, he stumbles across

2196
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:06,010
something that should be monumental and should be

2197
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:07,910
like what's wrong with us?

2198
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,830
It says this, but we're doing this.

2199
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:13,350
And instead of that, he just, it just

2200
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,070
digresses into...

2201
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:21,150
He's living in the residue of the torturous

2202
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:23,730
society that the Christians set up.

2203
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,230
Because you know, Christianity was used as a

2204
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:28,630
political tool, you know, they burned people that

2205
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,730
inquired into the scriptures.

2206
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,510
Which is absurd.

2207
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,230
It's absurd.

2208
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:37,770
You look at the scripture and the society,

2209
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,230
the way that the society of man is

2210
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,830
structured right now, what we would call, or

2211
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,410
what I would refer to as the world,

2212
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:46,030
separate from the earth, not the earth.

2213
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:47,030
The earth is doing great.

2214
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,290
If it doesn't want us here, it's going

2215
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,110
to shake us off.

2216
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:54,870
But the society of man, the world is

2217
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:57,230
so very...

2218
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:01,530
It's skewed, but at the same time, we

2219
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:04,750
have all of these religious organizations adding their

2220
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:08,970
justification to things, and it's very simple.

2221
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:13,890
Most of these organizations couldn't exist without oaths

2222
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,550
being taken.

2223
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:15,670
Right?

2224
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:18,750
With military orders, when you join a military

2225
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:22,310
order of anything, you know, you take an

2226
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:22,490
oath.

2227
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,750
The pledge of allegiance, like they do here

2228
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,890
in the States, you know, there are oaths

2229
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:29,290
involved.

2230
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:33,510
You go into, you know, Eustacius' court, there

2231
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,510
are oaths involved.

2232
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,530
And all of that is strictly verboten, very,

2233
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:41,610
very plainly, even in the rough translations and

2234
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:45,110
erroneous texts that we have readily available to

2235
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,350
us.

2236
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,270
The president takes an oath and he swears

2237
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:49,390
on the Bible, which is an oxymoron.

2238
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:50,810
Absolutely absurd.

2239
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:54,810
Because in doing this, you're making that book,

2240
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:59,390
that physical item, something other than what it

2241
01:34:59,390 --> 01:34:59,810
is.

2242
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,850
Well, the book condemns you to do that,

2243
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:02,910
if you do that.

2244
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,830
There's a condemnation in doing that.

2245
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:13,930
So yeah, that just shows you...

2246
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:16,050
It's just like the doctor, you know, people

2247
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,790
will say, Greek, I want to tell you

2248
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:18,350
what the doctor said.

2249
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:19,050
Hold on a second.

2250
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:21,390
I know you want to tell me how,

2251
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:25,270
you know, you ended up with that particular

2252
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:25,890
moron.

2253
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,390
But let me ask you, did he put

2254
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,970
a cuff on your arm and tell you

2255
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:30,670
you have blood pressure?

2256
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,010
So if he started off with such a

2257
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:34,530
farce, what makes you think that the rest

2258
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:35,510
of it's not a farce?

2259
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:38,310
So when you have a president swearing on

2260
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:40,890
a Bible, if you're starting out with a

2261
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:42,750
farce, what makes you think the rest of

2262
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,630
it is not a farce?

2263
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:45,590
And also...

2264
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,810
They've made it painfully obvious that it's a

2265
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:48,050
farce.

2266
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:48,690
Yes.

2267
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:50,270
And the other thing is this.

2268
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,770
If they're telling you that your sacred right

2269
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:55,790
to vote is secret, well, you all got

2270
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:57,790
together to put us in power in secret,

2271
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,290
and when we're in power, guess what we're

2272
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:00,150
going to keep from you?

2273
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,190
Secrets.

2274
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:06,090
Show me where in history, when Scripture or

2275
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:08,430
otherwise, when someone was elected, it was done

2276
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:08,850
openly.

2277
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:12,310
They had the crowds, all for, yes, say

2278
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:15,450
yay, and people wanted to say, yelled yay,

2279
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:16,350
and then nay, nay.

2280
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,550
And the one that was louder was the

2281
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,930
vote of that general group, and then they

2282
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:21,790
went to the next town.

2283
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:23,890
It was no secret.

2284
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,390
So people were like, oh yeah, they've all

2285
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,350
accepted the secrecy in government.

2286
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:31,190
Show me where you had secrecy in government

2287
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:34,370
in ancient, openly like that.

2288
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:38,650
Show me any ancient Stele or tablet or

2289
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:41,090
writ or Scripture that says, oh yeah, we're

2290
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:42,950
rulers of this, but we keep these secrets

2291
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:44,270
from the people and all this.

2292
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,930
Show me where that's ever in there, or

2293
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,590
were they open with the people?

2294
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:49,810
Yeah.

2295
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:52,090
Now, whether they were or not is not

2296
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:55,650
the point, because we know they were hypocrites

2297
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,010
also.

2298
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:58,750
What I'm saying is that it was not

2299
01:36:58,750 --> 01:36:59,370
memorialized.

2300
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:02,150
Now they're memorializing that you vote in secret

2301
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,150
and the government has secrets and everybody's okay

2302
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:06,270
with it, but then they complain about the

2303
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:06,930
secret government.

2304
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,630
That's why I keep saying this is unreal.

2305
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:13,170
You cannot fix the situation.

2306
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:15,450
They have plenty to complain about.

2307
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:20,850
It accomplishes little, but there's plenty of it

2308
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:21,210
there.

2309
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:24,990
If anything they do can be justified, the

2310
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:26,690
complaining, I suppose, would be up there.

2311
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:30,930
It boils down to the very simple deduction.

2312
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,930
It's an Occam razor type thing, even though

2313
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:36,110
I don't endorse Occam's razor thing.

2314
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:39,030
The only obvious reason why things are the

2315
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:40,570
way they are is because the gods have

2316
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:42,770
somehow figured out a certain number of humans

2317
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:44,770
over a certain amount of time has to

2318
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,450
pass before you go to the next level.

2319
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:51,330
There's no reason to have 200 years of

2320
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:53,890
whatever they're calling in history right now the

2321
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:54,570
way it is.

2322
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:55,830
There's absolutely no reason for it.

2323
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:56,490
It yields nothing.

2324
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:01,610
It changes what countries mean and go kill

2325
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:02,790
a bunch of people here and there.

2326
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,950
That's been done before.

2327
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,270
It's because a certain number of people have

2328
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:08,810
to come and pass through this existence, you

2329
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:09,030
see.

2330
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:09,890
That's all.

2331
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,170
The rest of it doesn't make any sense,

2332
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:13,570
you know.

2333
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,610
Yeah, the next 10 years are going to

2334
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:18,330
be very interesting to observe.

2335
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:23,970
Yeah, seven essentially starting this spring, and the

2336
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:25,410
middle of that seven is three and a

2337
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:27,910
half, so we're going to look around when

2338
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:29,050
they call the next decade.

2339
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:32,150
By then for sure you'll see the changes

2340
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,930
in place that leads to the next thing.

2341
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:36,870
If you know what's coming, it's going to

2342
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,850
be superb, because even though no matter how

2343
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:41,650
drastic the changes are, the people are going

2344
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:42,890
to accept it.

2345
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:43,230
Right.

2346
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,300
Yeah.

2347
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,060
Well, with the absurdity that has been prevalent

2348
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:58,660
in just the news cycle, it's become more

2349
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:58,760
...

2350
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:58,860
Sidiocracy.

2351
01:38:59,540 --> 01:38:59,800
Yeah.

2352
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:05,340
Yeah, it is absolutely the fictional movie that

2353
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,600
is quickly becoming a documentary film.

2354
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:09,240
Yeah.

2355
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:10,260
Future documentary.

2356
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,680
They're going to have to create a whole

2357
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,200
new genre.

2358
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,420
Here's a general statement that holds true, even

2359
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:19,300
though it's not specific, which is general general,

2360
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:19,580
right?

2361
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,020
Not specific, not specific.

2362
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,100
There's still a lot of people out in

2363
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,300
the world, whether it's on the rectangle or

2364
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,780
not, that have certain attributes, talents, skills that

2365
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:30,500
you can glean something off of, you know,

2366
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,780
get edible corn out of poop, right?

2367
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:37,120
There's still discoveries being made that are communicated.

2368
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,680
I think that's how I described reading that

2369
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:43,080
Tolstoy book, was picking peanuts out of refuse.

2370
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,580
Right, but it doesn't mean that what they

2371
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:49,120
do, the rest of what they do is

2372
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,320
not just reprehensible and repugnant.

2373
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,400
So when I say that there's no one

2374
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,320
out there discussing anything noteworthy, I mean it

2375
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,160
in a wholesale, qualitative way.

2376
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,400
Oh yeah, no, absolutely.

2377
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,300
There's been a number of programs I've at

2378
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,840
least read about, seen a couple of them,

2379
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,500
having to do with subject matter that I'm

2380
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,120
interested in.

2381
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:15,120
That subject matter being not simply scripture, but

2382
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,700
the gods, as in plural, like across all

2383
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,140
nations.

2384
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,440
As in the truth, yeah.

2385
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:25,960
And the subject matter is there, but the

2386
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,620
accuracy is nowhere to be found in several

2387
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:35,520
books, at least a couple of television broadcasts

2388
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,540
having to do with the subject.

2389
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,620
I'm watching these things going, I know that

2390
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:43,560
the interest is going to grow, but what

2391
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:48,420
is being presented is still the academic mythos

2392
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,480
garbage that is, with the tools that we

2393
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,420
have at our hands, is easily refuted.

2394
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,820
The tools being just the access to information.

2395
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,700
So I still have yet to see anything

2396
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:05,020
mainstream being broadcast about any of these things,

2397
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:10,960
be it Nordic gods or Indian gods, Indian

2398
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:17,120
as in India, like Hindi, none of it

2399
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,220
is dealing with any of it accurately.

2400
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:27,040
In other words, referencing something without making stuff

2401
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,560
up, yeah.

2402
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,180
Yeah, and it's not even, they're not being

2403
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,980
original with the making stuff up, they're just

2404
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:39,200
following the preconceived mythos as opposed to what

2405
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,720
is actually there in the archaeological and literature

2406
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,020
references.

2407
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,640
Like instead of treating these people like actual

2408
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:52,860
things, they're treating these things as just subjects

2409
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:56,080
that only exist because people think they exist.

2410
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,680
It's absurd.

2411
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,340
Well that subject, just like all other subjects,

2412
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,720
is people will, the access to the truth

2413
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,000
is not difficult, but it's the censorship, the

2414
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,380
fog.

2415
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,360
Like if you're in a dense fog, you

2416
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,840
could be a ship just meters or yards

2417
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,560
away from a rock outcropping in the water

2418
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,740
and you don't see it, right?

2419
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,360
So it could be just passing right by

2420
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,240
you in pitch black, you have no idea

2421
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:21,960
of your surroundings.

2422
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,060
So when the subject matter of the gods,

2423
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,080
like you said, whether it's mainstream or cable

2424
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,820
or even YouTube or whatever, they're in pitch

2425
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,240
black.

2426
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,900
It's whatever they're just immediately grasping and the

2427
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,240
truth or a bigger matter that could be

2428
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:39,480
more significant to help the program along could

2429
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,700
be right there and anyone can access it.

2430
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,900
And they don't even access it and they've

2431
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,760
taken the position to be in the media.

2432
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,760
There's a difference between the common plebeian on

2433
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,940
the street mouthing off the crap and there's

2434
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:58,160
a difference between someone in the media broadcasting

2435
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:58,480
it.

2436
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,360
They have a different responsibility, you see.

2437
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,320
When they go, when you see the media,

2438
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,680
whether it's alternative or mainstream broadcasting the same

2439
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,900
crap that the plebeian knows, you know, whatever

2440
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:11,680
myth about it, that is really, you know,

2441
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,300
I should say a sad state of affairs

2442
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,840
because it's not edifying at all.

2443
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,860
How long do you think until there will

2444
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:22,020
be a realization of the inadequacy, a realization

2445
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,640
of the responsibility that these people have been

2446
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,040
abused?

2447
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:28,260
And not just the media, but like the

2448
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,820
leaders of any organization.

2449
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,520
Well, look, there's two examples I'll give.

2450
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,800
The first example is the real history and

2451
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,860
the real matter of things is not, it's

2452
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:41,280
simple and really, I shouldn't say simple and

2453
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,540
not easy, but simple and not difficult to

2454
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:44,680
discover, okay?

2455
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:48,600
I'll give one example regarding World War II.

2456
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,840
You know, like everyone says the Nazis, right,

2457
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,620
and Hitler were so bad.

2458
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,740
Well, if you go back and just spend

2459
01:43:54,740 --> 01:44:00,220
a few hours researching periodicals, you know, which

2460
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,120
would be real time in their time, you

2461
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,100
know, like dated because let's say you see

2462
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,440
the New York Times, you know, they'll put

2463
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,920
a date up top, you know, like January

2464
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,460
6, 1939, for example, right?

2465
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,140
And you read the news there and what

2466
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:14,560
you will find if you look at the

2467
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:18,240
New York Times and other big newspapers prior

2468
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,340
to Hitler and the Nazis being the bad

2469
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,500
guys in Germany, what you will find is

2470
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,160
headlines in the New York Times in the

2471
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,900
late 30s and you'll find one headline, you

2472
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,300
know, it's a surprise attacks as France attacks

2473
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:30,940
Germany.

2474
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,440
This is before, you know, the Socialist Party

2475
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,120
armies were mobilized, right?

2476
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:43,760
Then you see another headline, this is again

2477
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,260
prior to historically when the Blitzkrieg was started

2478
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:49,800
again, Poland attacks Germany this weekend.

2479
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,840
And then, you know, you look at the

2480
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:56,000
newspapers and then a year later, Hitler has

2481
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,820
a Blitzkrieg.

2482
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:59,940
But you don't hear that France attacked Germany

2483
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,160
and Poland attacked Germany and England shredded all

2484
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,680
these treaties years before.

2485
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,960
You only right now remember, oh, Hitler was

2486
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,800
so bad because he did the Blitzkrieg across

2487
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,140
Europe.

2488
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,640
Do you see my point?

2489
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:14,560
Certainly.

2490
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:15,760
Okay.

2491
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,500
The other thing to remember, that's about getting

2492
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,420
any information, the other thing to remember for

2493
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:25,760
anyone is whatever humankind from now on discovers,

2494
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,960
not because I'm saying this, it's because you'll

2495
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,920
see again in the strong narrative with very

2496
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,100
little detail in scripture.

2497
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,080
The only reason, if they're unrehabilitatable and there's

2498
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,160
really nothing to fix humanity other than what

2499
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:42,660
happens at the resurrection, the only lawfulness that

2500
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,780
mankind will gain knowledge of and admit is

2501
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:46,120
what?

2502
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,620
The amount of lawfulness or knowledge for them

2503
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,600
to gain so when the kill shots come,

2504
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,260
they're lawful.

2505
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:58,340
Because it's not lawful to put on global

2506
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:00,880
kill shots on a group of people that

2507
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,360
don't know why they're receiving those kill shots.

2508
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:05,320
Right?

2509
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:06,420
Uh-huh.

2510
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,660
You know, they tell you what they're going

2511
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,840
to do before you do it.

2512
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,000
So if the people have no concept of

2513
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,680
the gods, how can the gods come and

2514
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:16,580
wipe out their society?

2515
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,760
Then at the resurrection, all these people are

2516
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,640
going to be sniveling, well, we didn't know.

2517
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,120
Why did you do it?

2518
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,840
We just needed a little more time to

2519
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,720
figure it out, you see.

2520
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:31,930
So keep in mind what you'll see in

2521
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:35,090
the near future and the next seven years

2522
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,650
and decade, what will be coming on the

2523
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,750
scene in terms of knowledge of the gods

2524
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:43,330
will be just enough where people acknowledge it

2525
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,930
just enough so when the kill shots do

2526
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:47,750
come, it'll be lawful so then later at

2527
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,550
the resurrection, they can't say, well, we didn't

2528
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:51,230
know, you know.

2529
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,370
Right.

2530
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:52,670
They will.

2531
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,310
So then you have to rationalize, which I

2532
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:59,590
don't know how much knowledge it'll be, really.

2533
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,590
We'll have to see it, but the people

2534
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:04,430
will gain enough knowledge that how much knowledge

2535
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:07,310
does a society have to have of the

2536
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:09,830
gods before the gods then can say, now

2537
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:11,450
we can take them out lawfully because they

2538
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:12,210
acknowledge us?

2539
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:14,230
And that's the amount of, that would be

2540
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:15,930
the answer to the question, how much more

2541
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,190
people of the truth are they going to

2542
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:18,410
get?

2543
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,480
Absolutely.

2544
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,860
It could be a lot or it could

2545
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,600
be a little, right?

2546
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,500
It just has to be enough.

2547
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:29,960
Just has to be enough.

2548
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:32,260
So then the question is, how much knowledge

2549
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:34,860
of the gods does society have to have

2550
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:37,540
for then the gods to lawfully proceed on

2551
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,060
their mopping up their society?

2552
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,060
That's the question.

2553
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:46,740
So before this happens, will there be, there

2554
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:51,300
would have to be widespread comprehension of the

2555
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:51,680
text.

2556
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:52,740
Yes.

2557
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:56,420
Well, no, not necessarily widespread comprehension of the

2558
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:59,900
text, but widespread comprehension of the significance of

2559
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,460
the text.

2560
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:06,130
The text as itself is a lawful reminder

2561
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:08,010
and a lawful notice of all of these

2562
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:08,410
things.

2563
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:13,630
Well, I'm someone who is personally invested in

2564
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:17,930
the comprehension of what would be called the

2565
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:18,450
New Testament.

2566
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:22,010
Well, not only the New Testament, but it

2567
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:24,490
does say in the end, the wise will

2568
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:25,110
understand.

2569
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:26,770
It doesn't say everyone will understand.

2570
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:31,630
And comprehension of the New Testament is very

2571
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:32,050
simple.

2572
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:35,150
And I've always said this, and I've stuck

2573
01:48:35,150 --> 01:48:36,750
by this for a very long time, and

2574
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,410
that is, that should have never been made

2575
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:41,550
public, as we know, because that is a

2576
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:48,930
series of testimonials to those that were waiting

2577
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,190
for the proof of what happens after you

2578
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,050
die, period.

2579
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:56,110
There's no, recently someone challenged me, how few

2580
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:57,710
words can you describe scripture?

2581
01:48:57,830 --> 01:48:58,850
And I put it in chat and I

2582
01:48:58,850 --> 01:48:59,450
came up with it.

2583
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:00,730
I thought about it for a few days

2584
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,190
and I put it in chat.

2585
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,430
Because I used to say, well, I could

2586
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:06,910
explain scripture in 30 seconds or less, or

2587
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:08,390
I could explain it in 20 words or

2588
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:09,670
less or 30 words or less.

2589
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,350
Now I've got it down to three words,

2590
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:13,530
Adam, Christ, resurrection.

2591
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:15,110
That covers everything.

2592
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:18,930
The Christ, because the Christ is the Godhead.

2593
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:21,650
If you said just the gods, well, then

2594
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:23,190
some moron might come say, well, are you

2595
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:23,930
denying the Christ?

2596
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:25,850
You deny Christ, you deny the Father.

2597
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,350
Like, well, so you just put the Christ

2598
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,090
as the head of the Godhead.

2599
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:31,110
Because he says he's equal to the Father

2600
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:31,510
anyway.

2601
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:34,810
And Adam is this, the descendants of Adam

2602
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:37,910
are the pivot of all the actions of,

2603
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:39,770
you know, all the battles, all the births,

2604
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:41,430
let's say, all the thing, right?

2605
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:43,050
Those are descendants of Adam, right?

2606
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:46,130
And there are others, but the pivot is

2607
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:46,470
Adam.

2608
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:47,370
The invasive man.

2609
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:48,110
Right.

2610
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:51,010
And then you have resurrection for two reasons.

2611
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,250
Well, resurrection for two reasons.

2612
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:55,230
The main reason is that it's the end

2613
01:49:55,230 --> 01:49:56,170
of this process.

2614
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:59,170
And also after the resurrection, all the things

2615
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:01,030
that have ever been questioned up until this

2616
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:02,390
point will no longer be questioned.

2617
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:04,690
There'll be full knowledge of all the things.

2618
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:08,290
Any question anyone can ask now, like the

2619
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,130
meaning of life or what happens after you

2620
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:12,490
die or, you know, how is the earth

2621
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,390
made or this, that and the other, all

2622
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:16,090
of that will be satisfied at the resurrection.

2623
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:20,030
So just saying Adam, Christ and resurrection encompasses

2624
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:20,970
the entire scripture.

2625
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:25,830
What of judgment and mercy?

2626
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:27,310
Resurrection.

2627
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:33,540
Because when Israel, even just like anything, when

2628
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,820
you look into the resurrection, well, that has

2629
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,840
many, many details.

2630
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:39,420
But when you say resurrection, it's the end

2631
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:41,200
of this process that we see in scripture.

2632
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:44,300
And also, it's the answering of all the

2633
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,660
questions that man can possibly have.

2634
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,580
In other words, you're coming into full knowledge.

2635
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,300
I mean, in other words, by the second

2636
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,680
resurrection, everyone will be in full knowledge of

2637
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,180
the gods.

2638
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:56,840
That's pretty obvious.

2639
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,680
And there's many processes in between there.

2640
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:04,980
Remember, there's a thousand years before everyone is

2641
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:06,280
resurrected after that.

2642
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,260
You know, that's a study within itself.

2643
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,720
Each one of those things is a study

2644
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,460
within itself.

2645
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,900
But that is the simplest way to categorize

2646
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,000
the entirety of scripture.

2647
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:21,040
And that's the reason why that was, and

2648
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,400
I focused on doing that recently also, was

2649
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,020
because of the thing that I just said

2650
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:25,420
also.

2651
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:31,300
What does man need to know about or

2652
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:31,940
acknowledge?

2653
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,000
What is not, you know, what is, what,

2654
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,500
you know, and so how many times have

2655
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,420
you run into someone that was so excited

2656
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,200
about learning something, and then a year later,

2657
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,660
they're not so, they don't care about it

2658
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,000
anymore.

2659
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,260
You see, this is, I have a feeling

2660
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,700
it's going to be very much like that,

2661
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,960
because you have something spoken of as the

2662
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,400
great falling away, right?

2663
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:51,700
So they're there at one point, and then

2664
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:52,860
they fall away from it, and they get

2665
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:54,080
worse than they've ever been.

2666
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:55,520
So.

2667
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:00,480
Well, humanity has historically been relatively stubborn.

2668
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:05,140
Stubborn, evil, self-centered, rebellious.

2669
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,520
You want to go on?

2670
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:07,420
Well, yes.

2671
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,480
But all of these things, I mean, that's.

2672
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,500
Descendants of Adam.

2673
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:15,940
Like that gets back into the, well, yes,

2674
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,960
good and evil, but where does evil come

2675
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,260
from?

2676
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,700
And it comes from the same place that

2677
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,300
good does.

2678
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,820
What gets into Adam?

2679
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:25,480
All of these things, all of this, it

2680
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,340
all is going to happen, whether we want

2681
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:28,920
it or not.

2682
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,720
But we were dealing with a society of

2683
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,080
men currently where there is a portion of

2684
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:39,580
it who is at least nominally dedicated to

2685
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:44,360
bringing what they see as prophecy to fruition,

2686
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:47,380
which is completely and totally absurd.

2687
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:50,500
If you have any sort of comprehension of

2688
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,540
what you're actually dealing with, those that are

2689
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:56,980
basing it upon scripture or, as I said,

2690
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:59,480
nominally basing it on scripture, you know, saying

2691
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,060
whether or not.

2692
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,800
But they've been, you know, that's an interesting

2693
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,380
thing, and I think that's more of an

2694
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:09,100
urban myth because I seriously doubt they understand

2695
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,240
anything in prophecy.

2696
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,540
Well, yeah, no, no, no.

2697
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,160
That's what I mean by nominally.

2698
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:19,800
They're naming it as a belief or a

2699
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:27,780
faith in prophecy, but in reality, literally, it's

2700
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:30,120
garbage because if there was a comprehension of

2701
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,460
these prophecies of which they claim, they would

2702
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:35,120
realize that no matter what they do, these

2703
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:36,220
things are going to happen.

2704
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,580
It's not up to…

2705
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:39,820
Well, and they won't realize that it happened

2706
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:40,940
until after they happen.

2707
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:41,900
They won't see it coming.

2708
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:44,840
It'll be like a baseball bat to the

2709
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:46,800
back of the head in a dark alleyway

2710
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:47,320
to them.

2711
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,810
Waking up going, what happened?

2712
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:52,610
My head hurts.

2713
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:55,890
And even though they know one prophecy just

2714
01:53:55,890 --> 01:53:57,270
took place, they didn't see it coming.

2715
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:58,410
They won't be…

2716
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:00,030
They have so little rationale, they won't be

2717
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:01,490
able to piece it together to the next

2718
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:02,210
one.

2719
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:05,650
That's because they're in terminal order, right?

2720
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:08,230
One thing happens, and the next thing happens,

2721
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,970
and the next, right?

2722
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:10,010
Right.

2723
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:10,910
Mm-hmm.

2724
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,490
But there is no understanding.

2725
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:14,130
The reason they have no prophecy is very

2726
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:14,490
simple.

2727
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:16,250
They don't have the right information.

2728
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:18,990
They don't know what day it is, right?

2729
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:20,070
They don't know…

2730
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:22,450
They cannot define any of the biblical characters.

2731
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:25,410
It seems relatively important to know what day

2732
01:54:25,410 --> 01:54:26,810
it is if you're dealing with prophecy.

2733
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,550
Mm-hmm.

2734
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:29,510
Yeah.

2735
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:30,270
If you read the…

2736
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:32,450
One of the reasons I got into day…

2737
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:35,050
Figure into what the days are in Scripture

2738
01:54:35,050 --> 01:54:38,190
is because I started reading Scripture, and it

2739
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:39,910
said, well, it was the 15th day of

2740
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:40,670
the second month.

2741
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:44,090
And I'm like, okay, does that mean February

2742
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:45,730
15th?

2743
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:49,430
And I looked at the Jewish calendar that

2744
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:51,690
they were putting in front of me, and

2745
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:52,990
I was looking at all these names.

2746
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,510
I'm like, wait, they're not even in Babylon

2747
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:54,850
yet.

2748
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:55,610
This is Exodus.

2749
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:56,690
What are you talking about?

2750
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,010
You know?

2751
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:02,770
And even the Jewish calendar goes off of…

2752
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,890
There was no…

2753
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:04,630
It's flipped.

2754
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:07,030
It's all the day is night and the

2755
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,730
night is day.

2756
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:10,930
Not as in it's bright outside, and we're

2757
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:12,850
going to say it's dark, but as in

2758
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:17,190
the dark moon versus the full moon.

2759
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:21,350
Something that can be observed versus something that

2760
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,390
can only be observed by its absence.

2761
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:24,050
Right.

2762
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,250
They left in the beginning.

2763
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:27,150
It was very important to let them know

2764
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:28,890
in Exodus when it was the beginning of

2765
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:29,230
the month.

2766
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:29,870
Do you remember that?

2767
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:32,670
There was two or three verses dedicated to

2768
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:32,810
that.

2769
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:33,490
This is this.

2770
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,070
This is the beginning of your months.

2771
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:39,530
Well, okay, if that was something new to

2772
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:41,750
them because they're in Egypt, that's like saying,

2773
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:43,790
okay, you see, when you wake up in

2774
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:45,110
the morning, the sky is blue.

2775
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:46,950
I want you to remember the sky is

2776
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:47,290
blue.

2777
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:50,150
Why would you say that with a narrative

2778
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:51,670
that has no detail in it?

2779
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:54,430
So it's very important because when they left

2780
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:57,330
Egypt, it was the beginning of the Egyptian

2781
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:00,470
month and the middle of their month, the

2782
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:01,090
lawful month.

2783
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:04,390
Anyway, that's another discussion.

2784
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:07,910
In the future, I'll get into Egyptian timekeeping.

2785
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:09,870
Here's a little tidbit on timekeeping.

2786
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:11,730
You know how you mentioned the Hindu earlier?

2787
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:13,390
You know the incense sticks that you buy

2788
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:15,890
still at smoke shops or places?

2789
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:16,670
You know they're like a stick?

2790
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:17,010
Nakshampa.

2791
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:19,150
Yeah, Nakshampa.

2792
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,510
Uh-huh.

2793
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:22,410
You know the incense holder that they go

2794
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:22,610
on?

2795
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:24,270
It's usually some kind of teak wood or

2796
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:24,590
something.

2797
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:27,130
If you'll notice that the ones that are

2798
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:31,810
more traditional, they have embellishments or markings on

2799
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:33,870
them, like little triangles that go on the

2800
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:35,110
end, across the length.

2801
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:36,390
I would say the embellished ones that are

2802
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:38,430
most common are the ones that have the

2803
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:38,750
cover.

2804
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:44,050
They're generally a trapezoidal wooden box that has

2805
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:45,430
a cover that folds down.

2806
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:49,550
Maybe they're engraved with faux gold.

2807
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:52,030
It'd be like a bas-relief kind of

2808
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:52,230
thing.

2809
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,770
But I mean the horizontal holders that the

2810
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:57,450
common people use, you stick the incense stick

2811
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:58,270
in horizontally.

2812
01:56:58,910 --> 01:57:01,770
It's meant to hold the stick horizontally, not

2813
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:02,310
at an angle.

2814
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:05,450
That's exactly what I'm talking about, actually.

2815
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:07,390
If you look at the bottom of it,

2816
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:09,150
there's cross-hatchings or triangle.

2817
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:12,690
The reason they're sticks is because they were

2818
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:15,630
to keep time, like an hourglass with sand

2819
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:17,110
or a lamp that burned a certain amount

2820
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:17,450
of oil.

2821
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:18,750
That was their timekeeping.

2822
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:23,710
So that the incense stick had to have

2823
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:26,070
a certain length and a certain thickness, and

2824
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:27,790
that was just a way to measure time.

2825
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,430
So in other words, that's another thing to

2826
01:57:30,430 --> 01:57:30,850
bring up.

2827
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:33,370
There are so many mechanical ways to measure

2828
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:34,770
time within a culture, right?

2829
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:39,170
So even when you go into the astral

2830
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:40,830
bodies, there are so many ways to use

2831
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:41,850
the astral bodies.

2832
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:46,710
In Exodus, it stresses the beginning of the

2833
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:48,450
month at a certain time.

2834
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:52,010
So anyway, and that was more of a

2835
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:55,390
universal timekeeping that you see in scripture, that

2836
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:57,550
you still see carried out scientifically, quote-unquote

2837
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:59,130
scientifically, nationally today.

2838
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:02,790
But each culture has their own variation of

2839
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:02,930
it.

2840
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,150
So anyway, it's good to understand what is

2841
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:08,090
lawful and then the variations of it, right?

2842
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:10,190
Yeah, absolutely.

2843
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:13,650
So what is lawful seems to have been

2844
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:20,070
provided not just to one culture, but to

2845
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:21,590
many in different forms.

2846
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:26,410
But at the same time, that lawfulness is

2847
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:33,310
being deliberately avoided, it seems, regardless of the

2848
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:33,630
culture.

2849
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:36,010
What's lawful is what are you using as

2850
01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:36,990
a reference, you know?

2851
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:40,690
And you use a reference based on that.

2852
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:43,030
That reference seems to have been provided to

2853
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:46,250
different cultures at different times in different ways.

2854
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:49,070
Because how do you keep a group of

2855
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:52,550
people that keep procreating over 6,000 years

2856
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,910
busy?

2857
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:54,990
Just make busy time.

2858
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:58,630
Do you ever think about how simple this

2859
01:58:58,630 --> 01:58:59,130
stuff is?

2860
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:01,770
Well, I mean, if they're procreating, they are

2861
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:02,110
busy.

2862
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:04,050
Yeah, they can be, yeah.

2863
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:07,050
They're doing it correctly.

2864
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,210
Yeah.

2865
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,330
Uh-huh.

2866
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:11,780
Okay.

2867
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:15,260
It's been, thank you very much for the

2868
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:15,780
conversation.

2869
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:17,000
Thanks for calling in.

2870
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:18,240
I appreciate it.

2871
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,620
I hope to do it again in the

2872
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:23,240
near future, but I've got to go.

2873
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,720
Thanks for coming, man.

2874
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:25,660
Yes.

2875
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,380
Thank you, Seth.

2876
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,020
Enjoy your meal.

2877
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,520
See you again.

2878
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,060
Thanks, Seth.

2879
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:29,180
Likewise.

2880
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,420
Bruce, and thank you.

2881
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,920
I put it in the text, but thank

2882
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,700
you very much for all you do, man.

2883
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:36,200
I greatly appreciate it.

2884
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,320
You're most welcome.

2885
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,840
You're most welcome.

2886
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,000
Go get your food while it's still warm.

2887
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:42,380
All right.

2888
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,340
I'll talk to you all later.

2889
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:43,780
Be well.

2890
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:44,200
See you, Seth.

2891
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:44,580
Be well.

2892
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,560
Well, we had a blast from the past,

2893
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:50,000
isn't it?

2894
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:50,260
Yeah.

2895
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:52,400
Ironically, we had two in a row there.

2896
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,460
May not be enough suffering backwards in time.

2897
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:55,900
That's good.

2898
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:56,500
That's good.

2899
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,220
You know, it always made me curious how

2900
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:03,000
they're doing, how their minds changed, what's new.

2901
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,900
And it was certainly a welcome to hear

2902
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:07,560
him again.

2903
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:09,320
Certainly.

2904
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:10,140
Yeah.

2905
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:10,800
Yeah.

2906
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,540
Quite the fellow.

2907
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:11,800
Yeah.

2908
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:15,260
It's always good to, like you said, bring

2909
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:16,920
people around that you've spoken to in the

2910
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,760
past and just go over things again because,

2911
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,320
you know, much, you know, there's change every

2912
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,120
day, of course.

2913
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:24,760
You know, when I say, of course, and

2914
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,400
I don't mean it facetiously, I mean, really,

2915
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,900
there's a lot of change going on.

2916
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,460
But at this time, how much is really

2917
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:30,920
changing?

2918
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:33,800
Well, if you understand there's a playbook and

2919
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,980
the way things are going to go, I

2920
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,280
think the change needs to be measured that

2921
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:38,920
way, you know?

2922
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:40,420
Exactly.

2923
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:40,880
Yes.

2924
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:41,660
Exactly.

2925
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:43,100
Mm-hmm.

2926
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:43,520
Mm-hmm.

2927
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,840
So anything else going on in chat?

2928
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,200
I'm just wondering.

2929
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:48,880
Not so much.

2930
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:50,220
No.

2931
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,380
We had, let's see.

2932
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:52,440
What do we have here?

2933
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:55,600
We got, we had a total of 15

2934
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,460
listeners at its peak, which is good.

2935
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:00,520
Okay.

2936
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,780
Three or four is fine.

2937
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,520
Yes, exactly.

2938
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,220
Exactly.

2939
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:07,680
I always say, why, you know, why go

2940
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:08,940
any further when you only have three or

2941
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:09,820
four people listening?

2942
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,880
Well, 15 means that we got five times

2943
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,620
as much, so, yeah.

2944
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:15,480
Oh, yeah.

2945
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:17,360
And here's the interesting thing, just so everyone

2946
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,760
knows, you know, people that do go into

2947
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:23,480
chat, I've gotten over 50, almost midpoint between

2948
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:25,780
50 and 60 emails in the past week

2949
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,660
regarding the chat, you know, where the new

2950
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:29,380
chat is, right?

2951
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,560
So that, what that does is when you

2952
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,120
go into chat and you see, what, five,

2953
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:37,160
six, seven people usually, you know, at the

2954
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:39,520
chat, you know, maybe a few putting things

2955
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,020
in here or there, a few, a couple,

2956
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,020
a couple, four, five, maybe a few, five,

2957
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,660
six sometimes, there's 50 people that come through

2958
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:49,380
at least, minimum of 60, maybe even 70,

2959
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:49,720
right?

2960
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:50,600
Yeah.

2961
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,420
That come through in and out just to

2962
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:55,220
give everyone an idea of how many minds

2963
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:58,120
read what's going on.

2964
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:00,020
So for everyone, I thank everyone who does

2965
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,600
contribute.

2966
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:04,500
And not to mention that, but when they

2967
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:07,320
do come, they're hitting the server at the

2968
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,320
same time, picking up some past Sonic events.

2969
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:13,560
It's all over the map as far as

2970
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:17,640
what they're grabbing, and it's all good.

2971
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,100
Yeah, I mean, if you ever told me

2972
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,120
there'd be 50 or 60 people coming on

2973
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,360
a chat coming through, I'd say, no way.

2974
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:27,000
There can't be more than four or five

2975
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,100
people that are able to listen to this

2976
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,040
type of stuff or this, the subject matter

2977
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,560
this way.

2978
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:32,360
There's no way.

2979
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,040
So that's 10 times over expectation.

2980
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,400
Right, right.

2981
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:37,980
You know, and what's funny, you know, you

2982
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:40,300
know, people are looking for thousands, you know,

2983
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:42,120
and I'm actually not looking for anyone, but

2984
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:45,260
I'm just saying that I'm pretty surprised that

2985
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:48,000
there's a consistent half a hundred or so

2986
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,440
that come around and find what's being said

2987
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,020
interestingly enough to be present.

2988
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:56,680
I mean, that's pretty, that's pretty astounding amount

2989
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:00,120
of people because what's being spoken of is

2990
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,180
usually that, you know, hey, did you ever

2991
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:02,780
think of this?

2992
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,100
And it's not something that's on the other

2993
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:06,660
side of the world or something esoteric that

2994
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:09,140
you have to rely on someone to tell

2995
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:10,880
you about it, but it's, hey, have you

2996
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,960
ever thought of this or looked at this

2997
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:13,380
this way?

2998
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:16,740
And it's stuff that's in your immediacy right

2999
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:17,740
around you immediately.

3000
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,880
I think it was nothing like farmers, you

3001
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,300
know, in a lot of ways, just throwing

3002
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,560
out the seed, you know?

3003
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:29,580
Yeah, but it's really the human crop is

3004
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:30,680
a very bad shape.

3005
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:31,320
It is.

3006
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,060
It is.

3007
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:34,660
But the seed is a manifestation to change,

3008
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:38,640
maybe open eyes, spark a question in their

3009
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:44,080
mind at some point and question.

3010
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:48,920
Just stop and look or just hear.

3011
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:52,040
And you have to remember, it's not for

3012
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,120
changing anything.

3013
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:54,160
No, no.

3014
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:56,760
But it's for appreciating the reality that you're

3015
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:56,960
in.

3016
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:57,760
Exactly.

3017
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,220
There's a big, yes, that's right.

3018
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,360
There's a big difference between those people that

3019
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,700
say they want better information to make the

3020
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:06,240
world better.

3021
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:09,240
And there's a bit and there's another mindset

3022
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,100
where you want to know the truth because

3023
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:13,520
that's a true appreciation of why you're here,

3024
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,660
whether it changes anything or not.

3025
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:16,960
Right.

3026
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:18,840
And that's a change comes all the better.

3027
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:19,280
Yes.

3028
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:20,840
But yeah.

3029
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:21,320
Yeah.

3030
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,120
You know what it's akin to?

3031
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:25,840
You buy an exotic race car that couldn't

3032
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,980
go 200 miles per hour or 300 kilometers

3033
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:29,520
per hour.

3034
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,520
And you know, according to what they call

3035
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,860
the rules of the road, you can't go

3036
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:37,780
fast, you know, speed limits, 65, 75, whatever.

3037
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,140
Right.

3038
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:38,380
Right.

3039
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:38,840
Yeah.

3040
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,580
So, but at least you can take it

3041
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:43,220
out to the track and go 200.

3042
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:44,340
And let it roll.

3043
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:45,860
Right.

3044
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:47,540
And take it to what it was made

3045
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:47,940
for.

3046
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,680
And that is home, by the way.

3047
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:51,200
It is.

3048
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:51,440
Yeah.

3049
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,560
Well, I'll tell you, I have lots of

3050
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:53,300
stories about that.

3051
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,160
I kind of figured you did.

3052
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:58,720
But you know, in the real world, if

3053
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:01,260
you have one of these super cars, guess

3054
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:01,540
what?

3055
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,740
What are you constantly reminded of?

3056
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,180
Speed limit, 75, you know, one over a

3057
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,780
third of basically what it can do.

3058
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:09,360
Yeah.

3059
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:09,960
And all that.

3060
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:11,920
But you know, at least you can take

3061
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,360
it out to the track once in a

3062
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:18,440
while and bring it to a realization of

3063
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:20,240
what it was really made to do.

3064
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:21,540
Not consistently either.

3065
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:22,340
Mm-hmm.

3066
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:26,480
You know, certain cars that are made that

3067
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:29,560
way because of safety concerns, when you do

3068
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:31,780
reach a top speed, they design the gas

3069
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:33,360
tank size that you run out of fuel

3070
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,060
after a certain amount of time, a short

3071
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:35,700
period of time.

3072
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:36,020
Yep.

3073
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,400
Designed that way because it's too much of

3074
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,080
a liability to run at that speed.

3075
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:43,380
And also, you know, just to give a

3076
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,900
short story, I remember once getting in one

3077
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,400
of these super cars, I'm like, oh, great.

3078
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,020
So we get on the highway and we

3079
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,680
start, you know, going over the 150 limit,

3080
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:54,980
not the limit, the limit 75, going over

3081
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:58,280
the 150 speed on the car.

3082
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:00,100
And once we hit over like the one

3083
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,540
between 160, 170, you felt like the doors

3084
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:04,780
were going to rattle off and the windshield

3085
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:06,000
was going to pop off.

3086
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,740
And I was like, what a piece of

3087
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:08,980
junk, you know.

3088
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:12,480
It doesn't tell you, just because the car

3089
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,300
is a super car and goes fast doesn't

3090
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:15,540
mean that it's going to do it well.

3091
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:17,180
Or for long.

3092
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:18,840
Or for long.

3093
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,220
Yeah.

3094
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:20,480
Yeah.

3095
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,620
So I just want to throw that in

3096
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:21,820
there.

3097
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:23,260
And you don't want to be a quote

3098
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,080
unquote passenger in one of those things when

3099
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:25,680
you're going fast.

3100
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:26,060
No.

3101
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:29,760
There's a reason why these cars have 400

3102
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,980
watt stereo amplifiers because it's so loud that

3103
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:33,540
you need that.

3104
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,220
You can't hear the music otherwise, you see.

3105
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:40,080
But they're not made to be comfortable.

3106
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,360
So hopefully when you do hear some Greek

3107
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,620
speak and whatever else, that you are comfortable

3108
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:47,020
and you do get the realization of what

3109
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:49,600
the mind is, either should have been or

3110
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,320
can't do or will do.

3111
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:53,320
Exactly.

3112
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:56,680
So much things to ponder on and so

3113
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,860
many topics that we want to address later

3114
02:06:58,860 --> 02:06:59,880
on, as you said.

3115
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,880
When the time is right.

3116
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,360
Mm-hmm.

3117
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:12,740
Well, the time, here's another way to address

3118
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:15,680
that, is the time to have done all

3119
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,320
these things is way past and gone.

3120
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,600
Oh, God, yeah.

3121
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:20,740
Yeah.

3122
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:22,140
It's too far gone.

3123
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:24,680
It's like the horse is not only out

3124
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,300
of the barn, but it's broken its leg,

3125
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:27,960
it's shot, and it's at the glue factory.

3126
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,020
You're not going to get it back.

3127
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:31,120
He's out redistribution.

3128
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:31,300
Get another horse.

3129
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:32,860
Yeah.

3130
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:34,720
The horse out of the barn with the

3131
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:34,900
horse.

3132
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,220
Well, I got news that it's at the

3133
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:36,820
glue factory.

3134
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:38,260
That's society and most people.

3135
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:41,380
But it doesn't mean that just because the

3136
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:44,460
time is over that you can't make best

3137
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,820
use of the time that's left.

3138
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:46,480
Exactly.

3139
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,200
That's the purpose in all this.

3140
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:50,920
Yeah, it's about best, the highest and best

3141
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:51,160
use.

3142
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:54,680
I always use that terminology, whether it's in

3143
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,920
projects or it's public.

3144
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,040
What's the highest and best use of something,

3145
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:58,380
you know?

3146
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,840
Right, right.

3147
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:00,380
Yeah.

3148
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,800
That's why, for example, I don't know if

3149
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,780
you remember the days of the Carter administration.

3150
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:09,200
They had made it very easy for people

3151
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,540
to go to college, and there was a

3152
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:12,480
flood of the market of PhDs, and people

3153
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,200
had a lie.

3154
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:14,560
I mean, they couldn't hire.

3155
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,720
They were overqualified for most jobs.

3156
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,300
So there were people with graduate degrees and

3157
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:22,200
PhDs that had a lie about their qualifications

3158
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,020
just to get a regular job to work.

3159
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:27,640
Even a stockbroker or something, yeah.

3160
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:28,860
Yep.

3161
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,160
That was a pretty big mess.

3162
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,380
Do you remember that time?

3163
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:33,780
Oh, yeah.

3164
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:34,800
Distinctly.

3165
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:35,340
Yeah, the 70s?

3166
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:36,180
Yeah.

3167
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:39,480
People with PhDs, they were starving, right?

3168
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:40,120
Right.

3169
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:44,040
So for example, imagine you go to get

3170
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,880
a job flipping burgers and you put on

3171
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,760
the resume to PhD.

3172
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:48,120
They're not going to hire you.

3173
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:48,380
No.

3174
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:48,840
Period.

3175
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:50,800
Right?

3176
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,920
But if you just basically finished high school,

3177
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,120
they'll say, yeah, we'll hire you.

3178
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:57,220
You see?

3179
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:00,620
And you got what you got, you know?

3180
02:09:01,460 --> 02:09:03,460
But at least you had something, you know?

3181
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,500
What I mean there is that that's the

3182
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:12,940
disposable, the equity and the value that people

3183
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:15,520
have set in the society is disposable.

3184
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,860
What I mean by that is- And

3185
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:20,780
they placed it upon you, especially if you're

3186
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,120
accredited in any way.

3187
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:23,900
Sure.

3188
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,180
What I mean is what people hold to

3189
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:29,340
be valuable and being the equity is really

3190
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:29,980
not so.

3191
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:30,980
No, no.

3192
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:31,940
Yeah.

3193
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:34,500
So one of the discussions, a lot of

3194
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:36,700
the discussions is how it's not so.

3195
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:39,380
Oh, yeah.

3196
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:43,790
Okay, what do you think we wrapped up?

3197
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:45,450
You can pick any topic.

3198
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:48,450
Oh, yeah, any topic.

3199
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:51,030
And you don't have to listen to anyone

3200
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:52,510
else what they have to say about it.

3201
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:54,730
Just go and see what they've memorialized about

3202
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:55,350
that topic.

3203
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:56,030
Yeah.

3204
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:58,370
And pick it apart a little.

3205
02:09:58,830 --> 02:09:59,870
In their own stuff.

3206
02:10:00,270 --> 02:10:00,490
Yeah.

3207
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:01,210
Yeah.

3208
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:02,610
It was in their own stuff.

3209
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:07,940
Well, we certainly have chewed the fat tonight.

3210
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:09,480
Good.

3211
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,360
Busting on two hours easy.

3212
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,060
Okay, great.

3213
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,780
So we have another one in the can

3214
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:15,820
for this week.

3215
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:16,120
Exactly.

3216
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,480
Maybe next week we'll get Sam.

3217
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:20,420
Maybe we'll get Seth again or we'll see

3218
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:20,520
how it goes.

3219
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:21,480
That would be something, huh?

3220
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:22,180
Okay.

3221
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:23,820
All right.

3222
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:25,680
Yeah.

3223
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:26,380
All right.

3224
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,620
Thanks for everyone who's contributed and all the

3225
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:29,600
work that you do as well.

3226
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:30,720
And we'll catch you guys again soon.

3227
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:31,420
You're most welcome.

3228
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,680
You're most welcome.

3229
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:34,340
All right, see you all.

3230
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:35,960
See you.

3231
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:36,320
Bye.
