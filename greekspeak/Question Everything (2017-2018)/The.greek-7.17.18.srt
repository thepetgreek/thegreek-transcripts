1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,060
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,900
I've got Greek with me.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,500
How are you doing tonight?

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,600
Hey, doing well.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,560
I figured we'd just do it, keep some momentum going.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,500
By the way, regarding the stream, I got an email recently about someone catching some viruses on the...

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,060
listen to my radio, and I went over there, and it did have a lot of junk.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,960
It did run into a very high, what do you call it, source-intensive peeking around cookies thing.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,160
So I had it.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,860
I wonder if maybe we should talk about this off the stream, because there's better things to talk about, I think.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,260
Certainly.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:01:00,000
But I wonder if we should, or you might want to change the way it issues into the public, because I had a link to it on the Uncommon site, and I took it down.

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,240
Right.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:13,440
Now, I wonder, because one of the services, and I think it's the one you're talking about, the talk, was it talk, something like that, and it's more...

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,320
Let's just stick to the one we're currently using.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,080
Yeah, the one we're currently using, because there's two flavors.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:37,920
There's the web-based, which is just a browser, and then the other one, which you had posted, which puts advertisements in there, or sometimes they'll pop up a quick advertisement, and then you have to literally X out of that advertisement in order to get the stream to continue.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,840
Right.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:50,460
I was totally unaware of that, but we could just stick with the web-based one, and maybe for people listening, that's the one I would choose, rather than using...

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,860
I'm glad you brought that to my attention, because that's...

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:09,139
Yeah, I didn't respond back on the email, because I think the person basically said something on the email, like, I clicked on one of your links, Greek, and I got some programs I can't get rid of now.

22
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,060
Well, that's...

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,620
Oh, great.

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:27,220
One aspect of that is basic, where I would say, well, then you better figure out how to use programs like iobit and ccleaner, and I should drop a link in the chat, how to remove a computer virus and malware.

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,300
There's a guy who did it.

26
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,360
He just put in some really good programs.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:42,260
The only thing is, if you use one of them, if you haven't used an application or a program in about two or three months, like Malwarebytes or something, we'll remove those programs.

28
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah.

29
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,320
But here, I'll drop a link in the chat.

30
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,020
And there's some real sticky guys out there, or sticky malware out there these days, and they're getting better and better as time proceeds.

31
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,240
As a matter of fact, it's funny that you kind of brought that up.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,620
But what they do, they still use the same old methodology, though.

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Correct, correct.

34
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,260
Which is, they try to come across as something that the computer...

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,840
Right, right.

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,420
Like a photograph or a graphic, yeah.

37
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,320
And then they unfold.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,100
Look at the old days.

39
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,260
You were able to send text in a JPEG, and if properly encoded, you could do other weird stuff.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:20,820
Yep.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,400
What was it?

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,020
It's routing, yeah.

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,720
Macro was an old thing, and that was a notorious little creature.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,600
It could be used for good or bad.

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,500
But I'm glad you brought that to my attention.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,360
I will certainly make an attempt to see if we can just strictly bring this to web-based.

47
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,000
There is no advertisements that I know of that I've ever seen pop up online.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,200
You won't.

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,940
You won't.

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,480
Right.

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:04:00,720
It's always clean because they know, basically, they'll see that, they'll sniff out that you're the administrator, and there's no reason to intimidate you with it.

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:14,100
And browsers inherently always had that problem that the minute you used them, you're assuming that you gave permission, depending on some of the attributes, like Flash or something like that.

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:24,680
My server, actually, one of the reasons that it was down was I had to delouse and get some things straightened away.

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,520
It was kind of acting buggy, so I took it down to make sure that that was addressed.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay.

56
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,760
Anything else going on?

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,620
Let's say it's outside of the...

58
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,820
I just haven't looked into anything in the chat.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
I haven't been around.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:51,420
I noticed, just in terms of, let's see, for gossip's sake, I see you've been, let's see, chatting here a lot lately, and I see that I'm scrolling up like 20.

61
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,340
We have a couple of new people, Reluctant Observer, Zeromit, MTX, who's that?

62
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,620
Okay.

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,160
There was a couple of questions that some of them posted.

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't know if I should scroll up since the last time I've been here.

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
Question for the Greek.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,440
You mentioned in the past about the Native Americans coming to disbelieve on their gods, which led to their inevitable destruction.

67
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,740
Has the same happened in Western world, or has it been replaced with Justicia?

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,900
Or, if so, is this a global displacement of the past gods?

69
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,840
I see someone here.

70
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,420
Hi, Emily, 29, female.

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,440
Rate my naked photos on sex dating.

72
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,700
Oh, yeah, that one popped in there.

73
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,140
Where is that question in time that you just read?

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,800
Is that recent?

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,160
Yes, I'll pop it to you.

76
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,760
I see.

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:52,540
Oh, here, actually, I think it's 2.41.17 p.m. today.

78
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,820
Question for the Greek.

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,920
That one you mentioned in the past, the Native, the one you just read.

80
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,320
It's just interesting to read it.

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,140
I get a little more sense of it.

82
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:07,260
But I heard you say, okay, regarding the replacement or the, what do you call it when you supplant something?

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,880
Yeah, of course.

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,440
It's kind of confusing.

85
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:24,560
I think I've given enough recitations on how the gods work and how humans work that one could piece it together, so I'm not going to answer that question because it's already been answered.

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,140
Right.

87
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,700
Basically, that's a question that is just answered in itself.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,860
I mean, yeah, the answer is there as well.

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,260
So, yes, the answer to that question is yes.

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,660
Yes, so.

91
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,540
It says, or if so, is this global displacement of the past gods?

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
Yes, across the board there, yeah.

93
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,840
The day the sun stood still, can you elaborate?

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,240
Yeah, not now.

95
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,700
That takes too much time because you have to understand the movement of the stars.

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,180
Greek mentioned that he would revisit the day the sun stood still.

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,240
You know, it's interesting.

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,300
There's so little knowledge of astronomy, even by astronomers.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,020
Is that so difficult to imagine?

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:16,660
There's so little knowledge of medicine by medical doctors, and there's so little knowledge of money through bankers, right?

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
Speaking of bankers, I see there's banking questions here.

102
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Yeah, Othello was relaying his fun times with the banking establishment.

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,380
Wow, that's interesting.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:40,720
Regarding the day standing still, I mean, I still have people that don't know, you know, speak to me that don't know the most basic stuff about astronomical movements.

105
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,700
I'm not talking about the bullshit NASA stuff, you know, what space is and the solar system.

106
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,420
That's all bullshit.

107
00:07:48,420 --> 00:08:11,160
But just the basic astronomical movements, like, for example, people are just, I think just because since I've been speaking, getting practical knowledge of what the purpose of the sun and the moon is in terms of other, you know, in terms of reckoning other than just providing heat and light and something to look at or other forces that imbue nature.

108
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,440
So, yeah, that's a, yeah, I could do that one day.

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,940
I have to, I have a lot of notes on it.

110
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,580
So, the banking, someone did some banking, they refused.

111
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,080
Is this the one of the lowest times I'm living in hell?

112
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,620
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
Checking account with my, oh, that's the problem with the language here.

114
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,720
My endorsed check, you see, right away this person's going to have problems.

115
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Without title 12, section 401, or why would you do it without, with demand of lawful money.

116
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,320
I don't get that.

117
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,940
My endorsed check without title 12, section 401, with demand of lawful money.

118
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,900
Okay, you can just do lawful money only.

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,280
That's a demand also.

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,180
Just like, you know, when you go somewhere, you know, they say only this, right?

121
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,760
Like, you know, like if you have the blue ticket, only blue ticket here, only red ticket here.

122
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,860
That's a demand, you know.

123
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,880
Right, right.

124
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,260
Okay, they refused doing business with me because I won't sign the electronic pad.

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,640
What?

126
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay, no, you don't, well, you don't kind of do it like that.

127
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,400
They said we cannot control P.

128
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,160
Oh, that's print.

129
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,460
It's not part of the system, so whatever it is, I signed void and scribbled my name.

130
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,580
That's another problem, my name.

131
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,000
They had three checking account options, direct deposit only.

132
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,100
I don't do direct deposit.

133
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
No one does direct deposit.

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,260
But anyway, option deposit with the bank teller.

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,060
I never got into what direct deposit really is, did I, Anasonic?

136
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes, you did.

137
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay, well, this is, I've done this with, this person here knows just enough to be dangerous but not to do it properly.

138
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,020
That's an open criticism.

139
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,680
That's okay.

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,700
You know what I mean?

141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,420
A little bit of information is not good.

142
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,200
It's like telling someone who hasn't seen an automobile before, well, here's the key, here's the pedal, here's the steering wheel.

143
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:12,400
That's fine, but it's not a, that's, and if you read later that they crashed the car or they ran over someone, would you be surprised?

144
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,740
No.

145
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,560
Yeah, this is something else.

146
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,260
But that's okay.

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,820
This is, you know, this is fine.

148
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,340
This is not on the KN82.

149
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,840
However, this is normal.

150
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,540
That's normal to go through that.

151
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,820
Actually, when I started rummaging through this stuff, I had, was like that as well.

152
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,520
And what that is, is you're not, you want to look dumb but be smart.

153
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,800
It's better than being, looking smart and being dumb like a professor or an attorney or a judge, right?

154
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,400
Right.

155
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,780
They look smart but they're dumb.

156
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
So, what you want to do is look dumb.

157
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,540
I mean, it could even go down to the point where you have to study enough to know what they have available to them.

158
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,400
So, instead of asking, you're asking and telling at the same time.

159
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,300
Right.

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,800
You know what I mean?

161
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,360
Right.

162
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:08,500
So, what you do with the, with, for example, you should write lawful money only per title 12 section 411 because that gives the legal basis for something to look up.

163
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,840
USC, just write 12 USC S, you know, 411.

164
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
You know how to write the section.

165
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,840
It looks like a dollar sign but it doesn't go through the S.

166
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,900
It's just the top and bottom.

167
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,960
Regarding the electronic pad, you just say, I'd like to do the written one because my accountant and attorney say I need it for tax purposes.

168
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:27,780
Correct.

169
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,120
Got to use the same lingo, Adam.

170
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
And if they ask you, why are you using this section?

171
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,920
That's just an old banking convection.

172
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
I do it for tax purposes.

173
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,100
Right.

174
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,120
Whenever you see tax purposes, they shut down.

175
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,840
They're like, okay, yeah.

176
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,580
Yeah, he's got permission.

177
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,120
Yeah, the electronic pad, okay, the thing, okay, there's something called the Paperwork Reduction Act, which they did after 9-11.

178
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
Actually, it started before that.

179
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,740
And that was to start, okay, let's just jump around a little bit.

180
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,760
They may not know as much as we do, meaning what people listen to Greek speak about what's coming on the world.

181
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,440
But they do know there's not a lot of time left.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,700
You know, the ones that are in control.

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,800
We're not talking about politicians.

184
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,200
We're not talking about Trump or Merkel or Putin or Saddam Hussein or anybody like that, right, or Fidel Castro.

185
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,800
They don't know.

186
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
I mean, they're just puppets, really.

187
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,600
They're leaders of the people, and when you're this simple, you know, slave type, that is as high as you can go.

188
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,260
Just like people who are into religion, they can only go as high as what's put in front of them.

189
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,720
They can't go to the next level because it requires five minutes of study.

190
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,580
Right.

191
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,840
And to have awareness, actually.

192
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,600
What's going on is they know that people are money.

193
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
You're just a collateral.

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Let's just say it that way.

195
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,680
Right.

196
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:57,860
And they like to play games, and when you're playing a game, you know, if you're losing, you take more chances than when you're winning, right?

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,020
And if you know the game is going to be over and everything else around the game is going to be over, you might as well play.

198
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,220
One of the things that the powers that be like to play with is what's called monetization.

199
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:19,080
And just to go back to this person's experience at the bank, which I've read at least 100 of these in the past 10 years, similar things, is this.

200
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,140
It's very simple.

201
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,620
There is no money.

202
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,340
There is no bank.

203
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,000
The first problem that you might encounter mentally is this person didn't go to a bank.

204
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,720
And I see when I scroll down, also you mentioned you have a bank.

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,460
There are no banks.

206
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:47,140
And what I mean by that is the Emergency Banking Acts from 1933, 1934, 1938, 1946, 1965, 1981, all those Emergency Banking Acts have never been resolved.

207
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,180
They're still in effect.

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
In other words, they're closed.

209
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,580
All the banks are closed.

210
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,020
They're just there like an office.

211
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,780
Like when you go to a movie theater, they have the little ticket booth.

212
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,120
That's in the movie theater.

213
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,460
What you have, if you pull out a 20, pull out a 20.

214
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,380
Do you have a 20 note or one of the newer notes?

215
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,660
Hold on a second.

216
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,180
Pull it out.

217
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,800
I want you to read what it says on there.

218
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,380
It doesn't say Federal Reserve Bank.

219
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,060
What does it say?

220
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Note, I believe.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,240
No?

222
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,820
Let's see.

223
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,560
I don't have a 20.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,620
I've got everything else.

225
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,680
I've got a stack of them here holding the door open.

226
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,170
Federal Reserve Note.

227
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,190
Actually, you have to look on 100.

228
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,530
Sorry.

229
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,850
On the 100, it says Federal Reserve Note.

230
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,270
It's the one where they have it parked over to the side and the signatures are on the same side.

231
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,030
It says Federal Reserve System.

232
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,330
Oh.

233
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,290
It's a system.

234
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,250
Yes.

235
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,890
The banks have been closed.

236
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:08,670
Whenever you see the term bank, it just means they're leaving it up because people are so stupid that you might as well not.

237
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,070
Okay, so the system is about monetizing you and your behavior.

238
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,430
Now, you can monetize something that you own.

239
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:25,370
That's why no government or corporation will deal with you unless you produce a social security number, which is attached to the title to your body, which is the birth certificate.

240
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:26,870
Right?

241
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,530
It's just about property.

242
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,190
They don't care if you live or die.

243
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,470
The only thing they care about is can they monetize you.

244
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,010
The problem becomes when they make more money when you're dead.

245
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,610
Ha ha ha.

246
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,670
That's why you have bad food.

247
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,710
That's why you have bad medicine and bad law and all.

248
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,570
You have no law.

249
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,850
Also, the term legal through history, you could look this up.

250
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,190
It's kind of hard on the Internet.

251
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,750
Whenever the word legal was brought up, it had to do with property, contracts, or slaves.

252
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,590
Free people use the word law.

253
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,510
And if you go in society, all they care about is what's legal or illegal, right?

254
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,330
All right.

255
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,490
So get it out of your mind that these are banks.

256
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,550
Get it out of your mind.

257
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,710
What they're doing, it's an elaborate hoax, right, not on you.

258
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,170
There's a difference when you're hoaxing someone.

259
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,570
It's a hoax for you because if they didn't hoax you, you wouldn't know what to do.

260
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,630
So you need the hoax.

261
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,570
You see what I mean?

262
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,330
Mm-hmm.

263
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,730
To keep you comfortable.

264
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:40,350
So if you think you're going to go and mitigate for yourself this condition, because you're not going to change anything, right, and deal with it in a way that it's real, you're going to end up with unsuccessful.

265
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,590
But if you know, like, for example, here's another thing.

266
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:55,470
When I see the cops beating somebody up, that has to be that way because if it wasn't, if the state that the people are in right now, there would be utter chaos.

267
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,890
You need to have brutality to manage these idiots.

268
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,210
You see what I mean?

269
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,850
Right.

270
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,930
It's the same old thing.

271
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,010
But he's not beating up.

272
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,069
It doesn't offend me when I see the cop beating the guy up for no reason because he's not doing that for me.

273
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,310
He's doing it because it's an example of what level society is on.

274
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,030
Right.

275
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,650
You see what I mean?

276
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,329
Mm-hmm.

277
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,490
When I see the church and the priest and all.

278
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:20,910
Instill that belief.

279
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,589
Well, yeah, to maintain the social order that exists.

280
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:33,670
See, the people that are running the show, which no one, I mean, for sure, people on this listening don't know who they are because they haven't done the research.

281
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,270
It's not hard to figure out who they are.

282
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,690
Who they are doesn't matter because whether you know who they are or not, you're not going to be able to affect it.

283
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,650
Right.

284
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,030
But they are honorable to a certain degree.

285
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:59,110
But let's go to the next subject because banking requires you have to be a really sharp listener, like before the mini televisions, you know, the iPods or whatever they're called mini televisions now also, and the rectangles and all that.

286
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:09,110
People were judged, like in engineering circles, if you saw an engineer with a lot of pencils in his pocket, that's like the guy who you go to when you want to discuss problem solving.

287
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:09,670
Right.

288
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:19,990
The guy who had a chocolate bar and his glasses in his shirt pocket with one pencil, he's the kind of guy you put aside and you wait until you figure everything out and then tell him and don't count on him getting it.

289
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,910
So that's why I always joke around.

290
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,730
You want to find a guy with at least three sharpened pencils in his pocket.

291
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,890
That dates me to the child of the 60s and early 70s.

292
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:37,230
I was brought up on slide rule until the Texas Instrument and the HP-11C came out later, a little $200 calculator.

293
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:37,790
Remember those?

294
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,890
Reverse pulse notation.

295
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,070
Texas Instruments.

296
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,810
I noticed that the nerds were nerdy for a reason because, you know, these outcast types, right?

297
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,430
Right.

298
00:18:48,430 --> 00:19:01,790
So if you understand that being not part of this society and dealing with it on a higher level, based on the level that it was set up for, then you'll be successful, you see.

299
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,210
Right.

300
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:10,970
But if you want to go in and do things your way on a system that is set up to be the other way or similar to what you think, it's not going to work ever.

301
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:13,850
Yeah.

302
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,490
There's a lot to discuss on the banking.

303
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:23,190
And I think I'm the only person on the Internet or the rectangle that's actually come out and discussed – actually, I know this for a fact.

304
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,850
People have searched what I've been saying for years and they haven't found any of it.

305
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:34,410
But I can prove it on how money is really transferred from account to – you know, when you deposit a check for $100 and then you see that it's taken out.

306
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,690
I mean, write a check for $100, let's say.

307
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:36,910
Right.

308
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,190
And you see they debited it.

309
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,790
You think that they actually took it out of your account and sent it to someone.

310
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,330
No, they didn't.

311
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,890
You see, they still have it, but they can't show you that because – right?

312
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:56,590
So, there's no – because this is on a need-to-know – let's say 99% of the stuff that I've discussed is not useful to 99% of the people.

313
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,730
You get why, right?

314
00:19:59,770 --> 00:19:59,930
Right.

315
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,230
Because it talks about how things really work.

316
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:12,110
Now, if most of the people have been bred and raised to believe in hoaxes, regardless what the subject is, the anti-hoax material doesn't jive.

317
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,050
Right.

318
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:23,310
But anyway, running head first and all feet and hands forward into something that is not what it really – what you think it is is going to always cause trouble.

319
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:24,690
Right?

320
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:32,410
Like, if you run into them and you think they're a bank, you're not going to succeed negotiating or doing business on the terms that are favorable to you.

321
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:39,270
Just like, for example, if you don't know how to drive a car and someone shows you – or operate – let's just say operate an engine-driven wagon.

322
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:39,970
Right.

323
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,750
And someone just tells you, this is the brake, this is the gas, this is the steering wheel.

324
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,230
You think it's a car.

325
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:45,830
No, it's not.

326
00:20:45,910 --> 00:21:09,990
What that really is is a shaped and formed metal and glass and rubber with a reciprocating engine that simulates hundreds of – or a hundred horsepower at least, that represents a hunk – a two-ton or one-and-a-half to two or three tons sometimes – a hunk of metal rolling down the road, which in ancient times that would be called a siege work.

327
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,890
That's something that you use to take down a crowd of people or drive through a wall.

328
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,610
You see how – I see them as weapons, cars.

329
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,270
They're not really transportation devices because of the potential damage that they do.

330
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:37,650
Not that I think they should be weapons, but they potentially – I see them as doing more harm than good once the thing gets flipped over and it goes into the lack of responsibility, lack of control, right?

331
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,070
Right.

332
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,590
You see?

333
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,030
I don't – people say it's a car.

334
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,730
I'm like, yeah, to me it's a ton-and-a-half or two tons of metal and things formed that can track and roll on the surface of the earth.

335
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,730
It's not very good at stopping.

336
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:58,870
And the basic – what they call Newtonian physics, which is bullshit anyway, takes effect.

337
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:11,430
So just like would you be surprised if someone had never seen a car before and you told them this is the steering wheel brake and gas, go down the road, and would you be surprised if you heard the next day they ran into something and damaged?

338
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,610
Not too much.

339
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,730
No, you wouldn't be surprised because they were just introduced to it and they didn't contemplate really what's going on.

340
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:17,870
No.

341
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,770
Okay, the same thing – here's another thing.

342
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,290
Let's get a little semi-cryptic now instead of full-on cryptic.

343
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,590
When you go to the doctor, it's the same thing with dealing with the banks.

344
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,290
When you go to the court, it's the same thing with dealing with the banks.

345
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,130
When you go to university, it's the same thing you're doing with the banks.

346
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,910
You get it?

347
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,510
Yeah.

348
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,610
The doctor is not a doctor.

349
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,630
It doesn't matter what color Robey wears or whatever.

350
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,630
He works for the state, which is a part of another system that most people know nothing about.

351
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,210
The university works for the state.

352
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,010
They're there to satisfy the need.

353
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,510
The court, same thing.

354
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,470
None of these things that you see around you – how many times have we discussed the church as the circus?

355
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:12,770
There was a high level of reverence and sacredness connected to the ancient circuses, the same thing that they're doing right now.

356
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,990
Are you living here and part of it, or are you visiting here and don't want to be part of it?

357
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,170
There's a big difference, right?

358
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:24,970
Right.

359
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,530
It doesn't mean you're not going to partake.

360
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,410
For example, today I was asked to prepare a dish for a potluck thing for somebody.

361
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,390
It was a white people thing.

362
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,170
I was like, do you want to go?

363
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,890
I was like, hell no.

364
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,510
There's no way they could produce any good food, and I was correct.

365
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,470
That sounds like you're very pessimistic, right?

366
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,250
Well, I'm realistic.

367
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,890
Actually, I brought back some samples of the stuff.

368
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,810
I was like, oh man, I was right.

369
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,670
Could I be surprised that there might be white people having a semi-decent edible potluck?

370
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,790
It's possible.

371
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,430
It might have happened, maybe, like Halley's Comet.

372
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,950
Blue moon.

373
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,450
Yeah, which doesn't make sense either.

374
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,970
Blue moon is two full moons in a month, right?

375
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,390
Right.

376
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,090
It's an oxymoron.

377
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:30,210
Either way, I would suggest that once you start looking at things as they are, the thing is you might want to ask for what they really are, not what you think they are, based on what's presented as their usefulness.

378
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:42,810
Because something like a bank is presented as being usefulness to you, and if you have to use it, well, you could go this route that we saw in the chat, or you can contemplate it.

379
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,630
And also, you might have to go to what's reasonable.

380
00:24:46,850 --> 00:25:02,210
I found when people first start learning how to deal with money, the difference between money and credit, because you're not going to get either, really, because you're being screwed with the credit also, and I've never really got into how they're screwing you with that.

381
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,350
That's a whole other level.

382
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:21,210
But once you start seeing what's going on, I would say two to three banks is what you're going to be going around to, shopping around, talking to them and all that.

383
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,910
Don't go into one and settle in just because you don't like to let them do what they do, right?

384
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,130
I know for a fact there are some people that have been working on Wells Fargo.

385
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,210
Wells Fargo, by the way, they're in the spotlight now.

386
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,150
They're getting spanked for many years now for a lot of money laundering stuff.

387
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:40,930
Here they all are.

388
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,290
Right.

389
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:50,990
Anyway, the money laundering aspect is all the drug dealing and all the pedophilia and all the human trafficking and all that.

390
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,910
You're not allowed to do that, but that's because it's their bread and butter.

391
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,590
You see?

392
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,270
Anyway, not that you should want to do it.

393
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:15,890
But anyway, Wells Fargo, they've been worked on in several ways where if someone comes in and is quite polite and quite reasonable and it does get over to legal, they do comprehend the USC 12411, 411.

394
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,130
They do comprehend that, right?

395
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:24,890
The worst ones would be like Chase, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America.

396
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,570
Those are the worst that I've heard of.

397
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,870
A lot of the smaller ones, all banks seem to charge around $15 a month.

398
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,150
Anyway, commercial banks can charge as much as $75 a month for a commercial account.

399
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,590
I had one of those a long time ago.

400
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:52,770
To make a long story short here, doing the thing with the bank is like saying, Bruce, where can we find a church to go to that is proper?

401
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,390
That's like Blue Moon.

402
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,390
It's an oxymoron.

403
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,230
It is.

404
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,130
Just by the nature of what we just used the description on, right?

405
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,690
Yeah.

406
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,570
Another thing, I think I've been giving out enough information just to make people dangerous, not useful.

407
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:19,390
I mean, at one point there was someone I was working on, even though I knew it wouldn't be a success, but it doesn't mean you don't stop, just like the white people with the potluck, right?

408
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,110
Right.

409
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,090
You do it anyway.

410
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:30,930
Regarding the Title 12, Section 411, and he had to go to some government office, and he wanted to use cash or whatever, and he did.

411
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:36,110
I said, why don't you just slip him a piece of paper with all the serial numbers on the cash and give it to him?

412
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,810
This person, after working with him for quite a long time, still didn't get it.

413
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,030
I said, what happened?

414
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,130
He said, well, I gave him the paper and the cash, and she asked me, what should I do with this?

415
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,670
And the paper had the Title 12, Section 411, and the serial numbers, right?

416
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,330
Right.

417
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,190
I don't want to put you on the spot, but are you aware of how to properly document cash?

418
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,830
I remember the conversation well, yes.

419
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,890
Okay, good.

420
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,670
All right, so he gives it to the clerk, and the clerk says, well, what am I going to do with this?

421
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,510
And the guy responds, well, I don't know, whatever you want.

422
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,090
Wrong answer.

423
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,110
The clerk just crumbled it up and threw it away.

424
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:06,910
Ooh.

425
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,670
What's the right answer?

426
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,330
That is for your records.

427
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,010
Right.

428
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,290
So the person I've been talking to about this for like a long time still didn't get it.

429
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:30,330
So, I mean, how long do you talk to someone, like if you have a baby, how long do you try to keep them, how long do you work with them until they learn to walk?

430
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:34,550
Well, whether it's a week, two months, or five years, or seven years, right?

431
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,050
Right.

432
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,330
But these people are not babies.

433
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,570
These people are not babies.

434
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,970
I wish I was a fly on the wall.

435
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,730
Why does everyone want to be a fly, right?

436
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,510
Right.

437
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,710
I think I heard this from Seinfeld.

438
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,610
Why don't you just walk in like a man?

439
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,950
You're not a baby learning how to walk.

440
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:48,750
Right.

441
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,830
So I realize it's not wasting time because it comes back on me in a way that's good.

442
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,470
Like often, you know, I'd go on these calls and even sonic events, like, Greek, why are you still doing this?

443
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,490
You know, no one's really listening or understanding anyway, you know, these morons, right?

444
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,910
I'm like, well, you ever think that I'm actually doing it for selfish reasons?

445
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,630
I'm practicing, maybe, you know, for something that might be real important in the future?

446
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,790
Mm-hmm.

447
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,490
Right?

448
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,370
Right.

449
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,290
So, but, you know, that's why.

450
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,950
It does take a level of investigating before you even try to take that step forward.

451
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,450
Oh, yeah, most people never get it.

452
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,630
You know, when I say never, it's in the condition you're in.

453
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,530
Now, if it was 200 years ago, it would be people won't get it for 200-plus years.

454
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,570
You know, if it was 1,000 years ago, you could say people won't get it for 1,000-plus years.

455
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,230
But fortunately, because of the time period you're in now, you're going to get it, but you're not going to get it the way you think it is.

456
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,310
You know, you're going to have to be given a new body, and I mean spiritual body as well.

457
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,190
Mm-hmm.

458
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:55,530
You know, so it's sad, but, you know, it's not.

459
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,390
It's not.

460
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,110
Would you rather know the truth and deal with it however?

461
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,030
You know, everyone deals with information differently.

462
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,150
Some people might panic.

463
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,470
Some people might be apathetic.

464
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,470
Some people might get angry.

465
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,490
Some people might get sad.

466
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:07,670
Right?

467
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,290
Mm-hmm.

468
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:17,650
But still, when you get the truth, you react to it in everyone's capacity, emotionally, emotional capacity, according to the character or spirit of that individual.

469
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,490
Correct.

470
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:32,950
And I've noticed that most people have the dumb bug or the stupidity so deeply entrenched that it's best to just leave it alone because their lives would be simple.

471
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,690
It wouldn't be a point ever.

472
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,810
You know what I mean?

473
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,550
Right.

474
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,430
So their lives would be much more simple.

475
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,530
But on the other hand, let's just make a long story short here.

476
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:53,470
Anyone who does try it and has a hard time with it, it's better from an altruistic point of view or from an honorable point of view, it's better to have known.

477
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:00,030
Anyway, I think most people will say, well, I can't do it like you, Greek, or I can't do it like this guy.

478
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,110
Well, would you rather have not known about it?

479
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,710
They still say, no, I want to know.

480
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,010
And you learn from your mistakes.

481
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,430
And hopefully it doesn't affect you too bad.

482
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,830
Yeah, you're not going to really learn from your mistakes.

483
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:20,290
No, very few people actually do because you have to have a very good memory and you have to be a good record keeper, meaning mental records, to learn from your mistakes.

484
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,070
I see most people just repeating the same.

485
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,010
I see most people doing what they're doing is a mistake.

486
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,810
So most people, in other words, they don't even know what they're doing is the mistake.

487
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,750
And what they think is the mistake is really not.

488
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,090
It's usually an insufficiency that wasn't taken through.

489
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:37,670
Right.

490
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:43,650
Unless you actually make a bad choice, like you're on a TV show, like the price is right and you choose the wrong curtain or something, right?

491
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:43,930
Correct.

492
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,550
Then it's different.

493
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:54,190
So I really enjoy law discussion, money discussion.

494
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,090
And when I say law and money, that goes back to scripture, of course, and all that.

495
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,670
Not in a rabbinical sense because they sit there and split hairs on everything.

496
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:20,790
I like to look at the scope of it because these things like law and money are far-reaching principles that go into everything in terms of motivating people and human behavior.

497
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:34,830
That's why, for example, when somebody sends me something regarding someone, no matter how good it is, if they don't know how the money system works or how law works, there's only so much they can do.

498
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,890
Like look at Jack Fresco.

499
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,970
He had no idea on how the money system worked.

500
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,610
Right.

501
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,830
I mean, not any more than anyone else.

502
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,630
Well, it's paper money.

503
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,070
Yeah, whatever.

504
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,090
They don't know how it works.

505
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:51,930
So that's why nothing ever worked out for him.

506
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,570
And I'm not saying that's why, but if you knew how the money system works, there's no way this would work.

507
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,490
It's so entrenched, so deep.

508
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,570
Or the law.

509
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,950
See, most people don't know law because they're not entitled to it.

510
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,530
If you have a birth certificate, you're not entitled to law.

511
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,630
You're entitled to what's called rights.

512
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,030
Because you're already, you're just a piece of property.

513
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:17,850
Right.

514
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,670
You see?

515
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,590
Yeah.

516
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,090
So there is none of that.

517
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,730
Since when are slaves entitled or property entitled to banking?

518
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:26,850
Huh.

519
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,770
That's like an old thing.

520
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:29,930
Never.

521
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,610
That's why the banks have never, they never bothered reopening them.

522
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,570
Yeah.

523
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:39,350
Now even a college professor, if you took this to Harvard, would say, the Greek is ridiculous.

524
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,670
Of course the banks are open.

525
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,590
That's how stupid they are.

526
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:49,310
So if your academicians, your high-level intellectuals are stupid, what does that leave you?

527
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,390
Not doing too good.

528
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:52,530
Yeah.

529
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,450
So again, you know, why bother?

530
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,130
So I see that going on.

531
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,690
So what else have we got in the questions?

532
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,730
But anyway, kudos to the person who went to the bank and did it, but they didn't do it right.

533
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,630
Well, they didn't do it right, no.

534
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:16,070
They didn't do it wrong either, because actually they should have just walked in like everybody else, because the result on the end was the same.

535
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:16,850
Right.

536
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,370
Right.

537
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,909
And they're probably going to get shafted by the taxman if they don't comply.

538
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,250
Oh, yeah.

539
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,690
So they don't know how to do it.

540
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,409
Yeah, you better learn how to keep records.

541
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:27,489
Real good.

542
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,949
Because they're not, see, you don't have to be honorable with a slave.

543
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,489
There's no reason for it, because they're just peace property.

544
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,889
You don't have to be honorable with a car.

545
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,409
You know, so what?

546
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,610
You crash the car, big deal, there's insurance for it.

547
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:55,409
There's no honor, but when you start acting like you're not a slave, but not a rebellious slave that's freed on his own terms, but on the real terms, which are lawful terms, then things will work.

548
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,390
But not the way you think they are, but they will work out.

549
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,130
You see?

550
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:08,770
Because what happens is, also another thing here, most people are too used to dealing with people that are too low on the bottom rung or the ladder or the totem pole.

551
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:21,450
Whether you're dealing with medical, scientific, academic, banking, legal, religious, most people you'll be dealing with the bottom low level leadership administrative.

552
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,990
You're dealing too low.

553
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,130
So your priest, your minister, is too low level.

554
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,470
He's the grunt.

555
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:35,150
When you're dealing with the bank, in the banking community, they have the grunts do the new accounts and the tellers.

556
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,250
You just want to open the bank account with the manager.

557
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,190
You call in.

558
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,490
I'm such and such, Mr. Such and Such.

559
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,070
I'd like to find out who's the manager's name.

560
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,570
I speak to him.

561
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,350
I'd like to set up an appointment to initiate business with your institution.

562
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,170
Right.

563
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,410
Not your bank.

564
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,910
Because also if you look up, I can't get off this bank thing.

565
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,150
Banks are not banks.

566
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,150
They're considered...

567
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,730
What are they?

568
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:01,930
Institutions.

569
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,250
You know what they are legally?

570
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,490
Well, yes.

571
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,930
But legally, what are they called?

572
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,050
An association.

573
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,930
They're not corporations.

574
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,010
Yes, they're a national association.

575
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:10,810
Yep.

576
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,430
What else is a national association?

577
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,190
Sierra Club.

578
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,990
Burl Scouts.

579
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,230
Yeah.

580
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,210
Burl Scouts.

581
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,130
Boy Scouts.

582
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,690
Yeah.

583
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,610
Look up a list of national associations.

584
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,370
They're not...

585
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,490
Now, these national associations do have corporations.

586
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,090
Yes.

587
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,170
That's why if you have a credit card, you never get a bill from the credit card company.

588
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,150
It's always a corporation that is using the credit cards.

589
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:42,010
That's another thing I need to share one day is how to really stick it to these guys from that direction.

590
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,050
But, yeah.

591
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,670
When you get an American Express bill at the end of the month, that has nothing to do with American Express.

592
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,030
That is someone using their letterhead.

593
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,730
And it looks authentic.

594
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,850
In a corporation, yeah.

595
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,650
Yep.

596
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:04,310
And not even by American Express's permission, but by the permission of the attorneys of American Express.

597
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,310
There's a difference now.

598
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,010
Yeah.

599
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:14,110
Imagine having an attorney, Bruce, run your affairs, and he starts doing stuff that you are not supposed to be doing.

600
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,350
Does that ever happen?

601
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,310
All the time.

602
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,350
I've seen that happen.

603
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,250
Yeah.

604
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:19,670
Yeah.

605
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,810
Oh, my.

606
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:22,510
Mm-hmm.

607
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,720
Mm-hmm.

608
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,780
All right.

609
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,480
What else we got?

610
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
Question for the Greek.

611
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,680
Sounds painful.

612
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,640
Same with my bank.

613
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,580
Oh, you got a bank.

614
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,140
Let me see.

615
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,360
Rephrase.

616
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,780
Same bank would I go to.

617
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,060
Okay.

618
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,300
Good.

619
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,580
Yeah.

620
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,400
Because if you have a bank, you shouldn't have a problem.

621
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,560
If you have your own bank.

622
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:47,820
Right.

623
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,920
See, that's why the language.

624
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,160
As soon as I see my, this, I, that.

625
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,680
I got away.

626
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,280
I caught myself right away.

627
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,640
That's slave talk.

628
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,700
Yeah.

629
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,720
Enoch.

630
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,800
I'll leave that.

631
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,180
Yeah.

632
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,240
Enoch, you know, there's a lot of controversy on it.

633
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,840
It's all wrong.

634
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,400
Book of Enoch?

635
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,540
Book of Enoch has nothing to do with Enoch other than it is an oral tradition that has been written.

636
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:19,960
Mm-hmm.

637
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,200
Book of Enoch, Book of Yashar, which is the Book of the Upright, Yashar.

638
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:23,780
Right.

639
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
The Book of the Upright.

640
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:31,620
Those are literary records of what the priests spoke about during the First Temple era.

641
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,940
Yeah.

642
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,440
Okay.

643
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,200
Just like, or maybe earlier, slightly earlier, during the time of judges as well.

644
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,980
That's like having a book on what the, you know how firemen stay overnight, say 40 hours straight, 50 hours straight at work.

645
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,380
Mm-hmm.

646
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,660
They don't go home for three days, right?

647
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,080
You know how that works, right?

648
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,600
Or fishermen.

649
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Right.

650
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:50,660
Yeah.

651
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,260
They have plenty of time to talk.

652
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,260
Imagine the firemen putting out a book on, you know, what things we talk about at the firehouse.

653
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:56,820
Okay.

654
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,120
It doesn't mean it's not worth reading if you're interested in firefighting, but it has a lot of juicy stuff.

655
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
You're not going to get anywhere else, right?

656
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,580
Right.

657
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,320
Because it's people that work in it.

658
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,240
So that's what you're going to get out of it.

659
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,420
Okay.

660
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:17,240
All of it is, I mean, I'd rather read that than read Melville, you know, or any other human author.

661
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,780
You've got to keep the context.

662
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,940
It's a literary work.

663
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,040
It's not inspired directly.

664
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,400
It's not given, there's no angelic dictation given like the prophets were.

665
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:29,960
Mm-hmm.

666
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,630
Okay.

667
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,370
So Enoch was taken and not dying.

668
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,070
No, incorrect.

669
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,390
Enoch has died.

670
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,650
Anyone that has been taken up into heaven has died unless it tells you they haven't.

671
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,610
And the secret to that is very simple.

672
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:53,790
Either you look in scripture where it says that this one will remain until, right?

673
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,010
Or it tells you that there's a spirit of that person.

674
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,750
So there's two people in scripture who have yet to die, not died.

675
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,410
One is because it's direct order to remain until he's coming.

676
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,190
Right.

677
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,810
And the other one is because there's a spirit that holds them.

678
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,070
So if I said Bruce, Bruce got taken up, the company car, right?

679
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,630
The company car, the whirlwind, right?

680
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,010
Right.

681
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,550
Yeah, came and got you.

682
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:28,330
And it was also said that he will return in the spirit of Bruce.

683
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,490
Okay.

684
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,350
Or the spirit of Bruce will return.

685
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,870
Right?

686
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,310
That's where you get the term spirited when someone is taken away.

687
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,390
Right, right.

688
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,970
That person is still alive.

689
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,070
Okay.

690
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,450
Right.

691
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,990
Okay.

692
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:52,670
So there's two people that have not died because one has been actually discussed thoroughly that he will remain until a certain time.

693
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,650
And the other one was spirited and the spirit of that person needs to return.

694
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:05,490
Because, okay, I think I've done enough in the past few years of sonic events to give an idea of the order and how things work, right?

695
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,230
And just to recap really fast, if you see a god, you die.

696
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:15,390
The closest ones to the most high, even his direct angel has that effect.

697
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,310
The one that is his body double.

698
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:17,990
Right.

699
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,950
If you see him, you die.

700
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,930
Walking with someone is not necessarily seeing them.

701
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:24,850
True.

702
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,050
I remember once in the 80s there was a politician.

703
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,230
They closed the whole road down and he was going through in a limousine.

704
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,170
I'm not going to say it was very high level in America.

705
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,010
And I yelled something out.

706
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,030
He rolled down the window and he says, come on, walk with me here.

707
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,270
I've got to say something to you.

708
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:41,990
And I did.

709
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,990
But did I go in the limousine?

710
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,590
Was I 25, 30 feet away?

711
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,250
Yes.

712
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:48,910
Wow.

713
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:49,550
You see?

714
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,610
If I tried to touch him, what would happen?

715
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,290
Secret Service would shoot me dead, right?

716
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,290
Oh, yeah.

717
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,930
Get it?

718
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,110
Yes, I do.

719
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,730
Same thing here.

720
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,590
If you see the gods or are in their presence, you will die.

721
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,950
Period.

722
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,150
Doesn't matter who you are.

723
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,830
Thank you for the clarification on that.

724
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,010
That helps.

725
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,590
Well, no, that's fine.

726
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,890
There's two people that have been retained and it discusses how and why.

727
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,590
And it's not Enoch and it's not Moses.

728
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,010
Right.

729
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,450
And I think that's God.

730
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,370
Now, do you know who they are?

731
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,750
Or you don't have this rhetorical question, don't bother answering.

732
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,430
Okay.

733
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,670
There are two people in scripture.

734
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:35,370
And they will make an appearance again while most people who are listening to me are alive.

735
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,570
Hopefully.

736
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,090
To some degree.

737
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:38,890
Right.

738
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:40,910
Yeah.

739
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,330
And also, it's not going to be one of these secret appearances because apparently the whole world will see them.

740
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,430
It says.

741
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:53,090
So when it says the whole world, it's through the little mini television you put in your back pocket or your shirt pocket.

742
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:53,730
Yeah.

743
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,050
Okay.

744
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,030
So let's see what else have we got here.

745
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,430
That's most of it.

746
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,110
The rest of it is you.

747
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,310
Let's go further back.

748
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,290
Is there anything else?

749
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,950
We've got 13 people on the chat.

750
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,090
Yeah.

751
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,010
There's a question about the biological vacuum.

752
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,150
We've got Emily call in.

753
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:25,990
Yeah.

754
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:35,570
I was going to say the last time when you hung up, a person called in just maybe 30 seconds after you hung up.

755
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:41,010
So that was bad timing.

756
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,450
Let's see.

757
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,310
Haven't you noticed?

758
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,570
Hey, haven't you noticed?

759
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,930
I think I know who that is.

760
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,530
Okay.

761
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,670
Judeans are Judeans because they live in an area of Judea.

762
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,710
It does not mean they are ethnically a tribe of Yehudah.

763
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,650
Yahshua, Joshua, the 12 tribes of Yehudah.

764
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:55,750
Okay.

765
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,410
Are you guys familiar with that message there?

766
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,710
It's pretty long for a message.

767
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,470
Yeah, that's right.

768
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,030
Judaism is a culture and they made it a religion.

769
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,550
Very good.

770
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,810
Someone's on their toes.

771
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:08,810
There.

772
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,410
Yeah.

773
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,650
The Jew thing is a tradition thing.

774
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,250
All of it is a tradition.

775
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,870
If you go and talk to them about anything, they're like, eh, we don't care about that.

776
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,930
This is tradition we're keeping.

777
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:29,930
If we were all screwing each other up the anus long enough and it became a tradition, you'd come here and that's what we would be doing.

778
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,710
You see, it has nothing to do with any law.

779
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,870
Whatever they pick and choose is what they do.

780
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,520
If you want screwing up the anus, that's the Catholic Church.

781
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,380
Sorry, by the way.

782
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,840
The Jews do a lot of it, too, and it's religious.

783
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,400
Sleepaway camp.

784
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,700
Yeah, I was molested during sleepaway camp.

785
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,540
Oh, yeah.

786
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,780
I've never been to that.

787
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,660
Shit's been going on since time immemorial.

788
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,620
All right, let's go back.

789
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,480
I think we're going back to about a week.

790
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:11,780
Not much.

791
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,180
There's tons to talk about.

792
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,720
I'm constantly researching and contemplating and meditating on stuff.

793
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:36,220
I think just doing the sonic event is just keeping some kind of momentum with no purpose other than it's there to do.

794
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,000
I think it's therapeutic for at least one or two people.

795
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
I get emails regarding that.

796
00:45:51,580 --> 00:46:00,060
I've got bragging rights on saying I've got more on the rectangle in the order of a hundred to a thousand times more than what anybody else has put out ever.

797
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,580
In terms of subject matter and accuracy and precision and all that.

798
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,300
More than a hundred times.

799
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,580
I've looked at stuff.

800
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,180
I'm like, this is ridiculous.

801
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,520
In other words, not because I'm special.

802
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,540
Anybody can do it.

803
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,140
The Greek-speak stuff, what I just mentioned in terms of bragging.

804
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,640
Anyone.

805
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:26,280
You don't even need a cape or any superhero powers or anything.

806
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,480
It's real basic stuff.

807
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:38,160
Once you get a hold of the basics, you understand that there's not even complexity in a negative sense.

808
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,740
But this wonderful fabric of things that weave together, everything is intertwined.

809
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,180
Most people have no idea that the medical system is run by the legal system.

810
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,080
In other words, they say they don't know that.

811
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,620
But they do hear it constantly.

812
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,000
If you've ever been around a doctor, he says, legally, I can't say that.

813
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,440
How many times have you heard that?

814
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,400
Just the very order.

815
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:10,760
The same thing with your food is controlled by the lawyers and the bankers.

816
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,020
By the way, there are no bankers, so the lawyers are the bankers.

817
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,660
Whenever you have a problem with a corporation or financial institution, where does it go?

818
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,720
Legal.

819
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,660
Yes, they're the ones running it.

820
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,140
And no one cares to notice.

821
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,260
They have noticed that, but no one cares to notice it.

822
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,240
Probably a lot of intimidation, I would think.

823
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,180
With words.

824
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,760
When they bring out the guys with the guns and the brutality, that's because you failed with the words.

825
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,700
Right.

826
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,840
You see.

827
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,160
We need another Greek or an Italian or a Spaniard.

828
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,380
Forget about Greek-speak.

829
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,700
We need Spain-speak or Italian-speak.

830
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,760
Why don't we get somebody else out there?

831
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,700
Why does it have to be race or nationality?

832
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,800
Nationality, yes.

833
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,400
Just have somebody else come here and start talking.

834
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,140
You're not going to get it from all these other idiots.

835
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:29,460
So we need a non-idiot to get on the rectangle and do some sonic events.

836
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes.

837
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,960
Which is hard to find.

838
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,760
It doesn't exist, by the way.

839
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,220
You'll have some people here and there.

840
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,480
Most of the stuff that's good on the internet, by the way, on the rectangle, is very narrow.

841
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,180
Shallow, some of it, and some of it deep.

842
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,640
Very, very restricted in subject matter.

843
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,700
Once they go outside of the subject that you deem to be good, they fall apart like everyone else.

844
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,020
You know what I mean?

845
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:56,760
Right.

846
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,620
Sorry, guys.

847
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,260
Humanity sucks.

848
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:14,260
What is dwelling on the surface of the planet other than the insects and the animals and the trees and other misanthropes?

849
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,060
If you're misanthropic, I don't blame you, but I don't think you're that smart anyway.

850
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,760
I'm not talking about being smart.

851
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,720
Are you noticing anything?

852
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,760
The answer is no.

853
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,740
I see it all the time.

854
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,640
No matter where you are in the world, it's the same.

855
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,120
It's getting more and more homogenous.

856
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:44,440
What you do have underpinning that homogeneity is the various different traditions still underpin it.

857
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,900
In certain countries, if something was never done, you're not going to find it there.

858
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,560
Especially if it's something that's going to be introduced that goes against their traditions.

859
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,640
Like, let's say, pigs in Israel.

860
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,060
You don't even import them.

861
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,100
You're not going to see that.

862
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,440
Right.

863
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:08,760
Or photos of people with the bottoms of their feet showing in Muslim countries, because that's showing the middle finger, right?

864
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,460
Right.

865
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,020
Otherwise, they're being more and more homogenized.

866
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,680
So, no questions or anything?

867
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,200
I think we'll just make another short one.

868
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,620
Otherwise, I'm going to have to start volunteering subject matter, which I'm not doing anymore.

869
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,820
No more new subjects, I think.

870
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,140
If people have questions, that's fine.

871
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,420
But I'd like to just get off this planet.

872
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,040
My spaceship doesn't look like it'll be finished any time soon.

873
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,720
A couple of times, I thought I had it right.

874
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,900
Where do you go?

875
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,800
Anywhere but here.

876
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,200
When you're in a real shithole of a planet, or you ever see a movie where they're in a bad neighborhood, it's like, go!

877
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:52,940
Where are we going?

878
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,360
Anywhere.

879
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,100
Just get out of here.

880
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,060
Just get out.

881
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,380
Yep.

882
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:06,120
And it's more of what they're not doing that makes it a shithole than what they're doing, believe it or not.

883
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:17,860
Because the possibilities of what can be done, that is not being addressed, is much greater than the bullshit, crap, vile crap that they're doing.

884
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,100
It's much better, and much more variety, and much more possibility.

885
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,800
We've got a call coming in.

886
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,760
Hold on.

887
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,240
I'll take that guy off the air here a second, Greek, and I'll let you continue.

888
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,540
Is it a Skype or a phone call?

889
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,500
It's a phone call.

890
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,060
Hold on.

891
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,680
If you've been on before, tell us you've been on before.

892
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,680
Otherwise, we'll call it a day.

893
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,050
Hey, Greek, we've got a call coming in.

894
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,170
Yeah?

895
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,590
You think you could hear us?

896
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,570
One second.

897
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:58,650
I'm going to patch us through.

898
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,730
Okay, there you go.

899
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:03,550
You're on.

900
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:07,970
Go ahead.

901
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:09,670
Can you hear them?

902
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,350
Yeah, I'm getting an echo here.

903
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:14,590
There we go.

904
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,310
What could he possibly say?

905
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,110
Okay, go ahead.

906
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,370
Yes, I believe so.

907
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:22,470
Okay.

908
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,970
No, I don't hear anything.

909
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:26,510
Do you?

910
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,750
Greek, can you hear Valerie?

911
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,190
Oh, it's Valerie.

912
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,610
Great.

913
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,610
I'd love to hear Valerie.

914
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,730
No, I cannot hear Valerie.

915
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,330
Okay, there we go.

916
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:35,930
Now we've got you.

917
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:36,710
No, I can't.

918
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:38,790
Okay, now I hear Valerie.

919
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,410
I think we've got you.

920
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,010
Now we can hear you.

921
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,530
Okay, you're having troubles there.

922
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,670
She's having trouble.

923
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,570
One second.

924
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,590
We'll get you in there one way or another.

925
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,050
Okay, how about that?

926
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:50,770
I'd like to hear from Valerie.

927
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:58,850
Well, I had asked if I could call over a regular telephone.

928
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,670
Sure.

929
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:06,050
VoIP phone, and it's really not working on my end.

930
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,530
Okay, but could she hear us?

931
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,270
Yeah, I believe so.

932
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,390
Can you hear Greek?

933
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,190
You're breaking up really bad.

934
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,190
Oh, okay.

935
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,630
Just call back.

936
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:19,810
Just call right back.

937
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,330
Okay, okay.

938
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,550
I'll try.

939
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:23,970
Okay, bye-bye.

940
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,890
We'll see if we can get her in here, Greek.

941
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:37,130
Yeah, I think Valerie is somebody that contemplates and is working on the crap.

942
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,650
Most people are quite happy with their crap.

943
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:44,920
Okay.

944
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:45,620
Hello?

945
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,220
Is that a Skype ring?

946
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,320
I hear it loud and clear.

947
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,650
I like it.

948
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,710
I like the effects.

949
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,480
Yeah.

950
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,940
There we go.

951
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:03,800
Good.

952
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:10,380
Well, I'm going to try to get on my Skype because I hear my voice echoing in the phone.

953
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,060
Okay, duplexing.

954
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,300
I apologize.

955
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:15,580
Can you hear us?

956
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,460
I'm going to try to get on my Skype and call in.

957
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,620
Okay, see you soon.

958
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay, okay.

959
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,840
Okay, we'll get her in here.

960
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,320
It's a deplorable thing, but it works.

961
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,380
Everything on Skype is recorded.

962
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,320
Everything, everyone, all the time.

963
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,700
Yes.

964
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,040
Everything is, and it's not for any malicious reason.

965
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,100
If you ever met any of these older government types, not the young ones, they're too brainwashed.

966
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,100
The older ones, which I realize it's all been bullshit, especially people in the military.

967
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,980
I still can't believe how people thank people for your service.

968
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:58,160
If you've ever spoken to anyone in the military that actually did anything or was half awake, they'll say, oh, it was all bullshit every time.

969
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,520
It doesn't matter what war it is.

970
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,080
Even the Civil War.

971
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:10,660
There was a bunch of stuff in the early 2000s, Civil War letters, and stuff that they were putting up as archives and basically talking about this is all bullshit.

972
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,000
They took all that stuff down.

973
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,560
It's all bullshit.

974
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,690
If you understand the NSA, CIA, and all that, it's all about monetization.

975
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,120
Right.

976
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,580
There is no crime.

977
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,000
The worst crime that anyone committed in this world is what?

978
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,820
To be born in it.

979
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:30,760
Right.

980
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,940
You're a criminal when you're born.

981
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,160
What the hell do you do?

982
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,460
You didn't have to do anything other than that.

983
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,680
Just be born.

984
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,860
Yeah, how do we know that it's a criminal affair?

985
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,040
Not because I say it.

986
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,420
It's on paper.

987
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,360
Where do you see that?

988
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,800
It's a criminal affair.

989
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,540
On the birth certificate, the mother is the informant.

990
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,380
Mm-hmm.

991
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,000
That's your crime.

992
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,100
That's right.

993
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,320
So anyway.

994
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,820
And whose planet is this anyway?

995
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,400
Right now, legally.

996
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,400
Satan's planet.

997
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,500
Ha ha.

998
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,860
What's that laugh in South Park?

999
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,080
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,980
Yeah, there you go.

1001
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,820
Yeah.

1002
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,420
And those are things that people will never, ever, ever, ever even comprehend.

1003
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,100
Ever.

1004
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,420
Yeah.

1005
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,640
Sad.

1006
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,920
Makes the spaceship look really good.

1007
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,160
It really does.

1008
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,460
Oh, yeah.

1009
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,580
Food, clothing, shelter, folks.

1010
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,540
It's just a show.

1011
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,540
I wonder if she's going to try to contact you or...

1012
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,320
I think you.

1013
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,180
Oh.

1014
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,480
If you just...

1015
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,240
I don't know if you could shoot a message to her.

1016
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:59,040
I think I have someone here, according to the contacts, that might be...

1017
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,300
I don't really remember.

1018
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,660
I only have about 25 or 30 people here, I think.

1019
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:12,200
I don't really remember what her handle is, the handle she uses.

1020
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah.

1021
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,500
I can't remember right offhand either.

1022
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,780
But we had another lady that wanted to call in and didn't and dropped off.

1023
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,000
You said you fixed it.

1024
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,500
And actually...

1025
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,620
That was Nicole, I believe.

1026
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,460
I'm going to add her to group call, see what happens.

1027
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,080
Okay.

1028
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,140
Because it's the same handle.

1029
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,140
Right.

1030
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,590
I'm calling her, so...

1031
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:38,910
Okay.

1032
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,810
Yeah, so if she picks up...

1033
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,180
There we go.

1034
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,060
Valerie.

1035
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,880
No sound.

1036
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,080
No sound.

1037
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,020
Check the mic.

1038
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,540
You could just hit the green button and get off, Valerie, and do a mic test.

1039
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,560
Skype test.

1040
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,860
Yeah, do the Skype test, see if you're working.

1041
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,760
I'll drop it in the text box for you, Valerie.

1042
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:17,880
Actually, if it doesn't sense a microphone in a speaker, it won't even allow you to log on or use it.

1043
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,720
So I just dropped in Valerie in the text box.

1044
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:21,800
Yes, I see that.

1045
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,220
Echo, yeah.

1046
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,280
Echo test, yeah.

1047
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,130
Give her a few seconds to run that through.

1048
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,970
Well, she's still on, she can't run it while she's on.

1049
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,870
Right.

1050
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,070
She can't run it while she's on the call.

1051
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,190
So I'm going to drop...

1052
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,770
Drop her, and then that'll get her off.

1053
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,590
Yep, she dropped.

1054
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,850
Okay, on her own.

1055
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:52,550
Okay.

1056
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,720
Nephilim, complicated.

1057
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,140
Yes, very.

1058
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:09,800
Complicated, but I would resolve it as, if you understand the sons of gods, if you understand other manifestations other than human manifestations.

1059
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,680
Yeah.

1060
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,060
It's within that understanding.

1061
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,440
Now, the comprehension there is minimal.

1062
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:25,020
Because it goes back to the, when I say pre-Adamic, Adam means red, by the way, or flesh in general.

1063
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,520
You know, let's play around a little bit.

1064
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,940
I've been around a high level Eastern Orthodox Byzantine religious order leadership.

1065
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:44,060
And I asked them about the biblical stuff, and they said, no, the church that we have, it came before the Bible.

1066
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,980
And I had to think about that.

1067
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,300
I didn't say, no, it didn't.

1068
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,760
I didn't act belligerent.

1069
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,040
But I thought about it.

1070
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:56,020
And what's interesting, why he said that, and he knew I could handle it, and maybe use it later.

1071
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,220
Well, because what we call the Bible started with Moses, right?

1072
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:00,980
Right.

1073
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:06,220
And that would have been roughly 1500 BC, so roughly 3500 years ago.

1074
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,900
You know, on the outside, 4000 years ago, not really, but yeah.

1075
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,600
Right.

1076
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,160
So it was 3500 years or less.

1077
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,760
35 was conservative.

1078
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Do me a favor, go and look up what is the Byzantine year.

1079
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:26,440
Okay, but before, in the meantime, for people listening, the Byzantine Eastern Orthodox year, what year is it?

1080
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:33,620
Because biblically, we're in the year 6020, around 6020 since Adam, right?

1081
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,380
Right.

1082
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,860
But what is the Byzantine year?

1083
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,860
I know the Assyrians have something that's more than 6020.

1084
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,120
The Byzantine year is around 755-something.

1085
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,980
How did they get that?

1086
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:52,480
How is it 1500 years more than Adam?

1087
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:53,400
Right.

1088
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,080
Well, the seventh day was the day of rest.

1089
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,000
Right.

1090
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,940
And the sixth day was the day when man first comes on the scene.

1091
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,120
So they're starting their calendar when the first man comes on the scene.

1092
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,160
Okay.

1093
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,080
From the sixth day.

1094
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:08,960
Right.

1095
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,460
Right, which is the seventh, right?

1096
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,360
Remember, it's six and a half.

1097
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,600
Six and a half, right.

1098
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:25,040
They're starting their calendar before the seventh day of rest, before Adam was made, when the first man was made on the sixth day.

1099
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,420
You get it?

1100
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:30,320
Because 7500 years ago puts you right in the middle of that sixth day.

1101
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:31,420
Right.

1102
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,420
Yep.

1103
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,240
I wonder what she's doing here.

1104
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,500
Anyway, okay, so just go right over that like it was no big deal.

1105
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,540
No, no, no, I was just seeing if there was anything in there.

1106
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,960
Yeah, okay.

1107
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:58,680
But you see the stuff that's going on right under, I mean, obviously the Byzantine year doesn't mean jack because they're a bunch of idiots anyway.

1108
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,400
But at this point, it's an interesting thing to note from a coincidental coinciding with, right?

1109
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,180
Right, and they entrenched themselves with getting their stuff out.

1110
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:22,060
Well, anyway, anyone that's done more than a day's worth of research cumulative on the biblical text knows that Adam was around 6000 years ago, and the year would be around 6000.

1111
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,900
So these guys go back 1500 years.

1112
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:37,180
They bypass the whole seventh day, which was the day off, and they go into the middle mark, the high mark of when mankind was created.

1113
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,680
Because remember, Adam is not created, he's formed.

1114
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,600
He's right.

1115
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,020
Yeah.

1116
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:47,460
And fortunately, I've been having some interesting discussions recently on Skype regarding that.

1117
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:56,600
People that know the Hebrew as their native, and they're going back and they're telling me this thing shows up more than you've even spoken about Greek.

1118
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,880
It shows up here, it shows up there in Hebrew, right?

1119
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:07,040
They see it, that there's a big difference between being formed in the garden and being created man and woman.

1120
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:07,820
Right.

1121
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:13,340
See, because man and woman were created, and they were given a job, and their job was to what?

1122
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:14,820
Take care of the garden.

1123
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,220
No, no.

1124
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,100
Oh, be fruitful and multiply, right?

1125
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,120
And then there was a day of rest.

1126
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,820
And they were not named either.

1127
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,940
They didn't have any names.

1128
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,260
And they were made at the same time.

1129
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,380
And then there's the day of rest, this thousand years of rest.

1130
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,620
And then there's another guy that's made by himself, and he's given a name.

1131
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,140
He's the only one that's made male.

1132
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:49,060
And he is given a specific job, which is to mow the lawn, prune the trees, take out the garbage, right?

1133
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:49,820
Right.

1134
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,740
Take care of the garden.

1135
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,840
No woman was made.

1136
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
And he was not created, he was formed.

1137
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:07,820
And this scenario of being created and formed, and the formed comes up again in Genesis 5, and in other places.

1138
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:14,660
I've been having some pretty interesting discussions regarding that, with people whose native tongue is Hebrew, by the way.

1139
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,880
Not someone who's running back and forth in an interlinear, you see, so.

1140
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,180
And you can see what's being discussed in an interlinear as well.

1141
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,380
So I just wanted to throw that in there.

1142
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,000
Okay.

1143
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,640
I don't know about the difference between Adam and the other.

1144
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,480
But I don't think they know about it, but it's suggested in their year count.

1145
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,600
Let's just put it that way, right?

1146
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,040
Right.

1147
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,260
Did you find it, Bruce?

1148
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,600
It's around 75-something?

1149
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,400
I came across some other stuff that did not go.

1150
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,340
Byzantine calendar year is?

1151
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,380
Oh, hold on.

1152
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,880
My fat fingers don't work here.

1153
01:04:59,540 --> 01:04:59,840
Yes.

1154
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Year 2000.

1155
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,040
Okay, time and date.

1156
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,860
Oh my goodness, what do we got here?

1157
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,540
That didn't work.

1158
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,360
No, hold on.

1159
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,560
Roman, Byzantine, Western.

1160
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh, I got everything but Greek.

1161
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,400
Sorry.

1162
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,480
And people that I know.

1163
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,900
Somehow, I did not get it correctly.

1164
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,640
Well, if I'm giving it to you on a silver platter and you don't get it, what do you think is going to happen?

1165
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,140
No, no, no.

1166
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,920
I was looking it up.

1167
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,240
I know, I'm just joking.

1168
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,240
It's just a commentary on humanity.

1169
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,100
It's still fine, Bruce.

1170
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,460
In other words, if I spoon feed you and you can't get it, what are you going to get on your own?

1171
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,280
Right.

1172
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,620
Well, I was trying to find it on this stupid rectangle and needless to say, I ran into it.

1173
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,920
It's just a general commentary.

1174
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:53,740
It's okay.

1175
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,300
I know you've got a lot of other stuff you're doing, but in general, anyone could find it.

1176
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,000
I shouldn't say anyone, but it is discoverable.

1177
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:02,520
Okay.

1178
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,700
The Assyrians go back 6,700.

1179
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,040
They don't know what they're doing.

1180
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,040
There's no reason for it.

1181
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,380
They have their own reasoning, but it doesn't add up.

1182
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,580
Just like two dimes and a nickel don't make a dollar.

1183
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:13,400
Right.

1184
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,640
But either way...

1185
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,420
Oh, here we are.

1186
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,120
7526.

1187
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:26,800
Roughly.

1188
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,100
Yeah, it's about the halfway point of the sixth day.

1189
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,260
Right?

1190
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:47,280
Yeah, that would put you on the sixth day of creation, 500 years in, where these cats were running, or men and women were already quite into their groove.

1191
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,000
So how does that tie back in?

1192
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,580
You want to go back 10, 15 minutes?

1193
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:59,020
Say, well, a memory serves us with the Nephilim and the sons of gods, and who was Cain afraid of?

1194
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,040
Right.

1195
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,860
And why did he go to the cities of refuge?

1196
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,160
What cities of refuge?

1197
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,540
If you study the cities of refuge given in the law, those are cities that were established back then.

1198
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,380
What was the mark put on Cain?

1199
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,100
You see?

1200
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,460
It's not a mark, physical mark.

1201
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,760
It's a mark, meaning it's a methodology.

1202
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:24,320
You know?

1203
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,360
Why wasn't Cain put to death if it says that if you kill someone you're going to be put to death?

1204
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,080
Right.

1205
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,300
Well, because it has to be qualified.

1206
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,080
Well, it's easy if you know the law.

1207
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:38,400
If you kill someone maliciously, you're put to death.

1208
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,920
But if you kill them by accident, you're not put to death.

1209
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,540
You can't no longer exist there because their blood might be avenged.

1210
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:47,180
Right.

1211
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:54,040
So did Cain say, I'm going to go out and kill my brother, or was he just angry with them, kicked his ass, and he happened to die?

1212
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:54,780
Right.

1213
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,780
The second part.

1214
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,780
So if you don't know the law, you will never understand these things.

1215
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,860
The other thing is, you know, it was about offerings.

1216
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,700
And you have to think that the gods now are dwelling amongst the people, right?

1217
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,340
There was no supernatural thing for them to do an offering.

1218
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,840
It was a very interactive thing.

1219
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,040
You know, something was left by his door.

1220
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,380
You know, anyone could research what I'm saying, but I'm just trying to bring up the points to look at.

1221
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,000
Sin was left at his door, at Cain's door, and he refused it.

1222
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,420
Right, I'm using the King James Version.

1223
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:35,180
Okay.

1224
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,240
So what was sin?

1225
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:38,680
A ram.

1226
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:41,899
How do we know sin is ram?

1227
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,660
Well, it's defined in other places, isn't it?

1228
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:44,700
Mm-hmm.

1229
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,540
Let me just add a little more to that.

1230
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:06,779
A ram is not sin, but when there is sin or shortcoming, remember sin is a shortcoming, it was left.

1231
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:10,479
In other words, to compensate for the shortcoming was a ram, to be sacrificed.

1232
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,260
Mm-hmm.

1233
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:18,460
When you bring an animal to be offered, that represents the shortcoming.

1234
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:19,200
Right.

1235
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,620
That's one thing that people have a hard time comprehending, is the word sin.

1236
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,580
It just means shortcoming.

1237
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:38,200
You know, if you say you're going to be, let's say, somewhere at 9 a.m. exactly by the wind-up toy, if you're there at 9 a.m. in two seconds, you just sinned, you were late by two seconds.

1238
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:38,859
Right.

1239
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,300
That's how precise it is, right?

1240
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:41,220
Right.

1241
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:48,340
Or if you go to an archery range and you said you're going to hit the bullseye and you don't, guess what you just did?

1242
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,340
Shortcoming, right?

1243
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,060
Right.

1244
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,779
It's just a shortcoming.

1245
01:09:51,680 --> 01:10:04,080
But the level of guilt and malicious intent behind the word sin within the Judeo-Christian, actually all of the religions that do use that, is malicious.

1246
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,780
It's inaccurate.

1247
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:12,420
It's just like recently someone was trying to have a conversation with me regarding consciousness and unconsciousness.

1248
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,300
I'm like, dude, there's nothing to talk about there.

1249
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,800
That's so stupid.

1250
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,940
Consciousness means you're awake and unconsciousness means you're asleep or dead.

1251
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:30,360
What the New Agers are trying to do, and I guess I'm branding this a New Age thing, they don't want to use the word ignorant, censored, stupid, stubborn.

1252
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,080
When you say, oh, this guy's not conscious of it.

1253
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,440
No, he's not conscious of it because he's ignorant.

1254
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,000
Right.

1255
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,100
Just use the proper words.

1256
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,120
Ignorant, unawares, uneducated, stubborn.

1257
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,460
Not unconscious.

1258
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,100
Unconscious means you're unconscious.

1259
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,140
Using the same word to define it.

1260
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,640
Yes, it means you're sleeping without dreaming or you're dead.

1261
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,100
You know how the New Agers say, oh, consciousness, man.

1262
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:57,980
What consciousness?

1263
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,560
Qualify it.

1264
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,460
There's no qualification.

1265
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,460
See, they try to mix the quality and the quantity.

1266
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,360
It's just bizarre.

1267
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,500
Humans are just bizarre.

1268
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,080
Okay, Valerie, are you coming?

1269
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,020
She dropped off.

1270
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,600
Well, she's not showing.

1271
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,100
So let's just say maybe we could do it next week.

1272
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,460
She hasn't texted either.

1273
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,080
Maybe Valerie could work on her Skype etiquette.

1274
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:22,700
Okay.

1275
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:26,860
If she doesn't have a keyboard either, just give us a message.

1276
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,060
Give her maybe another minute.

1277
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:28,880
Sure.

1278
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,780
Just use a keyboard if you can hear us.

1279
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:38,560
Or when you're trying to get the audio and the visual stuff together, use the keyboard to let people know you're still there.

1280
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,140
Otherwise, we don't know what's going on.

1281
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:42,540
Great.

1282
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,020
Yeah, we call it virtual etiquette.

1283
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:46,900
Mm-hmm.

1284
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:52,760
Otherwise, I'm going to just call it whatever.

1285
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,780
Another useless sonic event, let's just say.

1286
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,680
Spinning the bytes and the bits, right?

1287
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:01,700
Mm-hmm.

1288
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,360
All right.

1289
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,440
Oh, I see someone did put in 7525.

1290
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,360
Thank you for doing that.

1291
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,260
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,160
So yeah, they know.

1293
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:22,060
I don't think they know anymore, but they know enough, but not enough to invite them on to do a sonic.

1294
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,360
I don't want to talk to any Byzantine whatever.

1295
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,340
Mm-hmm.

1296
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,740
There are people that know more than what's noticeable, but they're not talking.

1297
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:41,400
No one's talking or speaking, you know?

1298
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,260
Mm-hmm.

1299
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:46,820
All right, man.

1300
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,320
We'll see you next week.

1301
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,240
All righty.

1302
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,400
Take care, Greek.

1303
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:50,860
Bye, thanks.

1304
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,600
Thanks, Bruce.

1305
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:51,880
Bye now.
