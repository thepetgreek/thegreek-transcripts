1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:18,070
And we're on live with the Greek and good evening Greeks, yes Yes, good evening late late afternoon some places of places all over the night.

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,090
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,470
Yeah.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,510
Yeah, okay, so What's cooking?

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:31,630
I I don't frequent Chats, I don't frequent Emails that much I check them about once a week There's not much.

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:41,290
There's nothing on the uncommon site I no longer link to the streams because a lot of red that site tends to Carve, you know dump a lot of stuff.

7
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,970
So just kicking back So, uh, there's many things to discuss.

8
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,130
I've been working on some interesting very interesting

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,350
Projects, it's really a singular project but involves many things like for example, if you're working on a car

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,870
You know, it's it's thousands of pounds of rubber steel and glass, but they're formed into forming different functions

11
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,230
This has to do with a sound recreation I've worked with a

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,750
Company called TBI to be I sound for a long time more than 12 years

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,870
Indirectly designing I designed some other stuff

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,910
Assisted with them and I've left

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,550
Working with them completely because I've noticed that anyone in the industry has to follow the industry and

16
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,610
reality no longer

17
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:34,070
Well, let's just say what people are doing in industry is does not reflect reality again, let's go back to the car

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,170
Ask any car mechanic or engineer to tell you what a car engine is and they're all wrong

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,310
Some will tell you well, it's a machine.

20
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,630
It's an air pump.

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,950
The only one says it's a reciprocating combustion.

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:02:05,410
It's none of that right It's it's very simple very it's basically anything anytime you set something in motion It wants to go to rest it doesn't mean rest does not always mean not moving rest just means a Pressure mediation of balance of pressure you see, right?

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:17,490
So if you have something that is creating extreme vacuum on one side and extreme high pressure on the other For it to balance out it might balance out and yield a positive pressure, right?

24
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,170
It's kind of like saying what's minus six and plus four what's minus two?

25
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,250
It's balanced out But it's still on the minus side, right?

26
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,170
So when it comes to things like sound for example You know, there's a for it.

27
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,710
There's a tree make sound in the forest

28
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,130
No one's here to fells and no one's there to listen to it

29
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,230
Well, there's you could look at it practically and practically

30
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,350
The only reason we perceive light and sound is because we have the organs to do so

31
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,670
right like the eye in the ear correct and if you understand how the ear works and

32
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,910
It's attached to a body that has tonality bone muscle blood

33
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,970
Water plasma minerals all these things.

34
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,850
Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:10,070
So when you're listening to reproduced sound Typically have stereo setups except for everything's going the opposite way There's disregard for it now with a little Bluetooth devices and cell phones, right?

36
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:23,210
But what people fail to recognize you that everything produced in reality is produced in mono When you there's no stereo like when you have a clarinet playing as one clarinet, that's mono There's no left and right anything, right?

37
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:23,850
Right?

38
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:33,630
So the idea of stereo, you know is to capture the source from two Receivers known as microphones and play it back on a similar setup to create the holography of sound right?

39
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:57,310
Hello Holography I call it right Okay, so ultimately no matter how you're doing whether it's multi-channel or single channel The tonality of the devices meaning the loudspeakers producing the sound must be in line with the human body Otherwise, it'll create fatigue I've been around like high-end audio systems where I think the most expensive system.

40
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,870
I've been around In someone's house to reproduce sound was about half a million.

41
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,690
This is a living room sound system, right?

42
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,030
Right and the average audio file could be anywhere between ten thousand to a hundred thousand.

43
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,350
That's fairly average For a stereo home stereo, right?

44
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,990
Mm-hmm.

45
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,149
Now all that's high-end.

46
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,510
That's like saying cars, you know, Ferrari, right?

47
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:31,150
You can't listen to any of that high-end stuff for more than 15 or 20 minutes without being irritated because it's made out of aluminum beryllium titanium various forms of compressed wood Right, right.

48
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,110
So what and also all the modern loudspeaker drivers have aluminum and plastics in them

49
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,530
Yeah, and the tonality regardless of the music that you're playing the tonality that is given off

50
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,090
Will irritate you like for example if you've ever seen any old rock and roll bands

51
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,410
They go on stage and they have these guitars and the lacquer finish is worn out

52
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,270
And mm-hmm

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,090
Why don't they refinish it because it sounds different when you do it, right?

54
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:10,230
Just putting a coat of lacquer on a an acoustic instrument will change in what type of lacquer it is And we also talk about what the Stradivarius the way they can't duplicate it It's because of the formula that they use to seal the wood, right?

55
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:18,430
Okay, and they can't tell the people what the formula is because it would be viewed as offensive vulgar and criminal, right?

56
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:33,010
Let's just say it has to do great, you know one human sacrifice, but it make a long story short Speaking to someone recently and there's Medicaid makeups that have human placenta and foreskins in it You know 400 bucks for a little bottle of facial cream, right?

57
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,350
Oh, you can look it up online It's it's anti-aging cream.

58
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,970
So it's not too far off but make a

59
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,670
short story long here

60
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,550
We noticed that

61
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,790
You're when you want to reproduce sound you want neutrality, but in essence the loudspeaker ends up being an instrument

62
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,990
So you have to still make it neutral because you don't want it to add coloration its own sound, but the material must be

63
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,390
materials must be natural so any kind of adhesives that are used in the paper or

64
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,470
In the wood of the cabin and all that must be natural

65
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,210
It can't be synthetic like people use and vinyls and things like that, right the drivers themselves

66
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,450
You have to go back to mid 20th century 1950s

67
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,590
Ultra-thin paper drivers with paper voice coils.

68
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:28,730
No aluminum or plastic Right, and then you have to understand a field like Ken Wheeler says There's not a branch of science that can define what a field is It's all you it's a wave a wave is not what something is.

69
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:50,010
It's what if something does what it does So when you have sound or light or anything projecting into a room the back side of it also wants to find a dissipation mode so What we're talking about here is we designed a structure inside the cabinet Which is an acoustic an aperiodic acoustic inertial plane acoustic?

70
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,670
You know what it means a periodic means it covers many frequencies, right?

71
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:09,410
This is periodic which is one frequency or a group of frequencies and it's it's a plane It's a very thin area inside the loudspeaker Very small gap because if you understand Bernoulli's principle the smaller the space the higher the velocity the lower the pressure Right, okay, right.

72
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,230
So you want it, right?

73
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,830
So so basically it's a it's an acoustic a periodic acoustic inertial plane

74
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:23,290
Now this is very similar to something TBI is doing which is an embedded transmission line, but there's such knuckleheads

75
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,950
They can't see the reality of it

76
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,650
So I took the idea of the embedded transmission line and thought to reconfigure it even though it's patented

77
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,790
Then I figured out the entire concept is wrong

78
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:41,410
You don't need an internal mitigation something to mitigate the wave because there is no way of the way of a secondary

79
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,270
You need an inertial plane.

80
00:07:43,410 --> 00:08:03,430
So now we have an inertial planes first time in history We can actually put together a small loudspeaker with the total qualities that I described that has no Characteristic of coloration and It's actually quite unnerving to hear like when people want on a headphone that's set up this for a loudspeaker.

81
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,230
They kind of jump

82
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,270
They're like it's unnerving

83
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,890
They're like who sounds really like they're here and you start and you start hearing things in the background and also it requires very little power

84
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,790
Interesting

85
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,410
Yeah, well, that would make sense

86
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,610
That would make sense

87
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,170
4,000 4,000 cubic room a cubic feet room

88
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:28,250
Right requires only two and a half watts to bring it up to 95 decibels a human voice is 50 decibels, right?

89
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,130
Right Wow, so so it's very efficient.

90
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:40,770
So So this kind of thing So maybe I'll have some things available in about a year or two if I'm still around To market or you know put out so other people can get it right now.

91
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:51,450
I have a bunch of prototypes I've been working for quite a while on putting this together some interest in it, but what happens is They fail to understand.

92
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,870
It's kind of like Greek speak.

93
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,970
Mm-hmm You know the Greek speak is like stuff that anyone can comprehend and understand.

94
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,670
They just fail to do so, right by the way Speaking of the opposite of failure.

95
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,910
I want to thank Jay.

96
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,790
I did receive something from you It was extremely generous and it all came intact in an envelope.

97
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,650
Thank you very much

98
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,170
Also, I wanted to state this is the first person I've run into in about eight years

99
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:24,850
Maybe there's two others that have actually when they send notes in the mail have done it properly where they record the serial numbers

100
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,030
The only thing that was missing was a demand for lawful money on 12 USC section 411

101
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,030
But it seems like no one still seems to get the most basic stuff

102
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,910
That's why part of me is like I even why bother talking about anything because people always agree agree agree

103
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,450
I got it.

104
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,730
I got it.

105
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,390
They don't got jack shit but You know what?

106
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,590
I mean?

107
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:53,670
So so even even during interchange even during interchange between one party and another you should always throw that in there Well, yeah.

108
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:53,910
Yeah.

109
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,910
Yeah, of course all your records, right?

110
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:08,030
It's a record Yeah, because I do for records, but I didn't know we had a man for lawful money And the end of the year you just don't let the IRS IRS you're doing that and they're like and they'll just send you back Whatever they took out all of it matter.

111
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,210
It's not a return Right between a return and then and then somebody taking something that they shouldn't.

112
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,150
Mm-hmm And it's still not lawfully.

113
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,970
Here's proof that you know what Dimitri says Dimitri Kalas of this, you know, the the sovereign state owns everything.

114
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,910
You don't you have non-redeemable money I mean slaves don't need money.

115
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:35,110
No when you're at it Well, if your whole life is a Monopoly game, you're gonna argue where you're gonna go and redeem that monopoly You can never get off the board, right, right?

116
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,410
so anyway, yeah, it's just Very interesting Greek very interesting.

117
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,530
Well, you do it.

118
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:43,770
Also.

119
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,050
There's a spiritual side to it That's why most people think they got it.

120
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:53,130
They actually I could prove you they don't they don't understand they think it's just a Something novel.

121
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,970
Well, here's the thing.

122
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:15,570
A lot of the Greek speak stuff is very novel and new You know Novell mean I guess to them So they think that they because it's new they get it, you know or because it's true They get it and I'm telling you very few people ever have it because it has to do with Let's just say doing the right thing, right?

123
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,250
Right and it's nearly impossible to do the right thing

124
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,850
So you have to try to do the right thing

125
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,330
Which means you can have to make a lot of compromises

126
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,050
so

127
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:35,290
Not not to sidestep you but I was speaking about your your inventing and I look forward to hearing more about that in the future

128
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,470
Yeah, well, you're not really inventing you're rediscovering and you're being challenged by problems and you and no one like stress

129
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,450
It says has ever invented anything in their mind.

130
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:43,830
Really?

131
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,270
You have to keep doing things to

132
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,230
Find out what works, you know

133
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,990
I mean like I I don't want to get into what I'm doing, but I still have to turn down

134
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,490
Consulting because they'll bring me like for example as a project where they were taking

135
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:08,150
Agricultural waste and processing it into hydrogen and they had this black goop and they wanted to take clean it up

136
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,110
And I was like, this is not

137
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,570
This is not water with black goop.

138
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,770
This is goop with water in it You just dehydrate or you can use this as a fuel.

139
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:29,750
This is primal, you know form of petrochemical here You could use burn it in generators and they freaked out They're like no We can't do that because we were just told the EPA says we should just clean it up and we're like no burn it And you put it, you know put it in a diesel and they're like, no, no, no.

140
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:48,950
No, so I'm like what's wrong with you you know, um so yeah, this And you know, there's just stupid people So after a while you got to say well Do I still want stupid people in my life and the answer to that is no then you find out pretty much being alone Right, even in the business realm, right, right.

141
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,390
So so you just manage and Yeah, however, you can't go on the boat.

142
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:01,810
Yeah Yeah, so with that said I didn't I usually I preempt if there's nothing going on I won't do a sonic but we're doing it We're here.

143
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,230
Is there anything?

144
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,530
Going on.

145
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,250
I'm in the kitchen right now making some Java, of course.

146
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,610
Mm-hmm And also I want to thank a few other people.

147
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:32,310
There's a couple of people very consistent Every month now for over a year and I like when they put a notation for six and coffee Right and again, I just want to thank Jay out on the east coast in the States It should be anonymous whatever but it's a few months of cigarettes and coffee and you know What my budget of cigarettes and coffee, you know, three four hundred a month.

148
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:53,230
So it's very thank you very very much again it was very generous and Yes, blackie I got a very talkative I have a colony of cats that have adopted yes, I remember you saying that Yeah, they're outdoor, but I have an old doggy door and I made it real small and they're free to come in and go They're totally they're free creatures.

149
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,490
It's real interesting to see how free creatures operate, right?

150
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,550
No, and they're trainable as well.

151
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,350
I've got I've got them pretty well trained

152
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,630
And they're hardly ever around

153
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,310
And you know, it's funny, you know, sometimes you'll you'll

154
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,870
You'll wake up and they'll bring a bird to bed, you know

155
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,770
Yeah, and they look at you and they're like you look like you need a little more nutrition

156
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,270
So I brought you this dog, right right or a mouse, you know, they look at you

157
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,930
They're like you look like you need some more nutrition.

158
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,210
So I brought you this mouse.

159
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,290
You're like, ah, man.

160
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:49,850
Thanks a lot My gift knows no bounds So here's this Wash all the sheets guy because it's dead.

161
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,370
Yeah.

162
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,690
Yeah But I try to make the sheets at home as unclean as possible.

163
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:14,950
If you know what I mean, I can correct so Okay, so what's going on in chat, I'm not in front of the laptop about 30 feet away Scroll up a bit here and see if we can find there was a Anyone want to call in to yes.

164
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:39,270
I did post that in the channel Would call in but have to go to bed early any discussion on God's more details Perhaps on things to come some info on coming seasonal changes dreading the cold water weather What is what is called sad seasonal effect disorder and how to cope with seasonal changes less sunlight?

165
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:53,470
And also idea of the Jews still expecting a Messiah when the Christ Messiah Yeshua Already came and showed slash proved the resurrection.

166
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,330
Is this false Messiah the coming Antichrist figure?

167
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,510
I realize this is a Explain that already.

168
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,470
Yes in a new time New Testament topic

169
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,950
So perhaps not to be discussed publicly if that goes into the book of Revelation stuff

170
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,290
Which is off-limits publicly and privately

171
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:18,130
I mean, I've had Skype conversations for years and I'm like, I'm not going to discuss the book of Revelation even in private

172
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,790
It has to be the right people and I haven't seen any right people in a long time

173
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,210
Let's just say are they the wrong people?

174
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,510
No, they're not the wrong people, but are they right people?

175
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:59,390
No for sure See and then there was another one here if it's appropriate to ask Greek to comment on one of the post links above it was from the bite show that featured a Shmo Asher Was curious about his leaning towards not eating meat as a way to keep what he calls the everlasting agreement If we are not to eat animal meat, why was the law given on which meats to eat?

176
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,830
Yeah, right.

177
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:07,770
I mean who's a schmuck is that guy gonna throw drop some Talmud on your ass the bite show Here's a comment on the bite show years ago.

178
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:20,550
I found out about Georgia and here's a her she passed away Yeah, yeah, she's what I call a goat you'll she'll interview someone and Talk about the most high or whatever like that seal off idiot.

179
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,109
Oh, you're so amazing.

180
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,790
That's so wonderful Thank you, then she'll interview another person say Yahweh is two-faced God or whatever goes.

181
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,690
Oh, you're so amazing Thank you.

182
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:38,830
I mean, she's like a goat, you know, she's anybody who's in front of her Anyone who's in front of her is the greatest, you know, whatever.

183
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:45,610
It's just a bunch of crap it's like all the other shit you see out there, but That's what the feeling I get whenever I look at the bite show.

184
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:57,050
I'd rather not listen any of that stuff because of her And then you could just look up the I know who's the who's the interview the guest on that?

185
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,230
shmol Asher Oh, that's very Jewish a tribe.

186
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,730
Oh, yeah, sure.

187
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,310
It's a Syrian.

188
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:10,670
That's a Syrian Jew probably Sephardic also Sephardic or Syrian Is he dry was he what does that go?

189
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,090
What does he do?

190
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,070
Come on there and drop some Talmud on your ass?

191
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,850
What is oh, yeah.

192
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,550
Oh, yeah big time big time Two to three hours worthy Did you listen to it?

193
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes, I did.

194
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,110
Yes.

195
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,090
I did take any notes.

196
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,190
What are the salient points?

197
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,990
Oh silly.

198
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:46,990
Oh boy I don't Just give me notes and I'll tell you let's see soul harvesting Moon is hollow and that is a place where they're harvesting In sending back the soul without memory and all this kind of stuff.

199
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,590
You know what the soul is you could saw Like people right hyperglycemia, you could harvest the soul in a brown paper bag.

200
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,570
Just exhale Okay, next next subject more dummy.

201
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:13,970
Yeah, well based on just what has been presented so far I guess we can say that there was a high concentration of brown 25 to corn and Well, there's always the the topic I've discussed this for many years now.

202
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,190
There's going to be more interest in the topic Will any of it be accurate?

203
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,150
No, is it as a general thing?

204
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,370
It needs to be thrown out But like for example, I have a CD player that died recently.

205
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,010
Mm-hmm.

206
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,270
I was like this isn't irreparable.

207
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,530
But wait a second I know if I open it up I could pull out a transformer You know, it's an high configuration winding.

208
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,430
I could use that.

209
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:55,150
Yeah, sure Sure, I mean, I just put it on the shelf because if I go to Elliot's electronics to buy one They're gonna charge me 12 or 15 bucks easily 3 amp 3 amp winding, you know 3 amp, you know 120 volt winding so why why not just pull it out and put it in a box with the rest of the windings, you know And pull out a couple of Mylar caps in there.

210
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,470
They had some pretty high-value 50 microfarad mylar caps that were small.

211
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,250
I know like those are 20 bucks apiece Easily same thing with this.

212
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,010
This is a dead.

213
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,110
This is a dead interview But if you can get something out of it, but you have to have discernment.

214
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:20,630
It's very well to ask that question At whoever did in the chat means they lack discernment I mean they could it would have been better off they put in This guy thinks the soul can be harvested.

215
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:28,410
What a moron the soul is, you know I would rather than a question is a person asking question The chat tells me that they're not listening to Greek speak either.

216
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,910
They don't get it You see so why bother?

217
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:56,520
Okay It's skimming around here Question before about okay the Weather-extreme weather like as you get older pain and heat become I mean cold and heat become more painful Tolerable look when you're young you can go out in regular clothes No jacket and play in the snow your hands turn pink.

218
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:03,220
You can't they're numb and you're fine You try to do that when you're 50 55, you're not a good idea.

219
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,440
Yeah, not a good idea It's like bone-wrenching pain, right?

220
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,420
No now

221
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,260
If you are more susceptible to the cold and that season is coming

222
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,040
Well, obviously one of the credos is to avoid tropical foods

223
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,220
But now you're gonna have to go the other way to aid your body into adapting

224
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,620
So not only do you avoid the tropical cold foods now you try to seek out traditionally

225
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,220
What was done in cold climates which would be if you're gonna have animal flesh, it should be dried and cured fatty and salted

226
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,160
Right if you're going to have veg it should be pickled

227
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Right cured.

228
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,740
Mm-hmm if you're going to have Food it should be very well cooked overdone Right.

229
00:21:47,420 --> 00:22:00,160
Mm-hmm Because it's easier for you says different energy actually puts time to roll up root Root vegetables things that are under the ground, you know If you go to a farm in the middle of Minnesota when the freeze what can you get nothing?

230
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,760
But you know if you if you if the soil is not that hard You could dig down and pull potatoes out and they're just fine, right?

231
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,120
You can go down with two feet right during the frost line.

232
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,760
There's pretty good.

233
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:25,980
It's like two feet to 16 inches at least Yeah, but if you go below the frost line, it's good So those things that are hardy in the cold you should eat like I know Things like collard and kale will survive a freeze Right, you know collards and kales.

234
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,160
They won't survive a hard freeze, you know Which when it stays cold for a long time, right?

235
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:40,280
You seek out very very very robust greens and root vegetables that again the root vegetable should be Temperate climate not of tropical nature, right?

236
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,740
So there's your simple Solution to making it even better in terms of seasonal change.

237
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,080
It works.

238
00:22:48,240 --> 00:23:02,520
Also if you're going to go to an extremely hot place You not only avoid of course normally the foods that were grown in temperate climates But now you're going to seek out things that bloom or grow well in the heat and that will aid you To adjust to the heat.

239
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,420
So right

240
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,120
Mm-hmm

241
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,760
So that's simple and the other

242
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,760
What was the other question regarding the Jews and the Antichrist that goes in a book of Revelation stuff, but the

243
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,980
What you have to comprehend is what happened with Moses and Exodus Moses was an Egyptian

244
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,680
Okay, one one second you can mute if you want yep, I'll do that

245
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,210
so Moses being an Egyptian then a leader of the Hebrews, I'm using that term loosely and

246
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,280
Then recognized as a prophet that gave them the law

247
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,340
And that's how basically the Antichrist is going to be and is actually a parallel there

248
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,340
that's why

249
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,320
in your

250
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,460
crap

251
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,420
Bibles it tells you in Exodus 34 Moses came down as he had his face was shining

252
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,360
Right well actually he had horns and Michelangelo knew that because when he sculpted the Moses

253
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,320
Seated in one of the basilicas in Rome you have Moses for these little goat horns on his head right or lumps on his head

254
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,640
That's why when you read about the Antichrist.

255
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:32,440
He's accompanied by someone that also has horns See, so that's why you'll never gonna understand the book of Revelation because you never understand them The written the Old Testament and what's called the Old Testament and It's how we got ourselves a caller Greek Okay, let's go.

256
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,040
Yep.

257
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,480
Okay.

258
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:55,800
I'll get them in here And caller go ahead oh Hello greetings greetings cell phone while you're traveling Yeah, I'm traveling right now Okay, but Yeah talking last time.

259
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:13,120
I called in there's a reason why I got cut off so sometimes when you're talking about the gods you have to kind of calm down and Use your big words for a little bit, but I wanted to say Just calling about using the Greek speak.

260
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,020
I took your advice.

261
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,840
I found a an art skill and I excelled in the art skill now.

262
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm teaching and Yeah, it's pretty good it's pretty pretty good so far.

263
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,260
Oh good yeah, I'm just calling in and say thank you and God I had a whole bunch of stuff.

264
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,200
I wanted to say but anyway think of it right now.

265
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,620
Oh, no Where were you guys talking about before?

266
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,940
You want to tell us more about the art skill and maybe how the method what methodology used and maybe a little roundabout outline if

267
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,060
You want to keep it anonymous, so maybe someone else can use it as an example

268
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,520
All right, so listen if you want to fill us in on your endeavor

269
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah, so I started listening in Greek speech probably for about a year now, and I've been applying it for about

270
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,440
almost a year Pope work schedule and it's been

271
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,840
It's been helping me tremendously

272
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,120
And you still kind of around some people that you know friends and family.

273
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:48,410
They just don't get it so you kind of live in this dualistic mindset that schizophrenic type of deal and But I've been using a green you do or they do yoga I like this you have to like well, cuz what what woke me up the most was um the kid was a baby goat and Finding out that I didn't know that until I was 24 years old, and I just found that out.

274
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,750
I'm 25 now and

275
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,050
that was almost like

276
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,030
Reality shattering almost around me because I've been calling kid

277
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,050
I've been calling me a kid all my life

278
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,970
and I did not know that and I've been to petting zoos and everything before too and

279
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,350
I like to call that almost like a snapple fun fact

280
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,770
Like I've like almost like a you know like a school of whales is a pod

281
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:18,150
But I didn't resonate with me until a kid was a baby goat for 24 years almost 25 years and

282
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,970
That was a pretty pretty

283
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,670
Awakening for me and I almost went to my demise for a little bit.

284
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:33,810
So I had to kind of pull myself right together I found an art yoga.

285
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:45,530
I Was kind of successful in it really successful It was kind of like almost a hidden hidden talent I had and I'm part of the studio right now.

286
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,770
It's a high-end studio.

287
00:27:47,170 --> 00:28:02,070
I'm from the Golden Ghetto Type is the Golden Ghetto the southwest With all the McMansions around so it's not It's a pretty high quality studio But um, yeah, do you teach the ladies happy baby pose?

288
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:13,750
Yeah I'm Surrounded in the Vipers gun around justice is everywhere.

289
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,010
So that's all I've been seeing lately this past year is justice This justice that justice.

290
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,270
Oh, yeah Yeah, they don't know what they're asking for but they're gonna get it.

291
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:45,390
All right Yeah, so then Venus so we're in Mercury retrograde right now right and then so Venus is coming up to almost in October Right, right Yeah You're gonna see that in the West it's very bright It's not a star looks like a very bright white golf ball.

292
00:28:45,490 --> 00:29:06,150
You can see it with the naked eye Okay, we keep an eye out for that Yeah, and then rises in the And then in California right now, there's a bunch of fires going on a new fire They're calling it Yeah, I let it burn, right?

293
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:15,410
Yeah, it's it's a for it's it's that's natural By the way, but for that to happen, but it's not natural.

294
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,070
I mean they Someone's having their fun.

295
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,630
You know what?

296
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:18,910
I mean?

297
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:20,950
The

298
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,770
Technology today they were recently here like in the southwest about recently ten years ago

299
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,570
There was a huge fire and they didn't want to put it out

300
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,310
I mean someone was having their fun and

301
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,550
They wanted to bring in a Lucian 7, which is one of the largest freight planes in the world

302
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,550
Russian flight plane to just jump dump, you know 100,000 gallons an hour on and they said no, it's too big of a plane

303
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,950
So they're just having their fun

304
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,430
I want to go back to terms of having fun when you when you hear about all the pedophilia scandals

305
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,090
with children being abused or raped or eaten

306
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,910
Nothing is ever gonna be done about that in a big sense because if you listen to the Dimitri

307
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,110
Kalashov video, you're not people your property.

308
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:13,890
You're not free people So for these elites, for example to do what they do to children From a juristic point of view they have every right to do so.

309
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:24,370
I'm not saying this I'm not saying that they do but they do because they own you you're like property It's like they're not doing it to the children of free people.

310
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:34,490
They're doing it to children It's no difference than if you went to a planet and they were raising people in tanks for food Right, you what are you gonna say to them?

311
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,310
Stop doing that?

312
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,090
Well that we've been raising people for food for thousands of years.

313
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:48,390
So that's why you're not going to see anything done with human trafficking or Pedophilia rings or child sacrifice because those are not the children of free people.

314
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,010
Those are the children of slaves You see what I mean?

315
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,850
So your yeah, yeah, they've never they never Ever dare to touch me.

316
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,530
They never dare to touch me, but I wish I can say something about my friends But oh, I know.

317
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,650
Yeah, it's more rampant.

318
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:19,290
So when you bring up the children So what they do is they have the goat thing in your mind constantly See the state uses and the corporations and the schools and the churches use the kid kid kid to keep reminding you You're nothing but a piece of meat.

319
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,170
You're not a free

320
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,230
Lawful society you're nothing but a P and now I'm not saying I'm not condoning this

321
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,550
I'm not saying that children should be I don't think anyone should be abused

322
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:32,770
I recently someone is wants to adopt a bunch of beagle puppies and one just took a big poop

323
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,250
You know in front of you, you know near a shoe is that what you can't beat the dog for that

324
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,650
You shouldn't know as any people whether there's slaves or free

325
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:47,010
but I'm saying nothing will be done in a juristic point of view from the powers that be because you are not free and

326
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,630
Your children are not free.

327
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:58,130
You're just material So the the abuse of children the rape of children this human sacrifice is not going to stop Because they're not doing it to free people.

328
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,030
They're doing it to their property.

329
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,970
I Don't want to hear the New Age moral shit.

330
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,670
Well, they're humans.

331
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:10,690
No, they're not They're humans humans can take various status and you have the status of property.

332
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,290
That's why nothing will be done

333
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:19,110
It doesn't matter what political or moral leadership is put in is put in front of you until you say

334
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,370
So anyway continue about let's I don't I want to just turn around and go all the way back to the yoga

335
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,250
so you're pursuing the yoga and

336
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,950
You're trying to apply Greek speak and all that and everything's I yeah

337
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,370
I I've been in fine Greek speak and I've been excelling in it and

338
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,690
I've been having all these opportunities come up and I

339
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,590
Like a the thing about this video.

340
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,350
It's not really new agey.

341
00:32:45,430 --> 00:33:01,290
So well yoga subjective And so it's whatever you want it to be and I'm putting the objectivity in it And I'm telling all that you learn the Buddhist story the love story and everyone's digging it and it just made me Like I've only I started practice.

342
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:17,370
So using the Pope work schedule for simplicity reasons, but last October I started I got into it last October and then I They had the teacher training coming up and I wasn't gonna let the money stop me because you know Money is just a credit.

343
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,470
So it's $3,000 and to most people be like, oh my god

344
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:29,410
$3,000 I kind of just did it and then I had some all these opportunities come up and so the money wasn't an issue and

345
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:37,770
Yes, I did the teacher training and so then I just started teaching and then I started getting they're starting paying me in credits

346
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,930
That's how I went to the bank and I went to all these different banks and I knew I was doing it wrong when I signed

347
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,830
Right, but they wouldn't they literally wouldn't let me they wouldn't do business with me and that's I

348
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,950
Signed on that pad.

349
00:33:51,290 --> 00:34:02,350
So I kind of screwed up on that one Wait, well when they want you to sign the pad Just say your attorney that they freeze when you say your attorney your accountant wants you that wants you to give them something on paper Mm-hmm.

350
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,030
So just have them don't tell him you want it.

351
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,750
You always use a third party when you read the biblical text

352
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,090
It's all the Christ speaks in the third party

353
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:20,510
Yes, nothing, you know nothing yeah, yeah, so I did I did that same thing

354
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,350
The

355
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,070
Administration in the hospital because I had to go to the hospital and had to go to the ambulance

356
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,409
And so I went to go get the cash receipt and I was talking to this lady cash receipt

357
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,230
She didn't know what I was talking about.

358
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,670
And then there's

359
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:42,530
My attorney needed it and then right when I said my attorney they froze

360
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,170
exactly

361
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,389
Because they're ruled by the attorneys

362
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,270
They use the attorneys for thousands of years now to rule the slaves and don't don't misinterpret

363
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,470
The attorneys not knowing any law at all because if you're an attorney and you learn law you're fired

364
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,210
So just like a priest with the biblical text or a rabbi same thing.

365
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:12,590
So or a doctor with the body Essentially the do you know what let me just quiz you here on the spot Why would you ask for a cash receipt for a hospital registration form?

366
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,480
See, that's what I was trying to you need a cash receipt because there will there I'm trying to figure that one out.

367
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:31,600
So I Because that registration form that registration form has a cash value They don't tell you what it is.

368
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:39,780
It's a blank check Yeah, and then they write whatever they they can on it right and then they Write the back of it.

369
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,820
Yeah, same thing and they say yeah.

370
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

371
00:35:43,680 --> 00:36:13,260
So the This your signature has a cash value right anything any time anything administrative right anytime you endorse anything and you're the only one that has a that's basically a check and Imagine you had you're a billionaire An open check so you want say well instead of a cash receipt Why don't you give me a receipt that you you that you actually wrote you filled out the form?

372
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,660
It don't don't say cat

373
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,080
You know if it is say I want a receipt for the form not a copy any the separate receipt you see

374
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,860
Or I would like to have one you see that's where they kind of freeze those

375
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,380
I'll give you a quick story a while back a lady had a

376
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,240
Corporate people with insurance they had a baby and they still got a bill for 50,000 because they were just being screwed with

377
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,160
You know and I told him go in and ask the hospital

378
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,860
Administrator for a cash receipt for the paperwork you sign and then what happened they called back a week later

379
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,000
Do I owe you guys 50 grand says no you don't owe us anything

380
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,620
You get it well

381
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,040
Is it a baby signed it?

382
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,260
No because they knew they were being messed with

383
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,060
Yeah

384
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,300
Like when you get a credit card, and you get you spend

385
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,760
Let's say 2,500 bucks a month on you get a bill end of the month

386
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,600
You don't know that you don't owe that there's that money to pay that doesn't exist

387
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,980
I'm not saying if you think you owe it you do owe it right there is messing with you

388
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,740
Let's say you have an Amex American Express card, and you get a bill at the end month.

389
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:39,940
That's not American Express That's an administrative office that uses American Expresses letterhead and letter express Which was strong-armed years ago by administrative authorities and the owners of the country and attorneys to do that to give out their You know and there's different Companies you know so the thing is anyway.

390
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,660
It's a lot.

391
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,320
It's it's

392
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:49,240
Ultimately they've established that all of the population is not entitled to a redemption you see what I mean by that

393
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,060
So yeah

394
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,760
At least at least if you and let well okay

395
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,640
And the last thing you want to do is tell another tell one of these slaves something like that they get upset

396
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,900
You know they don't you know you heard me say like even family members

397
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,640
They want you to do better, but secretly they're saying I want you to do well in life

398
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,520
But not don't do better than I'm doing right

399
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,020
So if you go to the bank

400
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,100
Yeah, when you go to the bank and you deal with them

401
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,420
They they don't want anyone coming in there that thinks that the note

402
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:26,140
They know more about banking than they do they get offended the same with judges attorneys and doctors and priests right anybody

403
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,140
So you that's why there's several things you might read somewhere appear as

404
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,720
Harmless as a dove and built be as wise as a serpent.

405
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:43,020
I'm just loosely interpreting that But that's okay, I just this is an interesting What's okay?

406
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,680
Is that you're trying it and you know when you do it one way how what you what result you get because if you didn't

407
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,060
Try these things you wouldn't know you wouldn't have any result, so thanks for sharing that

408
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:02,220
Yeah, yeah, and then I wanted to say about I guess about scripture knowing what we know about scripture and America is going to

409
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,100
Be like the second power or whatever to the Middle East Union

410
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,840
Right if you did have a bunch of money in the United States, and it's in US dollars

411
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,400
And you needed to convert it over.

412
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,020
I don't know.

413
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,120
I don't know what kind of currency.

414
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,740
They're going to use everything use the shekel

415
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,140
Most likely something really unified well they have the real the shekel the dinar

416
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,920
So it depends on we're going to see how that pans out, but it's all credit remember in the end

417
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,720
You know what people invest in stocks to hedge off

418
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,560
Losses in in earnings in the economy that they might be

419
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,580
right

420
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,540
eventually you might want to consider substance based things, and I don't mean just silver and gold but

421
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,780
right now unless

422
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
Unless it threatens your livelihood.

423
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:11,860
I wouldn't think about it too much, but always research it you know what I mean Yeah Financial advice one can give on that, but it not I did not have a drop of a hat like that You have to really get into a pretty detailed discussion on it.

424
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:25,300
You know So whoever's listening can can have a more informed decision in other words what you would might be let me just rephrase what you might Be asking how do you make an informed decision that will be profitable?

425
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,860
Not it versus.

426
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,780
What do I do?

427
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:46,150
Exactly Because if someone asks you what do I do and then it doesn't work out then they're stuck But if you understand how to make informed decisions as the conditions change you can change with them you see Yeah, I can see that and then Kind of bring him back.

428
00:40:46,210 --> 00:41:03,550
I only have a like five more minutes, but bring him back with the conversation You guys had with Sam and everything You guys are talking about how this is kind of like a game and everything different levels well I'm almost he was I wasn't he was you were because he's a game boy.

429
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,670
I wasn't it's not a game But that's okay, it's not a game.

430
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:14,330
It's a lease agreement It is a lease agreement right and then so what does the justice have to do?

431
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,770
She does she have any agreement on this lease or she's just running a havoc

432
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,170
Both there's many many many many many many gods you don't only have and there still are

433
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:32,810
Subcultures that don't have a female deity you know there is a lot of the Zaroastrian stuff going on

434
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:41,230
You have a mixed bag of things going on, but the justice or the goddess religion will prevail

435
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,530
As it is as you see it prevailing, and I think I've described what the purpose of it

436
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:54,350
Is it's basically to create a superior race by male unions and female unions, and then the children know are asexual or bisexual

437
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,830
right

438
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,830
It's to destroy the natural order.

439
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,370
Yeah of Not only with humans, but with plants.

440
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:26,990
That's why you have GMOs with drugs All kinds of stuff anything to destroy the way the mechanisms work You know with a male female and and procreation any procreation plants animals humans She's against that Yeah, it's gonna be yeah So many people have tattoos too these days.

441
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,570
Oh, yeah, I'm lucky more.

442
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:34,530
I never might have never gotten to that Yeah, but yeah, okay, well um good.

443
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,250
There's a much more.

444
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:35,970
I can say I got it.

445
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:42,010
I got to run in the studio right now, but You guys have a great great rest of the evening.

446
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,490
I would like to call back next week, maybe Okay, thanks.

447
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:51,490
Thanks for doing so Yeah, yes, and thank you for calling in And no problem.

448
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,210
Have a great night.

449
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,490
All right.

450
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,670
Bye.

451
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,690
Bye be safe also.

452
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,470
Bye.

453
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,690
Bye, okay?

454
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:12,370
I Was a good bit in this I guess or you know Yeah, I would suggest that anyone and everyone that I've ever discussed Privately and publicly that they have adopted something out of Greek speak.

455
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,790
They've all stated on their own

456
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,410
Volition that the their lives are better

457
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:27,170
Mm-hmm over overall overall and and because they also most of them do appreciate that they're living around scum

458
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,750
bags, whether it's parents friends family brothers sisters workers neighbors

459
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,210
You know it's better to know the reality

460
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,990
Of these people than to be living in the pink bubble right like I've had a lady once she was an attorney

461
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,770
She goes.

462
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,350
I'm not saying what she told me.

463
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,510
I'm not saying what you're saying is wrong I just don't want it to break my pink bubble.

464
00:43:47,650 --> 00:44:09,330
I like the illusion that I'm in that the people around me are good She was honest, and I'm like yeah And I'm not saying that humans are Assholes or scumbags the ancient Ritz do so and actually they can be proven correct as a general whole That's why why do you always see for example even portrayed in what you call Hollywood?

465
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:16,010
For many years the aliens are always aggressors against humans right right right like when I watch one of those movies

466
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,290
I'm rooting for the aliens

467
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,970
You know nothing

468
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,630
Even though I'm yeah, I'm embarrassed not because

469
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,810
You know I choose to do that it's because that's the truth look the aliens are trying to clean it up

470
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,030
You see I spend way more time now by myself

471
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,850
And I'm more pleased than ever to do so

472
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,130
Absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah, and there's an option

473
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,990
There's an option that you can take but at the option always reminds you of that

474
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,330
Absolute solitude that was where the real stuff gets done.

475
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,270
Mm-hmm.

476
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,110
You see what I mean.

477
00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:05,310
Yes, yeah So and if anyone doesn't believe me you could go look at even philosophers not even the ancient Ritz especially the scripture Which is inspired?

478
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:11,370
very poorly Throughout the ages humans are spoken of very poorly.

479
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:27,210
I'm not saying that there should be wanton Violence against them right just like just like you shouldn't go to a swamp and kill all the piranhas for no reason But you recognize they're there Simple enough yeah, or the snakes or roaches.

480
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:32,750
You know there's no reason to kill all of them No, or whatever you know or violence against them.

481
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,710
No not at all.

482
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,190
They have their spot, and I have mine I

483
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,250
Mean I have a large composting bin for the garden and they get these

484
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:47,670
Large American roaches that could be up to an inch and a half long oh my and they love the cut they love the compost

485
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,450
They're in the backyard sure sometimes they get into the house right or whatever

486
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:54,590
But yeah, they can fly they go up to a high area, and then they jump and they fly down

487
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,570
They kind of hover down.

488
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:13,130
Oh my what when they when they develop their turf you walk over to the compost I had one that was like pre-dawn They all scattered away, and then one turned around and kind of sat up like I'm gonna defend this you know and he could squash But I'm like why should I squash him, but most people have the impulse take your shoe off and step on them Yeah, I'm looking at the guy.

489
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:27,130
I'm like wow what a cocky son of a bitch right really Like an attorney or something you know right right so or a doctor or a priest Them a little scooter of the yeah, yeah, I just leave him alone.

490
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:48,190
You know there's no reason now some people have been brought up to to Automatically destroy them like instinctively yes sure yeah the instinct to be violent right All right people like that Actually, not a whole lot in the in the chapter Greek not a whole lot.

491
00:46:48,290 --> 00:47:18,570
Yeah, at least in the one that I'm at Yeah, okay, but that that's we got a caller, and I was also if Haven't you noticed I think or whoever that was the lady that called in was it have you Whoever I Whoever it was I mean who that was she that was a good Call in this person also whoever you know having a slightly different Input on these sonics is helpful as well.

492
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:27,370
Just to see it in measure where people are yeah I mean from a from a an altruistic point of view the Greek speak is not for this society.

493
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:40,590
I've said that before Whether it's few or many, but I would have rather have spoken publicly than not I've ever spoken publicly you know right right so Yeah Well, I'm glad that you did.

494
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,810
I'm glad that you did.

495
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:42,730
Yeah.

496
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,250
Yeah, good.

497
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,430
I'm glad you that you're glad very glad

498
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,130
Mm-hmm

499
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,390
It's so a very welcome change to this last year and

500
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,310
Coming up on a year now or so I believe and and

501
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,270
Still going strong Greek still going strong

502
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,070
And you know just to confess I did go down the rectangle this morning

503
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,710
I spent a couple of hours because I need a hunt down some materials

504
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,850
Mm-hmm and I looked around

505
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:19,590
See what's going on and just to state it as a fact do not expect anything on the rectangle

506
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,350
By the way in terms of like alternative media or whatever it's still all the same

507
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,270
Stupidity it's all politically based, and you know these are just ignorant slaves.

508
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:43,430
You know across the board Not some of them all of them Occasionally you get a gem like Dimitri and look at Dimitri's status He's like one of the videos at the end.

509
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,250
He was like well.

510
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:49,530
I want to do more, but I don't think I'm no one's interested I'm not getting any support right yeah, I know if you go.

511
00:48:49,710 --> 00:49:08,070
Yeah look at real dumb shit They have a hundred thousand subscribers, and they could make a living you know easily shows you what kind of trash is living on this planet Yeah, they want to talk about you know whatever you know look at all the I mean people you know that you've heard me Speak with in the past on the internet.

512
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:24,990
It's all garbage I did it because it was there, and I figured I'd probe into it and give it a shot You know yeah, it's all rubbish all of it, and there's no exception you might have an exception like I said by looking at some Old historical stuff.

513
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:34,590
You know how years ago people used to transfer video to DVD so they could preserve it Yeah, there might be some old stuff that you read about or heard an audio book.

514
00:49:34,630 --> 00:50:01,670
Maybe that's worth listening to Or I don't know Reference technical stuff, but in terms of mainstream or alternatives are all idiots with no exceptions at all And it's just trash And on one hand that's a fact that on the other hand the other fact is if they weren't Trashy they wouldn't no one would follow them Right here support right?

515
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,010
So you're living on a planet and a social norm is to be trash

516
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,710
Yeah in order to succeed and to shovel it and push it around right

517
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,570
Yeah, and there's no speaking of which speaking of which we were touching on

518
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:26,450
Subject of my knee which I twisted today coming down the ladder, and you're gonna speak about lymphology and

519
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,170
And I'm still wrapped, and I'm still got her wrapped and everything so

520
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,110
Yeah, let's just matter of fact.

521
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,130
It's a detailed.

522
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:42,470
Yeah, someone might be listening actually they prefer me not to discuss it And I forward it to the point where how do you know if bone is broken?

523
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,830
Do you are you familiar with the signs on the skin?

524
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,670
You know without an x-ray.

525
00:50:46,790 --> 00:51:01,110
You know how they saw discoloration massive discoloration type of discoloration on the skin It'll be a yellowish tinge, and I mean a yellowish like an ochre yellowish Like a turmeric color yellow right a deep yellow.

526
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:20,730
Yeah, I'm gonna have a slight greenish blue mixed with it You know blotches and red and pink So if you bruise yourself Let's say let's say you suffer an injury or damage to the body, and it's just red It's most likely muscle and lymph if it's black and blue you know red and Very dark blue.

527
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,550
It's the muscle has been damaged.

528
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:35,750
You know the fibers have been Misaligned right if you start getting the yellow color the blue the green and the red you have a broken bone Yeah Or fracture in the bone by the way, I just a sign see now.

529
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,810
It's ridiculous.

530
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,150
I've seen in emergency rooms.

531
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:48,990
You know someone falls And they hear a snap in their leg actually the people around them heard something snap like a bamboo a piece of wood yep They go to the emergency room.

532
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:54,010
They're sitting there for three hours, and the doctor's like yeah, let's take an x-ray another two hours later Oh your bone is right hit.

533
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:54,930
Yeah

534
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,470
Stupid oh

535
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:02,530
Weeks right yeah easily easily

536
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:08,750
But if they wrapped it immediately and actually even if the bone is broken even if it was fragmented very tightly

537
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,810
The healing process starts immediately very very very very rapidly ever heard of

538
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:20,870
Well actually you might have experienced it if you get like a very fine cut from a razor or a paper cut or something

539
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,210
If you do this methodology you ever know right away you ever notice the next day

540
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:29,290
It's completely healed you could almost I'd say 99% healed yeah

541
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:32,190
If it's a very clean cut not a jagged break

542
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,850
Correct right and I've done that I've done that and yes

543
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,890
But if you don't do that

544
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,670
By the next day for sure a cut it'll last a few days or more

545
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:49,650
Right so the bone works the same way in the bone is a very interesting thing because the bone is I would say inert in

546
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,110
the body

547
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,310
That's why the most ridiculous thing is bone cancer.

548
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:58,510
No, that's those bones don't get cancer you have cancer sitting on the bone There's a difference.

549
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:04,010
Yeah, you see and then with that area where it's anaerobic it can eat away at the bone.

550
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:28,750
Just like you know Rust on a car how it eats through right mm-hmm, so but nonetheless a very tight wrap again I mean, there's many many levels to this of course an entire School of study and application can be put into how the human body really works and apply it medically Medically meaning you know medicinally right, but it's not going to happen in this society.

551
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,030
No doctors

552
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:35,350
Shouldn't well do you remember there was a congresswoman shot and

553
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:41,950
The president came to speak and the chief of surgery who worked on her mm-hmm

554
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:50,910
Did a public speak as an Asian guy, I'm getting too detailed well that guy told me he needs me to work on his staff

555
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,970
Right Wow

556
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,930
Yeah, yeah that guy famous guy great reason he's one of the best trauma surgeons in the world so

557
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,470
And he's on my ass about I need for you to come and work with Malik.

558
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,830
I don't have an education Don't worry.

559
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:13,850
We'll take care of that Because he's seen what the books yeah, yeah I get a phone call so you know Someone's in here.

560
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,730
I go there and the trauma and and the person's going home their intensive care.

561
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,510
They're going home the next day

562
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:25,470
Not from the I'm talking from intensive care now, yeah, yeah the I see you in it, right

563
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,590
Yeah, right home the next day released

564
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,690
Yeah, even if you go into the hospital, they're not gonna let you go home in it, so no

565
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,890
Make a short story

566
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,790
even longer here

567
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,870
That I'm not that stupid no matter what this idiot says because he's an idiot

568
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,250
He will eventually get in trouble or I'll get in big trouble

569
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:53,770
Because it's not allowed the owners of this country and the owners of this planet well just a little system alone

570
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,810
Right the attorneys will not approve of it.

571
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:09,450
No these are morons So you know is what I'm speaking of is not temporal meaning this society like these old farts that say oh things used to be Better no they weren't better because if you were so smart it wouldn't have let it go into this condition, right?

572
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:15,090
Right it should be getting better if the older people were wiser and smarter and a better generation

573
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:20,710
Why is it degrading because they're they're not they're just at a higher rate of speed might I ask

574
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,650
Right and if they were better they would get better you see so they're no good

575
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,250
You know and when you read in the Bible respect your elders

576
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:34,090
It's talking about those that are within the the covenant of the scriptures and lawful people right you see

577
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,670
You know the headhunters

578
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:41,390
You know it's a go kill all of them the old the young the children the animals all of them didn't say oh

579
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:46,370
Don't kill the old people you know in the in when they were Joshua was told to go into the land

580
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,610
Yeah, yeah, so people don't understand the context of Scripture

581
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,630
still

582
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,750
It has to do.

583
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:59,130
That's why when I say Forget about the scripture has got nothing to do with you.

584
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:13,570
That's very accurate for most people Mm-hmm really doesn't now it doesn't mean that you can't take it and Learn from it and apply it because even you know a savage headhunter pagan or whatever it can improve their lives, right?

585
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:19,830
But you're still into the gods you're still a savage pagan headhunter right because the gods don't look they look at bloodline

586
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:27,010
Unless you really make a big quote-unquote repentance where you really turn around and then you your main goal in life is to

587
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:33,790
Commune with the gods especially the most high then they'll notice that and they'll say look this guy is just some scumbag like the rest

588
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,910
Of them, but look he doesn't stop bothering us right

589
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:42,330
You see that's where your free will aspect is in there you see

590
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,210
So it's like the cruise ship.

591
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:53,010
You know the everybody's going from point A to point B But if you're always on the deck in one position there, what's this guy doing?

592
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:58,910
He's not moving from that position He's you see that's your free will you know you don't have to be you could right?

593
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,790
But everybody's still going to go to that you know condition point B.

594
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:07,710
You know yeah, right, so that's where people don't understand It's so simple.

595
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:24,790
You know that the of course all the various sects from the You can pick take your pick there are thousands of religious sects They all have a certain view and they plug that view and they and they're blinded to everything else There's there are sects and that talk about free will and the it's all or nothing.

596
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:30,210
I'm telling you It's not it's a MIT you have to understand the the concept Mm-hmm, it's not a game.

597
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,230
It's not an experiment.

598
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,090
It's a lease.

599
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,570
What do you understand about a lease you that you know?

600
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,450
when you lease a property or something location or a

601
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:45,830
Holding to someone as a tenancy yeah, you still call the shots

602
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,270
But they are the tenants so what humanity is going through is not a game

603
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,350
And it's not an experiment to the immature it

604
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,670
They try to

605
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:58,210
Communicate it as such because they're immature, and they don't they lack knowledge

606
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,830
But once you see that it's obviously a leasehold

607
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:08,890
And it's mentioned several times on how this world is under the grip of these particular entities, right?

608
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,550
Right their hold you know it's not theirs.

609
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,130
It's their leasehold.

610
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,730
It's it's a tenancy Yeah, but it's not a joint tenancy.

611
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:31,730
It's just a tenancy joint tenancy means both are there Equals a yeah Yeah, but I would say that I recently got an email about You know how do we get rid of the evil spirits and just do the good ones is what makes you think that the evil?

612
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:46,790
Spirits are working on their own the good ones are sending the evil ones That's the thing everyone still thinks is good and evil As separate oppositions like the History Channel did a stupid thing God versus the devil or Satan Oh boy, it's no such thing.

613
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,210
There's no God versus.

614
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:59,710
It does no challenge there at all It's like for it's like saying three-year-old baby versus his father kind of straight Let's pick up the baby and throw him out the window very easy.

615
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,090
There's no challenge

616
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:08,390
It's ridiculous to even suggest that but you have to you see for the for the idiot subjects on the planet

617
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:15,350
They have their what they desire to do in life, so let's say your job as a slave is to cut wood all day

618
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:19,630
Well the only thing you need to know is about cutting wood outside of that

619
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,050
You know it's not it's none of your business

620
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:28,210
But let's say you the society becomes a little loose and they tell you that it's good to learn about other things

621
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:30,510
Do you think they're gonna bring you real information?

622
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,350
Or they're gonna just fill your mind with bullshit

623
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:36,450
Because they want to keep the only thing that you need to know that is true is sawing wood

624
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,450
That's your job, but everything else is bullshit because you know that

625
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:47,050
If it's bullshit inherently you're not gonna really want to study it more, but if someone asked him is it bullshit

626
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,010
No, that's the truth because they said so but they know deep inside

627
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:56,230
That it's bullshit, but they don't want to I'm not interested you see so the last thing you want to do is get the slaves

628
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,890
True information about things that that are not need to know

629
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:07,330
Because then they're gonna start quote-unquote resonating with the truth and noticing more and more and then after a while

630
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:10,790
They're gonna notice that maybe I can achieve something else other than

631
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,530
Cutting wood or being a doctor or a lawyer or a bus driver or whatever

632
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:21,990
So they have to put bullshit in front of you like church and Christianity Judaism all that crap

633
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,850
Yeah, you know Islam.

634
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,490
Whatever.

635
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:34,250
That's all they have to lie to you Because they have you tuned in to what you think is the truth then how many times you still have new age Well, that's your opinion.

636
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,970
That's your truth.

637
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:52,610
You know all right all right, so you know they still So that's part of the leasehold and here's the thing if you're operating in truth And in a high level of morality and lawfulness you can't do it here Even the most high will tell you that you can't do it here Because this is I've uh this is leased out to Satan.

638
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:53,990
What are you crazy?

639
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,210
Good luck, that's yeah, well, it's more than luck.

640
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:07,150
Yeah, yeah, that's why that's why he says you do it Anyway, you're they're gonna kill you he does say that description anyway They chop your head off.

641
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,450
They'll torture you your own family.

642
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,750
We're talking about now about the Popo the police or anything

643
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:17,850
Right or Leo, you know Leo law enforcement right or nothing like that no no no

644
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:25,430
Talking about you by the way the malevolency that's brought on you is in scripture is brought on you by your own family by the way

645
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,470
That's more than implied

646
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,070
so anyway

647
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,470
And

648
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:38,370
He tells you that if you insist on doing the right thing and they do harm you for my name's sake and for my sake

649
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:38,890
That's fine.

650
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,210
That's very honorable.

651
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,230
No You see still, but yeah, that's where a choice.

652
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:54,410
Maybe you might want that's gonna be a heck of a battle though Yeah, do you want to really suffer because you know you if you stub your bare foot on the kitchen chair it hurts, right?

653
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,590
Imagine right what these assholes can do to you, right, right?

654
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,510
There's many levels to it, but just keep in mind.

655
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:07,150
This is not the place for lawfulness morality What's good and whatever you do have good and evil here put on the earth.

656
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:07,610
Yeah

657
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,030
Yeah, but it's not good versus evil no not at all

658
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:18,710
Sorry, it's the the the malevolent like the people who have the the bad dreams those negative spirits are being sent to you by the good

659
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:20,870
powers you see very

660
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,550
But it doesn't mean you have to go back

661
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:30,370
That's why you can go back and and be angry at the most high and all that about that because you you don't understand it

662
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,670
Yes, it's very emotional

663
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:37,870
You know to find out someone is putting you through suffering of something that is unpleasant

664
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:41,950
Because suffering means you you go through it, right?

665
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:53,250
But if you look at the whole thing in its perspective It's okay to have the anger and all that but you have to understand how to dish it out respectfully, right?

666
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,970
correct, right so

667
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:01,150
You know, I mean anyone that understands the truth of the matter sees that it's not this

668
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,250
bullshit

669
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,950
morality or

670
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:10,090
Religiosity or morality, you know, whatever you want to call the good and bad good and evil or good in bed

671
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:15,850
He bad contrast is not one or the other it both come from the same place

672
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,070
I think it's a book of Jeremiah that says both good and evil come from me

673
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,990
In book of Jeremiah, I think he says in your me Yahoo

674
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:26,030
Show me a city that disaster has befallen that I have not sent

675
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,770
I'm just paraphrasing.

676
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,750
Mm-hmm, right?

677
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,740
Yeah, oh yeah it over it.

678
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:55,880
Yep You won't set yourself apart on it Yeah, you can set yourself apart on it is best Always, you know, even the evil ones set themselves apart in their own way Because how can they plot and design the things that they need to produce the evil in the open?

679
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:09,160
You see they have to do it secretly So setting oneself apart is always the right thing to do for both the dark side and the light side You know like a bunch of guys conspired to rob a bank.

680
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,820
They're gonna talk about it at a cafe.

681
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:16,860
No, no They're gonna set themselves apart in a place that no one can hear right?

682
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,260
So

683
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,960
From you setting yourself apart from the rest

684
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,680
essentially

685
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:33,350
These things are very basic and they should well like fresco says, you know, give the children the tools

686
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,690
These are tools that no one has and no one

687
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,830
Get you know, they or uses because they don't know they exist yet

688
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:45,510
there's so simple when I say no one has I mean if you look at the formality and the

689
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:54,330
What do you call it when something is growing formative aspect of what people learn about things it's all bullshit

690
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,250
there there isn't

691
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:02,230
Critical thinking discernment looking at the past looking at accumulation of knowledge and let's just say wisdom

692
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,550
You know wisdom is knowing how to apply the knowledge

693
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:12,690
And all this especially with children, especially with lawfulness with the natural world with you know

694
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:18,150
I think that was the biggest culture shock that I had when I first got introduced to

695
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,810
the concepts and in the thinking

696
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,050
It

697
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:30,350
Took it took some time to to just wrap my head around that, you know that the many measures.

698
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:38,190
Yeah Well, you could say you were censored before because nothing has changed We didn't see a billboard.

699
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,310
You just got a few hints

700
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:45,550
Someone right someone in the background putting together website, by the way a pretty elaborate one on Greek speaking

701
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:53,190
Okay, okay, and they do communicate with me infrequently and they've written articles long articles about all the various things and

702
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,490
Recently they I was asked to edit an article about cosmic censorship

703
01:05:56,490 --> 01:06:01,870
Which I didn't because really the whole thing has to be rewritten or just leave it and that's that person's writing style

704
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,270
Let's say right, right

705
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,830
And I would leave it that way as really but

706
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:15,530
when you look at the cosmic censorship, and I have also heard an email someone about cosmic censorship on how it's

707
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:19,010
You know, I say it's easy, but it's not it's actually quite difficult

708
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:25,070
Well, it's it's neither here nor there whether it's easy or difficult is it you have to consider

709
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,930
The cosmic censorship is outside of you with it's not the free will aspect you see

710
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,870
Otherwise, it wouldn't be cosmic censorship.

711
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:41,930
It would just be discovery But even that rate it's if they let it go on the other side So when you poke around and you can't get through the censorship, it's the other side.

712
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:49,010
That's not allowing it to happen That's the the heavy part about it, but once they do Let you around you see it was there.

713
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:52,670
It was like a curtain Not a brick wall, right, right.

714
01:06:52,770 --> 01:07:02,170
Mm-hmm so but but but even though you You you let's say not able to get through the censorship if you do internalize that it's a very light veil But it's opaque.

715
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,230
You can't see through it.

716
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:09,590
You have to go around it because it is a complete baffle complete obscuration Right, right.

717
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,670
You still keep that in mind.

718
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:17,530
So you there's no That's what you call it trauma or stress About it.

719
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,250
In other words, there's no dynamic.

720
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,990
There's no dynamic Expression that'll get you through it.

721
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:28,850
Like if I said go through this curtain Okay, and then I said go through this brick wall.

722
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:29,530
You're like, okay.

723
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,450
Well, that's gonna take a lot more I need a sledgehammer.

724
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:31,910
You see.

725
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:32,530
Mm-hmm.

726
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,070
I'm telling you you don't need a slit.

727
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:38,050
There's no sledgehammer Explosives bulldozers or anything for this?

728
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:45,590
It's a very very light opaque veil and right think of it as a curtain that has a brick wall painting on it Right.

729
01:07:45,750 --> 01:08:08,490
Yeah, we're in a mirage All right, but I'm telling you that if the other side doesn't want you to see it You will not see it no matter what you do So now that you know, let's just take this a little further Now you have to understand who's on the other side just to begin Work this that's why I've had some discussions with people from Israel and They're reading.

730
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:28,710
That's what they call the Tanakh in Hebrew They don't have to go to the King James and they go directly and they and they basically tell me It's basically it has to do with your personal relationship with them you know the Christians use that a lot but that there is this stupid but the from from the from the Hebraic point of view someone who is immersed in it.

731
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:41,109
I could read the old Hebrew without Looking around for an interlinear basically says this is all personal stuff This is up to you this information what you do with it, right, right?

732
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:46,930
So unless you have it like I said earlier talking about the Antichrist

733
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:54,649
You have a mosaic type figure who is a prince of Egypt literally and then befalls that entitlement into

734
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,470
a prophet of the Israelites

735
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,930
Right and then establishes a

736
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,229
record

737
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:07,130
And that record holds many things law event history

738
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:08,970
Right and things to come

739
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:13,950
So when you put all that together from Genesis all the way down the first five books, what do you get?

740
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,350
You have to hold it all together.

741
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:26,410
That's why I looked at that Peaked at the that bite show Oh, yeah, the title has to do about Genesis, right?

742
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:37,790
Cannot discuss Genesis without discussing all of the five books and the purpose of The information that is given in Genesis you see I don't know what the guy said.

743
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:45,130
I'm sure it's not accurate I'm sure that you know, you get a little bit here a little bit there But the purpose the reason I'm saying I know it's an accurate.

744
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:50,350
Here's the thing I wish it wasn't I'd stop and I'd say go listen to this guy forget about Greek speak, right?

745
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:57,470
Right, but the the essence here is if I think I've discussed in the past Doing a study on Genesis.

746
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:06,450
First of all, I've said before it doesn't say what what you think it says on The when you read it, it doesn't say that at all Right.

747
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:20,450
In other words, you're gonna have to go in into an interlinear and even with the interlinear You can't trust that they are giving you the word down below correctly because they'll switch it around Right, right you go from forms to create it back to create it back to formed.

748
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:21,470
Mm-hmm, right?

749
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:32,930
things don't mean You know that there's no creation is very little creation in Genesis there is reforming mostly.

750
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:33,870
Mm-hmm.

751
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:39,890
The only you see so In in the global sense, right?

752
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,630
Man is created

753
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:45,290
But it's from a spiritual point of view this type

754
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:51,550
You see so then when you go through Genesis you start getting into Abraham and then you get into

755
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,450
Well, you get into the flood which is very important and then you get into

756
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:03,330
Abraham and then all the other patriarchs right with the right development of Israel as as the as the group right and the

757
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:08,090
Promise and you have to understand that throughout Genesis you ever notice

758
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:15,270
It's the gods that are making all the agreements and the promises man doesn't really have to do anything

759
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,550
Right other than no, I don't they aren't right

760
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:24,850
The only basically only time man is told to really do anything on his end is to build the ark

761
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:31,070
Right and attend the garden and very little but as you get later man has to do a lot when you look at Leviticus

762
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:32,990
All the laws all the things you have to do.

763
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:40,590
It's not what the gods are going to do They'll basically offer you protection and prosperity But you have to do all these things when you read Leviticus, right?

764
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:46,070
616 really like 200 things the other 400 roughly are don't apply to most people.

765
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:47,450
So

766
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:53,890
What's interesting is when you start looking at the dynamic through the first five books of Moses

767
01:11:53,890 --> 01:12:00,490
then you can go back and look at Genesis, especially the the most confounding aspect is the first couple of chapters and

768
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:09,050
Overlay the mindset of the first five books back to Genesis you see I just gave a big secret on how to comprehend Genesis

769
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:17,470
the first couple of few chapters and also then forget about the chapters try to read it without the chapter in verse because those

770
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:22,130
Who why why did they decide to stop and start there?

771
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,710
You see don't write don't pause, you know

772
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,990
Try to get something that doesn't have chapter and verse or ignore it if you can

773
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:31,850
Mm-hmm, and it has a different effect on the mind even if you're looking at intra linear

774
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:35,210
Because you have to bear in mind the creation

775
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,870
Sequences have historicity and also they're given

776
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:45,450
Relevant to the other five books in Genesis in in that Moses gave they're all together

777
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:52,890
When I so in other words the first few chapters of Genesis have to be read along with Exodus Leviticus numbers in Deuteronomy

778
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,110
You know in terms of the month.

779
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,390
So in other words, you notice when you read Genesis

780
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,450
you get first five books you get a different mindset than when you go after the

781
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:09,510
After chapter 5 of Genesis right before the flood the mindset changes and then it changes again and again and again with Abraham and Joseph

782
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:14,990
And you know and is Jacob and all is then you go to Exodus is different mindset and that mindset changes again

783
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,650
The numbers changes a mindset

784
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:20,730
Leviticus changes your mindset Deuteronomy changes your mindset

785
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:26,330
So when all these mindset changes are leading on building to a greater mindset that you take then

786
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:30,230
That you've exercised these various mindsets that the various

787
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:36,310
Portions of the book create you get a feeling of what's going on here and then you go read the first

788
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:40,270
two chapters or three chapters of Genesis and now you're going to really see

789
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:44,290
Why they give the creation and the formation the way they do and all this

790
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,830
And I can and I know I could get more specific but it's not necessary

791
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,770
that's actually something that we have to go back and and

792
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:59,230
Get an idea that whoever's listening has access to what I'm talking about meaning a good interlinear

793
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,170
Has went gone through it's when I bring up a point

794
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,970
They don't have to search for it in real time.

795
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,910
You know what I mean, right, right?

796
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:12,910
But even without an interlinear, you know, you don't need an intro because I could basically tell you Well, this word is being used here.

797
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:15,910
It means that Well, yeah, I don't want you to believe me.

798
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,410
You're gonna have to go look it up yourself.

799
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:27,870
You see also you learn it And not because you need to learn it from memorization purposes, but because now you see the point of view Correct.

800
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:28,670
You see correct.

801
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:34,670
Mm-hmm, but there's no information

802
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:40,330
Being given widely even narrowly regarding these things because

803
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:45,650
Whenever you bring up anything scriptural biblical still it's a religiosity aspect to it

804
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:51,130
You see and until that goes away, you're not there isn't going to be any understanding of it

805
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:58,470
In other words most people no matter what lip service they give they still think this is a joke or it's something that's religious

806
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:04,310
Most people do and I know it doesn't matter almost but still even people listen to Greek speak

807
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:09,570
They think this is like that's just one aspect, you know something, you know, it's not important

808
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:14,330
You know one or I have to say it's important because it is but I really don't think so

809
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:19,970
Wow, and the thing is you can't consider it

810
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,670
You really have to meditate on how important it is

811
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:32,250
In an isolated way almost like a thought experiment because you cannot understand how important these things are because your life is too short

812
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:37,330
60 70 years 80 years is not long enough to contemplate these things

813
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,590
No, especially when you have to go search it, right?

814
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:49,510
So and if the end and if the first 50 of them was wrapped in waste cosmic censorship, but you You're on a short end of that's real Right.

815
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,870
Well, you still can't do it with

816
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,950
Experiment thought experiment imagine, okay

817
01:15:55,950 --> 01:16:00,730
When you you can you think about something for five minutes and now I want you to think that you thought about that

818
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,150
Not for five minutes, but you thought about it for ten years the same thing

819
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:04,850
Mm-hmm

820
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:08,310
Not that you did but just imagine you did and then you actually catch up

821
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:14,090
In your mind in your spirit and your psyche to the point as if you did and it really gets buried a little deeper

822
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,730
Let's say in that palace.

823
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,330
We call the mind, right?

824
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:23,030
You know the many rooms Yeah, that's one aspect.

825
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,170
There are many other things regarding memory.

826
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,110
Mm-hmm

827
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:31,610
But the memory schools were popular

828
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:36,530
Well, I shouldn't say popular because they were you know for people that needed to know again

829
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:39,230
Mm-hmm up until they wrote what they call the Renaissance

830
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:44,990
then it was like now we're gonna completely enslave everyone and the last thing we want is slaves that can remember and

831
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,110
sort things out

832
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:48,710
So

833
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,370
that in itself

834
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:58,950
But again, just to beware if you do look at interviews or whatever out of who posted that

835
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,870
That doesn't matter who posted it.

836
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:17,090
No but if you If you whenever you look at any kind of biblical commentary there's I'm telling you it's going to be bullshit and Come because it's going to be mixed with bullshit because it's coming from a religious perspective, right?

837
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,230
Mm-hmm the

838
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:24,410
The reason why I'm saying this is because the amount of caveats the warnings that you have to give

839
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,670
to settle to set the

840
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:30,890
Mindset is longer than the topic that's going to be discussed

841
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:37,090
Like if you're gonna walk into a room or do an internet thing or whatever and start talking about Genesis

842
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,810
Even if you want to do a two-hour talk on Genesis

843
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,990
You're gonna have to do at least two hours to show how people no one even knows

844
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:47,230
Either the condition of the information, you know

845
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:49,570
King James is not a translation.

846
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,290
The the the words are not being translated, right?

847
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:56,690
Everything you've seen in art media and religious is wrong, right?

848
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,390
There is no Apple.

849
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:57,950
There is no tree.

850
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,850
There is no serpent like a snake, right?

851
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,270
You know, you're gonna have to go in and make so many qualifications

852
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:10,150
Before you get to the point because if you think you're gonna go start talking about anything in the Bible people are thinking about

853
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:14,890
What's been putting in front of put in front of them through the circus through Hollywood and all that

854
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,830
There's no way what you're doing is going to work

855
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:22,710
It's like making a paper bucket to carry water or basically you're serving poo

856
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,710
Are you putting good corn on top of poo?

857
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:31,370
Where it would have been perfect corn as long as you didn't mix it with the poo So most people's heads are filled with poo.

858
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:40,930
So when you try to put something in it, it's going on top of the poo So you have to empty the poo clean the vest, you know clean it out You see Mm-hmm.

859
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:50,510
So the amount that amount of work makes it That most that it what do you call it when you shouldn't do something because it's a waste you see.

860
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,790
Oh Whatever Right.

861
01:18:55,150 --> 01:19:03,190
Yeah, when you do something if you do it's going to be wasted Yeah, so on most people because their heads are so full of poo That you can't talk about these things.

862
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:18,470
You can't talk about the human body at all Because they're they're full of blood blood pressure and absorption and This that in the other you can't tell that's why I make my most of my time is just squeeze it Just put a good squeeze on it.

863
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,350
You'll be fine.

864
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:28,650
You don't need to know anymore Mm-hmm and even if you wanted to You know you the the level of cleaning house cleaning in your mind.

865
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:36,630
It has to be done Now here's the other thing some people can do that some people can abandon preconceived notions very quickly Right.

866
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,710
They do exist.

867
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:51,870
All right, so You know like for example recently I had there was an author You wanted me to write a segment for his book regarding weather control, which I did and we had a conversation He just found out he's in his late 50s.

868
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,610
He just found out that the moon landings never happened, right?

869
01:19:55,150 --> 01:20:05,950
So he's trying to send me all these things and I'm like, well, no, no, no Let me show you something there's something called lunar transit or Earth transit, you know transit is when one that's how you get eclipses, right?

870
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:07,950
The moon goes right in front of the Sun or the earth goes in front.

871
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:18,990
That's when one thing covers another Okay, you can go right now and just based on the NASA's paperwork sign of your paper How big the moon is and how far away it is and how big the earth is and all that?

872
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:23,630
If you're standing on the earth looking at the moon, you could see the moon is about you know

873
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:26,530
Twice as wide as your thumb three times as wide as your thumb or whatever

874
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:30,330
Correct because of its size and its distance now if you're standing on the moon

875
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:36,010
And in the earth is as big as it isn't as far as it is when you're looking at the earth

876
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:40,210
It's not like they show you in the NASA pictures are like twice the width of your thumb

877
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,110
Very fills up three quarters.

878
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,790
It fills up three quarters of the horizon.

879
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,790
It's huge

880
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:51,370
So that's your first notion that the NASA's the moon landings are fake

881
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:58,470
Right as they show you the astronauts on the moon in the studio with the little earth in the background Earthrise or whatever

882
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:02,110
Right, it's not the if you are on the moon looking at the earth

883
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:06,630
The earth would fill up the horizon about three quarters of at least half of it would be huge

884
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,790
It would look like you could reach out and tell you would be overwhelming.

885
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,130
That's your first thing.

886
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:22,910
They know that it's a fraud Because they have stupid people working as scientists I mean if you are not stupid you wouldn't be a scientist if you are smart Let's say intelligent you went to work for a government agency or university.

887
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,430
They wouldn't hire you they would say you're not fit Just like the police.

888
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:28,670
You're not you can't do this job get out of here

889
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:30,470
So there is no video

890
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:39,080
Anyone who knows about astronomy can and has at least two or three sharpened pencils or a stupid rectangle can do it on their own

891
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:45,930
The how big the earth is how big the moon is and their distance and just basic algebra you look at it

892
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:50,550
And if you're standing on the moon again looking at the earth rising the earth would be huge

893
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:58,170
It would cover you know if the horizon is a meter wide the it would be like 500 centimeters 600 centimeter

894
01:21:58,170 --> 01:22:02,310
You would just completely cover the her you wouldn't yeah, you wouldn't see any space.

895
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:06,770
It wouldn't be dark at all You would just see the blue big blue marble.

896
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:18,810
Yeah Yeah, yeah Basics this is basic stuff And it doesn't matter how if your earth is smaller and bigger or further away by accuracy 10 or 15 percent still going to be Like that it's good.

897
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:25,110
So right away what it's going to be massive So that's why when they show you the pictures of the astronauts of the moon the earth in the background is that right away?

898
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,230
That's bullshit.

899
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:28,150
No one's calling it because of the earth transit.

900
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:51,350
It's huge Compared to it so anyway, I know what yeah, I mean it's stupid you know That's what I'm saying when I say you're idiots with no exception is pretty accurate Yeah, I mean yeah, and you know whatever well the film set only had so much room yeah Could have slid the projector.

901
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:56,630
Oh, it's it's like the airplanes like the airplanes going into the Twin Towers on TV, right?

902
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,770
He's like really bad Photoshop or whatever program.

903
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:09,710
They used mm-hmm Very nice, and it's like you asked that question one time who was controlling the media that day Exactly no one's asking that at all.

904
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,030
No.

905
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,410
Yeah, so stupid people.

906
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,630
Yeah, these are earth idiots.

907
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:23,190
Yep Earth idiot would it be EI instead of AI yeah, yeah versus the EI the earth idiot What what kind of a bunch of morons?

908
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,850
What kind of media or university or even alternative media?

909
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:52,170
They're gonna do Laughable bullshit, and that's what it is and they take it serious They prove a point on how well they could get everything Collated together and in organized together Yeah, I was I was impressed with that that would that took some effort In other words they have the tools yes, they have the tools to organize the bullshit.

910
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:58,050
Yeah Yeah, yeah And I'm sorry.

911
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,830
I cut you off in the middle of your point again.

912
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,710
Sorry about that.

913
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:09,850
No, that's fine No, you didn't they have the tools to organize, but that's to organize all the the crap and corn and Bullshit, they're not capable of the rest again.

914
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,770
It's cosmic censorship spiritual oppression.

915
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:33,890
They're being oppressed By what's called familiar spirits, you know that foul follow them along for generation after generation The they have the chemical thing happening from the goddess religion bad food, you know, so today I wanted I'm gonna be making some Japanese food some yakitori with various things and I wanted to get some chicken and I'm like, oh There's no way.

916
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:34,870
I'm gonna get these channel.

917
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:36,550
I went to this Korean market.

918
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,330
I said, could you have any chicken from Korea?

919
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:39,610
I want real chicken

920
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:45,530
It doesn't have to be a whole chicken even chicken parts or chicken liver or something just something that's not American

921
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:49,050
Great, you know, there's no they don't import it like damn

922
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,950
So it's like we don't even know what real chicken tastes like unless you grow one, of course

923
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,850
And by the way, when you do harvest a real chicken, it's nothing like

924
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:58,150
No, well alive, you know

925
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:04,730
The breasts are real small and there's hardly any the the real drumstick is like a wing is a very little meat on it

926
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:09,070
You know when it's right because they tend not to get fat when they walk around free range.

927
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:31,810
Yeah But even the free range is is you know, it's yeah So eating animal the more, you know, I think about it more and more, you know, it's like I Don't think it's something I want to do you know, I would like to Encourage anyone out there to open a vegetable sushi You know how sushi is a thin slice of fish on rice to call that nijiri sushi, right?

928
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,670
well, what about curing veg and

929
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,910
cutting it the same way as you would sushi and

930
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:45,310
Putting that on rice because you can there's so many varieties of vegetables in texture flavor color

931
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:49,050
Mm-hmm taste, you know ever of every, you know, you got bitter sour sweet

932
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,190
depending on the soil and

933
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,350
You can cure and produce vegetable sushi

934
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:59,950
So someone can go out and have an enjoy because it's the sushi is not the fish

935
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:04,310
It's the whole thing about a warm rice or cold fish in the dip with tamari and wasabi.

936
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:09,390
It's the entire The form of eating it's how the form of how the food is presented, right?

937
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:13,930
Mm-hmm It's like sometimes I you know, you want a hamburger and not a steak.

938
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:24,410
Well, it's both beef But just you just want that ground meat meat consistency, right sometimes and sometimes you don't want the ground meat consistency So, how about we do the same with the veg?

939
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:28,410
How about do a fillet of an aubergine or a zucchini?

940
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:45,830
Or something and put that on a nigeri with rice with a dipping sauce instead of fish animal Why not create that I think it would go really well But it has to be delicious You can't do like these white people that go vegan because they can't cook and then when you serve you food This is terrible.

941
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:46,630
So I was not terrible.

942
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:50,510
It's vegan Or is there's an excuse, you know, I'm like these cookies are terrible.

943
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:56,010
No, they're not they're vegan Like we're talking about vegans delicious Is this much or they use it as an excuse, you know?

944
01:26:56,010 --> 01:27:04,110
So but I'm talking about people who really know about food and know how to prepare food and make some delicious Vegetable sushi.

945
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:05,250
What's up with that?

946
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,490
I mean, I'm believe it or not.

947
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:09,790
I'm I'm doing it I'm not gonna I said believe it or not.

948
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,590
I'm experimenting with it, right?

949
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,750
And it is quite delicious and quite satisfying.

950
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:17,990
I mean, there's so many ways to prepare a veg

951
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:18,790
and

952
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:25,230
Which veg adds flavor and complementary and all that and you feel really good

953
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,610
do you feel your body adapts to it and

954
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:28,590
starts

955
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:33,330
You know recovering from eating the animal flesh

956
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:40,650
Which has no vacuum, you know, it's dead right where if you have fresh veg vacuum is still maintained

957
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:48,470
Actually making me hungry Greek

958
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,130
Yeah, yeah and and cooking rice I recently got some really good rice

959
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:55,250
I don't have the I transferred it.

960
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,870
I have it somewhere.

961
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:56,590
It's in Japanese.

962
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:10,530
It's a Really good pearl rice if I noticed that doing a two hour or three hour soak and Rinse and rinsing it several times in the beginning you say well if you rinse the rice a lot you lose some of the flavor Don't don't go for that.

963
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:21,390
Give it time to mature and soak Yeah, you do lose the perceived flavor But the more you rinse it the better it cooks less starch that won't stick together as much.

964
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:42,510
Mm-hmm And if it's a high quality rice It'll it'll work out really well, I'm preparing some of that got some pickle Japanese pickles So, oh see how that yeah Have you ever messed around with natto and a Nato is fermented soybeans.

965
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:44,670
It smells like really bad gym socks and sticky.

966
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,710
No, no, you'll kiss

967
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:48,890
Yeah, no, I have not

968
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:54,790
Yeah, that's an interesting that's a good way to put acidophilus in the body it's very hard to find

969
01:28:55,710 --> 01:29:00,230
Unfortunately, I have a market that has like six varieties of it and if you can even find it a market

970
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:04,230
Yeah, and and I got a bunch of that that's Asian prepare

971
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:05,990
Yeah, yeah, not those

972
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:11,210
fermented soybeans very stinky if you go to a Japanese restaurant and

973
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:15,090
You're a white person and you order not so if they happen now, they'll say no.

974
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:20,950
No, we don't serve it to white people Say they see it's offensive to them, you know, oh, it's very very strong.

975
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:42,430
It smells like really bad gym socks and toe cheese and I mean just this it's It would be like not that I know what those things really smell But I'm just giving like with children say right sure like Lindenburg Lindenburg or cheese or gray or something But it's vegetable and it's very loaded with acidophilus.

976
01:29:42,730 --> 01:30:02,810
Okay Which is a very high in other words, it will completely readjust the way your intestines induce food It might be difficult if you've never had it before and you do have it You're gonna have some problems going to the bathroom either too much or too little And you'll be waking up in the middle of night with your stomach gurgling.

977
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:05,390
This is not know my report This is reports.

978
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:15,730
I've gotten from other people Okay, and my report would be a mixture of that until you've resets your body to that vegetable base of Makes sense.

979
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,610
Yep, that would make sense.

980
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:22,390
It's a very you know, you the prima dophilus acidophilus, you know intestinal

981
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,270
intestinal fauna

982
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:29,850
It's the strongest variety you can take and by the way many of the natural

983
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:36,990
I shouldn't say that many of the ailments that people suffer today are because they lack that for natural fermentation

984
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:43,990
And you can't get a lot of it from cheese because cheese again is animal based and it's very rare to get good cheese because

985
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,030
It's read they use rennet

986
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:51,690
Animal rennet, which you know as a piece of it to you to make fermentation more rapid.

987
01:30:51,890 --> 01:31:11,170
Mm-hmm So, you know, you know right finding rennet list cheese is very difficult So not oh would be the easiest way to do to recorrect the body So anyway, I do have Asian markets around here, I'm gonna definitely check into that Greek Yeah, I asked them for a nacho.

988
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,090
Yeah, look it up.

989
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:17,450
Yeah, I Mean, you know how cheese is stringy when it's warm like a mozzarella or pizza.

990
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,330
Mm-hmm.

991
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:45,230
That's how this stuff is natural You just pull it's just really really slippery nasty mucus kind of looks like Mixed with brown soybeans and it smells like Lindberger with gym socks and Thanks for the heads up Yeah, yeah, it's very intense and it's acquired taste Okay Imagine like a three-year-old drinking a strong beer for the first time.

992
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,010
I'd be like, ah, what is that drain cleaner?

993
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,390
Right?

994
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:58,610
All right, right Okay Yes Yeah, I highly recommend it only as a Midget from a medicinal point of view, correct, correct.

995
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,790
You get some natto in your body every three months.

996
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:19,190
It'd be a really good way to start Getting into more of a healthful way of eating I don't know how else you'd get those positive intestinal flora and fauna in your body You can try to make yogurt at home an animal, you know Milk it doesn't make you unclean but eating beef does right?

997
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:19,790
Right?

998
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:26,510
Yeah, the milk is not the the dead animal So the eggs are oh, you know is an egg a dead animal.

999
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:33,450
Yes, and no, I mean, it's a goat either way Because you know, it's not yeah once it's out of the shell.

1000
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:55,250
Yeah It's basically a whole chicken, but I'd say milk is Ovo-lactic pesco-lactic, you know fish Mm-hmm and milk as a form of animal protein and then just milk and then no milk I think milk is fine as long as it comes from a goat or sheep or a cow No donkey milk or anything like that, right?

1001
01:32:55,550 --> 01:33:05,430
Oh And I tried the warm milk idea on cereal Much totally different different day.

1002
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:10,370
Yeah, what a whole different perspect Very enjoyable very enjoyable.

1003
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:10,630
Yeah.

1004
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:11,810
Yeah more more delicious.

1005
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:38,110
You really taste within the cereal more My daughter's been experimenting with the making yogurt and Haven't really had a chance to touch base with all the progression is going but I I look forward to favorable Input at least and yeah Right, and then you could graduate to like what they call a cottage cheese or curds, you know Mm-hmm you can get milk now here locally where I'm at there.

1006
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,750
I finally can get raw milk.

1007
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:43,810
They just started offering really Yeah, yeah, believe it or not.

1008
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,790
I don't know how they're getting away with it.

1009
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:56,830
I was just gonna say I Don't know how they're pulling that one off Yeah, maybe they're gonna get in trouble Who knows, you know, it's a totally different substance there.

1010
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,510
You got a big organization.

1011
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:08,610
That is Mm-hmm got a whole bunch of legal people in it That's not a good combination No, no, those the gods will take care of the attorneys.

1012
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:09,490
Don't worry all of them.

1013
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:20,850
Don't worry Yeah, that's a I kind of I kind of sit back and say this is a natural Progression of things, you know what in order that's how you know a society is getting bad.

1014
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:29,270
You have more doctors and attorneys Because the thing is you really and the doctors you they're like restaurants, by the way.

1015
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,610
Why do you eat out?

1016
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,770
Why don't you cook at home?

1017
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:32,450
It's healthier.

1018
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:53,510
Why don't you train the population on healing how to you know, do first aid and Even basic surgery on the body Yeah, I don't like our base on that once before there should be more places for healing You know, yeah, and also and how to procure Aid to someone who is in you know been injured.

1019
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:55,930
Why do you have to have a separate class of?

1020
01:34:56,790 --> 01:35:00,090
You know, it's I see individuals a very bad thing.

1021
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:07,490
There should be very very few doctors for highly specialized things Yeah, and and and most people say well, they're good people.

1022
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:08,230
They don't know I'm telling you.

1023
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,090
They're not good people.

1024
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:11,250
They're not inherently They're not good.

1025
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:17,330
I mean overall because I mean Because basically ignorant people are dangerous, right?

1026
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:28,970
That's why when you go visit and they're ignorant When you go to the mines the large mines that give out hard hats, you know You know, there's like a little place to check in.

1027
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:46,530
They give you a vest and a hard hat Yeah, and all the hard hats have different colors, you know Like the guests have a different color the engine the chief at the head the senior engineers have a different color right, the the engineers that just got a college have a different color or a Marking code on the hard hat, right, right.

1028
01:35:46,650 --> 01:36:13,070
I wants to I went to a a Action tell the story that's okay But anyway back to the attorneys you ever heard right where there's an old There's an attorney because I want to get the mining company in trouble right but There is a Becker just to go finish up here but back with the attorneys we'll just turn around here Return back to them.

1029
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:32,950
I'm gonna tell you the joke There there's a small town and there was an old attorney there and he didn't have much business He was going broke Had to live a very more Modest life than he was used to and he kept scaling down because he wasn't getting any kind of earnings from anyone in the town Well in comes this young attorney.

1030
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,710
He moves into the town and now both attorneys are rich.

1031
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,440
Ah You get it, oh, yeah, you see how it works.

1032
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,080
Yeah.

1033
01:36:44,340 --> 01:37:05,500
Yeah So just like the doctors the doctors weren't wealthy until the pharmaceutical companies came in more sick people great You see Yeah, so again back to the attorney He's got nothing to do here comes another attorneys to start stirring the pot creating Controversy and then they obviously they're both gonna prosper from it.

1034
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,380
So usually this is the condition.

1035
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,800
Yeah Yeah, I mean even on the alternative me.

1036
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:20,600
I see these these people in the corner called government They're indicting them and the guys some some idiot general or colonel or somebody He had to sell his house to pay the fees and all that.

1037
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,100
I'm like why?

1038
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,820
What an idiot Yeah, it's the wrong court.

1039
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:28,420
First of all, he took him into a judicial court.

1040
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,400
It should have been administrative.

1041
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,600
Yeah Well, what happened?

1042
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:37,200
He his dog bit somebody Is that why they're taking him to a federal judicial court his dog?

1043
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,140
He bit the dog bit someone.

1044
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,400
No, this is all Political stuff is administrative.

1045
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:53,900
It shouldn't be in a justice court at all There's nothing to do with anything like that But it's a you know, these people this is a machine that eats you up like a monster, you know It just comes through and and it's all ignorance that you're right on.

1046
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:54,500
Yeah.

1047
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:59,940
Yeah Yeah, so it's just for Danny and the alternative media is just so stupid all of them.

1048
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,020
Not some of them all of them You know, what are they gonna do?

1049
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:08,040
They've got not to disparage Chuck, but they got the JFK Researchers, right?

1050
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:13,500
They already got a confession on who did it Now, what are they gonna do the JFK researchers gonna hold their swinging Cod?

1051
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,700
That's an old term if you know, right?

1052
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:16,240
Yep.

1053
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,340
I remember I just know what a cotton.

1054
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:24,640
Yeah, okay All right, what is the 9-eleven truth is gonna do when they figure out it was a nuclear thing What are they gonna do nothing?

1055
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,740
Yeah, they're swinging Cod.

1056
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:41,280
It's all bullshit It's all bullshit all of it the UFO people, you know, we're gonna take it to Yeah, these people they need they need the ignorance they need the stupidity and No evidence in the world will satisfy them.

1057
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:52,280
Like there was a college professor publicly said I Believe in the moon landings and even if the astronauts confessed that they didn't go I'd still believe that they went This is how this is how fucked up people are.

1058
01:38:52,420 --> 01:39:00,900
All right, so so you're gonna get an alternative media talk about anything that makes sense or a University that's going to talk about anything.
