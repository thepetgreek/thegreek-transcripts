1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,050
Good evening folks, we got here the Greek

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,210
and hope everybody out there is fine.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,450
Greek, how are you doing tonight?

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,930
Greetings, doing okay.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,050
Yeah, I guess they could call this the

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,730
the most rational misanthropic talk on the internet.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,150
If anyone wants to look up what the

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,630
word misanthropy means, anthropo meaning man and misos

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,450
meaning hatred.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,430
That's why I would consider, it's funny like

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,570
soul and spirit, how they run around definitions.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,670
It's forbidden, like the Germans say forbidden to

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,570
define certain things, you know what I mean?

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,050
Yeah, it's funny when you when you speak

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,910
with either academics or, heaven forbid you make

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,190
a comment on the internet defining anything.

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,390
It's like, you know, then you see where

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,910
the moron magnets are, which is everywhere.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,610
But, you know, the word mis, M-I

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,590
-S, I'm pronouncing it in a Greek, misos

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,930
means hatred.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,310
So, when you hear misspelled, it's hatred for

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,830
spelling.

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,330
Misunderstanding is hatred for understanding, right?

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,570
You've heard of the word mis as a

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:12,910
prefix.

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,450
Now, they try to excuse it away saying

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,610
that, well actually it's not the Greek prefix

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,570
meaning misos, it's the Latin mis means mistake.

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,750
So, there's a there's a little bit more

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,530
of an underlying feeling to looking at etymology

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,590
than meets the eye initially.

33
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,630
But, I can tell people objectively, this is,

34
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,110
you're not going to get this kind of

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,130
speak anywhere, and neither has there been this

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,650
kind of speak anywhere from several kinds of

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,030
perspectives, by the way.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,450
Whether temporal meaning, well of course I wasn't

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,950
around before, but this kind of talk has

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,030
never happened in this capacity, publicly at least,

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,350
ever.

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,470
So, if you've, yeah, and if people found

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,670
us on the internet, they've probably found a

44
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,930
lot of other stuff, and I'll tell you

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,330
right now, it's all crap.

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,050
It's all dummy load, and if you feel

47
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,350
like there's anything edible or good, you're actually

48
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,190
eating corn, edible corn out of someone else's

49
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,430
poop.

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,470
Now, if you guys want to guess, you

51
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,730
get three guesses on what we're going to

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,490
speak on tonight, and the first two guesses

53
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,390
don't count, right?

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,390
We're talking about food, and it's going to

55
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,130
be rather short, because I have done on

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,950
that, was it AFR, I think you have

57
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,870
some, where there are archives about speaking on

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,310
food, I think I did it with Seth

59
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,590
Michael.

60
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,170
As a matter of fact, that one was

61
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,230
just explained tonight on a re-broadcast, and

62
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,410
brilliantly done.

63
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,930
Well, that was a time like, I've been

64
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,350
chided a lot by Sam behind the scenes,

65
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,070
like, you're always talking about how people are

66
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,170
so bad, they're all morons.

67
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,110
I'm like, yeah, you want me to lie

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,630
to people?

69
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,610
And, you know, he says, well, I had

70
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,870
a different demeanor back then.

71
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,770
Well, yeah, because you want to be neutral,

72
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,470
and you want to see if you're going

73
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,310
to become a moron magnet, and if you

74
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,250
become a moron magnet, you want to start

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,290
repelling, you know what I mean?

76
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,530
So you want people coming, not for the

77
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,570
character or the personality of what they're used

78
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,490
to hearing, but the content and quality of

79
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,370
the content, right?

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,110
I mean, I speak to people and captains

81
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,830
of industry, even in the past political figures,

82
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,650
or I can, I can rub, I mean,

83
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,210
in other words, I can go to the

84
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,630
best restaurants in the world, and it would

85
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,870
look like I fit in, right?

86
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,410
Well, most of you wouldn't, you'd be kicked

87
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:38,730
out.

88
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,090
So anyway, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that

89
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,150
if it wasn't true.

90
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,390
Right?

91
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,270
But anyway, I know how to speak on

92
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,050
various levels.

93
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,250
But essentially, if you study the term misanthropy,

94
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,670
you know, there, which it's a trait, it's

95
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,830
not discussed that it's been adopted as a

96
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,390
trait, which is basically the definition is kind

97
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,390
of skewed, but it says the hatred of

98
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,990
people or humans and their society and human

99
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,450
nature.

100
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,290
Not really, that's, you know, it has to

101
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,590
be packaged in a sense, where, okay, is

102
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,890
there a virile hatred for just people because

103
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,810
they're people, you know, like, if, you ever

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,750
see these squeamish women that are afraid of

105
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,350
snakes and spiders, and you ask them why

106
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,030
they can't respond, they just been taught that

107
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,290
way.

108
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,890
Yeah.

109
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,670
It's funny, like I bring up, you know,

110
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,190
there's a miso technic, which is the hatred

111
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,310
for technical things.

112
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,850
There's a someone that I got in touch

113
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,910
with recently, and she has a secretary actually,

114
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,910
about six months ago, and I started bringing

115
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,650
up some points.

116
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,910
And she says, Well, I'm not technical.

117
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,650
And she works in a medical, you know,

118
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,190
industry.

119
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,410
She's a secretary, I said, Well, can I

120
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,670
give you a little personal, a commentary?

121
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,830
Because, you know, when people say they're not

122
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,450
technical, and I don't know if it helped

123
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,250
or screwed her up, psychotic, did irreparable damage

124
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:54,790
to her mind.

125
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,850
But either way, when someone says they're not

126
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,990
technical, if you translate that into proper rational

127
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,650
speaking, what they're actually saying is, at a

128
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,150
young age, I there was someone in the

129
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,210
family or friend that was respected and either

130
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,810
accomplished or accepted by others.

131
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,410
And they would always say, or had heard

132
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,830
I had heard them say that they are

133
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,770
not technically inclined, and everyone still found that

134
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,730
trait or that characteristic to be agreeable.

135
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,250
So that person at a young age, decided,

136
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,450
Well, if this older person is still respected

137
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,130
and liked, and they say they're not technical,

138
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,990
often enough, well, I can get away in

139
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,990
life saying that, too.

140
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,610
So I'm just going to shut myself down

141
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,570
and just use that excuse, you see, just

142
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,030
the same, the same goes, we're going to

143
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,570
be speaking about cooking tonight.

144
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,730
Well, I don't cook, I don't like to

145
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:41,910
cook.

146
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,790
That's because they were around somebody in their,

147
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,810
in their formative years that not necessarily in

148
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,330
their family, it could have been a favorite

149
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,630
aunt that was having an affair with their

150
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:51,830
dad.

151
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,910
Oops, sorry, did I just say that?

152
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,090
No.

153
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,190
Because you know how pagans are.

154
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,430
But anyway, yeah, so and she says, Well,

155
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,170
I don't cook.

156
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,870
And she was still liked.

157
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,490
So the child grows up saying, you know,

158
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,330
I'm going to try that.

159
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,670
I don't cook bullshit, right?

160
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,030
You know, so this is it's, in other

161
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,730
words, when I speak of misanthropy, and the

162
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,990
dislike of people and their condition, it's a

163
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,730
rational one, right?

164
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,410
In other words, if you give someone 100

165
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,210
choices, and two of them are really bad,

166
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,350
and you keep repeating this experiment, and they

167
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,570
always go for the two really bad choices,

168
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,310
and they negate the others, consistently, that being

169
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,490
is to be avoided, right?

170
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,810
This is the nature and of humanity.

171
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,590
So again, I brought that up, tying it

172
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,570
back in with cooking, there's a lot of

173
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,590
people that still have not done any self

174
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,210
examination.

175
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:45,850
Right.

176
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,410
And by the way, what's called the theoretical,

177
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,410
it's alternative media and informational in the internet,

178
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,550
it's theoretical, right?

179
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,650
In other words, in theory, if they ever

180
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,690
put it alternative media, or the information on

181
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,750
the internet in practice, maybe you'll get some

182
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,970
improvements, but it's not being practiced.

183
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,310
So.

184
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,470
So the reason I bring that up is

185
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,310
because you can go on what's called the

186
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,270
stupid rectangle.

187
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,450
And it's a device of your choice.

188
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,830
That tends to be a rectangle, and it

189
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,430
is quite stupid, even though they're called smart

190
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:18,930
devices.

191
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,670
But in reality, if they're stupid, and the

192
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,370
devices are called smart, but you're never called

193
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,830
smart, could you imagine how stupid people are

194
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,630
considered to be?

195
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,030
Right?

196
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,990
So anyway, in other words, if stupid things

197
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,290
are considered to be smart, and people are

198
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,090
never even told to be that they're smart,

199
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,390
could you imagine how stupid people really are?

200
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,850
But anyway, it's really off the chart.

201
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,730
I mean, there's, so if you go on

202
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,570
the stupid rectangle and look for foodstuffs and

203
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,570
recipes, human sharpening knives, it's just a wasteland.

204
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,430
No wonder nothing gets improved or done with

205
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,450
information alone.

206
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,490
You know, there's, you're not going to learn

207
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,770
it by osmosis.

208
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,090
And if you don't know something, and you're

209
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,670
average human, which lacks discernment and objectivity, you're

210
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,450
probably going to run into some poorly done

211
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,630
presentations or instruction, you're not going to get

212
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,110
it anyway.

213
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,590
And if you did, you're still going to

214
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,410
be doing it poorly.

215
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,950
So and this is this is the rule

216
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,730
that I'm giving, I'm not giving the exceptions,

217
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,430
there's always an exception, right?

218
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,470
What I mean by that is, there's a

219
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,130
lady that I know, she was actually a

220
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,350
client, and then she wrote a book on

221
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,790
ghost towns in America, she'd go around and

222
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,530
take photographs.

223
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,390
And it's quite interesting.

224
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,590
And the first thing this is quite commonly

225
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,809
known, maybe listeners don't know, when you find

226
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,610
a ghost town, not only do you want

227
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,370
to look for, you know, where the treasure

228
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,049
is buried, or, you know, whatever might help

229
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,549
you sell your book, but you want to

230
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,309
find out where the outhouses were.

231
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:42,790
Why?

232
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,150
Because that's where people sat down and all

233
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,810
kinds of interesting stuff fell out of their

234
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,330
pockets, like even a revolver would fall out.

235
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,490
And if it falls into the outhouse into

236
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,290
the pit, you're not going to necessarily go

237
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,770
down there diving for it if it's you

238
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,430
know, the outhouse or basically the public toilet

239
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,010
for you know, a place, right?

240
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,150
Right.

241
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,290
So after about 100 years or so, all

242
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,130
that stuff is kind of decomposed and mineralized.

243
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,210
And it's kind of safe to dig down

244
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,190
and find all kinds of gold coins and

245
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,430
silver coins and gold guns and anyway.

246
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,090
So the exceptions are quite interesting, but the

247
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,250
rule is that it's all crap.

248
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,190
So speaking of crap, you don't want to

249
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,470
eat crap, which is coprophagia, right?

250
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,370
I think that's C-O-P-R-O,

251
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,090
phagia, P-H-A-G-I-A.

252
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,090
But unfortunately, if you are living in a

253
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,310
quote unquote, white people society, which would include

254
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,710
Northern Europe and the United States of America,

255
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,830
Canada, let's see where else we go, should

256
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,270
you find a prolific white people be like

257
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,790
Northern Germany, Scandinavia, Netherlands, England.

258
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,350
I think if you go south from there,

259
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,570
their Mediterranean rim, you go further south, it's

260
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,030
Africa.

261
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,530
And if you go east, it's Asia.

262
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,090
So basically Northern Europe and if you come

263
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,590
over to America would be Canada.

264
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,490
If you live in those societies, you're kind

265
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,590
of like at a disadvantage because you're not

266
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,810
going to get good food on the go.

267
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,970
In other words, the type of foods that

268
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,590
these cultures and food methodologies that they've have

269
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,330
allowed to become culture and tradition is crap.

270
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,730
And that's just a quick little encompassing word.

271
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,830
And that is the rule, not the exception.

272
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,750
There might be an exception, they don't last

273
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,270
very long.

274
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,850
But let me give an example.

275
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,810
If you go anywhere in the world, you

276
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,610
know how you have various style restaurants, right?

277
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,710
Well, go show me any city that has

278
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,950
an English restaurant, you'll see Chinese, Indian, Greek,

279
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,010
Italian, you'll never see English or Irish restaurant

280
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,990
food chain, will you?

281
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,230
Right?

282
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,750
Because the food is crap.

283
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,390
And they don't know how to cook.

284
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,070
American is the same thing.

285
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,450
The only reason American food, you'll see like

286
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,290
KFC and McDonald's all over the world is

287
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,190
because guess what, not because it's good, it's

288
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,990
because it's what?

289
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,950
Mostly what?

290
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,870
Deep fried.

291
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,010
If you deep fry a shoe, it tastes

292
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,310
good.

293
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,190
Anything fried tastes good.

294
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:12,430
Why?

295
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,370
Because it's fat.

296
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,950
Umami.

297
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,930
Umami is a term, Japanese term, which is

298
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,130
one of the fifth or sixth flavors, which

299
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,610
is just deliciousness, like a real delicious cold

300
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,710
beer, you know, something that's really delicious, like

301
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,190
MSG tries to create that umami, right?

302
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,250
It's a fake umami.

303
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,750
And don't believe these clinical scientists, by the

304
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,790
way, that tell you MSG is in cheese,

305
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,590
it's in tomatoes.

306
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,630
No, no, no, it's not.

307
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,510
There is no MSG in tomato.

308
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,530
There is no MSG in cheese or mother's

309
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:41,730
milk.

310
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,750
It does not naturally occur the way that

311
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,730
they add it as an ingredient.

312
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,530
You cannot show me the MSG in any

313
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,270
natural food.

314
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,470
The only way you could show MSG in

315
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,850
any natural food is if you crush it,

316
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,010
blend it, dehydrate it, and burn it in

317
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,570
a gas spectrometer, right?

318
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,450
And now you changed it.

319
00:11:59,650 --> 00:11:59,750
Right.

320
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,790
So back again.

321
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,710
So most people I believe that I'm addressing

322
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,230
here because we're speaking English are eating or

323
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,870
have eaten or in what's called a white

324
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,390
people food.

325
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,930
This is not racist, by the way.

326
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,790
Because the whole world, by people that are

327
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,550
into food culture, and even a few people

328
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,910
know the food culture, the chef culture, meatloaf,

329
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,110
mashed potatoes, right?

330
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,070
Macaroni, cheese, tuna, casserole.

331
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,770
That stuff's called white people food by white

332
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,290
people also.

333
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,450
It's not good for you.

334
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,670
It doesn't taste good.

335
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,650
It's a part of the culture and tradition.

336
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,310
I believe you called it the SAD diet,

337
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,730
Standard American Diet.

338
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,810
Standard American Diet.

339
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,130
Right.

340
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,810
That also envelops, it's Canada.

341
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,090
Canadians also don't know and neither do the

342
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,690
Northern Europeans.

343
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,070
Okay.

344
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,110
So how do we move forward from that?

345
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,610
We move forward from that by several, several

346
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,110
directions that could be taken.

347
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,070
And the first direction, by the way, if

348
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,050
you have interest in this conversation, that's fine.

349
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,570
Because I've noticed in life through many years,

350
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,550
not, not constantly uniform, but people are not

351
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,230
interested in food or upping the food quality,

352
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,910
usually a poor character anyway.

353
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,070
That doesn't mean that if you're listening or

354
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,430
you know someone that is not a poor,

355
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,670
not interested in food talk is a poor

356
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,070
character.

357
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,750
Definitely.

358
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,930
I said mostly they are.

359
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,870
And I've been noticing this in my life

360
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,670
where people say, well, I don't really care

361
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,050
about food.

362
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,190
I wish I didn't have to eat.

363
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,810
I just take a tablet, a pill, which

364
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,890
scientists come up with a pill.

365
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,510
And if you look at what else this

366
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,190
person is doing in their lives and how

367
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,350
they focus, you're like, Oh yeah, this is

368
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,870
not someone I, you know, that I see

369
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,230
any quality in any way.

370
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,630
And you'll notice that.

371
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,990
And it's actually for me to say that

372
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,850
is not an opinion.

373
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,410
Think about it.

374
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,870
No food, no air, no water, no shelter.

375
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,410
You're done.

376
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,970
So one of, you know, it's one of

377
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,050
the most important things, actually, you know, food,

378
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,890
clothing, shelter.

379
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,830
You could live the longest without shelter and

380
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,310
then clothing and then food.

381
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,330
You know, depending on temperature and things like

382
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,370
that, you might want to reorganize the priorities.

383
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,550
But essentially that's it.

384
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,030
So most people, again, I'll say it again,

385
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,850
are probably used to being surrounded or exposed

386
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,970
to white people food.

387
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,110
Another example of that, you'll see, why is

388
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,310
he harping on white people food?

389
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,030
I'm not harping on white people, just their

390
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,290
food.

391
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,210
Because if all the white people started eating

392
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,250
healthy, creative, delicious foods, then I wouldn't say

393
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,790
white people food is a pejorative, right?

394
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,510
Well, there's a history behind that too, and

395
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,610
how much it's degraded over many, many generations.

396
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,430
And it's getting worse.

397
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,590
And it's getting worse.

398
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,690
We're probably at our worst.

399
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,990
And it's going to, well, it'll be a

400
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,790
little worse tomorrow.

401
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,370
You'll see.

402
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,390
And the next day, it'll be a little

403
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,630
worse.

404
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,230
So essentially, one thing you'll see is if

405
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,250
you go to a European market, Asian market,

406
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,750
it kind of smells foodie.

407
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,730
Even if the fermented stuff, you know, the

408
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,850
dried fish, cheese, or whatever, veg, you know,

409
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,050
you go to a white people market, it

410
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,930
smells like powder detergent.

411
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,230
Right?

412
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,030
You ever notice that?

413
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,630
Even when you walk into the kitchen area,

414
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,890
it's clean, and it has no, it doesn't

415
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,830
have an appetizing feel to it.

416
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,850
Yeah, no, no.

417
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,850
Even when you go to the section where

418
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,790
they're cooking food, it doesn't smell good.

419
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,050
You see?

420
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,890
Yeah, that's the other thing.

421
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,310
If you live in a white neighborhood, and

422
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,090
in the spring, fall, and summer, when people

423
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,250
are cooking, shut your windows and your doors.

424
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:20,990
It stinks.

425
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,570
It's interesting, when I do cooking, I had

426
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,210
a neighbor once, he came and knocked on

427
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,910
the window, and I said, what's up, man?

428
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,250
He says, I gotta come around and talk

429
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,110
to you, you're killing me.

430
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,190
He had a real serious, I said, why?

431
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,330
He says, that food that you're cooking, it's

432
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,270
killing me and my wife.

433
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,510
I said, what do you mean it's killing

434
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:35,670
you?

435
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,470
It smells so good.

436
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,330
What is it?

437
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,870
And he's, you know, we're talking about 100

438
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,870
feet away, right?

439
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,670
Right.

440
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,310
And what's interesting, there's a family, an Afghani

441
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,590
family that moved in the middle of the

442
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,930
block, and the wife and I will joke

443
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,730
around, we'll say, if it stinks, oh, that's

444
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,570
the white people cooking.

445
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,390
Or if you smell something delicious, oh, it's

446
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,550
probably the Afghanis cooking.

447
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,570
And someone said to me once, how do

448
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:54,770
you know?

449
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,150
I said, come on, let's walk over and

450
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,750
I'll show you.

451
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,090
You see.

452
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,950
So this is like one of those real

453
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,470
obvious things, you know.

454
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,750
And the reason I spent the first 15

455
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,550
minutes or 10 minutes discussing it is because

456
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,030
be aware of what I'm speaking on, in

457
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,590
other words.

458
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,670
Immediately, you know, if you see something that

459
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,110
ain't good, it's white people food mostly.

460
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,610
I'm not talking about 100-year-old egg

461
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,290
and some real nasty stuff that certain cultures

462
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:23,550
do.

463
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,370
I'm talking about the general thing.

464
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,230
Okay, so, have you gotten the hint that

465
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,750
maybe you should explore and expand your horizons?

466
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,930
Maybe some Latin cooking, some Asian cooking, Mediterranean

467
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,010
cooking, you ever get that concept, hint, hint?

468
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,090
Right?

469
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,910
So, right there, there's nothing wrong with saying

470
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,110
that's white people food, because I've been around

471
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,590
chefs, and when they have their big pagan

472
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,610
holidays, they even, you know, even white chefs

473
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,630
will say, oh, we got to go cook

474
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,390
white people food, you know, Thanksgiving, Turkey or

475
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,370
Christmas, whatever, right?

476
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,710
That's the white people food thing.

477
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,750
So they're like, shit, you know, at least

478
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,650
we don't have to do it once or

479
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,790
twice a year, you know, because it's very,

480
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,829
you know, unappealing.

481
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,410
To make a long story short regarding the

482
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,050
white people food thing, that is a big

483
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,510
disadvantage if you are in Northern Europe, England,

484
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,210
Ireland, Scotland, America, what they call the United

485
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,369
States and Canada.

486
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,589
Big, big disadvantage.

487
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,550
Not because, well, because, you know, you still

488
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,710
have the freedom to cook what you want,

489
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,390
but because the markets are piss poor.

490
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,410
So you're going to have to run and

491
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,770
find yourself a European market or an Asian

492
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,910
market or something that doesn't have, you know,

493
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,270
really old stuff vacuum sealed in plastic.

494
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,470
You know what I mean?

495
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,210
So that is the predominant rise to any

496
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,530
occasion for better food.

497
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,210
Before we get into the food discussion, let's

498
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,470
say you live in the middle of Kansas

499
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,030
or Wisconsin or Tennessee.

500
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,610
You want to eat better?

501
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,270
Move.

502
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,090
Sorry.

503
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,630
Move.

504
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
Move to the East Coast or the West

505
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,570
Coast.

506
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,970
That's where you're going to have more international.

507
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,930
The same with England.

508
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,210
You know, move.

509
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,190
But in England they do have a lot

510
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,570
of formula.

511
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,710
Like in England they'd say, oh, I think

512
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,830
I'm going to have an Indian.

513
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,590
Oh, I'm going to have a Mexican.

514
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,690
You know, that means like a food, right?

515
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,430
Right.

516
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,130
I could murder one.

517
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,010
Right?

518
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,470
It means you really want it, right?

519
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,630
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

520
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,550
I think I'm going to have an Italian.

521
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:31,910
Right?

522
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,410
So they have, you know, a bit in

523
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,570
Scots and Irish.

524
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,250
I don't know.

525
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,610
That's, you know, that they've always been put

526
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,930
down through history anyway.

527
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,750
So they're used to it.

528
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,850
We don't need to get into it with

529
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,310
them any much, any much more.

530
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,470
Same with the black people.

531
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,850
They've been put down for so long.

532
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,090
You don't need to do it anymore.

533
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,310
You know, just stop beating a dead horse

534
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,850
about it.

535
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,970
There's the ups and downs of every culture

536
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,830
and every race and creed and color.

537
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,330
But there are certain races, creeds, and colors

538
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,110
and cultures that have been for centuries just

539
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,710
under the foot of the elitist class, the

540
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,270
middle class, so to speak, and all that.

541
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,930
And this has nothing to do with it

542
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,750
in terms of, you know, how you see

543
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,270
politically.

544
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,150
Oh, you know, the white people, it's a

545
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,870
white man's fault.

546
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,630
No, it's not.

547
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,770
You know, I'm not talking about that, right?

548
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,990
You know, like turning it around.

549
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,810
It's like if you go study anthropology or

550
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,910
sociology in college, all those courses, if you

551
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,310
distill them down, you know what they're really

552
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,570
about?

553
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,250
Just how to blame the white man for

554
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,590
everything.

555
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,030
That's all.

556
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,310
They don't really get into anything.

557
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,590
That's not what I'm talking about.

558
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,230
I'm talking about the inherent objective aspect of

559
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,630
it, right?

560
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,330
So there we go.

561
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,250
White people, food, avoid it if you want

562
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,010
better diet.

563
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,410
If you don't think you want to cook,

564
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,210
move to the east or west coast of

565
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,770
the states.

566
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,690
That's where you're going to, or an international

567
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,250
city, right?

568
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,930
And that's pretty much it.

569
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,550
Now, the rest of the crux of this

570
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,390
sonic event is what do we do now,

571
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,730
right?

572
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,350
I've got fire, I've got water, I've got

573
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,650
some cutlery, pots and pans, right?

574
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,790
What do we do, right?

575
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,110
Let's start that part of the conversation in

576
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,390
terms of food preparation.

577
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,350
What people are mystified, I've noticed through time

578
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,830
when it comes to cooking and food preparation

579
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,730
are two things other than the ingredients of

580
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,050
the food is pots and pans and knives,

581
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,490
utensils in the kitchen.

582
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,470
We're not talking about serving now, right?

583
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,750
So which one do you want to do

584
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,970
first, Bruce, the pots and pans or the

585
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,310
knives?

586
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,410
Okay, the knives.

587
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,590
Thanks, Bruce.

588
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,410
You're welcome.

589
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,770
So let's go with knives first.

590
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,710
I've yet to see, again, I'm going to

591
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,830
be referencing a lot about white people, so

592
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,730
don't, whatever, and this is still true for

593
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,830
many, but I've never been to a white

594
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,790
person's house that had a knife that worked

595
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,350
in the kitchen.

596
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,950
I've never used a serrated, you know what

597
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,950
a serrated edge is?

598
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,190
It's used on a cutting board, you know,

599
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,610
for cutting.

600
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,690
That's only for bread.

601
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,590
You ever go to a white person's house

602
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,810
and you see a cutting board and it's

603
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,130
fuzzy?

604
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,450
It looks like it's a shag carpet.

605
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,030
That's a serrated knife.

606
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,450
And the reason they like serrated knives is

607
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,930
because they don't dull quickly, right?

608
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,950
And all white people have fuzzy cutting boards.

609
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,630
I don't say, I mean all, but, you

610
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,490
know, there's maybe a few dozen in the

611
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,050
world that don't, that are not chefs.

612
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,010
Never use a serrated knife.

613
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,370
You're going to use a serrated knife, get

614
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,410
a glass or do it openly.

615
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,950
You know, don't cut all the way down.

616
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,870
If you have a serrated knife and that's

617
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,410
all you have, a serrated knife means it's

618
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,430
rough, it's not smooth.

619
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,870
When you have a cutting board, cut three

620
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,370
quarters or seven eighths or 90% down

621
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,190
and then turn the item vertically and then

622
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,930
continue cutting.

623
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,490
You see?

624
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,570
So the blade just barely ever touches the

625
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,130
base of the knife or the cutting board.

626
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,390
So what I just did there was save

627
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,690
you from, well, I have to go, I

628
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,730
don't ever want to tell people they have

629
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,930
to buy anything, right?

630
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,470
So, I mean, otherwise I would have done

631
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,850
a podcast that you had to be a

632
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,470
member for it.

633
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,830
I knew that would become a moron magnet

634
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,130
so I don't want to do that.

635
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,770
By the way, just to interject this in

636
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,270
the middle here, I want to thank someone

637
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,930
from Ohio.

638
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,450
I got your anonymous package.

639
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,210
Thank you very much.

640
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,270
So anyway, just going to go back.

641
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,230
Serrated knife, instead of making the fuzzy board,

642
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,830
let's say you're cutting bread or meat or

643
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,050
whatever, cut across however you do, turn the

644
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,610
item or curl it or if it's a

645
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,650
soft item, roll it so it cuts up

646
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,070
into the blade instead of the blade cutting

647
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,270
down.

648
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,190
Please don't know fuzzy cutting boards, okay?

649
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,470
So serrated knives are only for cutting bread

650
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,110
on a bread board and even then most

651
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,330
people don't know how to use them.

652
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,490
I've seen people try to use serrated knives

653
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,010
that keep cutting all the way down to

654
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,410
the base.

655
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,270
What you're supposed to do is cut most

656
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,630
of the way down and then turn, rotate

657
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,850
90 degrees the item you're cutting and then

658
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,050
finish your cut that way.

659
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,550
So you're always cutting in the air.

660
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,530
Do you picture that, Bruce?

661
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,690
Did I get a visual from that?

662
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,170
Okay.

663
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,870
Even if it's a piece of salami or

664
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,550
a piece of tofu, cut most of the

665
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,270
way through, rotate the tofu or the salami

666
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,570
90 degrees and then continue cutting and you'll

667
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,970
notice you're cutting in the air but you're

668
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,010
using the food or whatever you're cutting as

669
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,270
a guide for your knife, right?

670
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,390
So you're basically just touching the board slightly.

671
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,930
Now, if we get to the real talk

672
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,810
about knives, there's something called a santoku knife,

673
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,410
there's something called a chef's knife, there's carving

674
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,230
knives that are very narrow and very long.

675
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,610
Basically, what's called a short chef's knife or

676
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,410
a chef's knife or a santoku which means

677
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,490
three ways in Japanese.

678
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,990
San means three.

679
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,290
They're easy to get.

680
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,350
You can even go to a closeout place

681
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,790
like TJ Maxx or Ross or Marshall Holmes

682
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,670
or whatever.

683
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,770
They have them prepackaged.

684
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,490
They're pretty good.

685
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,330
Santoku, it's a three-way knife.

686
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,170
Usually they have dimples on the side.

687
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,770
They're pretty tall, the knife.

688
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,230
So not quite like a butcher knife but

689
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,250
anyway, look it up.

690
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,890
Or a chef's knife but don't get a

691
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,330
chef's knife that's so like freaking long that

692
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,870
it looks like you could skin a crocodile

693
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,470
with it.

694
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,210
You don't really need that.

695
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,510
Or carving knives are totally useless.

696
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,610
They're really narrow and very long, right?

697
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,550
So get yourself a medium, an 8 or

698
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,810
9-inch, what would that be, 20-centimeter

699
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,350
chef's knife or so or a 7 or

700
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,830
8-inch, 20 or so centimeter santoku knife.

701
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,630
Now, here's the deal about knives.

702
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,250
I've got knives of every variety.

703
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,850
Lately, I've been preferring the closeout ones that

704
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,970
are made for, you buy them for $5

705
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,250
or $10.

706
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,050
I have a Rockwell hardness 64 Japanese sushi

707
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,610
knife that costs about $300, $400.

708
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,030
I have one here, a Mac knife that's

709
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,850
about $250 and all that.

710
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,290
And the ones that I use are just

711
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,250
the ones that I find that are easy,

712
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,230
the most workable and the thinnest blade.

713
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,930
What you want to find also, like Mac

714
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,230
knife, M-A-C, there's a lot of

715
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,770
companies that are copying their technique.

716
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,310
You don't want a forged knife.

717
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,550
You want a stamped knife.

718
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,750
In other words, you want the blade to

719
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,330
be stamped.

720
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,150
So when you're looking at the back of

721
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,810
the blade, not the edge, the opposite, you

722
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,650
want that to be very thin and narrow.

723
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,150
Unlike years ago where even though it was

724
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,550
a sharp knife at the top or the

725
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,590
back of the blade, it was very thick.

726
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,550
You notice that, Bruce?

727
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,790
Those are for, yeah, you don't need that

728
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,350
because what that'll do is it puts too

729
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,450
much of an angle on the edge.

730
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,370
So as you're cutting, it's going to create

731
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,650
more friction on the blade.

732
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,430
What you want is a thin knife.

733
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,830
Mac, for example, part of their claim to

734
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,170
fame is that their knives are stamped and

735
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,170
forged that way.

736
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,450
So the other thing is sharpening a knife.

737
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,410
There are the pull sharpeners.

738
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,610
There are stone sharpeners.

739
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,410
Get a pull sharpener and a very thin,

740
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,970
low abrasive sharpener to practice on.

741
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,510
Have a practice blade or something.

742
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,250
Learn how to practice on a popsicle stick

743
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,410
or a piece of wood because believe it

744
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,130
or not, it won't cut much.

745
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,930
But if you can create a fine edge

746
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,610
on a piece of wood, you can move

747
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,190
up to metal.

748
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,450
You won't really ruin the knife if you

749
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,470
don't know what you're doing because you could

750
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,850
always take it to be sharpened.

751
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,710
But even with a knife that costs several

752
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,190
hundred, even a thousand in credits, it doesn't

753
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,250
come with a really good edge on it.

754
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,610
I know it sounds kind of crazy.

755
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,830
You have to learn how to do that,

756
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,590
which is called knife sharpening.

757
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,850
If you're going to enjoy it.

758
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,330
That was a knife that used to be

759
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,050
handed down from one generation to the next.

760
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,590
Yes.

761
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,390
That's gone.

762
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,230
You don't see much of it.

763
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,370
I consider myself to be a master sharpener,

764
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,910
but it took me over a year, well

765
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,210
actually 10 years of doing it or more.

766
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,150
Actually, I've been sharpening knives for 30 years.

767
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,870
I don't want to talk about the first

768
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,250
20.

769
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,030
It was hit or miss.

770
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,210
I couldn't explain what I was doing.

771
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,630
Once I discovered the way it should be

772
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,930
done or could be done, that's only been

773
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,370
the past few years.

774
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,190
I can cut anything.

775
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,710
As a matter of fact, once I had

776
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,790
an orthotic, that is an insert that you

777
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,670
have made in the shoe.

778
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,830
I was doing coaching and cycling and I

779
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,730
measured the leg length discrepancy.

780
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,850
I said, this one needs to be a

781
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,550
little thinner because that leg is a little

782
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,670
longer than the other leg.

783
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,810
How are you going to trim it?

784
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,030
It's a $300 orthotic.

785
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,710
How do you do that?

786
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,610
You don't want to ruin it.

787
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,010
I just took the sushi knife that I

788
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,050
have and I sliced off a half a

789
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,150
millimeter across and then I went again another

790
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,130
half a millimeter until we got the right

791
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,110
size across.

792
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,810
It looked like the entire orthotic.

793
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,730
See, nothing disturbed.

794
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,490
Like a laser would cut it.

795
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,430
No resistance, no deformation.

796
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,670
Super, super sharp.

797
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,110
Someone would say, well that will dull the

798
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,470
knife.

799
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,830
It would, but so what?

800
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,870
Because now we sharpen it again.

801
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,590
Right, which you should do all the time.

802
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,330
The practice that I do is before I

803
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,410
use a knife, I sharpen it.

804
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,330
Let's say I'm going to prepare a meal.

805
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,690
I'm going to use this particular knife.

806
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,850
Sometimes I'll use more than one type of

807
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,090
knife depending on what I'm cutting.

808
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,950
I'll take the knife out and I'll sharpen

809
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,330
it.

810
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,290
I'll wet it down with a cloth, clean

811
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:26,470
it.

812
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,850
After I'm done using it, I clean the

813
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,570
knife and sharpen it again and then put

814
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:31,910
it away.

815
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,850
The reason why they do that is because

816
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,910
when I've sharpened it after I've used it,

817
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,230
I know it's as good as new now

818
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,570
and if I just have to pull the

819
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,910
knife in a hurry, it's ready to go.

820
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,990
I don't have to be mid-cut saying,

821
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,930
oh, it needs sharpening.

822
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,250
You see?

823
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,050
Right.

824
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,090
And also if I sharpen it, if I

825
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,630
have the time and sharpen it before I

826
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,950
start cutting, then I know that I'm at

827
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,730
the performance.

828
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,690
Now I know to expect the performance that

829
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,610
I would want to expect from a sharp

830
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:58,970
knife.

831
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,150
Never put knives in a drawer.

832
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,530
Never put knives in a dishwasher.

833
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,570
The drawer is obvious.

834
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,250
It gets knocked around every time or anything

835
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,030
touching the blade is going to skew the

836
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,390
edge.

837
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,330
So what do we do about sharpening knives?

838
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,970
Well, there's these things called tungsten carbide knife

839
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,310
pulls.

840
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,350
You could see there are two pieces of

841
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,590
metal if you look very closely.

842
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,390
They crisscross each other at an angle.

843
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,390
It looks like a V and you pull

844
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,490
the knife across that.

845
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,150
The ceramic ones are good, but they wear

846
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,570
out.

847
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,130
So they're not worth getting as much anymore.

848
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,130
Use a tungsten sharpener.

849
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,990
And then you have to learn how to

850
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,250
hone.

851
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,410
Now in the Western world, they go with

852
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,390
a 15 degree angle.

853
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,210
I prefer a 10 to 12, which is

854
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,550
a little steeper, more of the Asian.

855
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,130
It's a little sharper.

856
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,630
It doesn't hold its edge as long.

857
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,750
They found 15 to 20 degrees is when

858
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,850
a knife keeps its edge the longest.

859
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,130
So most sharpeners you're going to get are

860
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,430
going to be in the 15 or 20

861
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,710
degree on the market.

862
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,790
Now I've had a lot of success with

863
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,790
going to closeout stores and there's a blister

864
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,150
pack hanging $5.99 for a Japanese knife.

865
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,390
I just get it just to try it

866
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,730
out and I give it away if it

867
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,410
doesn't work out.

868
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,190
But I do sharpen and check out the

869
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,530
quality.

870
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,130
So between five and ten bucks at a

871
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,190
retail outlet type place, you could get a

872
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,690
pretty decent knife, but you're going to have

873
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,370
to sharpen it.

874
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,730
And it'll still come sharp out of the

875
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,030
package.

876
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,230
It's at that 20 degree angle.

877
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,350
In other words, it's going to rock left

878
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,730
and right.

879
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,290
It won't cut like a razor blade.

880
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,570
So that's pretty much the story of knives.

881
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,010
No, there's no YouTube video I could recommend

882
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,110
for knife sharpening.

883
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,330
I've looked it up and I'm like, huh,

884
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,590
what?

885
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,770
That's not what it's about.

886
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,170
So you're going to have to learn how

887
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,950
to sharpen either from, yes, doing internet research

888
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,510
and also trial and error and understanding the

889
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,290
concept behind it so you have the tools.

890
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,510
You see, when people go to research how

891
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,830
to do certain procedures, it's monkey see, monkey

892
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,110
do.

893
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,410
Most information on the internet, whether it's video

894
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,190
format or not, doesn't give the background, doesn't

895
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,530
really give you the fundamental tools on why

896
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,210
you're doing it.

897
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,510
You see, you get my drift on that,

898
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,710
right?

899
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,850
So you're going to have to learn the

900
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,930
fundamental drift on what shear pressure is, right?

901
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,950
You know, the narrower the edge, the more

902
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,450
it penetrates, you know, the object, right?

903
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,590
You remember years ago, if you saw one

904
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,230
in someone's house or a hotel and it

905
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,290
had a wood floor and you see all

906
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,730
these dots in the floor, that was from

907
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,030
the stiletto heels in the fifties and sixties.

908
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,410
You know, so a 90 pound woman and

909
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,570
a little tiny heel put 1200 pounds of

910
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,910
pressure on the wood floor and deformed it,

911
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,290
made a hole in the floor, right?

912
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,090
You see, so the smaller the surface for

913
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,550
the same amount of weight, the higher the

914
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,050
pressure, that's what cuts.

915
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,910
So the finer the edge, the better.

916
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,070
Because even the sharpest knife in the world

917
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,090
looked under a powerful microscope will look as

918
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,270
blunt as, you know, a dunghill or something,

919
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,250
right?

920
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,650
So that's pretty much on the attitude I

921
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,430
have on knives.

922
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,550
Most of everything you'll see is stainless, but

923
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,730
when you get into the more demanding reaches

924
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,310
of knives, it's going to be carbon steel

925
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,750
because carbon steel has a higher Rockwell hardness.

926
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,290
I think the hardest stainless is in the

927
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,110
mid-fifties, so carbon goes much higher than

928
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,390
that.

929
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,390
And what does a harder knife mean?

930
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,670
It means that you can maintain a sharper

931
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,610
edge longer, right?

932
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,490
The reason why knives dull out is because

933
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,150
the material is soft and deforms, essentially.

934
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,590
Notwithstanding impact or other things, right?

935
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,990
Talking about normal use.

936
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,790
So I don't think most people listening to

937
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,330
this are going to aspire to getting a

938
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,070
carbon knife which does rust and oxidize, right?

939
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,150
Should be oiled if you don't use it

940
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,430
daily.

941
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,610
Even if you do use it daily, oil

942
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,050
it because it creates a seasoning, you know,

943
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,550
like cast iron pans do.

944
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,390
But that coating won't survive when you're sharpening.

945
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,810
And when you're sharpening, it should always be

946
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,510
wet, maybe a dab of soap.

947
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,950
I use Falspar, which is called, Falspar is

948
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,650
a white powder, it's in Bonami, B-O

949
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,450
-N-A-M-I, never scratches yet.

950
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,730
It's a gold foil thing, has a little

951
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,410
chick on it, never scratched yet, been around

952
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,610
for a hundred something years.

953
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,190
Are you familiar with Bonami cleaner?

954
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,270
No, I'm not.

955
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,090
Oh, okay.

956
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,410
You could brush your teeth with it.

957
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,650
I'm going to look that up.

958
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,410
Yeah, because I smoke sometimes I'll get stains

959
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,030
on the lower teeth.

960
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,450
I'm like, Wes, are you going to go

961
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,490
to the dentist and get, no, I'm going

962
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,090
to get some Bonami.

963
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,810
She goes, are you going to brush your

964
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,190
teeth with Bonami?

965
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,310
I say, yeah, I'll burn your lip because

966
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,870
it's alkaline, but yeah, it turns teeth really

967
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,410
white, so.

968
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,150
Anyway, yeah, yeah, it's pretty neat.

969
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,410
It doesn't scratch like, you know, many powdered

970
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,270
cleaners that will scratch.

971
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,190
Right.

972
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,610
Right.

973
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,010
The ones that, especially the ones that are

974
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,610
chlorinated.

975
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,470
Bonami, Falspar is a white abrasive.

976
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,050
It's used like in Crocus or what do

977
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,110
they call those honing, years ago with the

978
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,710
old cars.

979
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,930
When you had a new engine before you

980
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,190
turned it on, you threw some Falspar powder

981
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,330
while you first turned it on to go

982
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,570
inside the valves and it polished everything up,

983
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,130
you know, but it doesn't scratch.

984
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,429
It would be in the 3, 4,000

985
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,429
grit, you know, or higher.

986
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:16,870
Oh, wow.

987
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,170
You see?

988
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,389
Yeah, but it doesn't scratch.

989
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,150
It's Falspar.

990
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,090
It's like chalk.

991
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,710
It's not like granite or ruby or garnet

992
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,510
that scratches.

993
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,150
I use that for a knife.

994
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,370
I use it as a compound because, you

995
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,989
know, I have wet on the, I have

996
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,770
a diamond plate and I have various stones.

997
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,989
So, now we got into a little more

998
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,030
detail on how to maintain knives, which most

999
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,610
people probably won't get into, so I'll switch

1000
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,150
over to pots and pans.

1001
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,690
The reason I'm saying that, I might be

1002
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,429
saying it sarcastically because when I discuss this

1003
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,570
for 10 years with people, I'm not as

1004
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,469
social as I used to be.

1005
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,830
Only like one out of a hundred will

1006
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,889
ever do anything about it.

1007
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,630
So, we'll keep moving.

1008
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,490
At least you know.

1009
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,870
Pots and pans, this is something where people

1010
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,650
can do something more about it because it

1011
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,190
doesn't require any skill that you're going to

1012
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,150
have to go out of your way and

1013
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,930
acquire that could take a long time to

1014
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,430
determine how are you going to use pots

1015
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,970
and pans.

1016
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,730
Essentially, pots and pans, I'm not going to

1017
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,350
talk about Teflon and coatings.

1018
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,790
If you're stupid enough to have one of

1019
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,010
those, it doesn't mean you have to throw

1020
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,910
it away if it's your only pot or

1021
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,210
pan.

1022
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,530
Just don't make it, just don't ever put

1023
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,710
it on heat with anything, nothing in it

1024
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,910
and it gets really hot, right?

1025
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,510
Because I think Teflon starts to evaporate at

1026
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,750
what, 400 or 500 degrees?

1027
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,470
Oh, 500.

1028
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:39,610
So, anyway, and it's a fluoro, and it's

1029
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,310
really messed you up.

1030
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,790
That's why they like using that ceramic coating

1031
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,970
because it'll, and you're already too messed up

1032
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,990
anyway to reverse it.

1033
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,090
So, you keep using it, you'll get a

1034
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,550
little worse, but if you don't use it,

1035
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,170
it's even better.

1036
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,510
So, the biggest thing I find, especially with

1037
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,690
white people, is unless they have like an

1038
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,670
old cast iron pot that they inherited or

1039
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,570
didn't know what to do with, all their

1040
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,770
pots and pans are too thin bottomed, right?

1041
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,510
You pick up, you tap it, you tap

1042
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,950
the side, you tap the bottom, it's the

1043
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,990
same thickness real cheap, right?

1044
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,150
A decent sauce pot, one like that, costs

1045
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,410
in the hundreds, you know, if you're going

1046
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,750
to get like an oil clad or a

1047
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,170
Lincoln or anything like that, most people have

1048
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,250
never invested in that.

1049
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,790
If you happen to have inherited a thick

1050
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,090
bottomed pot, it's the bottom of the pot

1051
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,850
if the whole thing is thick like a

1052
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,690
Le Creuset, which is a baked enamel cast

1053
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:29,950
iron.

1054
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,450
Are you familiar with any of this stuff,

1055
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,690
Bruce, by the way, I'm bringing up?

1056
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,630
No, I'm not.

1057
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,150
That's why I'm taking notes.

1058
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,390
Okay, Le Creuset would be French, it's L

1059
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,770
-E and then C-R-U-S-E

1060
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,270
-T, okay.

1061
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,030
Now, there's no shame, there's no fault and

1062
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,850
there's no flaw to having cheap pots and

1063
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,670
things like that.

1064
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,610
What you do to fix that is you

1065
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,150
go out and you, for two bucks or

1066
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,030
whatever you are, you get what's called a

1067
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,710
heat diffuser.

1068
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,970
Look up a heat diffuser.

1069
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,130
It just looks like two pieces of thin

1070
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,430
metal with lots of holes in it.

1071
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,670
And what that does is you put it

1072
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,010
over your burner and it doesn't create a

1073
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,850
super hot spot and it does just like

1074
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,030
the name says, it diffuses the heat.

1075
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,030
So now, you take a real cheap ass

1076
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,810
pot with a thin bottom that usually would

1077
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,230
burn the food on the bottom and the

1078
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,790
food would still be cold on top because

1079
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,850
it doesn't transfer heat very well in terms

1080
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,450
of evenly.

1081
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,690
You get a heat diffuser and you save

1082
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,130
yourself the trouble of getting pots and pans,

1083
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,050
okay.

1084
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,310
The rules for humans, by the way, and

1085
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,950
the gods for all these utensils is if

1086
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,930
you have meat, cooked meat or touch animal,

1087
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,030
any kind of animal flesh in these pots

1088
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,790
and pans, they're considered unclean so they have

1089
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,830
to be scrubbed, right?

1090
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,650
That's how you scour pots and pans and

1091
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,490
forks and knives to make them clean, right,

1092
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,090
to declare them clean.

1093
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,550
But then again, we'll talk, okay, so pots

1094
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,250
and pans, there we go.

1095
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,370
Then we're going to jump over to the

1096
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:02,770
fridges.

1097
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,430
By the way, do you know if you

1098
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,990
put a piece of meat in a fridge

1099
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,550
or animal flesh, that whole fridge is declared

1100
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,290
unclean, right?

1101
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,090
You're familiar with that concept, right?

1102
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,630
I would think that would be the way

1103
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,190
to go, yeah.

1104
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,870
Yeah, so the only way to really go

1105
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,970
to maintain a divinely clean fridge is to

1106
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,450
have two.

1107
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,050
One for animal flesh and one without.

1108
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,930
Actually, there's some people that I've told this

1109
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,910
to and they've actually done that.

1110
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,870
They actually kept the meat fridge outside and

1111
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,470
the one in the house only has veg

1112
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,270
and dairy products because dairy is not dead.

1113
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,130
It's not animal flesh.

1114
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,750
Okay, so by the way, if anyone has

1115
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,290
any restaurant experience, you can look this up

1116
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,010
in the health codes.

1117
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,450
If you have a fridge in the restaurant,

1118
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,590
the meat always goes on the bottom and

1119
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,630
the veggies on top.

1120
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,470
So if the meat storage starts to drip

1121
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,170
and leak, it's already on the bottom.

1122
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,850
See, if you put the meat on top

1123
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,390
and it drips and leaks, then it's going

1124
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,710
to drip and leak on all your veg.

1125
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,850
Now, all the home fridges have this thing,

1126
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,070
it's a white people thing, vegetable crispers where?

1127
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,670
On the bottom.

1128
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,770
Right, now when you get a roast beef

1129
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,870
or a turkey and you put it in

1130
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,770
the fridge, where are you going to put

1131
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:16,910
it?

1132
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,190
On top of that, aren't you?

1133
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,230
All your fridges are built to be unclean

1134
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,730
and dirty.

1135
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,210
In other words, if you had a restaurant

1136
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,710
business, this is a universal code by the

1137
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,610
way, and you, the inspector from the state

1138
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,750
or whatever health board came over and saw

1139
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,510
that you had meat over vegetable, they would

1140
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,030
fine you.

1141
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,570
But in your homes, it's okay.

1142
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,370
Think about that for a moment.

1143
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,590
Actually, don't think about it.

1144
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,090
It might get you in heaps of trouble.

1145
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,330
All right, so now we've covered how unfortunate

1146
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,830
it is to live in a white people

1147
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,030
food society, getting proper knives or at least

1148
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,690
addressing proper knives.

1149
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,650
And if most of you have serrated knives,

1150
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,050
which you do, don't say you don't because

1151
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,610
you do, don't be aggressive on the cutting

1152
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:02,870
board.

1153
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,390
Make sure it never makes it down to

1154
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,110
the board directly by rotating and get yourself

1155
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,690
a heat diffuser because I know you all

1156
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,130
got cheap ass pots and pans.

1157
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,890
That's the rule, not the exception.

1158
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,390
Yes, someone listening might have some proper cutlery

1159
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,310
or cookware, but that's not the rule.

1160
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,850
So there you go.

1161
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,270
Very simple.

1162
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,610
Now we're ready to cook, aren't we?

1163
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,880
Well, do you think we should add more

1164
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,360
to this?

1165
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,920
Because there is that discussion I did with

1166
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,300
Seth.

1167
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,420
And you know, Seth's demeanor is very good

1168
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,340
in that sense because he's very like, he

1169
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,860
sounds like he just woke up and he's

1170
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,040
kind of tired of everything.

1171
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,940
So it keeps me going slow and it

1172
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,720
keeps me going.

1173
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,700
And he'll ask a question that's redundant.

1174
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,620
I'll have to repeat myself like he wasn't

1175
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,860
listening, which is fine.

1176
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,360
Because it's good for the audience, right?

1177
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,240
A lot of people do like, say, why

1178
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,140
don't you do something with Seth?

1179
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,000
And I'm like, no, I don't want to

1180
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,720
do anything with anyone.

1181
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,200
Because I don't want to be a moron

1182
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,600
magnet.

1183
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,260
In other words, we're at a time in

1184
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,820
history now that if you know this, you

1185
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,600
know it, shut up.

1186
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,220
And if you don't know it, just that's

1187
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,740
too bad.

1188
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,240
And it's like this is if you're listening

1189
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,640
to Greek speak, it's an anomaly.

1190
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,480
It shouldn't be happening.

1191
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,240
So I think there's a lot of stuff

1192
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,580
we covered there, which is how to make

1193
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,660
the perfect rice, which I'm still playing around

1194
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,360
with, which essentially is.

1195
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,400
Oh, hey, I know what I was going

1196
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,860
to ask you.

1197
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,240
Did you ever get to figure out about

1198
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,800
what was going on with that rice?

1199
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,280
Hit or miss.

1200
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,620
Yeah.

1201
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,780
Hit or miss.

1202
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,220
Other rices have gotten better.

1203
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,460
Really?

1204
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,380
This was a variety of an organic variety

1205
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,700
that was just uncookable.

1206
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,620
And I tossed the package.

1207
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,860
It wasn't returnable.

1208
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,620
But this is prophetic, by the way.

1209
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,260
You know, why?

1210
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,200
You know, here's the thing people don't understand.

1211
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,300
And you're going to get, you know, when

1212
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,740
everything in society is told and shown to

1213
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,340
be perfect, that's when the shit's going to

1214
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,640
hit the fan to the point where the

1215
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,480
blades break off.

1216
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:06,720
Right?

1217
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,580
Yeah.

1218
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,060
One of the things that happens that there's

1219
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,820
nothing to eat, not because of Monsanto or

1220
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,120
whatever.

1221
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,460
Yeah, they're going to adding it to it,

1222
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:14,860
too.

1223
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,540
But because of certain events, you know, regarding

1224
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,680
irrigation, water, solar heat, weather.

1225
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:23,900
Right.

1226
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,540
So one thing you'll notice prophetically, is things

1227
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,640
are very rarely do things just hit happen

1228
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,920
all of a sudden, there are things that

1229
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,660
hit too suddenly.

1230
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,440
But usually you're given fair enough warning in

1231
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,480
advance, and it takes generations to take to

1232
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:37,940
happen.

1233
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,920
And it happens.

1234
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,640
On occasion, prophecy happens on occasion, so gradually

1235
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,300
that the people don't see it coming, even

1236
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,380
when it's upon them.

1237
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,100
You see, so, like, for example, the invasion

1238
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,620
of the Babylonians, their Jerusalem was under siege

1239
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,840
for over a decade and a half by

1240
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,380
Assyrians and such, and they thought it was

1241
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,220
going to be the Assyrians.

1242
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,960
But last minute, there's a switch into the

1243
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,500
Babylonian sack them, right?

1244
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,620
Talking about 5600 BC.

1245
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,420
So they were used to it.

1246
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,260
They're used to siege.

1247
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,480
Look at Hezekiah's tunnel, you know, Hezekiah was

1248
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,640
all about siege, you know, and others, you

1249
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,020
know, and then, you know, so anyway.

1250
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,260
Yeah.

1251
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,120
Why don't you put on some music?

1252
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,800
I want to take a five minute break.

1253
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,980
I've got to run and do something.

1254
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,860
I'll be right back.

1255
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,460
So we get into some food preparation.

1256
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,340
I'll see you in about five minutes.

1257
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,180
Sounds good.

1258
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,480
Greek.

1259
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,610
There we go.

1260
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,650
And we're back.

1261
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,130
We're back.

1262
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,810
Cool beans.

1263
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:40,710
Yeah.

1264
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,150
All right.

1265
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,510
So regarding of what to cook, I've gone

1266
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,310
over on the archives there regarding making a

1267
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,830
perfect rice, which is feared by most white

1268
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,290
people and most cultures too.

1269
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,790
But, you know, the Asians and Middle Eastern

1270
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,870
cultures, you know, they are quite well, even

1271
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,590
there, then there's room for improvement, but they're

1272
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,570
well skilled in that.

1273
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,310
Basically, just a quick thing, follow the instructions

1274
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,070
on the rice, but rinse the rice and

1275
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,830
let it stand in water or in a

1276
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,850
strainer for at least five or 10 minutes

1277
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,390
before you put it in the pot.

1278
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:13,350
Right.

1279
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,370
And make sure that your lid is long

1280
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:15,690
grain.

1281
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,890
With the brown rice, I believe you mentioned

1282
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,630
that it should be for significantly longer.

1283
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:21,990
Overnight is best.

1284
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:22,670
Mm hmm.

1285
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,050
Overnight is best.

1286
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:24,330
Yeah.

1287
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,230
Whole grain.

1288
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,410
Now here's the thing about whole foods and

1289
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:27,750
whole.

1290
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,430
I would suggest that when you hear the

1291
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,930
term whole food, it mostly applies to grain,

1292
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,530
I would say.

1293
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,370
OK.

1294
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:38,150
Right.

1295
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,330
Because when you have a steak, is it

1296
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,810
a whole steak, a whole, you know, or

1297
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:42,870
anything else.

1298
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,810
So it's usually grain.

1299
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,810
So when you hear the term whole food,

1300
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,570
it's not processed, which would be grain.

1301
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,350
By the way, there's no such thing as

1302
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,650
gluten allergy.

1303
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,490
That is just an allergy to a very

1304
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,270
bad quality grain.

1305
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,370
If there was such a thing as a

1306
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,290
gluten allergy, there would be no one alive

1307
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,150
today because most societies relied on wheat to

1308
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,670
stay alive.

1309
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,130
Yeah.

1310
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,950
So again, that goes back to the degradation

1311
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,210
of the product.

1312
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:09,790
Yeah.

1313
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,510
So all that gluten-free stuff is really

1314
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:12,950
stupid.

1315
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,530
But, you know, it's planet Earth, so it

1316
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,110
has to fit.

1317
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:16,790
Right.

1318
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,930
Essentially, when you're dealing with a whole food,

1319
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,730
I'll give you a story from several people.

1320
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,610
If you've heard of macrobiotics, which is about

1321
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,230
eating seasonally, eating locally, I don't recommend it

1322
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:33,650
because it's very Sinocentric, Japanese centric, and they're

1323
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,970
very dogmatic people.

1324
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:40,930
I mean, it's almost they've turned it into

1325
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,390
a I call it macro neurotics because it's

1326
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,470
almost like a disease.

1327
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,070
But it does work.

1328
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,510
The spirit behind it, of course, is not

1329
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,130
a good one.

1330
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,810
But evidently eating the way that they suggest

1331
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,370
is good.

1332
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,090
You see what I mean?

1333
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,350
It's been hijacked from the beginning, especially when

1334
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,090
it was brought over to America by Michio

1335
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,650
Kushi, who I knew, and Shizuko Yamamoto, who

1336
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:07,010
I knew, and also George Asawa, who was

1337
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,990
their teacher, I didn't know.

1338
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,630
He died before I was born, I think.

1339
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,350
Then there were other bunch of white people

1340
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,570
that tried to take it over and run

1341
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:13,690
it.

1342
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,390
But one of the stories about macrobiotics is

1343
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,510
when they first brought it to eat whole,

1344
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,210
basically grains, proportions of grain to bean, and

1345
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,950
how to eat a balanced diet, and also

1346
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,190
how to heal things by changing the attributes

1347
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,770
of the food.

1348
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,130
Changing the food, because each food has an

1349
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,110
attribute to the body.

1350
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,130
Get my drift.

1351
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,910
Eventually, you can get into the medicine of

1352
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,010
it.

1353
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,530
Each type of food corresponds to a certain

1354
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,690
organ of the body.

1355
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,870
Mostly the ones that are neutral, like the

1356
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,650
cabbage looks like the brain, or the lotus

1357
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,430
root cross-section looks like the lung.

1358
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,830
No, a banana doesn't look like you know

1359
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:55,430
what, right?

1360
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,070
That's tropical, right?

1361
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,250
You see more of the mid-temperate stuff

1362
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,630
grown.

1363
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:05,770
When they started having seminars in Northern California

1364
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,490
and Central California, a lot of people were

1365
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,490
interested in it, from all sorts of life

1366
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,090
came over.

1367
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,390
I think I've said this story before.

1368
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,810
They had a seminar every week or every

1369
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,170
two weeks.

1370
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,270
They noticed that, this is in the late

1371
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,330
60s, early 70s, they noticed after about a

1372
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,110
series of seminars, the only people that were

1373
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,630
showing up were the hippie types, the stoners

1374
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,130
and all that.

1375
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,230
One day they just stopped and said, well

1376
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,590
why do you guys keep coming back?

1377
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,950
Because no one else is.

1378
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,310
He said, well because we don't have to

1379
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,210
get high anymore.

1380
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,650
We've noticed that if we eat what you

1381
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,470
say, we feel high all the time.

1382
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,570
There you go.

1383
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,150
If you get yourself a good quality whole

1384
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,690
grain brown rice and you have some other

1385
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,990
grains that you can mix it with, like

1386
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,310
some barley or whole oat, millet is really

1387
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,850
good to add to it in small amounts.

1388
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,850
If you have a high quality organic brown

1389
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,750
rice and you cook it properly and have

1390
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,770
it in low proportions of protein with it,

1391
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,330
you will start to feel high.

1392
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,230
In other words, you will feel this constant

1393
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,450
feeling of euphoria.

1394
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,780
Nothing wrong with that.

1395
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,280
I just wanted to bring up when you

1396
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,780
hear whole foods, it's grains and what eating

1397
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,320
whole grains cooked properly can do for the

1398
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,780
individual.

1399
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,040
What else?

1400
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,460
We spoke about hearty tubers, what would be

1401
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,040
a potato.

1402
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,960
Learn how to do stovetop.

1403
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,980
Even if everyone likes a baked potato, don't

1404
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,040
bake it.

1405
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,360
Put it in water and lots of salt,

1406
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,060
15-20 minutes.

1407
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,520
Poke some holes in it with a fork.

1408
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,900
Go at least to the middle of it

1409
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,740
or a third way through.

1410
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,820
Put it in a stovetop in a pot

1411
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,860
with a tight lid with a weight on

1412
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,020
it.

1413
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,020
Make sure it doesn't overboil or overspill.

1414
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,720
Then take the water out of the pot

1415
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,600
and just leave the potato sitting on a

1416
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,940
low heat for five minutes.

1417
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,700
Rotate it.

1418
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,520
Turn off the heat for five minutes.

1419
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,120
You'll open the lid again.

1420
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,800
You'll see the potato released a lot of

1421
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,100
steam.

1422
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,920
Rotate the potato for another five minutes.

1423
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,600
Turn it off for five or ten.

1424
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,380
Come back another five minutes on low.

1425
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,980
This is all stovetop.

1426
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,640
You've got a stovetop baked potato.

1427
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:18,700
Go figure.

1428
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,880
You know, one of my favorites, by the

1429
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,080
way.

1430
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,440
Have you done it?

1431
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,540
Oh, yeah.

1432
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,400
Many, many, many times.

1433
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,280
It works well.

1434
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,300
It works well and it's safe.

1435
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,720
And you know when you talk about that

1436
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,080
aroma towards the end.

1437
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,840
It does have that.

1438
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,720
Oh, yeah.

1439
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,600
If you're going to do mashed potatoes, do

1440
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,280
it the same way now people chop up

1441
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,460
to make mash or potato salad.

1442
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,460
When the potato is barely fork tender, take

1443
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,620
it out of the water and put it

1444
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,400
back in the pot.

1445
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,800
If you're making potato salad or mashed potatoes,

1446
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,060
imagine opening the pot lid and you have

1447
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,200
that baked potato flavor in your potato salad

1448
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,400
or mash.

1449
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,600
You know, like the most delicious mash is

1450
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,780
baked potato mash, not the kind that you

1451
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,060
boil.

1452
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,240
So now you can achieve, when I do

1453
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,160
mashed potatoes, people freak out like I never

1454
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,380
had mashed potatoes in my life.

1455
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,220
Basically because they do a stovetop bake to

1456
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,820
make mash.

1457
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,040
Actually, as a matter of fact, let's just

1458
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,420
be dogmatic and say this.

1459
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,480
If you cook potatoes, do it all stovetop

1460
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,440
baked and whatever potato dish you have, it

1461
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,780
will be really potato-y and delicious if

1462
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,120
there is such a thing as potato-y.

1463
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,480
Now, you can do the same with beets

1464
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,540
and turnips or any other tuber, any root

1465
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,580
vegetable, carrots.

1466
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,360
A simple carrot recipe is to steam it

1467
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,480
or just put the carrots in a saucepan

1468
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,920
or a pot with a tight lid, barely

1469
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,340
cut.

1470
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,520
I never got into how to do cuts.

1471
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,580
Various cuts change the flavor of food.

1472
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,500
You know, if you grate a carrot, slice

1473
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,240
a carrot or chop a carrot, it tastes

1474
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,680
like three different things, even though it's the

1475
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,160
same carrot.

1476
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,060
The cut changes the flavor.

1477
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,460
Like a steak will taste different than a

1478
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,120
hamburger, even if it was the same cut.

1479
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,380
What was it, a turquoise?

1480
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,540
Oh, roasting it.

1481
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,020
That's what it was.

1482
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,920
You mentioned that.

1483
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,380
With carrots, you could do stovetop roasting.

1484
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,800
The key to a roast is the browning,

1485
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,820
the caramelization.

1486
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,560
You cheat with it by adding just a

1487
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,820
little bit of honey or sugar or some

1488
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,620
sweetener, even some kind of a fruit juice,

1489
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,020
a dash of apple juice or grape juice.

1490
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,900
In other words, if you're making carrots, just

1491
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,860
go ahead and slice them the long way.

1492
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,260
Actually, I would hate to see a white

1493
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,060
person with a serrated knife trying to cut

1494
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,100
a carrot the long way.

1495
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,880
But anyway, you got to go, yeah, no

1496
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,720
way it's going to happen.

1497
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,580
So anyway, I don't get into a lot

1498
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,200
of the techniques because I know the rule

1499
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,900
is that people have crap equipment.

1500
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,100
And you don't need gizmos and gadgets.

1501
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,360
Back to the carrots.

1502
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,120
Just get some heat into them, steamed where

1503
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,440
they're just barely fork tender, meaning they're still

1504
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,920
crunchy.

1505
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,560
Drain the water out.

1506
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,340
And with carrots, I don't because they're going

1507
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,000
to leave a glaze.

1508
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,640
I just put a couple of tablespoons of

1509
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,080
water and when the water evaporates, it's about

1510
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,620
time to add some kind of sweetener and

1511
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,460
a little bit of fat.

1512
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,800
When I say fat, it would be butter

1513
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,480
or oil.

1514
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,860
Avoid using too much olive oil if you're

1515
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,540
going to use a long duration of heat

1516
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,040
because it doesn't taste good.

1517
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,220
It goes to a high level of rancidity.

1518
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,460
Use peanut oil, sunflower oil, and even a

1519
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,760
quality canola oil.

1520
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,660
They call it rapeseed.

1521
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,980
For a while, they're saying, oh, it's really

1522
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,260
bad.

1523
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,960
Well, that's how you make siren gas with

1524
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,880
canola oil, right, rapeseeds, that real toxic gas,

1525
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,820
if you know what you're doing.

1526
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,360
So anyway, there are many movements of latching

1527
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,480
onto something that's bad for you and pushing

1528
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:45,720
it.

1529
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,740
But either way, olive oil should be a

1530
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,040
finishing.

1531
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,140
You could use a non-toasted sesame oil

1532
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:52,980
also for cooking.

1533
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,040
That's also good for oil pulling.

1534
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,340
If we've ever discussed oil pulling when you

1535
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:57,880
wake up.

1536
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,940
Anyway, you take a teaspoon of oil and

1537
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,480
gargle with it and then spit it out.

1538
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:03,880
Does the body good?

1539
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,580
Okay, but back to the carrots.

1540
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,960
When you get your sweetener and they're low

1541
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,600
heat, go from low to medium until you

1542
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,720
get a char.

1543
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,320
If you don't stir it, move them around

1544
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,660
or a glaze and it makes it really

1545
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,120
delicious.

1546
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,840
I have prepared personally roasted meals, baked meals,

1547
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,420
all stovetop and served them and people thought

1548
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,920
they were roasted or baked in the oven.

1549
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,060
It was all stovetop.

1550
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,020
Now, what does that mean?

1551
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,100
When you do everything stovetop, you conserve a

1552
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,180
lot of heat because an oven is basically

1553
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,740
a big box you have to get really

1554
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,120
hot and they're very inefficient.

1555
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,640
They're only about 10% efficient or 50

1556
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,860
% efficient, the best.

1557
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,960
And the burners in the stoves and ovens

1558
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,280
are always in the wrong spot.

1559
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,420
And electric's a little better because the burner

1560
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,640
goes around the edge.

1561
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,900
But most ovens, they put the burner in

1562
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,380
the center, which is a hot spot.

1563
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,220
It should have double burner left and right.

1564
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,660
We never got into master roasting or master

1565
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,140
baking techniques.

1566
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,900
But if you understand that there's been a

1567
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,320
culinary movement in Spain that actually have surpassed

1568
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,360
the French culinary movement in modern times, most

1569
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,380
of the hot cuisine or high-end cooking

1570
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,660
places in Spain or restaurants, they have to

1571
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,160
still design and build their own equipment.

1572
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,460
If I were to do a restaurant, I

1573
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,920
wouldn't go out and buy the equipment that

1574
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,340
they sell.

1575
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,940
It's crap.

1576
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,740
It's whoever put it together is stupid or

1577
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,060
is not into making good food.

1578
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,580
I would have to build and design my

1579
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,840
own grills and ovens and all that to

1580
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,980
put the heat where I want it.

1581
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,320
I know it sounds kind of crazy, but

1582
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,220
I just finished mentioning that look at the

1583
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,160
refrigerators that they sell you for your homes.

1584
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:37,740
They're backwards.

1585
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,180
Pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?

1586
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:41,760
Yep.

1587
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,260
So again, you can get a good glaze

1588
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,320
or caramelization on the stovetop by, I call

1589
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,840
it cheating, by adding a sweetener.

1590
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,160
Anything that has a little sweetness to it,

1591
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,900
starchiness will caramelize and it'll just dark brown.

1592
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,120
That's where that umami flavor comes from.

1593
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,280
So pasta is another thing.

1594
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,400
There's noodles pasta.

1595
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,620
Make the water saltier than you normally do.

1596
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,640
There's an old saying in Italian where the

1597
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,340
water for the pasta should be as salty

1598
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,020
as the sea.

1599
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,760
That's a little too salty.

1600
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,340
It actually really isn't.

1601
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,360
But when you do that, it gives the

1602
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,280
noodle more flavor.

1603
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,460
Very often I see or have had, I

1604
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,660
don't eat that much, but a noodle dish

1605
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,020
or whatever, and I could tell that the

1606
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,500
water was not salted enough.

1607
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,420
The noodle is kind of bland, right?

1608
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,820
Also good salts.

1609
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,600
Find out what they are.

1610
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,600
Not all salts are created equal.

1611
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,700
The best salts are the ones that are

1612
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,320
assured that were harvested without metal.

1613
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,180
You're going to say, what do they use

1614
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:46,860
in Greek?

1615
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,380
What are they, plastic spoons and wooden shovels?

1616
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:49,640
Yeah.

1617
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Expect to pay 20 pound or 35 credits

1618
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,760
in US credits per pound for a quality

1619
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,480
salt, right?

1620
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,840
So we're looking at $2 an ounce roughly

1621
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,560
for a quality salt.

1622
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,440
I've landed on lately some Thai.

1623
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,240
I've been investigating salt source from Thailand.

1624
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,140
Seem to be a very high quality.

1625
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,200
They don't cost that much.

1626
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,340
They're actually pennies on the ounce and I've

1627
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,160
been enjoying them.

1628
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,360
A really good salt should be salty initially.

1629
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,820
You just dab some on your finger.

1630
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,720
Don't wet your finger and dab it in

1631
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,040
the salt.

1632
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,840
Just do it dry.

1633
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,980
It should be enough.

1634
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,020
It should be salt initially and then have

1635
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,000
a sweet, earthy finish.

1636
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,520
If you have like white people salt or

1637
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,220
table salt, it's salty and then it gets

1638
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,740
really salty and metallic.

1639
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,480
That's poison.

1640
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:43,620
Right?

1641
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,120
Have you ever had a good quality salt,

1642
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,300
Bruce, where you taste it and it's salty

1643
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,480
and it finishes off as being sweet and

1644
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:50,840
earthy?

1645
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:51,380
Yeah.

1646
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,460
And we do get a caller, by the

1647
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:53,700
way.

1648
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,060
Oh, we do?

1649
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:55,620
All right.

1650
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,640
Let's bring him on in.

1651
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,300
And his first name is Joe, I believe.

1652
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:00,920
Go ahead, Joe.

1653
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,180
Greetings.

1654
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:05,660
Hey.

1655
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,240
Greetings, you guys.

1656
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,040
Okay.

1657
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,680
Can you hear me?

1658
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,640
Can you hear Greek?

1659
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,800
I do not hear nothing.

1660
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,380
Okay, just a second.

1661
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,680
Oh, you don't hear us?

1662
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,420
Okay, try it now.

1663
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,180
How about that?

1664
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,620
No, I got to put it in like

1665
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:23,840
this.

1666
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,520
Okay, go ahead.

1667
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,180
How about now?

1668
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,240
You hear us?

1669
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:28,880
Yes.

1670
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,800
Loud and clear.

1671
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,140
All right.

1672
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:31,580
Okay.

1673
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,580
Joe, go ahead.

1674
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,660
What's on your mind?

1675
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,960
You know what?

1676
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,740
I really wasn't sure.

1677
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,420
I just saw that there was some folks

1678
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,960
calling in and I thought maybe we were

1679
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,260
just having a conversation casually, but I didn't

1680
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,900
know the call was still going on.

1681
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,380
I thought it was over or maybe that

1682
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,600
the Greek was just having more entertaining conversations

1683
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,500
in a private capacity.

1684
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,940
I didn't know we were live right now.

1685
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,240
We're live, but let's just say that it's

1686
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,700
a private conversation that happens to be streamed.

1687
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,040
So you are our first stream monkey of

1688
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,380
the night.

1689
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,820
I'll shut up so you can say what

1690
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,520
you got to say.

1691
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,700
Go for it.

1692
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,580
Man, I really don't know what to say

1693
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,120
at this point.

1694
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,900
I was expecting just to be having a

1695
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,540
conversation with some gentlemen on just kind of

1696
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,040
casually talking, but I don't have the wherewithal

1697
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,240
like Sam or somebody like that to be

1698
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,700
going live with you, man.

1699
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:35,900
That's all right.

1700
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,020
I got casual shoes.

1701
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,520
I got casual shoes, casual pants, casual shirts,

1702
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,060
and now we got casual conversation.

1703
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,380
No, we were talking about food tonight, aspects

1704
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,600
of food, the pitfalls of white people, food,

1705
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,840
the pitfalls of how people let everything go

1706
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,460
where they don't even have sharp knives in

1707
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:58,960
their house.

1708
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,480
They got thin pots and pans where they

1709
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,380
can't cook even if they wanted to.

1710
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:09,880
Teflon, we talked about basically how to pursue

1711
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,880
various ways to remedy those things without abandoning

1712
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,640
those things.

1713
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,620
Would you say that sums it up, Bruce?

1714
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,340
Yeah, that pretty much sums it right up

1715
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,400
and a lot of good info.

1716
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,420
We'll have this, of course, up in the

1717
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:21,820
archives.

1718
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,520
Did you have anything else, Joe?

1719
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,640
I got a question for you.

1720
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,020
I read a book called, I think it

1721
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:36,180
was called The Electric Body, but somebody stole

1722
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,960
it from me and I cannot remember the

1723
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,840
name of the author.

1724
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,960
I had looked into it before, but it

1725
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,220
was a good reference of information.

1726
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,920
He was talking about piezoelectricity in the body.

1727
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,480
That just made me think of all sorts

1728
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,580
of things with regards to converting energy in

1729
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,760
the body, the relations of that and how

1730
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,980
it is, I guess, I don't want to

1731
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,960
say replicated or displayed in other forms because

1732
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,960
it seems like that's a major function with

1733
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,420
regards to magnetism.

1734
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,200
Let me just interrupt because without the vacuum

1735
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,020
of time, even when we show Frankenstein, which

1736
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,760
is a parody of Ben Franklin used to,

1737
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,840
when he was a big proponent of electricity,

1738
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,720
he used to get slaves and chop them

1739
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,900
up in pieces and put them back together

1740
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,160
and try to revive them with electricity.

1741
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,240
Mary Shelley found that out and freaked out.

1742
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,980
So she wrote, yeah, these are your founding

1743
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,660
fathers in America, a bunch of scumbags.

1744
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,480
I was going to ask you, Greg, do

1745
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,460
you think this also harkens in now when

1746
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,600
he mentioned about the piezoelectricity in the body?

1747
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,320
I think it goes much farther than that.

1748
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,140
It doesn't work.

1749
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,240
It's irrelevant.

1750
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,300
Hold on, it's irrelevant without the vacuum.

1751
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,780
Right, exactly.

1752
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,360
I was going to say, this explains a

1753
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,180
lot of things in the lawful, in Leviticus

1754
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,280
as far as being lawful, food, clothing, shelter,

1755
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,920
as far as what was laid down for

1756
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,260
what man should be doing.

1757
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,340
You look at some of that, how that

1758
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:22,360
might play an effect to stay lawfully and

1759
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,060
why it was put there.

1760
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,960
Of course, the gods don't really say why,

1761
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,320
they just give it to you and that's

1762
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:29,680
that.

1763
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,200
Well, here's the other thing, even back then,

1764
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,420
the people were too stupid to comprehend why.

1765
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,240
Correct.

1766
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,560
If you don't believe me, go read about

1767
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,240
the comments of what the people were doing

1768
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,840
while they even were in their presence.

1769
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,220
Yeah, yeah.

1770
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,760
By the way, the biblical text is a

1771
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,570
misanthropic text, right?

1772
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:51,890
You understand?

1773
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,490
You get what I mean?

1774
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,550
It's misanthropic.

1775
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,790
You read the Bible, you're like, these people

1776
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,210
suck.

1777
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:02,290
So anyway, without the biological vacuum, electricity doesn't

1778
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:02,890
mean anything.

1779
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,450
I think the vacuum, take care of the

1780
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,870
vacuum and the electrical part will take care

1781
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:10,430
of itself.

1782
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,870
As a matter of fact, there's a guy,

1783
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,890
John Bedini, did a bunch of DVDs called

1784
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:15,990
Energy from the Vacuum.

1785
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:16,650
You remember that?

1786
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,610
Energy from the Vacuum is a short movie

1787
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,110
about that.

1788
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,690
Oh man, that's a name I haven't heard

1789
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:23,790
of.

1790
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,530
His brother died within four hours apart, and

1791
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,810
they were in their mid-60s.

1792
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,910
Yeah, talk about, just like the, talking about

1793
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,710
talk, Anthony Bourdain allegedly was committed suicide.

1794
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,570
Yeah, right.

1795
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,750
He was mixed up with CNN, which is

1796
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,590
mixed up political.

1797
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:41,230
By the way, just to bounce around a

1798
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,710
little bit, are you guys familiar with the

1799
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,250
treachery and the crap that was going on

1800
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,170
in the Roman Empire?

1801
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,770
If they didn't like you, you're a political

1802
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,910
official or famous person.

1803
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,550
They said, well, the emperor doesn't like you

1804
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:54,970
anymore.

1805
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:56,870
You have a choice.

1806
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,490
Either take your own life or we'll kill

1807
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:58,670
you.

1808
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:00,190
And if you take your own life, it'll

1809
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:01,330
be more honorable, you know?

1810
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:03,990
Right.

1811
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:05,890
I guess when they killed you...

1812
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,550
When you're talking about the vacuum, the way

1813
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:13,090
I understand it is that matter or the

1814
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:18,170
fields that encompass matter have the ability to

1815
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,370
compress or go, I guess you could call,

1816
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,950
go in phase to smaller levels of space.

1817
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,190
Is that what you mean by vacuum?

1818
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,290
I'm just trying to be clear.

1819
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,670
Yeah, well, it's really hard to be clear

1820
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,530
because it's out of this, this type of

1821
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,830
thinking is not in the world right now,

1822
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,370
but you have to comprehend counter space also.

1823
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,810
Counter space is the opposite of space, but

1824
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,550
it's not the opposite of space.

1825
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,350
You see, it's not like hot and cold.

1826
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,790
You could but it's not the, it's not

1827
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,590
like in science fiction, they got matter, anti

1828
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:50,910
-matter.

1829
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,110
Counter space, everything comes out.

1830
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,910
Like, for example, if you draw it, if

1831
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,350
you have a, imagine a dot in the

1832
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:01,910
center of a circle and that represents the

1833
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,710
locus point of a circle, the center.

1834
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,970
And from that dot to the, that's how

1835
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:07,810
you create a circle.

1836
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,270
You make a radius and you spin it

1837
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,470
around 360, actually 361 degrees and you make

1838
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:13,270
a circle, right?

1839
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:16,250
So now we're talking all two dimensional, right?

1840
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,310
And with the dot, you think is one

1841
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,030
dimension, but there's actually a counter spatial element.

1842
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,010
When you're drawing that dot or you're imagining

1843
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,230
that dot, it's not just a point in

1844
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,230
space, but imagine that it's the end, you're

1845
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,870
looking at the end of a line that

1846
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,750
goes to infinity.

1847
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,050
That's what a dot really is.

1848
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,010
And when you bring in counter space into

1849
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,370
the picture, you could imagine, you know, taking

1850
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,530
a pole, it looks like a rod, let's

1851
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,110
say 10 feet long, and you hold it

1852
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,050
and you just look at the end, it

1853
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,370
just looks like a dot on the end,

1854
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:43,630
right?

1855
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,130
So now you're starting to, that's how you

1856
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,410
deal with counter space.

1857
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,470
And some people ask me, can you explain

1858
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,990
counter space?

1859
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:53,190
And I do, I spend hours on Skype

1860
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,970
or have spent explaining counter space and it

1861
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,410
takes usually a week or two to come

1862
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,930
back and they're like, oh, okay, I either

1863
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:59,930
don't get it or I want to hear

1864
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:00,230
more.

1865
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,730
So once you understand counter space, like if

1866
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,570
you think space, you define it as pressure,

1867
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,350
counter space would be the opposite of that,

1868
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,510
would be a negative pressure, but it's not

1869
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,050
sucking like a vacuum cleaner.

1870
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,930
You know, sometimes I'd make public discussions or

1871
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:18,970
whatever, and oh, the Greek says we're like

1872
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,050
vacuum cleaners, you know, no, I do not.

1873
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,530
It's not that type of vacuum, it's a

1874
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,410
counter spatially induced vacuum.

1875
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,550
And when you talk about fields, you know,

1876
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,270
there's no branch of science that can define

1877
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,530
a field, still.

1878
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,210
They tell you it's waves and waves is

1879
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,090
not what something is.

1880
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,450
Waves is what something does.

1881
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,490
So they can't define that something.

1882
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,470
And I will probably never do public discussions,

1883
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:46,590
I've said this about other things, as I

1884
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:48,850
see about counter space and these other things

1885
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,170
in great detail.

1886
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:55,890
So would you, would it be safe to

1887
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,870
say, and I sometimes refer to that as

1888
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:01,450
a complimentary domain, sort of like if you

1889
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,870
could think of what is manifested in space,

1890
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:08,350
the polar opposite of that would be what's

1891
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,050
not manifested or whatever would be the…

1892
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,350
Well, all right, let me just fill it

1893
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:18,729
in for you, so it's more continuous.

1894
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,529
What you see as space is a manifestation

1895
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:26,170
of a pattern that comes from counter space.

1896
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,569
Like remember that dot that we constructed, the

1897
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:29,930
circle using a radius?

1898
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,270
Now everyone says that dot is one point,

1899
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,250
one dimension, I'm telling you that's the end

1900
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:35,950
of a line.

1901
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,270
You can visualize that, right?

1902
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:40,790
You're not looking at the length of the

1903
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,590
line, just the end of the line.

1904
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,970
Whether it's the beginning or the end is

1905
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:46,470
not important at this point, it's just the

1906
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,490
end of a line.

1907
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:52,189
Okay, so what you see, it manifests everything

1908
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:55,450
in the universe, physical and energetic, is the

1909
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:57,210
end of the line of counter space.

1910
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:00,939
Can I ask you a question, Greg?

1911
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,080
Do you dream a lot or have you

1912
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,740
had…

1913
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,000
Never.

1914
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,540
I don't dream.

1915
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,380
I don't know how old you are.

1916
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,760
I'll tell you, I'm half a century plus

1917
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,060
three.

1918
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,840
Did you experience anything during that psychedelic era

1919
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,760
in life?

1920
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:23,080
I'm not sure, I'm making an assumption, but

1921
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,700
I'm just throwing that out there, because that

1922
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,420
kind of language, I usually only find people

1923
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,620
who have experienced altered states of consciousness who

1924
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,960
really understand that kind of language, and I

1925
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,100
can kind of like…

1926
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:41,439
I'm not a relativist, but I would suggest

1927
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,899
that the psychedelic stuff was a dummy load.

1928
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,700
You don't need it, you're already equipped with,

1929
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:49,899
you already got everything you got.

1930
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,060
To me, what's psychedelic is what's considered to

1931
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,640
be normal.

1932
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,580
For me, psychedelic is like going to look

1933
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,100
at what Harvard is teaching, or MIT, or

1934
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,960
some underground government lab.

1935
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:06,760
That's some bullshit.

1936
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,460
Actually, BS, bad science.

1937
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,500
To me, psychedelic is seeing what's going on

1938
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,040
around me.

1939
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,530
Counter space is interesting.

1940
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:20,030
Why don't you go check out a little

1941
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,270
bit of J.J. Thompson and Charles Proteus

1942
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,090
Steinmetz.

1943
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,730
A little bit of Eric Dollard, maybe, if

1944
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,570
you could stomach it.

1945
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,530
He seems pretty normal on YouTube.

1946
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:32,490
I would get his older ones, when he

1947
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,970
was talking about when he was in electronics.

1948
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,910
Who was that first person you've seen?

1949
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,330
J.J. Thompson.

1950
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,510
Recent Studies in Electrical Experiments.

1951
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,310
It's a 900-page…

1952
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,230
Charles Proteus Steinmetz.

1953
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,570
Don't try to read Steinmetz.

1954
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,530
There's very few people alive that can still

1955
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:51,510
comprehend what even his point of view was.

1956
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,210
I would just go read about what he

1957
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,430
wrote about counter space.

1958
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,670
Believe it or not, on the rectangle, anywhere

1959
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:01,530
you go, there's very little about counter space

1960
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,230
discussion.

1961
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,730
It does exist.

1962
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,970
I use it all the time when I

1963
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,850
do weather work.

1964
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,110
The weather is a function of counter space.

1965
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:13,430
Flowers, dandelions are a function of counter space.

1966
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:17,470
Animals, plants, planets, everything is a function of

1967
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:18,250
counter space.

1968
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,350
Let me ask you a question.

1969
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,170
I know you are familiar with Wilhelm Reich's

1970
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:24,490
work.

1971
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,570
His terminology is screwed up, though.

1972
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,050
Go ahead.

1973
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,970
I've experimented for years with Tantra and preserving

1974
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:40,130
my discharge, if you will.

1975
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,450
No, no, no.

1976
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,590
Hold on, hold on.

1977
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,990
Those are a bunch of degenerates.

1978
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,110
All that information that comes out of the

1979
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:51,830
East is the same degenerate crap that you

1980
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,890
get from the Catholic Church, I mean, on

1981
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:54,450
that level.

1982
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:58,950
In other words, an average Catholic thinks that

1983
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:02,990
everything they're doing is right, but if you

1984
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,730
go look, everything they're doing is wrong.

1985
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,850
Everything that you hear in the Western world,

1986
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,950
and I mean everything, about Eastern sciences, you've

1987
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,010
been pranked.

1988
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:16,210
And the degenerates that they send over here

1989
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:18,130
that are gurus, they call gurus a bunch

1990
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:18,810
of assholes.

1991
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,170
So does that mean that you're never going

1992
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,110
to find out about Kundalini and all this

1993
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,550
other stuff?

1994
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:25,830
No.

1995
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,510
You're going to have to find out for

1996
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,590
yourself, because there ain't no real information about

1997
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:32,750
it on the rectangle or has been taught

1998
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,310
ever in the West, ever.

1999
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:38,350
Just like Tai Chi, you're going to see

2000
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,170
some slow movement and all that stuff that

2001
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,970
works well, but the real Tai Chi is

2002
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,110
so fast you can't even see it happening.

2003
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,430
In other words, if you're a real Eastern

2004
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,990
master coming over here trying to teach Kundalini

2005
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,750
and all that stuff, you would be dead.

2006
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,390
Once they found out you were teaching it,

2007
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,390
they'd come over here and assassinate your ass.

2008
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,790
I think now they'd be suiciding you.

2009
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,250
That's hardcore truth right there.

2010
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,330
There is no mastership on the rectangle.

2011
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,070
I believe you.

2012
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,550
I'm just saying from my own experience.

2013
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:10,810
I'm not asking you to believe me.

2014
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,950
I'm making a claim and a statement that

2015
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,010
holds true to anybody that researches what I

2016
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:15,490
just said.

2017
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,970
I don't doubt that, man, because I believe

2018
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,270
that.

2019
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,850
So I'm not going to address that, believe

2020
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:23,370
it or not.

2021
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,230
Now, William Wright, just to address the William

2022
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:30,150
Wright part, he thinks that, which I would

2023
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,570
be in agreement with him, it is an

2024
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,330
expression of discharging excessive life force.

2025
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:38,030
We're not talking about the fluids now.

2026
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:43,030
We're not talking about the fluids.

2027
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:48,130
We're talking about the actual nervous and metabolic

2028
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:49,130
reactions.

2029
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,840
I figured that at that point the fluid

2030
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,500
would be just the residue of the leftovers

2031
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,960
of something smaller that would be electrical.

2032
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,340
I just thought that that was something that

2033
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,040
was just...

2034
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,860
The electrical still can't be defined because electrical

2035
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,700
is really dielectric and magnetic.

2036
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:20,660
What you call electromagnetism, dielectric has been completely

2037
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,340
negated.

2038
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,760
And rightfully so.

2039
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,920
Waste product of ether.

2040
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,040
That's right.

2041
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:30,980
It's a manifestation.

2042
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,640
I wouldn't say a waste product.

2043
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,620
It's just a manifestation.

2044
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,540
Is a bullet a waste product of a

2045
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,400
gun or a manifestation of what the gun

2046
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,340
was designed to do?

2047
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,160
Charles Steinmetz or something like that.

2048
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:45,920
How do you pronounce it?

2049
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,220
What was his name again?

2050
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,560
Steinmetz.

2051
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,560
Charles Steinmetz.

2052
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,380
Years ago, recently they say you eat no

2053
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,900
Einstein, meaning you're not smart.

2054
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,680
Einstein was an asshole.

2055
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,680
Einstein, by the way, means stupid in German.

2056
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,620
Stein is stone and ein means one.

2057
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,980
It means you only got one stone, one

2058
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:10,400
rock.

2059
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,260
It's like one brain cell.

2060
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,500
Someone's got two brain cells, they rub them

2061
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:14,840
together.

2062
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,320
You don't even have that.

2063
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,960
You got one brain cell in a mirror.

2064
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,840
So that's Einstein.

2065
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,740
But just years ago, they say you ain't

2066
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,620
no Steinmetz.

2067
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,260
They stopped that in the 50s because they

2068
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,600
had propagated everybody.

2069
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,060
Just like today, you know, there's still people,

2070
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:30,740
you know, stupid people talking about, oh, I

2071
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,740
was Osama bin Laden.

2072
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,640
Ain't no such thing as Osama bin Laden,

2073
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,040
you know.

2074
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:42,440
So I would say Steinmetz would be a

2075
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,800
way to grease yourself about it.

2076
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,080
I mean, like, you know, take the friction

2077
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,360
out of the thought by looking at what

2078
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,900
other people have established.

2079
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,540
That's the thing about why I do a

2080
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,820
lot of this speaking is because there's so

2081
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,600
much that can be accessed and so little

2082
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,020
is being accessed that you just got to

2083
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,320
throw your hands up in the air and

2084
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,440
say, OK, this is the wrong time, the

2085
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,000
wrong people, the wrong planet.

2086
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,320
You know what I mean?

2087
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,600
Well, you have to start going back and

2088
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,240
looking at old books, you know, old teachings.

2089
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,120
You want a really new idea, read an

2090
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:18,600
old book.

2091
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,340
The older the book, the newer the idea.

2092
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,760
OK, did we lose you, Joe?

2093
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,080
No, maybe we lost him.

2094
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,820
OK, well, that's OK.

2095
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,660
OK, I don't want to talk too much.

2096
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,840
I just want to be able to absorb

2097
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,220
what you're saying and not, you know what

2098
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,060
I mean, just kind of reflect.

2099
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,100
OK, well, you have to induce it.

2100
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:52,700
Well, we were good.

2101
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,320
Let's go back to the food discussion.

2102
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:54,840
Yes.

2103
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,080
Let me turn on this chat.

2104
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,180
Anybody?

2105
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,560
Let me see anybody going on.

2106
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,180
I don't see.

2107
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,060
We got some.

2108
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:02,560
Who's this?

2109
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,600
We got a new 42.

2110
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,520
Leon and my band from coming in at

2111
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,420
the Greek coming in.

2112
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:07,700
Where?

2113
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:08,900
Go ahead.

2114
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,060
Call in if nobody.

2115
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,660
That was me.

2116
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,080
Call it.

2117
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:15,800
Forty two.

2118
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:16,320
United.

2119
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:17,220
Yep.

2120
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:17,800
That's you.

2121
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,300
That was Joe.

2122
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,800
Oh, yeah.

2123
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,000
OK, that's not a problem.

2124
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,000
Go ahead.

2125
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,960
And the food thing is important.

2126
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,800
But, you know, when you when you look

2127
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,300
at the rules that are out there, you

2128
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,880
know, people are very poorly equipped with equipment

2129
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,480
and skill.

2130
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,840
Now, let me just give an example with

2131
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,260
equipment.

2132
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,580
You don't need any of those gadgets, gizmos

2133
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,100
and whatever.

2134
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,500
That's one thing I wanted to get into,

2135
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,360
Bruce, which I didn't.

2136
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:46,500
Yes.

2137
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,980
You need basically you need small, medium and

2138
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,300
large.

2139
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,580
It's like the rule of hammers.

2140
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,200
I got toolbox.

2141
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,140
Fix everything.

2142
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,640
Open it is three hammers, a small one,

2143
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,480
medium and large.

2144
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,240
Right.

2145
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:58,340
In other words, OK, so if you're going

2146
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,480
to buy anything, what do you need?

2147
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,320
You need in cooking.

2148
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,240
You need to cut, stir and cook.

2149
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:03,540
Right.

2150
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,080
Or cut, stir and strain.

2151
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,140
So if you're going to buy anything for

2152
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,280
the kitchen, I see people try to compensate

2153
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,340
for their lack of skill with gizmos.

2154
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,880
How many times you've been in like, you

2155
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,440
know, what's called like a high net worth

2156
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:15,760
person.

2157
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,460
You know, they got the million dollar, two

2158
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,020
million dollar house in the Golden Ghetto.

2159
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,400
You go into their kitchen.

2160
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,720
It's all canned food.

2161
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,380
But you open the doors.

2162
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,760
They got every gizmo, every shaker, cutter thing

2163
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,360
you can imagine.

2164
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,200
They can't, you know, do anything right.

2165
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,660
That stuff was not designed for it was

2166
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,400
to compensate for people's willingness to be in

2167
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:34,820
the kitchen.

2168
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,580
So, for example, what you're going to need.

2169
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,940
That's why I suggested one knife.

2170
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,300
You might want a small knife.

2171
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:41,640
Right.

2172
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,920
They're very helpful if you're working with certain

2173
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,720
types of fruit.

2174
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:45,640
Right.

2175
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,280
Or if you want to make a small

2176
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,880
cut, a short blade, a medium and a

2177
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,240
long one, you probably won't need too often.

2178
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,660
So, you know, a 20 centimeter, eight, nine

2179
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,360
inch was fine.

2180
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,720
OK, same with pots and pans.

2181
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,600
Let's say pans, a small skillet, six inch,

2182
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:02,960
right.

2183
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,460
14 centimeter or so for if you're going

2184
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,100
to make yourself like some sunny side up

2185
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:09,440
eggs.

2186
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:09,760
Right.

2187
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,920
You don't want a big ass pan where

2188
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,740
they're going to spread out.

2189
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,800
How about a little pan?

2190
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,500
So when they do spread out, they take

2191
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,440
the shape of the pan.

2192
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,160
You get the picture.

2193
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:17,940
Right.

2194
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,440
Exactly.

2195
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:19,460
Right.

2196
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,080
You're going to you're going to grill a

2197
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,760
piece of toast or make grilled cheese.

2198
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,020
Right.

2199
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,240
If you make grilled cheese, by the way,

2200
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,700
don't use butter, use mayonnaise on the outside

2201
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,540
and grill it with mayonnaise.

2202
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,520
And look how that's going to be umami.

2203
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,260
I thought like for a while I was

2204
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,580
the only person in the world doing it.

2205
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,280
Every time I do food talk privately, I

2206
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,040
say make grilled cheeses, you use mayonnaise and

2207
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,660
I never heard of that.

2208
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,920
So you use mayonnaise and they come back

2209
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,240
like, man, that was the most delicious.

2210
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,100
Right.

2211
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:45,760
OK.

2212
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,060
All right.

2213
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,840
And, you know, I was blessed with getting

2214
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,100
me a small cast iron one like that

2215
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,120
pan.

2216
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:53,700
There you go.

2217
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,000
I like the Lincoln.

2218
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,360
You bet.

2219
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:56,900
The Lincoln.

2220
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:57,540
Yeah.

2221
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,540
The heavy duty stainless steel with the aluminum

2222
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,260
bottom insert, you know, so it's real thick

2223
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:01,840
on the bottom.

2224
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,460
Cast iron is good, too.

2225
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,820
Just don't use soap.

2226
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:05,640
No.

2227
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,140
Cast iron.

2228
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,720
You really have to.

2229
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:08,540
Yeah.

2230
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,640
You just water.

2231
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,000
You could use some if you've got a

2232
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,540
food flavor, you know, sometimes the seasoning in

2233
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,900
cast iron will hold the flavor.

2234
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,320
Like if you sauteed garlic and you want

2235
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,540
to do a pancake, you might get some

2236
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:20,080
garlic flavor in your pancake later.

2237
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,040
Put some baking soda on the pan.

2238
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,760
That'll draw the flavors out mostly.

2239
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:26,940
All right.

2240
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,120
So you're going to it's basically it's obvious

2241
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,680
you're going to need a bigger skillet, but

2242
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,400
get the small skillet, get the medium skillet,

2243
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,060
you know, the same with a pot.

2244
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,060
You might want to reheat something in a

2245
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,500
one quart pot and then you're going to

2246
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,000
want to jump to a four or six

2247
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,320
quart.

2248
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,600
And that's it.

2249
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,860
Unless you've got a family and you're going

2250
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,020
to be producing volume, then the sky's the

2251
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:48,280
limit.

2252
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,280
Right.

2253
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:49,960
How big you know.

2254
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,580
So don't get too much stuff cutting boards.

2255
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,820
It's good to have a meat and a

2256
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,720
vegetable cutting board if you do meat.

2257
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,740
I wanted to get into in the future,

2258
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,340
perhaps it gets real sensitive to just talk

2259
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,880
about just vegetarian eating.

2260
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,680
I've got a lot of stuff, you know,

2261
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,160
where someone who's not used to it will

2262
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,520
not miss eating meat.

2263
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:13,240
You know, that that type of structure is

2264
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,360
not necessarily vegan.

2265
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,540
By the way, vegans are serious misanthropists, people

2266
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,680
haters, by the way.

2267
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,980
If you ever notice that, I'm not saying

2268
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,680
that that's the rule, but it could be

2269
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,420
the rule that there are exceptions that are

2270
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,220
not people haters.

2271
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,420
But essentially, when someone is vegan, they let

2272
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,160
you know they are.

2273
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:30,800
You know what I mean?

2274
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:31,560
Right.

2275
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,940
I think that's a Gustav LeBlanc kind of

2276
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,380
thing going.

2277
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,080
Yeah, it is.

2278
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,680
They don't even know why they're usually I've

2279
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,000
told you about vegan.

2280
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,320
Usually when it's white people that don't know

2281
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,740
how to cook, want to cook and don't

2282
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,680
want to learn how to cook.

2283
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,160
So when they cook and you say the

2284
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,780
food's terrible, they say is vegan.

2285
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,540
It's vegan.

2286
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,540
Where in reality, vegan is delicious.

2287
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:54,620
It's even more delicious than other any other

2288
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,300
style, if you comprehend it.

2289
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:57,460
Right.

2290
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,480
So that's all you need, basically.

2291
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,600
The other thing is, if you're going to

2292
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,440
have a lid, whether it's for a pot

2293
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,060
or a pan, make sure it's tight because

2294
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,600
there's something called pressure cooking.

2295
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,840
You understand as the pressure increases, the boiling

2296
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,740
point goes down.

2297
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,660
But if you have enough heat to drive

2298
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:16,300
the boiling point up, you can actually boil

2299
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,260
water at 270 degrees in a pressure cooker.

2300
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:19,560
Right.

2301
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,720
You see, or in other words, you would

2302
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,580
have the effect, sorry, at lower, you could

2303
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:27,600
have the effect of, I've got a pressure

2304
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,100
cooker up to 270, it gets dangerous.

2305
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,100
But what I'm saying is you could boil

2306
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,080
at lower than boiling point with a pressure

2307
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:34,380
cooker.

2308
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,000
So you save energy and also you cook

2309
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,460
faster.

2310
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,060
So anyway, you two guys talk amongst yourselves.

2311
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,380
I'll be back in about three minutes.

2312
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:43,680
Okay.

2313
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,750
You there, Bruce?

2314
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:47,330
I'll be right back.

2315
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,610
Yes.

2316
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,690
Yep.

2317
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,070
Go ahead.

2318
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,890
I'm just listening, man.

2319
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,930
I do enough talking in the chat, so

2320
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:57,250
I'm just trying to listen.

2321
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:57,850
That's fine.

2322
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:58,630
That's fine.

2323
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:00,270
All are welcome.

2324
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,790
That's why he kind of caught me by

2325
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:04,150
surprise in the chat.

2326
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,670
And I was like, well, I couldn't think

2327
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,310
of any reason why you would have trouble.

2328
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:11,110
Yes.

2329
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:17,370
If anything, we're all, we're all pretty lighthearted

2330
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:23,150
here and very seldom do we, there are

2331
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:27,670
the occasional touchy times, but oh, well, life

2332
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,170
goes on.

2333
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,570
That's when I just stay quiet.

2334
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,270
I don't really hold a grudge.

2335
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:33,450
That's not really who I am.

2336
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:36,250
I mean, I have a moment and I'm

2337
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,470
just like, yeah, I would.

2338
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:39,250
So, you know what I mean?

2339
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,190
It's nothing.

2340
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:46,990
I just, uh, there's bigger things, you know,

2341
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:48,610
certainly, certainly.

2342
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:52,350
And, uh, we got something in your, uh,

2343
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:58,610
chana masala or sauce for chickpeas.

2344
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,350
Hmm.

2345
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:01,550
Actually sounds good.

2346
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,960
All this talk about food is making me

2347
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,260
hungry.

2348
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,320
Okay.

2349
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,940
The vacuum and foods, well, there's, there's two

2350
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,320
aspects.

2351
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,920
When the food is alive, like when you

2352
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,720
have a veg up until the point that

2353
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,840
you eat it, it's alive.

2354
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:23,980
As a matter of fact, if you eat

2355
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:27,840
a raw salad, you're eating live food and

2356
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,640
that energy, that energy that maintains it alive

2357
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,620
is now in the body.

2358
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,320
You see, most carnivores are called predators.

2359
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,640
It's not the, this is what the scientists

2360
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,680
will never understand.

2361
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,180
And the zookeepers and all that.

2362
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,280
It's not that they need meat and protein

2363
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,580
is they need that immediate release of life

2364
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:45,980
force.

2365
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,960
You see what keeps a whole different spin.

2366
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:49,660
Yeah.

2367
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,760
What keeps a predator healthy.

2368
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,140
He's not feeding off the meat as much

2369
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,060
as he's feeding off of the release of

2370
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,080
the life force when the animal is killed.

2371
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,520
But the same thing with what you said

2372
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,300
with, uh, with vegetables and things and that,

2373
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,260
that takes it to a whole different level.

2374
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:06,500
Yeah.

2375
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,100
The other thing is when you, if you've

2376
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,060
been around predators, they don't eat the meat,

2377
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,700
the muscle, uh, for the eat the, the,

2378
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,900
the face, the brains and the internal organs

2379
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,480
first.

2380
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:17,840
Right.

2381
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,200
You can still watch a mutual of Omaha

2382
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,600
national geographic when the heinous and the lions

2383
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,160
eat an elephant or a gazelle, they, they

2384
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:26,920
got it first.

2385
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,340
It's all gutted.

2386
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,520
Of course, when there's a frenzy in a

2387
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,920
pack, they'll pull a limb off, but you

2388
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,640
notice they got the animal first and then

2389
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,880
they, because the muscles, uh, if pure muscle

2390
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,260
of them is toxic, cause that's where all

2391
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,280
the adrenaline goes.

2392
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:42,920
Uh, that would make sense.

2393
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:43,420
Yeah.

2394
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:44,100
Yeah.

2395
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,760
If you send adrenaline to the organs, whether

2396
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,220
it kills the Oregon, but it goes to

2397
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:50,020
the muscle to provide the, uh, fight or

2398
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,300
flight fighter Yeah.

2399
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:52,700
Yeah.

2400
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,880
So if you go to certain countries, uh,

2401
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,420
if you go to a very ethnic restaurant,

2402
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,880
let's say Chinese or so, and the menu

2403
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,860
is in that language and they have just

2404
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,000
a, a quick English translation.

2405
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,320
If it says beef, it'll say muscle, organ,

2406
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,380
liver, stomach.

2407
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,940
You see most Americans, when you say I'm

2408
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,020
going to have beef, they think they don't

2409
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,540
think about eating brains or tongue or stomach

2410
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,160
or intestine or tripe.

2411
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:17,620
Yeah.

2412
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,060
Yeah.

2413
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,160
Uh, um, they, they think, they think beef

2414
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,460
is just, they don't even know what they're

2415
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:24,720
eating.

2416
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,320
It's muscle.

2417
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,280
Right.

2418
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,900
When you get a steak, that's muscle you

2419
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:30,760
see.

2420
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,720
So, uh, here's an interesting eating, eating organ

2421
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,940
meat, you know, liver, brain, all that, whatever

2422
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,420
would be far more beneficial.

2423
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,840
Uh, then, um, that's why in the Hollywood

2424
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,560
they want the brains of the zombies, you

2425
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,160
know, right.

2426
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,540
Go ahead.

2427
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:46,420
What's the question, Joel?

2428
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,320
Go ahead.

2429
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:47,520
Shoot.

2430
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:54,780
Um, I, I, I noticed the geometry of

2431
01:26:54,780 --> 01:27:00,500
plants has, um, more symmetry than would be

2432
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:06,300
say, um, meat, but I noticed that the,

2433
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:16,580
um, carrying mechanism for blood veins, um, oxygen

2434
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:20,480
in, uh, what they call it, uh, trachea

2435
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,740
or something like that in the, in the

2436
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:25,860
lungs, there's, um, this geometry that looks like

2437
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,840
lightning bolts.

2438
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:27,820
Yeah.

2439
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,520
Lichtenberg geometry.

2440
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:35,200
The fluids.

2441
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:39,760
I noticed that that geometry, um, seems to

2442
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,940
be more, um, affluent in vegetation with regard

2443
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,040
to, I don't know, you look at flowers,

2444
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,800
you talk about flowers earlier, we talking about,

2445
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:54,680
um, say like, um, lightning bolts.

2446
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,300
It has more of a, yes, it, it,

2447
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,680
but it has more of a, um, a

2448
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,390
geometry that seems more symmetrical as opposed to

2449
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,480
meat that seems to be more asymmetrical.

2450
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:09,520
Wasn't it Dollar, wasn't it Dollar that came

2451
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,240
up with that about the golden mean with

2452
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,100
different, uh, uh, ancient Greeks did.

2453
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:14,460
Yeah.

2454
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,080
All the ancients of wisdom of any ancient

2455
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:22,280
society had known that, uh, plants, animals, and

2456
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,860
minerals are different manifestations of the same thing

2457
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:29,540
specifically, just like you can send, uh, you

2458
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,560
know, through a wire, you could send data,

2459
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,460
you could send voice and electricity, you know,

2460
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,760
have you seen the, the data connections where

2461
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,400
you just plug it into the wall and

2462
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,460
it, and it's a different frequency on top

2463
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,640
of the, uh, the AC power lines in

2464
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,340
the house, right?

2465
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,700
So basically, yeah, you have this incoming field

2466
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:51,520
and it, and field basically, it is, it

2467
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,640
is, uh, uh, a two-way street, like,

2468
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,020
just like you have a two, uh, uh,

2469
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,820
two lane car, you know, one, uh, on

2470
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,480
a highway, one car going one way, one

2471
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,860
car going the other, as long as they

2472
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,880
keep their lane, they're okay, but in, in

2473
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,060
fields, they work one overlapping the other, so

2474
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,320
one doesn't recognize the other as they pass

2475
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,920
right through each other, is basically how fields

2476
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,160
work and it's communication or transport from counter

2477
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,300
space back and forth.

2478
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,500
Let me give you an example.

2479
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,780
Um, there are physical things that reflect and

2480
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,540
change the nature of these fields, like there's

2481
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,940
a book called The Planetary Effects on Plants,

2482
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,260
right?

2483
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,160
And, uh, if you check that out, like

2484
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,680
the dandelion plant is attached to the Mars.

2485
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,300
Now, if you guys are familiar with, I

2486
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,520
think Mars is in retrograde, if anybody wants

2487
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,060
to go outside past 12 a.m. by

2488
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,880
the wind-up toy, wherever you are, just

2489
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,440
look up slightly to the south, um, in

2490
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,440
the sky coming from the east to the

2491
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,920
west, you're going to see a red, looks

2492
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,800
like a red-orange LED in the sky.

2493
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,860
That's how bright it is.

2494
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,160
That's Mars.

2495
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,820
It's the closest it's been in a long

2496
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:58,160
time.

2497
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,280
I think it's the closest it's ever really

2498
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,140
been for a long, long time.

2499
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,160
Yes, I believe you're right on that one.

2500
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,700
Yeah, I saw it the other night.

2501
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,500
Yeah, that's, and if you look at it

2502
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,660
through a telescope, it's like, it's like a

2503
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,720
three-quarter moon is what it looks like,

2504
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:12,900
right?

2505
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:13,680
Yep.

2506
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,680
So, uh, yeah, so, um, okay, I knew

2507
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,640
this was coming before they announced it because

2508
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,300
I noticed the dandelion plants are about shoulder

2509
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,920
high right now, if you don't trim the

2510
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,220
weeds, let's say, in certain parts.

2511
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,980
Well, since when do dandelions get that high

2512
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,240
or way above waist height?

2513
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,740
They usually don't get more about knee high.

2514
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,200
Right, yeah.

2515
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,120
You know what I'm talking about?

2516
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,260
Okay, so that means, you know, and we

2517
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,380
know that, but, well, we know we, it's

2518
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,260
been referenced that they're attached to, okay, you

2519
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:40,960
see the connection?

2520
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,260
Wasn't there something with, uh, metals too, wasn't

2521
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:44,500
it?

2522
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,660
Uh, certain metals?

2523
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,140
Crystallization of metals and salts, just the crystallization

2524
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,680
process on a micro level, or on a

2525
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,400
macro level, because crystallization, like plating, electroplating in

2526
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,680
the form of crystallization.

2527
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:57,460
Right.

2528
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,600
Uh, and all that, uh, because, you know,

2529
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,840
you use salt solutions, um, is retarded during

2530
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,580
the dark moon.

2531
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,720
It almost, it comes to a stop, by

2532
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,960
the way, during an eclipse, which is the

2533
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,240
worst.

2534
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:11,880
Oh, very interesting.

2535
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,100
Yeah.

2536
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,760
Oh, that makes sense.

2537
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,660
It's funny that you say eclipse because I

2538
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,880
was bored and I started watching, uh, the

2539
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,960
heroes, uh, show that, it was a show

2540
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,880
that came out of, I think, 2006.

2541
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,460
And I heard of it, yeah.

2542
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,800
There was this theme of a change in

2543
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,580
the DNA of people, certain people during an

2544
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:44,720
eclipse, and I just thought that was interesting.

2545
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:45,280
So?

2546
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,900
Because I.

2547
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,760
Yeah, but hold on, you know, you could

2548
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,500
take the DNA out of your body, you

2549
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,380
wouldn't even notice.

2550
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,960
That's overrated.

2551
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,540
Everything, everything, everything in the, everything is spiral

2552
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,460
form in the body.

2553
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:03,160
That's a adenorhinonucleic whatever acid.

2554
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:07,360
That's, that's a byproduct of phosphenes and phosphates

2555
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,940
in the cells and the mitochondria.

2556
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,000
It, yeah, that's a dummy load.

2557
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,160
DNA is a dummy load.

2558
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,640
The only people talking about are using DNA

2559
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,880
as a legal society.

2560
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,580
And not to mention the triple DNA.

2561
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,500
Let me try to rephrase.

2562
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,160
Yeah, that's the one that's more important.

2563
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,880
I'm using DNA just as a reference because

2564
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,400
that's what is commonly referred to as the

2565
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:35,200
storage unit for the, um, data for the

2566
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:39,760
algorithms that make up the geometric expressions of

2567
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,800
biological life, if that makes sense.

2568
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,280
And I'm using this just as a lack

2569
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:43,440
of.

2570
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:43,680
No, it doesn't.

2571
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,740
That, that's what they're telling everyone.

2572
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,380
They don't even know what they're doing with

2573
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:48,500
it.

2574
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,720
Everything is a spiral.

2575
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,620
You know, just like you mentioned the patterns

2576
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:54,360
of the vessels and the blood, they look

2577
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,640
like this, the lightning bolts.

2578
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,840
They really, they do on a, on a

2579
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,500
planar, on a planar view.

2580
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,120
But if you view them three dimensionally, they're

2581
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,300
twisting and spiraling.

2582
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,740
You see what I'm saying?

2583
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,940
So everything is, uh, that's why Newton's law

2584
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:13,040
first laws are bullshit because he says, if

2585
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,200
something moves in a straight line, it'll move

2586
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,260
forever unless another force affects it.

2587
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,080
I'm like, you know, asshole, when was the

2588
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,680
last time you saw anything in the universe

2589
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,780
move in a straight line?

2590
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:23,700
It's all bullshit.

2591
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,820
So nothing moves.

2592
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,800
I want to, I want to just jump

2593
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,100
back.

2594
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,400
I notice here, uh, odds and dive and

2595
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,580
chat would Greek impart a method for preparing

2596
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,860
a perfect cup of coffee.

2597
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:35,880
Okay.

2598
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,520
And then the other one was about sauce

2599
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,040
for chickpeas.

2600
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,360
All right.

2601
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,960
Which one should we do first?

2602
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,520
The coffee or the chickpeas?

2603
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:43,460
All right.

2604
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:43,700
Chick.

2605
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,300
We'll do the coffee first.

2606
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:45,660
Okay.

2607
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,240
Now coffee is technical because you know, you've

2608
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,180
heard of green coffee, which isn't roasted.

2609
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,360
And then you've got dark roast and you

2610
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,600
got everything in between.

2611
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,260
So the first way the coffee is ruined

2612
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:01,320
is by the roast or the first way

2613
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:03,860
coffee becomes really good is by the roast.

2614
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:05,380
Okay.

2615
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,120
Now here's the thing.

2616
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,600
Have you remember on previous Sonics I talked

2617
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,500
about when you cook use inconsistent heat, don't

2618
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,600
use this thermostat timer bullshit because it's not

2619
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,040
organic.

2620
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,020
You see for thousands of years, when you

2621
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,780
cooked, you see you let up your coals

2622
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,440
or your fire.

2623
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,940
And then naturally what happens?

2624
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,720
It comes down.

2625
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:24,680
Oh, we got to load it up.

2626
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,340
What happens to the contents in the pot?

2627
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,580
It cools down and then the heat goes.

2628
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,340
And then what happens?

2629
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,040
Does the heat come up gradually or does

2630
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,040
it really hit it hard?

2631
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:32,880
It hits it hard.

2632
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:34,120
Right?

2633
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,160
That's why like in restaurants, by the way,

2634
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,980
the best sauces and soups are the ones

2635
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,700
they make the day before they fridge it,

2636
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,480
then they reheat it the next day.

2637
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:42,540
Right?

2638
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,500
That's how you even notice how some leftovers

2639
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,360
taste really good, but better than they did

2640
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:47,620
originally.

2641
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,160
It's not because they're leftovers.

2642
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,660
Let's see what's really going on is because

2643
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,740
inconsistent heating.

2644
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,580
So why not give your food that leftover

2645
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:56,040
taste?

2646
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,240
I know it doesn't sound good, right?

2647
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:01,780
It'd be like a new Swanson's ad right

2648
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,660
away when you're cooking it first time around

2649
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,800
on the pot by doing inconsistent heat.

2650
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,200
So the best coffee roast, which you're not

2651
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,980
going to, they don't advertise or talk about

2652
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,820
it is inconsistent heat.

2653
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:14,300
And you're going to get that with, you

2654
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,120
know, when it's hand done, artisan roasts and

2655
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:17,900
stuff like that.

2656
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:18,100
Right?

2657
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,600
Most of the commercial roasted beans are done

2658
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,840
by machine automated.

2659
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,340
And do you think they have variable heat?

2660
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,220
Nope.

2661
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:26,540
Right?

2662
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,260
Because the scientist said, this is the best

2663
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,980
temperature to get the roast.

2664
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,920
So once you establish, you have a good

2665
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,720
source, the good source of coffee is the

2666
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,240
quality of the ingredients, right?

2667
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,580
So once you have a good coffee, if

2668
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,120
you're trying to pursue the perfect cup of

2669
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,960
coffee, you must grind the beans yourself.

2670
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,880
Do not buy pre-ground unless you're going

2671
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,560
to buy what's called Illy coffee.

2672
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,760
I-L-L-Y is real pricey.

2673
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,940
If anybody, are you familiar with Illy coffee?

2674
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:56,100
I-L-L-Y?

2675
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:56,820
No, no.

2676
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,800
I've never, never experienced that one.

2677
01:35:59,520 --> 01:35:59,800
Yeah.

2678
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,700
It's the opposite of vacuum seal.

2679
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,740
They do pressure seal because when you vacuum,

2680
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,440
you suck the, you suck the flavor out

2681
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,240
into the air, the container, right?

2682
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,940
When you pressure seal, you're pushing all the

2683
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,840
flavor in, but Illy is pretty pricey.

2684
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,100
You're looking at, you know, 30 bucks a

2685
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,960
pound or more.

2686
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,140
Okay.

2687
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,120
But unless it's of that quality, it's always

2688
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,000
in a metal container.

2689
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,760
You're not going to get a good coffee.

2690
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,400
We have a couple of good coffees here.

2691
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,460
One was just brought to me.

2692
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,580
I'm not going to be promoting them too

2693
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:31,840
much.

2694
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,640
Did we get this coffee for free?

2695
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:34,500
No.

2696
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,020
All right.

2697
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,640
Screw them.

2698
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,640
I ain't promoting them.

2699
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,000
But there's a couple of small, there's a

2700
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,320
small, a couple of, if you could discover

2701
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,060
a good roast.

2702
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,380
Okay.

2703
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,260
So that's how you start off with a

2704
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:46,040
good cup of coffee.

2705
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,640
The best way to ruin a cup of

2706
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,500
coffee is an electric coffee maker.

2707
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,640
You know, like a Mr. Coffee or whatever,

2708
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:53,740
Sunbeam or whatever.

2709
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,020
That's how you ruin.

2710
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:55,300
Why?

2711
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,460
Because the water goes through an aluminum coil.

2712
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,880
It's too hot.

2713
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,080
It takes too long.

2714
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:02,540
All right.

2715
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,220
There's two types of ways to do a

2716
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,080
really good coffee.

2717
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,280
One is you brew the coffee with just

2718
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,060
water and an inert, like a glass.

2719
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,320
There's a couple of gravity filters.

2720
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,480
I'm not suggesting anything esoteric.

2721
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,020
Microfiltration, not using paper.

2722
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:27,500
You know, if you brew a coffee, you

2723
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,040
got to brew it as fast as possible.

2724
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,160
Try to avoid bringing water more than 220

2725
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,900
degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius.

2726
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,980
And you want to brew it as fast

2727
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:38,640
as possible.

2728
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,980
What I do, I'll tell you what I

2729
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,500
do to make a perfect cup of coffee.

2730
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,340
Two ways.

2731
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,320
I could do a cowboy coffee where I

2732
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,960
put, I grind the beans myself.

2733
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,140
And when you grind and pulse it, don't

2734
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,620
do a consistent grind because the temperature goes

2735
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,420
up on the blades.

2736
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:52,680
Right.

2737
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,360
You ever notice when you blend or grind

2738
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,900
something for too long and the temperature of

2739
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,480
the contents, too much friction.

2740
01:37:58,660 --> 01:37:59,920
So you pulse it for a few seconds,

2741
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:00,520
you stop.

2742
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:01,800
Right.

2743
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,200
That's why like certain good blenders have a

2744
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:05,920
pulse function.

2745
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:06,340
Right.

2746
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,120
So what I do if I want a

2747
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,340
cowboy coffee, I put the grinds, turn up

2748
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:13,800
the heat.

2749
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,640
I also make tea this way, certain teas.

2750
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:19,580
And then I add the water, hot water

2751
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,040
to it.

2752
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:21,960
And then I put it into a cone

2753
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,420
filter.

2754
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:26,800
Now, I've been using the bleach cone filters.

2755
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,240
I used to use the brown, but the

2756
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,580
filters add too much flavor.

2757
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,180
And if you want to take the flavor

2758
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,160
out of a if you have to absolutely

2759
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,660
positively make a perfect cone filter coffee with

2760
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:42,520
a paper filter, open up the cone filter

2761
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,700
paper in the cone.

2762
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:44,260
Right.

2763
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,420
You have a carafe below it.

2764
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:45,640
Right.

2765
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,960
You spray it, put some hydrogen peroxide in

2766
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,840
a spray bottle and spray it, the paper,

2767
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:54,160
and then run it under some water because

2768
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,920
the hydrogen peroxide acts like an oxidizer and

2769
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,100
it will oxidize any flavor out of the

2770
01:38:59,100 --> 01:38:59,540
cone.

2771
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,320
So another way to get the flavor out

2772
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,240
of the cone paper is to put the

2773
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,460
paper in the cone itself and run some

2774
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,400
water into through it first, because that initial

2775
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,240
run of water will get rid of that

2776
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,020
paper flavor.

2777
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:14,760
You see what I'm saying?

2778
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:15,440
Interesting.

2779
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:16,100
Yes.

2780
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:17,280
Okay.

2781
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,120
Yeah.

2782
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,920
And if you have to use a coffee

2783
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,560
machine, go ahead and do the same.

2784
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:22,760
Put the paper.

2785
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,360
I shouldn't say if you have to use

2786
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,940
a coffee machine, no one should have to.

2787
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,380
When you load the paper, you see the

2788
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,760
people's load that they load the paper and

2789
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,260
then they put the dry coffee beans in

2790
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,520
the dry paper and they let the machine

2791
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,080
do the rest.

2792
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:34,880
Uh-uh.

2793
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,660
Put water in the coffee filter first without

2794
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:41,480
the coffee and that initial water that drains

2795
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,780
out takes the paper flavor with it.

2796
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,540
Then put your dry ground roast coffee grinds

2797
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:49,780
in there.

2798
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,200
You see what I'm saying?

2799
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:50,740
You follow me?

2800
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:51,600
Right.

2801
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,160
Right.

2802
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:52,620
Okay.

2803
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,280
Now you're on your way.

2804
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,420
Now that's for the cowboy coffee.

2805
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,060
The only difference between that and another way

2806
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,040
to make a perfect coffee is put your

2807
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,080
grounds in of the paper cone filter that's

2808
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,380
been pre-treated with water.

2809
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,820
If you really want to go crazy, do

2810
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:07,680
a little hydrogen peroxide and then rinse it.

2811
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,080
Uh, what I do is when the water

2812
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,120
on the kettle before the kettle whistle blows,

2813
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,140
which is I've measured with a thermometer is

2814
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,080
just below boiling.

2815
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,700
Um, cause the bottom of the kettle of

2816
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,960
water is real hot and the top of

2817
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,080
the water is not that hot.

2818
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:22,320
Right.

2819
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,180
You see what I'm saying?

2820
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:23,280
Okay.

2821
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,400
So what I do there is I add

2822
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,300
a little bit of lukewarm water while I'm

2823
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,020
waiting for the water to come up to

2824
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,580
temp into the coffee grinds to pre-temper

2825
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:34,520
them a little bit.

2826
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,940
So they don't have dry grounds being hit

2827
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:37,700
with hot water.

2828
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,020
You add a little bit of water.

2829
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,380
So you have the hot water hitting wet

2830
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,500
grind grinds.

2831
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,100
You see what I'm saying?

2832
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,440
So as I put the hot water in

2833
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,420
there, I have a small spoon and I

2834
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:50,380
stir the grinds with the water because what

2835
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,220
you'll look up and find out about coffee,

2836
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,540
I think 20 or 30% of coffee

2837
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,160
is water soluble once it's been roasted.

2838
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,180
You see what I'm saying?

2839
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:01,280
Okay.

2840
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,000
The stirring gap, the stirring would make sense.

2841
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,820
So the stirring, the stirring, when it gets

2842
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:08,080
the most out of the flavor, the motion,

2843
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:11,980
also it allows for a faster pour through

2844
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:14,460
the cone because you don't have the grains

2845
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:17,660
of coffee sticking on the sides, clogging the

2846
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:17,980
filter.

2847
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:20,780
And also you're dissolving the coffee faster.

2848
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,380
Now you have to do this with some

2849
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,380
finesse because if you grab the paper while

2850
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,760
you're stirring or make a hole in it,

2851
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,120
you're going to have grinds coming through.

2852
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,380
And that's how I make coffee.

2853
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,160
I don't like a French press because it

2854
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,800
doesn't press out the very fine stuff.

2855
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,460
And also what happens, what do you have

2856
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,360
sitting on the bottom?

2857
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,100
The grinds the whole time, right?

2858
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:45,980
Right.

2859
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,680
You want them out of there because there's

2860
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,980
each different, just like anything, each different stage

2861
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:55,900
of the brewing process releases different things from

2862
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,500
the coffee.

2863
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:00,930
Also, the hotter the temperature of the water,

2864
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,030
the shorter the brew.

2865
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:04,850
Just that's why espresso, that's really hot, high

2866
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:05,570
pressure steam.

2867
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,010
And that's not designed to have any dwell

2868
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,850
time in the coffee.

2869
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:10,930
It's designed to go right through, isn't it?

2870
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,170
Very quickly.

2871
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,490
Yeah.

2872
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:16,230
Now where something like a cowboy coffee, which

2873
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:17,530
is the grinds in the water in a

2874
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:21,050
pot or percolator, or let's leave the coffee

2875
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:24,010
machines out, or a French press that has

2876
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,590
a very high dwell time with the beans,

2877
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:28,270
you see, different flavor.

2878
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:31,190
So the least amount of dwell time would

2879
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:31,930
be an espresso.

2880
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:33,390
I don't suggest that.

2881
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,430
And if anyone's had an espresso, you'll understand

2882
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:38,250
that's an acquired taste for most.

2883
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:42,290
But just the cup of coffee, paper filter

2884
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:45,210
that's been pre-rinsed by just running water

2885
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:47,030
through it, especially the warmer the water, the

2886
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:49,190
better the paper flavor.

2887
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:50,870
I hope you guys understand what I mean.

2888
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:51,930
Maybe they don't, maybe they do.

2889
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:54,590
That there's an initial paper flavor, you know?

2890
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:55,390
Yep.

2891
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,090
And don't be squeamish.

2892
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:01,810
If you want to know what paper filters

2893
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:03,430
are going to do to your coffee flavor,

2894
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:05,050
put a coffee bean in your mouth, spit

2895
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,710
it out, and then take a little piece

2896
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:09,210
of the cone filter, tear a piece off,

2897
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:09,970
put it in your mouth.

2898
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:12,070
Don't say yuck and spit it out because

2899
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,670
guess what?

2900
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,170
You're going to get that flavor in your

2901
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:17,550
coffee anyway, you see?

2902
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,690
So if you put a piece of paper

2903
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:23,010
filter or filter mechanism on your tongue before

2904
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,710
you brew, that will let you know what

2905
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:27,010
is going to be imparted to your coffee.

2906
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:29,980
Makes sense.

2907
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,280
And I just gave basically the account on

2908
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,820
how I do it because I played around

2909
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:37,660
with different gadgets and different things.

2910
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:41,020
And I found that just doing it this

2911
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:43,940
way with a direct filter where it allows

2912
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:46,340
direct cone filter, allows you to make coffee

2913
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:50,920
at any time, anywhere with very little, very

2914
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,700
few devices.

2915
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,440
As long as you get hot water.

2916
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,720
Of course there's other ways, but as long

2917
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,000
as you get hot water and a filtering

2918
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,660
mechanism, you've got coffee.

2919
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,040
Then there's the cold brew where they leave

2920
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,020
the coffee overnight or two days in the

2921
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,100
fridge or out and then fridge it, then

2922
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:07,520
whatever.

2923
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:08,720
That's fine.

2924
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,980
I've never really tried that, experimenting with that.

2925
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:16,120
I tried it once, I wasn't really impressed.

2926
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:17,840
No, no.

2927
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:21,080
It's just something about cold coffee.

2928
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,700
It doesn't register right.

2929
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,340
Well, also you have an extremely long dwell

2930
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:28,240
time in the coffee bean with the water,

2931
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,700
even though it's at low temperature, dwell time

2932
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,440
is not negated.

2933
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,410
So, now the chickpeas.

2934
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:39,710
Yeah, they are delicious.

2935
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,010
They have umami.

2936
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:43,910
What I do, make hummus, also when you

2937
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,410
make the hummus with the tahini and the

2938
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:49,070
lemon juice, use a little cumin or powder

2939
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,850
in with it, right?

2940
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:54,710
The other thing I do, also if you're

2941
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:55,990
going to pre-soak or even if you

2942
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:58,270
get canned, which pre-soaked dry beans always

2943
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:02,930
taste better, chickpeas have a pretty thick peel

2944
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:03,290
on them.

2945
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:06,270
It's a translucent, almost transparent peel.

2946
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:08,370
Get rid of that, right?

2947
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,370
Because that adds a grainy, it has no

2948
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:12,170
nutrition other than fiber.

2949
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:18,410
It adds some character to the chickpea that

2950
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:19,950
I don't find pleasant, let's say.

2951
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:22,410
Whether it's nutritious or not, it's there.

2952
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,210
You could have it, let's just say, but

2953
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:25,830
I would suggest getting rid of it.

2954
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:28,350
The way you do that is just move

2955
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:32,250
things around in a bowl and just skim

2956
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,810
it off the top, where the peels usually

2957
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:34,650
come to the top.

2958
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:37,730
So, if you're going to do a dry

2959
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:40,670
soak on a chickpea, make sure you run

2960
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:42,850
your hands, keep agitating until the peels start

2961
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:44,030
coming off, and you'll see there's quite a

2962
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:44,570
bit, right?

2963
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:47,150
All right, so once I've peeled the chickpeas,

2964
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:50,070
what I do is I cook them twice.

2965
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:51,770
They soak up a lot of water.

2966
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:54,890
Twice meaning like I'll pre-cook them and

2967
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:57,570
then hours later or let the temperature come

2968
01:45:57,570 --> 01:45:58,990
down and then I use them as a

2969
01:45:58,990 --> 01:45:59,590
raw ingredient.

2970
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,210
What I do is I add potato and

2971
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:05,750
carrot and some onion, some garlic, maybe some

2972
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:06,470
celery.

2973
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,130
Learn how to use celery if you want

2974
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:10,650
that umami deliciousness to your food and then

2975
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:11,210
take it out.

2976
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:16,150
And I use a curry that I either

2977
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:17,810
make or pre-buy, which is, you know,

2978
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:21,730
turmeric, cumin, a little bit of cinnamon.

2979
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:25,990
You know, many of the pre-made curry

2980
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:27,250
mixtures are pretty good.

2981
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:28,310
They're mostly turmeric.

2982
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:30,470
There are red and brown curries as well.

2983
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:36,350
So, I make a curry chickpea, potato, carrot,

2984
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,930
onion dish.

2985
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:40,190
I put that over long grain rice like

2986
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:40,790
a basmati.

2987
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:42,690
And I want to go back to the

2988
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:43,030
celery.

2989
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,130
If you're going to use, if you want

2990
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:46,370
to add a lot of flavor to your

2991
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:48,030
food, no matter what it is, if it's

2992
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:52,570
savory, stock up on celery and just take

2993
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:53,310
a celery stick.

2994
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:54,430
Don't cut it with a knife.

2995
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,350
Just break it in half by hand.

2996
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,090
Make sure it's clean and put it in

2997
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:00,050
the pot because you're going to remove that.

2998
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:01,750
You're not going to be serving that.

2999
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,150
That's just there to add flavor.

3000
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:07,550
Okay, so no matter what you're doing in

3001
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:09,350
the kitchen, if you want to make even

3002
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:12,910
pasta, if you don't have a water bath

3003
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,990
for the pasta, throw in a couple of

3004
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:16,750
stalks of celery and remove them.

3005
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:18,870
You're going to see how delicious everything gets.

3006
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:22,890
Celery has a very good function, just like

3007
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:24,890
onions do, to add umami or a lot

3008
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:26,250
of depth of flavor.

3009
01:47:27,070 --> 01:47:28,890
You know, very often when we have a

3010
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:30,830
very good crop of green or spring onions,

3011
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,810
I would just leave, put the onions whole

3012
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:34,430
in a dish and not serve them.

3013
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:35,150
I remove them.

3014
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,150
And the dish is so delicious and whoever

3015
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:40,950
has it doesn't know why because they don't

3016
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:43,730
see the presence of the celery stalk or

3017
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:44,170
the onion.

3018
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:45,170
It's removed, you see.

3019
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:48,750
So it's like an infusion.

3020
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:53,070
So there's another thing with the chickpeas.

3021
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:54,730
Another thing you can do is don't be

3022
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:57,190
afraid to mash the chickpeas and make a

3023
01:47:57,190 --> 01:48:01,410
paste by themselves, plain, without making a hummus.

3024
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:04,210
And then you can use a dressing over

3025
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:07,890
the chickpeas as if you would, you know,

3026
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:09,330
make a dressing for anything.

3027
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:12,250
You know, like a quote-unquote salad dressing,

3028
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:15,950
a creamy dairy recipe, you know, what they

3029
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:18,330
call blue cheese or, you know, ranch for

3030
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:19,250
white people, whatever.

3031
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:22,150
You can make a yogurt with cucumber and

3032
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:23,570
garlic dressing for it.

3033
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:26,210
Or you can make, you can just do

3034
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:27,750
a simple vinaigrette.

3035
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:31,970
Just make a chickpea paste, just salt it

3036
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:33,930
a little bit and you can get creative

3037
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:34,550
with that.

3038
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:37,710
But when you make a chickpea paste by

3039
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:39,850
mashing it or ricing it, if you know

3040
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:41,870
what a ricer is, it's basically a press

3041
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:44,350
that has a durable screen with small holes,

3042
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:44,810
right?

3043
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,430
That's the best way to make mashed potatoes

3044
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:47,970
and other things.

3045
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,230
Potato ricer.

3046
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:54,490
You make yourself a chickpea paste and it

3047
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:58,150
makes a good filling for various things, right?

3048
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,550
If you know what I mean, a filling

3049
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:02,430
for whatever.

3050
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:05,410
You can stuff vegetables with it and cook

3051
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,630
them again or you can have it cold,

3052
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,630
you can have it warm.

3053
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:18,920
You could use it as, for example, if

3054
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,700
you go to, I'm not saying in this

3055
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:24,520
directly, but in many Asian countries when they

3056
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,780
talk about sweets, it's usually a red bean

3057
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,120
filling that's very sweet.

3058
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,600
So you could use the chickpea as, you

3059
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,420
know, a filling.

3060
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,240
Well, what other ways you can do chickpeas?

3061
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:37,580
I guess you can consider it a meat

3062
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,120
substitute.

3063
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,680
There's something called falafel where you do a

3064
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,860
coarse chop or a coarse mash and you

3065
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,740
mix it with various, especially high amounts of

3066
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:50,900
cumin and parsley and deep fry it or

3067
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,680
bake it.

3068
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,100
They look like basically meatballs.

3069
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,700
I once, when I was not eating meat

3070
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:00,860
at all, I had a barbecue and it

3071
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:03,240
was all vegetarian stuff.

3072
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:06,880
Skewers, things that look like patties and meatballs,

3073
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:07,200
whatever.

3074
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,660
And I had some ghetto types come over

3075
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,440
and I knew that they would balk at

3076
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,040
it because it's kind of like a culture

3077
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:14,440
there.

3078
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,500
And they asked me what kind of meat

3079
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,860
that was and I said it was the

3080
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,780
boneless kind because if I told them it

3081
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,320
was vegetarian they would spit it out, right?

3082
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:26,260
So they all said, oh yeah.

3083
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,140
I said, what kind of meat?

3084
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,200
What kind of meat did he say it

3085
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:28,400
was?

3086
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,880
I said, he said it was boneless.

3087
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:30,900
Oh yeah, it's good.

3088
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:32,220
I was like, okay.

3089
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:34,900
You know what I mean?

3090
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,320
I was like, all right.

3091
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,480
No, that's fine.

3092
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,000
Yeah, because, you know, it's, there's a, you

3093
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,340
know, you have to understand the culture.

3094
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,420
I think that Jacque Fresco talks about that,

3095
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:51,480
you know, there's a cultural, you know, you

3096
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,800
go down to the ghetto, if you don't

3097
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,600
have deep-fried chicken wings with hot sauce

3098
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,900
and ketchup, you ain't right.

3099
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,500
So, and I know that's not the whole

3100
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:02,060
ghetto, but yeah, if you tell them I

3101
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,180
got vegetarian, you know, whatever, like, no, I

3102
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:04,840
can't be good.

3103
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:06,180
I don't want to taste it.

3104
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,340
So, you know, I went vegetarian for some

3105
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:17,420
time and I did get the looks, the

3106
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,360
talks, et cetera.

3107
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,520
Right, something wrong with you.

3108
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,140
I still eat pork or beef.

3109
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:26,340
I try to keep, even if I do

3110
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,960
eat meat, it's turkey, regardless of what the,

3111
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,740
anybody else says, it's very little.

3112
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,060
But yeah, I feel that folks that eat

3113
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:38,840
a lot of meat tend to be more

3114
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,540
animalistic in regards to their approach to things.

3115
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,380
It's the culture, not the folks.

3116
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,120
Like, for example, Count Dracula, they don't show

3117
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,200
him as being animalistic.

3118
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:56,900
He seems very well, very well refined culturally,

3119
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,320
socially, you know what I mean?

3120
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,760
But he's a blood drinker, you know what

3121
01:51:59,760 --> 01:51:59,960
I mean?

3122
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,860
I'm just saying from a sci-fi, you

3123
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:04,240
know, metaphor here.

3124
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:08,820
I think it's the culture, the traditions that

3125
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,800
they have, right?

3126
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,980
And for example, you have traditions in neighborhoods,

3127
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:15,540
even, not even the, it's not even proper

3128
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:18,280
to say culture because that has racial air

3129
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:18,720
to it.

3130
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,040
I'm talking about even a neighborhood can have

3131
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:21,460
a culture.

3132
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,400
I mean, I'm from back east and someone's,

3133
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:25,140
I'm Brooklyn or I'm Bronx.

3134
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,540
I'm like, and that's not even good enough.

3135
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,620
You got to say Bushwick, we're part of

3136
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,020
Brooklyn.

3137
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,180
Now we do things this way here.

3138
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,280
And if you don't do it this way,

3139
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,900
you ain't no good, you know?

3140
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,680
So I'm like, Whoa, you know, so when

3141
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,600
I say culture and tradition, it can be

3142
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,420
very local.

3143
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:47,810
I got a question.

3144
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:49,830
Anyway, what do you think about honey?

3145
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:53,650
I know I've been told that honey has

3146
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:56,070
some really good health benefits.

3147
01:52:57,110 --> 01:53:01,030
I mean, I've, well, it depends on the

3148
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:01,330
individual.

3149
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:03,590
See, the thing is, that's another mistake.

3150
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:07,150
There's no such thing as health benefits because

3151
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:09,770
what's good for one person might harm another

3152
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:10,130
person.

3153
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:11,810
Like, you know, the concept of yin and

3154
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:12,450
yang, right?

3155
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:13,530
Okay.

3156
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:16,650
There is no, there's no such thing as

3157
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:18,210
yin and yang as two separate things.

3158
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:19,930
It's the aspects of a thing.

3159
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,490
Is it more yin or is that thing

3160
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:25,330
more yang, you know, or is it imbalance?

3161
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:27,210
That goes with people too.

3162
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:28,730
Yeah.

3163
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:30,630
So you can have someone that has too

3164
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:32,390
much yin, they should not have honey.

3165
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:36,450
Someone who's too yang should have some honey.

3166
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:38,410
You see what I'm saying?

3167
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:44,870
There's a first aid aspect to it in

3168
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:48,010
ancient cultures where they used to call certain

3169
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:50,330
armies immortal because they left them on the

3170
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,210
battlefield dead.

3171
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:53,430
And then a year later, they came back

3172
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:54,450
still fighting, right?

3173
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,690
Well, because they had certain first aid techniques,

3174
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:58,950
they'd stuff a wound like a guy got

3175
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,530
stabbed or had half his gut cut out.

3176
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:04,630
They'd stuff him with silk dipped in honey

3177
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,450
until the body started to heal.

3178
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:09,450
And they would push, they would push that

3179
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:11,150
thing out, right?

3180
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:11,750
Because why?

3181
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,710
Because you got a big hole in your

3182
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:14,970
side, you don't got to live too long,

3183
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,030
but if you stuff it and wrap it

3184
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:19,890
tight, it's like a tire that's leaking or

3185
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:21,010
a garden hose is leaking.

3186
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,590
You wrap it with electrical tape, right?

3187
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:25,370
The body will start to close and start

3188
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:26,550
pushing it out, you see?

3189
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:29,030
So, but I'm not, I'm not going to

3190
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:30,910
get into too much of that right now.

3191
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:33,250
We're talking about food, but that was used.

3192
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:34,110
Honey was used.

3193
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:35,490
You know, honey is perfect.

3194
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:37,030
You know, if you drop something inside of

3195
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:40,030
a big jar of honey, that's basically keeping

3196
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:40,970
it encapsulated.

3197
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:42,410
You know, nothing goes in and out of

3198
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:42,610
that.

3199
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:45,710
So, but yeah, there's no such thing as

3200
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:48,130
a health benefit or a health detriment or

3201
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:51,110
whatever, unless it's a known toxin, like, like,

3202
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:54,350
you know, what kills, what I think is

3203
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:58,010
cyanide kills you is not because cyanide is

3204
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:00,110
deadly, but it's deadly to you because once

3205
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:02,690
it gets into the cell, it stops the

3206
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:05,170
phosphate production in the cell, in the mitochondria

3207
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:05,710
immediately.

3208
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:08,350
And once that stops, then all the cells

3209
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:09,630
start dying very quickly.

3210
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:13,810
You see, that's what a poison is.

3211
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:15,310
It's not really a poison.

3212
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:18,870
It just stops a certain critical body function.

3213
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:21,110
It's like cutting the wire.

3214
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,130
You ever see when you just want to,

3215
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,790
before they break into somebody's house, they just

3216
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:25,770
cut the power lines.

3217
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:26,230
They don't care.

3218
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:28,210
They don't go, there's a, which breaker, which

3219
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:30,470
breaker do we drop to turn off the

3220
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:31,710
lights so they don't see us coming?

3221
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:33,090
No, I just cut the whole power line.

3222
01:55:33,150 --> 01:55:33,250
Right.

3223
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:33,570
You see?

3224
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:37,790
So, uh, what, what, what was indiscreet?

3225
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:39,590
So the same thing, is there anything that's,

3226
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:41,210
that's going to be, that you're going to

3227
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:42,590
take that's going to bring you to health?

3228
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,590
No, that's why I, all that stuff you

3229
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:47,030
hear through the years, oh, the cannabis.

3230
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,590
Oh yeah.

3231
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,530
This oil does every, no, that's bullshit.

3232
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:53,950
No, it doesn't for certain people in certain

3233
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:55,090
times and certain things.

3234
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:55,390
Yes.

3235
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,490
Done a certain way.

3236
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,790
Vitamin C.

3237
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:59,290
Remember a few years ago was the vitamin

3238
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,530
C dummy load, right?

3239
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:01,370
Yeah.

3240
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:03,170
And before that it was something else.

3241
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,010
Colloidal silver.

3242
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:05,710
No, there's none of that.

3243
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:08,630
And it's all of it for what you

3244
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:08,910
see.

3245
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,660
So, I mean, I guess you could say

3246
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:17,580
that every person is vibrating at a particular

3247
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:21,480
rate and that is individualistic and it doesn't,

3248
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,540
it's not the standard for everything.

3249
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:26,160
So just because something is good for one

3250
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,140
person, that doesn't mean it's going to be

3251
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:30,820
quote, unquote good for the next person just

3252
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:31,340
because.

3253
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,120
Well, there are things that are generally good

3254
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:36,260
for everyone, but it's not good for that

3255
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,980
person's condition at the time.

3256
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:42,810
Like, like I just cut the finger, the

3257
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:44,070
pinky finger pretty deep.

3258
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:47,370
And, uh, what's good for my condition right

3259
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:49,390
now is some paper towel with some tight

3260
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,230
electrical tape.

3261
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:50,850
Feeling me?

3262
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,890
Now, if I tell you, put some tight

3263
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:56,050
electrical tape on paper towel on your finger,

3264
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:56,970
you say, what for?

3265
01:56:59,110 --> 01:57:00,370
You don't need it.

3266
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:02,970
Well, I, you know what I did?

3267
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:07,670
Um, find interesting that the material, the electrical

3268
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:11,690
tape is, um, I saw that vinyl was

3269
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:14,430
one of the, um, I don't want to

3270
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:16,230
say ingredients, but one of the things that

3271
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:19,070
it was, yeah.

3272
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:25,590
But I thought interesting because, um, that type

3273
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:29,590
of material holds data really well.

3274
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:32,630
But I'm talking about the vacuum.

3275
01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:34,930
Let's keep it, let's keep it practical.

3276
01:57:35,770 --> 01:57:38,050
Uh, uh, it doesn't have to be electrical

3277
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:38,330
tape.

3278
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:39,670
The reason I keep it around is because

3279
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:40,850
you got it in the car and the

3280
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:41,730
hose starts leaking.

3281
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:42,590
You wrap it real tight.

3282
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:43,570
I'll get you where you're going.

3283
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:46,990
Uh, you know, uh, you know, it's flexible,

3284
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:49,310
it's cheap, easily available.

3285
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:52,510
Vinyl is a fatality plastic, which is an

3286
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:53,550
estrogen mimicker.

3287
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:56,410
Um, you know, it's using PVC pipes.

3288
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:57,950
If you want to destroy any kind of

3289
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:59,370
fluid, you run it through vinyl.

3290
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:01,350
I don't care what it is.

3291
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:02,770
So any kind of fluid you run through

3292
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:05,130
vinyl pipes or whatever, you ruin the quality

3293
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:05,470
of it.

3294
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:08,010
There's a known, known, very well documented.

3295
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:11,570
Um, you know, if I didn't have that,

3296
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:13,410
I do cowboy style.

3297
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:15,450
When somebody was hurt, you saw they use

3298
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:16,970
their teeth to cut off a piece of

3299
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:18,350
their shirt and wrap it real tight.

3300
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:19,870
Remember that person, the old movies, right?

3301
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:24,250
So, yeah, I'm not going to suggest, you

3302
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:26,370
know, the thing is, you know, people spend

3303
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:28,010
at least 20 or 30 bucks a month

3304
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,010
on paper towels and paper goods, right?

3305
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,990
Um, last thing, you know, how much, how

3306
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:36,010
much do they spend every month on cotton

3307
01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:36,570
and shirts?

3308
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:39,310
And so not, not that much, but if

3309
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:41,170
you told them to go and tear up

3310
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:44,010
a cotton shirt or whatever, let's just say

3311
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:45,350
for this as a, no, I'm not going

3312
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:45,830
to do that.

3313
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:47,150
Right.

3314
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,870
So the vinyl tape is real cheap, 50

3315
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,110
cents a roll or less.

3316
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:53,890
And, uh, you can see, and it's not

3317
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:55,730
only for, it's meant multi-purpose.

3318
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:56,350
Yeah.

3319
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:59,710
So the compromise of if it's flexibility and

3320
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:02,490
ease of application for many, many things, as

3321
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:04,490
well as wrapping electrical wires, by the way,

3322
01:59:05,150 --> 01:59:06,930
um, that's like the last thing you do.

3323
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:08,930
I mean, how many times you need to

3324
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:11,230
wrap electrical wires, but you, you should have

3325
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,150
electrical tape around for that purpose.

3326
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:13,890
Yep.

3327
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:16,530
Now the band-aid concept is good, but

3328
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:17,890
that's really wimpy.

3329
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:19,550
You look at a band-aid, like you

3330
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:21,450
can't make that tight and it's too local.

3331
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:24,490
And also who's to say that the wound

3332
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,990
that you need to dress is the shape

3333
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:27,050
of the tape anyway.

3334
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:30,630
But if you slap a paper towel on

3335
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:32,830
it, that's a full-on bond breaker.

3336
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:35,170
When you pull it off, you have no

3337
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:36,930
stickiness on the skin to open the wound

3338
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:37,230
again.

3339
01:59:37,410 --> 01:59:39,930
You see a band-aid as you're pulling

3340
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:41,810
the band-aid off or the, the, those

3341
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:44,470
pre-made bandages, they, they pull on the

3342
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:46,490
skin and you could actually pull the wound

3343
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:46,870
open.

3344
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:50,330
You see, so you want to put a

3345
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:53,370
bond breaker and wrap it tight with a

3346
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:53,770
band-aid.

3347
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:54,030
Yeah.

3348
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:55,250
So, but if you have a full-on

3349
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:57,230
wrap with a bond breaker, like a rag

3350
01:59:57,230 --> 02:00:00,150
or paper, and then the electrical tape, when

3351
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:03,130
you remove it, you, you're not disturbing the,

3352
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,030
uh, the break in the skin.

3353
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:05,350
Yeah.

3354
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:07,170
Okay.

3355
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:08,630
Very, very good point.

3356
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:13,550
And it works, it works for all kinds

3357
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:14,170
of injuries.

3358
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:16,530
So, uh, what else have we got?

3359
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,470
Other, I see, see red, red pepper spread.

3360
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:20,310
Also, you dropped in a chat.

3361
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:20,650
Okay.

3362
02:00:21,290 --> 02:00:22,830
Oh, back to the chickpea here.

3363
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:25,350
Um, what, when you make hummus, by the

3364
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:28,210
way, uh, you can make it by hand.

3365
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:29,410
It's a lot of work, or you could

3366
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:30,510
use a food processor.

3367
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:32,390
Blenders are too high speed, but if you

3368
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:34,170
know, know what you're doing, you could use

3369
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:36,770
a blender, but doing it by hand is

3370
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:37,090
good.

3371
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:39,470
But if you, you could put roasted vegetable,

3372
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,110
you know, hummus.

3373
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,030
Have you ever had hummus?

3374
02:00:41,370 --> 02:00:42,570
Either one of you?

3375
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:43,590
I have, yes.

3376
02:00:44,030 --> 02:00:44,230
Question.

3377
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,870
Okay.

3378
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,390
If you have roasted red peppers and you

3379
02:00:47,390 --> 02:00:48,870
mash it in there towards the end, you're

3380
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:51,910
going to get this red toned hummus, right?

3381
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:53,670
So it tastes a little bit like red,

3382
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,590
but it's a beautiful color.

3383
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,950
You know, if you put a dark olives

3384
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,210
now, all of those are really hard to

3385
02:00:58,210 --> 02:00:58,430
get.

3386
02:00:58,490 --> 02:00:59,850
Not the ones in the can or know

3387
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:01,450
that are black, you know, the pitted, those

3388
02:01:01,450 --> 02:01:02,050
are not real.

3389
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:04,570
Um, I mean, they are, but they're junk.

3390
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:06,130
I mean, like all of us still have

3391
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:06,870
the pits in them.

3392
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:08,830
If you take the pits out and you

3393
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:10,670
mash up olives, you're going to get this

3394
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:12,490
dark puree purple.

3395
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:15,050
If you put part, a lot of parsley

3396
02:01:15,050 --> 02:01:18,370
or something green, like sage or parsley in

3397
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:19,710
what you're going to get a green hummus.

3398
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:21,990
So now you could have, you could create

3399
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:24,150
like the flags, the colors of a flag

3400
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:26,510
of a country on a hummus plate is

3401
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:27,790
basically what I'm saying.

3402
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:33,690
So also changes the flavor, but also remember,

3403
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:37,050
that health comes from variety.

3404
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:40,830
Like there's nothing wrong with a diet of

3405
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:42,510
bread and water.

3406
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:45,110
If it's really good bread and really good

3407
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:48,770
water, what makes it seem like a punishment

3408
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:50,550
is that you have it every day.

3409
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,870
You see what I'm saying?

3410
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:57,870
So, so part of health comes with variety

3411
02:01:57,870 --> 02:01:59,910
and where, where are you going to get

3412
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:00,630
that with food?

3413
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:05,920
Absolutely positively with seasonal change, right?

3414
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:07,600
That's the other thing about white people.

3415
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:10,620
They try to eat everything all year round

3416
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:12,940
the same, irrespectively.

3417
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:15,300
That's why they're so screwed up physically and

3418
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:15,740
all that.

3419
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,360
So you ever notice how their governments don't,

3420
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,760
don't tell them how they should eat better.

3421
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:22,100
They, they tell them they should have healthcare.

3422
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,560
You got to go to a doc to

3423
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,260
get the information.

3424
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:29,880
Yeah, it's crazy.

3425
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:31,520
It's just like, I was telling something about

3426
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,280
the military was say he knew somebody who

3427
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,360
tried to convince him to get out of

3428
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:35,820
the military.

3429
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,600
I say, if, if it takes that much

3430
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,720
convincing, let him go.

3431
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:40,580
That's like natural selection, you know?

3432
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:45,600
Tell them that the military, their own leaders

3433
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:47,640
hate their own soldiers.

3434
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,760
That's why they're in the business.

3435
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,500
That's why they want you not to kill

3436
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:52,720
the enemy to kill you.

3437
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:56,200
They're, they're basically again, misanthropists, all the generals,

3438
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,600
they won't say this if you, but if

3439
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,660
you get to know people in the military,

3440
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,340
that's how the leaders, that's how they are.

3441
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:02,380
They hate their own people.

3442
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:04,960
Now here's the thing, and this is the

3443
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:05,340
proof.

3444
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,220
They, they know their own people and they

3445
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:10,060
hate their own people.

3446
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:12,340
That's why they have a military, because if

3447
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:15,840
they knew the enemy, they wouldn't be fighting.

3448
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,660
Sun Tzu.

3449
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,360
In other words, they win the battle, they'd

3450
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,000
win the war and then fight the battle

3451
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,280
just for the hell of it, right?

3452
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:26,900
No, no, no rational human being fights battles

3453
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:27,720
to win a war.

3454
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,400
That's a stupid ass right there.

3455
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:31,640
You got to win the war before you

3456
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,980
start fighting, and if you got to want

3457
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:35,020
to throw down and create some pain and

3458
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:36,420
suffering, then you do the battle.

3459
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,860
You see, I tell you, the western world

3460
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,880
military leadership, your generals and president, whatever, whatever,

3461
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,700
they don't know the enemy at all.

3462
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:48,080
They know you.

3463
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:49,680
That's why they want you in the military.

3464
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:50,880
They want your ass done.

3465
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,220
Again, because if they knew the enemy, they

3466
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:55,060
wouldn't have to fight.

3467
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:57,700
So simple.

3468
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,240
I mean, this is, this is the state.

3469
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,740
So someone wants to get in the military,

3470
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,880
I'm like, screw it, let them go.

3471
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:02,800
Natural selection.

3472
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,220
Maybe you'll catch a bullet and be better

3473
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:05,240
for everybody else.

3474
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:07,400
Get rid of them.

3475
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,500
You shouldn't sterilize them.

3476
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,260
Cut their nuts, take their eggs out so

3477
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,080
they don't have children.

3478
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:13,780
You know, whatever.

3479
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:15,600
I mean, you want to get real harsh,

3480
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:17,620
and this is the kind of talk you

3481
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,460
read if you study the gods, you know.

3482
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:26,600
So anyway, yeah, there's, there's, it's really a

3483
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,580
piss-poor situation.

3484
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,620
By the way, there's, I think I put

3485
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:31,480
up a while back in a video of

3486
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:34,420
some guy that goes and finds military meals

3487
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:37,180
from 40, 50 years ago and opens them

3488
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:39,300
up, and some of them are still viable.

3489
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:39,720
Yeah.

3490
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:43,170
Classic.

3491
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:44,850
Yeah.

3492
02:04:45,070 --> 02:04:50,070
So either way, we didn't get into too

3493
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,250
many recipes other than discussion of the, the,

3494
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:56,130
the sadness of white people, food, and living

3495
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,830
in a white culture when it comes to

3496
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:58,250
food.

3497
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:00,750
The thing about...

3498
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:02,650
But you did leave things better by, by

3499
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:05,430
bringing in all sorts of different, there's a

3500
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:07,070
couple of them I'm definitely trying out.

3501
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,150
Yeah, points of view.

3502
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:12,430
Yeah, not, not getting into too many...

3503
02:05:12,430 --> 02:05:13,830
Here's the thing, if you're going to really

3504
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:17,410
learn about cooking, it changes so much based

3505
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:23,270
on season that not necessarily learning about what

3506
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:25,330
to make or how to make it, but

3507
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:27,870
when to make it, you see.

3508
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:28,230
Yes.

3509
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:31,670
So one way to inspire good cooking habits

3510
02:05:31,670 --> 02:05:37,810
is say, well, okay, winter's coming, so what

3511
02:05:37,810 --> 02:05:39,470
kind of food should be eaten in the

3512
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:39,730
winter?

3513
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:42,510
What kind of food is sourced from cold

3514
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:43,150
latitudes?

3515
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:44,450
Start adjusting.

3516
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:46,990
So examine, what are you eating now?

3517
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:49,630
Are you eating foods that are from warm

3518
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:50,170
latitudes?

3519
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:53,710
Well, you should probably depart from that when

3520
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:55,630
the cold weather comes, because if you don't,

3521
02:05:55,690 --> 02:05:58,770
you will, right, actually suffer the cold.

3522
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:02,310
I'd be starting in the fall, myself, early

3523
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:02,690
fall.

3524
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:06,050
Get that, get that transit, because the body

3525
02:06:06,050 --> 02:06:08,350
does take time in order to transition in.

3526
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:11,650
Right, three weeks, really three days.

3527
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:12,070
Easily.

3528
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:15,070
It goes on like three days, seven days,

3529
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,250
and then three weeks you're in.

3530
02:06:16,370 --> 02:06:19,410
I mean, even people that go from the

3531
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:21,690
lower, lower 48, they call it up to

3532
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:24,670
Alaska, they call it the lower 48 when

3533
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:26,210
you're up there, down here.

3534
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:28,850
Before they go work for the oil companies,

3535
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:30,270
they give you like a little cut sheet,

3536
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:33,670
like a bunch of xerox-copied photocopies or

3537
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:36,250
emails about how to prepare weeks before you

3538
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:36,850
go up there.

3539
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:39,730
They, you know, they start increasing your fat

3540
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:40,470
intake, you know.

3541
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,050
I actually saw one, it was kind of

3542
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:42,450
ridiculous.

3543
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:44,370
They told them go to get a tub

3544
02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:46,530
of Cool Whip and add a quarter cup

3545
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:48,090
of corn oil to it, stir it up,

3546
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:49,110
and eat that every day.

3547
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,090
Whoa.

3548
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:52,610
Yeah, I mean, that's like white people food

3549
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:52,850
again.

3550
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:55,210
Cool Whip's not even, it's not very, you

3551
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:56,130
know, sad, you know.

3552
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:58,710
They don't say anything about eat some high

3553
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:00,090
quality arctic fish.

3554
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:03,390
They don't say that because, again, because they

3555
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,250
hate you, you know.

3556
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:06,450
They're the real haters, you know.

3557
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:10,170
It's just, he was asking about psychedelics, man.

3558
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,650
It's amazing what you see going on.

3559
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:16,430
It's completely satanic and demonic, straight up.

3560
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:18,870
And after a while, you can't even feel

3561
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:19,970
sorry for their children.

3562
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:22,790
But I do feel sorry for the children

3563
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:25,670
because it's like, damn, these parents are totally

3564
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:28,510
incapable of doing anything good for their children

3565
02:07:28,510 --> 02:07:30,670
other than providing the most basic needs.

3566
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:33,030
But they're really, but then what I, the

3567
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:34,230
reason why I said what I did, you

3568
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:36,750
can't even feel sorry for the children after

3569
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:38,090
a while because they're going to grow up

3570
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:39,950
to be scumbags just like the parents.

3571
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:43,570
So they're just mini scumbags right now because

3572
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:45,370
there's no way they're not going to be

3573
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,230
like that because who's going to take them

3574
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:48,930
away and rear them, you see?

3575
02:07:49,290 --> 02:07:51,930
Put the plug in for idiocracy.

3576
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:55,170
Yeah, if you're an idiocracy, you look at

3577
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:56,110
the children and feel bad for you.

3578
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:56,910
How can you feel bad?

3579
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:58,670
In 10 years, they're going to be just

3580
02:07:58,670 --> 02:08:00,050
like these other ones, you know.

3581
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:01,650
So it's like, oh, the whole thing is

3582
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:01,950
screwed.

3583
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:04,110
All right, what else we got?

3584
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:07,050
Yeah, rice pudding is a poor man's dessert.

3585
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:09,110
Yeah, a rice pudding, make sure that you

3586
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:10,850
get yourself some cardamom pods.

3587
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,870
Put some, you don't need a lot.

3588
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:15,810
You could get a couple ounces of cardamom

3589
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:17,330
pods or cardamom powder.

3590
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:19,930
Have you ever played around or cooked with

3591
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:20,430
cardamom?

3592
02:08:20,970 --> 02:08:22,210
No, but no.

3593
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:23,610
Extremely fragrant.

3594
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,630
Extremely fragrant.

3595
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,770
I'm going to peak my curiosity with that.

3596
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:30,190
Cardamom, pine oil, orange oil, you can make

3597
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:32,310
a man's aftershave, you know, like a man's

3598
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:33,570
cologne out of that, you know.

3599
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:37,250
Yeah, cardamom is an ingredient used for many

3600
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:38,470
years in many things.

3601
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:43,370
It's very, but anyway, a really good rice

3602
02:08:43,370 --> 02:08:46,690
pudding will always have some cardamom, you know,

3603
02:08:46,730 --> 02:08:48,850
like a mulled cider or a nutmeg.

3604
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:52,050
I mean, a, you know, eggnog, any of

3605
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:54,050
those things, if you add some cardamom to

3606
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:56,130
it, it really makes the flavors explode.

3607
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:58,230
That's another white people thing, eggnog.

3608
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:03,490
So, all right, so anyway, yeah, learn about

3609
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:09,670
cardamom, C-A-R-D-A-M-U

3610
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:10,730
-M, I think, cardamom.

3611
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:11,850
I believe so, yes.

3612
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:15,590
Yeah, learn how to work with that, either

3613
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:17,510
powder or pods.

3614
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:19,350
If you crush the pods, they look like

3615
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:21,130
pistachio nuts, very soft.

3616
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:22,750
You crush the little black seeds in there.

3617
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:25,630
If you're never familiar with cardamom, you might

3618
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:27,890
be, just get some open, you'll be amazed

3619
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:28,670
at the fragrance.

3620
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:31,410
That's really good with rice pudding.

3621
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,790
And the thing about rice pudding, it's really,

3622
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:37,790
again, hard in a Western culture, is have

3623
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:39,670
you ever had rice pudding with real whole

3624
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:40,150
milk?

3625
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:44,330
Because the milk that they've, and especially in

3626
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:45,790
the U.S., it's not, you're not allowed

3627
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:47,670
to have whole milk, you know, because it's

3628
02:09:47,670 --> 02:09:48,710
too nutritious, you know.

3629
02:09:50,150 --> 02:09:53,870
Again, they, your own government hates you.

3630
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:54,610
Why?

3631
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:56,090
Because look at what they're doing to your

3632
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:56,370
food.

3633
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:58,650
If your own government was supporting you, they

3634
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:01,650
would make it mandatory for everyone to have

3635
02:10:01,650 --> 02:10:06,610
weapons and weapons training to protect yourself, right?

3636
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:08,350
It's just insane.

3637
02:10:08,490 --> 02:10:10,710
They're poisoning you, they took your money away,

3638
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:14,330
they put religions that are based on demonology

3639
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:15,050
in front of you.

3640
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:15,910
I mean, it's just insane.

3641
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:21,700
So again, talk about an acid trip, and

3642
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:24,320
everyone's just sitting around, and they're patriotic about

3643
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:24,760
it, too.

3644
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:27,380
To a piece of cloth.

3645
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:30,020
No, to the whole concept.

3646
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:32,240
Well, yeah, and that too, you know.

3647
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:33,860
Really sad.

3648
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,780
All right, so what else on the food?

3649
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:38,880
Let's see.

3650
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:41,920
You went to Gammon on many things here.

3651
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:49,230
I know I'll be listening to this again.

3652
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:54,650
Well, let's, are there any questions in chat

3653
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:55,410
or anywhere else?

3654
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:59,410
We are out of questions in chat, and

3655
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:02,510
it's pretty much just staying.

3656
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:09,430
And again, just to end off with the

3657
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:11,050
beginning, the conclusion should tie up.

3658
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:13,750
Started off talking about Western countries, the white

3659
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:16,730
culture, white people, food, all that stuff, how

3660
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:19,030
difficult it is, and the reason I brought

3661
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:20,990
it up, I wasn't anticipating on speaking on

3662
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:23,810
that too much, but one has to, because

3663
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:26,370
three quarters of the battle, you know, unless

3664
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:27,750
I'm going out to the backyard and picking

3665
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:30,390
stuff that I'm growing, which is growing beautifully

3666
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:33,130
all on its own, didn't plant anything this

3667
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:36,490
year, but when three quarters of the battle

3668
02:11:36,490 --> 02:11:39,970
of going out and acquiring food ingredients and

3669
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:42,710
other things is countering the white people culture

3670
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:44,010
when it comes to food.

3671
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:47,070
You know, the prepackaged, lack of freshness, lack

3672
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:50,570
of quality, lack of variety, you know, it's

3673
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:52,150
like I've got to sometimes go out of

3674
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:53,630
my way to find an Asian or European

3675
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:54,530
market, right?

3676
02:11:55,670 --> 02:12:04,450
So, yeah, so I find that if I

3677
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:08,050
were in a different culture, it would be,

3678
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:09,570
I would just go to, I probably wouldn't

3679
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:10,650
be cooking as much.

3680
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:13,510
I would just go to the nearest food

3681
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:16,290
vendor, street vendor, and get excellent food, you

3682
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:18,490
know, in most cases.

3683
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:19,050
Right.

3684
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:22,210
So, and if anyone's lived near a Chinatown

3685
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:25,570
or a Russia town or whatever, you know,

3686
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:30,850
any other culture, you'll notice that the food

3687
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:33,330
is quite palatable and delicious, right?

3688
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,320
Well, I think you did a beautiful job

3689
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,180
on this one, Greg.

3690
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:44,660
Lots of information to go through.

3691
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,680
A lot of things I'll be trying.

3692
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:47,420
Yeah.

3693
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,720
Oh, good.

3694
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:49,580
Definitely.

3695
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:51,420
And I'll report back.

3696
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,600
I don't know which would work for you,

3697
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,780
but try it out.

3698
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:56,180
Oh, we'll figure it out.

3699
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:57,880
Yeah.

3700
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:58,620
Yeah.

3701
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:03,060
Especially the idea of the diffuser, which I

3702
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:05,500
think is going to be a good dish.

3703
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:06,540
Yeah.

3704
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,580
Mandatory for thin pots and pans.

3705
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:13,600
Well, then the fact I have, I cook

3706
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:17,100
with flame, so that is definitely going to

3707
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:17,720
be an asset.

3708
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,600
And for electrics, for anyone really that has

3709
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:28,840
thin, it's, yeah, the best tasting food always

3710
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:31,020
comes from wood fire or coal fire.

3711
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:34,520
Second would be gas fired and then oil

3712
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,320
fired, you know, because there are actually some

3713
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:39,000
bakeries that still use oil fired.

3714
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,500
The really old ones, they haven't upgraded.

3715
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:43,060
They've upgraded them to gas, but it basically

3716
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:44,580
has a turbine and they have a big

3717
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:47,420
oil tank out back, petroleum, and it shoots

3718
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:49,400
it into the turbine at high speed and

3719
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:50,100
high pressure.

3720
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:51,920
So it burns cleanly.

3721
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:54,240
So the bread or whatever they're baking doesn't

3722
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,320
taste like the tailpipe of a car, right?

3723
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:59,360
Have you seen the old oil fired bakeries?

3724
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,140
There's not too many around anymore.

3725
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:02,720
No.

3726
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,900
And then there would be electric.

3727
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:06,740
Yeah.

3728
02:14:06,820 --> 02:14:08,420
And then electric would be at the bottom

3729
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:09,600
for cooking.

3730
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:11,880
And you can taste that.

3731
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:14,300
The scientists are total idiots, of course, otherwise

3732
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:15,120
they wouldn't be there.

3733
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,260
They'll tell you heat is heat and it's

3734
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:18,600
not.

3735
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,640
You can, you know, cook the same ingredient,

3736
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:25,540
take a potato, cut it into three pieces,

3737
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:29,360
cook one of it over electric, in water,

3738
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,760
one over electric, in water, one over gas,

3739
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:33,120
and one over coal.

3740
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:34,860
It'll taste completely different.

3741
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:43,500
All right, I've got, there's no emails.

3742
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:48,860
Do you ever bake bread or just flatbreads?

3743
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:50,440
Oh, yeah, mostly.

3744
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:53,000
Well, I made a pizza the other day,

3745
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,860
which is the same bread dough.

3746
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:58,500
Basically, I made a yeasted bread.

3747
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,620
I use a quick yeast.

3748
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:02,280
Yeah.

3749
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,420
But no, I haven't done that in a

3750
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:04,920
long time.

3751
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:07,840
Flatbreads would be the way to go because

3752
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,120
you don't, you're not concerned about the complexity

3753
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,080
of introducing yeast into the body.

3754
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:16,340
You know what I mean?

3755
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,800
Yeast is, fungus is a complex creature.

3756
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,540
I would say flatbreads are the most digestible,

3757
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:27,660
the easiest, and the most economical because they

3758
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:29,120
require the least amount of heat.

3759
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:30,760
You know, you're going to use a penny,

3760
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,860
two cents worth of heat to make a

3761
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:35,280
bunch of flatbreads and you probably use 50

3762
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,400
cents to make a loaf of bread of

3763
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:38,100
energy.

3764
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,660
So they're very frugal in terms of energy.

3765
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:44,220
Let's say you're camping and you had to

3766
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:46,120
make a yeasted bread.

3767
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:47,980
You'd need a lot of wood.

3768
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:48,940
You'd struggle.

3769
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:49,800
Yeah.

3770
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:50,820
Yeah.

3771
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:52,680
Where if you had to make flatbread, well,

3772
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,220
will it burn for 30 seconds?

3773
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:54,500
Right.

3774
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:54,900
Done.

3775
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:55,680
Yeah.

3776
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:56,400
Yeah.

3777
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:01,040
And non-brominated flour would be another asset,

3778
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:01,720
I would believe.

3779
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,540
Oh, yeah.

3780
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,180
Yeah.

3781
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:06,960
Fortunately, here we have, there's a place, we

3782
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,700
have bread that they grow the wheat just

3783
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:10,560
outside of town.

3784
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,100
I remember you saying that.

3785
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:12,560
Yeah.

3786
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:13,340
Yeah.

3787
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:13,720
Yeah.

3788
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,660
And they mill the flour.

3789
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:17,140
It's like, it's like the brown, when you

3790
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,940
eat that bread, it's called barrio bakery.

3791
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:22,060
When you eat that bread, it gives you

3792
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:23,700
the euphoric feeling as soon as you bite

3793
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,380
into it.

3794
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:25,020
Wow.

3795
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,040
Yeah.

3796
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:28,140
Like spring water when you have good spring

3797
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:28,480
water.

3798
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,160
That's like that.

3799
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:32,760
And at one time, all foods were like

3800
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:32,920
that.

3801
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:33,980
No matter what you ate.

3802
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:34,700
Exactly.

3803
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:35,860
Yeah.

3804
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:38,160
Yeah.

3805
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:41,600
Again, that's the harp on white people again.

3806
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:44,139
But I've traveled through places in the country

3807
02:16:44,139 --> 02:16:45,780
and stayed with white people and I felt

3808
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,180
sick.

3809
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,219
And I was I knew I was cringing

3810
02:16:48,219 --> 02:16:48,959
at what they ate.

3811
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,240
But then I realized that I feel sick,

3812
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:55,639
dull, light, you know, lackluster feeling low energy

3813
02:16:55,639 --> 02:16:57,059
is because of what they were eating.

3814
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,920
And then once I got back out of

3815
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,760
traveling and even just making beans and rice

3816
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:05,180
on the back of the van, I felt

3817
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:05,520
better.

3818
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:09,700
So even elaborate meals, I just it was

3819
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:13,420
just a very bad experience in the American

3820
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:13,900
culture.

3821
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:17,139
And if you are listening to this, and

3822
02:17:17,139 --> 02:17:21,280
you have an American cultural upbringing or practices

3823
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:25,080
currently abandon them as soon as possible, especially

3824
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,340
before your next meal.

3825
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:31,139
Start learning how to prepare food, simple food,

3826
02:17:32,139 --> 02:17:33,200
quality food.

3827
02:17:34,299 --> 02:17:37,360
And yeah, give up all that white people

3828
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,059
food or sad.

3829
02:17:38,059 --> 02:17:41,459
And make that transition rather gentle on yourselves,

3830
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:43,480
because it's going to be some adjustment to

3831
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:43,700
it.

3832
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:44,780
Oh, yeah.

3833
02:17:44,959 --> 02:17:47,740
Well, the body what happens is people call

3834
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:50,000
it detoxification, which is not true.

3835
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:54,379
There could be intestinal lining like plaque, you

3836
02:17:54,379 --> 02:17:56,160
know, someone would get plaque building up on

3837
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,700
their teeth, you can have plaque building up

3838
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,840
on the intestinal wall, right like below the

3839
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:04,719
duodenum or the duodenum stomach, small intestine, not

3840
02:18:04,719 --> 02:18:06,920
so much large in the colon, mostly large

3841
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:07,299
intestine.

3842
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:12,020
That's, that's what you would detoxify.

3843
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:14,620
But there is no such thing as detoxification,

3844
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:16,760
like the, the new agers are trying to

3845
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:17,459
tell you, right?

3846
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:21,920
What's happening is your body has tuned in,

3847
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:26,340
literally tuned in to the frequencies and the

3848
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:29,959
field effects and the inductive effects of digesting

3849
02:18:29,959 --> 02:18:32,660
crap food of inducing energy from it.

3850
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:36,139
And once you change it, the everything the

3851
02:18:36,139 --> 02:18:39,020
frequency changes, you know, like, for example, on

3852
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:42,420
a, you know, when you let's say have

3853
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:44,459
a good turntable and a tone arm and

3854
02:18:44,459 --> 02:18:46,680
a cartridge and you play a crappy recording,

3855
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:47,960
right?

3856
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:49,700
And then you play a good recording, they

3857
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:50,900
sound very different, right?

3858
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,860
Recording quality.

3859
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:58,020
And yeah, so basically, that will be noticeable.

3860
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:02,799
Yes, you'll suffer, you will suffer either, like

3861
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:05,360
extremely, it'll slow down your bowel movements to

3862
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:08,000
the point where you're uncomfortable, or it'll speed

3863
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,620
up your bowel movements to the point where

3864
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:11,100
you're uncomfortable, your body doesn't know what to

3865
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:11,600
do, right?

3866
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,520
So depending on the kind of food you're

3867
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:18,559
eating, staying regular is good.

3868
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,540
Yeah, don't want to be full of brown

3869
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:23,120
25.

3870
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:25,719
No, no.

3871
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:27,260
Yeah, lemonade.

3872
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:29,219
Here's another thing I want to introduce what

3873
02:19:29,219 --> 02:19:31,260
I do here see the living in the

3874
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:31,879
southwest.

3875
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,900
citrus season is in the middle of the

3876
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:36,540
winter for the rest of the place, right?

3877
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:39,200
So what everyone maybe where you are Bruce

3878
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,459
is like high in snow, and Arctic temperatures.

3879
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,920
I'm picking limes, lemons, grapefruit, oranges, right?

3880
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:50,920
Or just outside, right?

3881
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:53,820
Thinking that it's like, or, okay, so what

3882
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:55,840
I do there for a lemonade, I take

3883
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:59,120
the whole lemon, I cut it in half

3884
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,420
or quarters, I put it all in a

3885
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:02,400
blender, I try to trim off some of

3886
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,820
the ends if they're rough or thick.

3887
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:06,460
And I put in the blender, the entire

3888
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:08,720
lemon seeds, everything just to make sure I

3889
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:10,300
wash the outside real good.

3890
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:12,280
If you're going to buy a lemon, or

3891
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:14,580
citrus and do this with the make a

3892
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:16,900
lemonade, let's say, make sure you scrub all

3893
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:17,720
the wax off.

3894
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:20,420
Because citrus, they wax it so look shiny,

3895
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,120
right?

3896
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,520
Or it's an edible wax.

3897
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:24,920
But you know, I usually do borax water.

3898
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:28,820
If you have non scented dish soap, scrub

3899
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:29,440
it real well.

3900
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:31,440
And you put the whole blender, the whole

3901
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:33,880
lemon in the blender, you could do half

3902
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,160
a lemon, depending the 26 to 32 ounces

3903
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,240
of lemonade, this will make throw some ice

3904
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:39,960
cubes in there.

3905
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:42,260
And I throw some mineral tablets, you know,

3906
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:43,320
like mineral supplements.

3907
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:44,820
Right?

3908
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,260
And some honey and some sugar, and a

3909
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,140
cardamom pod.

3910
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,980
And I blend it all together.

3911
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:54,320
And and then when I when it's all

3912
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:56,220
blended, it's not too thick, not too thin.

3913
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:58,520
I pour it through a screen, a sieve,

3914
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:01,220
you know, like, I'd say it's about a

3915
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:05,600
3035 mesh, meaning 3030 holes per inch, right,

3916
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,300
you can even be coarser, like a 20

3917
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:09,500
sieve, you know, the little screens that are

3918
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,600
in your faucet are 4036.

3919
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:13,980
Okay, that's too fine, it'll clog.

3920
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:15,220
But you know, I have a I have

3921
02:21:15,220 --> 02:21:16,720
a, I think this is a more of

3922
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:17,540
a 20 mesh.

3923
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:20,540
So I filter it over some ice.

3924
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:22,060
And when you when you hold it up

3925
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:23,600
to the light, it looks yellow.

3926
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:26,080
Because it gets the color just like you

3927
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:28,480
would had a commercial lemonade, you'd add yellow

3928
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:29,400
color to it, right?

3929
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,260
Right, right.

3930
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,180
But it's translucent.

3931
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:32,880
And when you do lime, it turns green.

3932
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:33,400
It's beautiful.

3933
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:34,480
It's all natural, right?

3934
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:36,420
Well, but it's filtered out.

3935
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:38,500
Now, the reason I put the mineral supplement

3936
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,240
in there is to buffer the acid.

3937
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:43,840
Okay, you know, and the reason you filter

3938
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,340
it is to get all the stuff out

3939
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:47,120
even like if you do a banana orange

3940
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,960
drink or strawberry, orange banana in the blender,

3941
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:52,380
use a filter, run it through a sieve,

3942
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:55,020
a screen filter, get all the little seeds

3943
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:55,460
and stuff.

3944
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:56,600
If you put a banana in the blender,

3945
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:58,360
it's got lots but has got hundreds of

3946
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,140
seeds in it.

3947
02:21:59,300 --> 02:21:59,560
Oh, yeah.

3948
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:01,740
And it changes the taste and it changes

3949
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,420
the flavor.

3950
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:04,700
You know, I wanted to once open a

3951
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:06,980
smoothie shop will blow away all the other

3952
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:09,080
ones because I would buffer each drink meaning

3953
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:10,900
add some mineral supplement to it.

3954
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:12,440
You know what I mean by buffer because

3955
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:14,880
whenever you blend fruit, it's very acidic.

3956
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:16,560
And the last thing you want to do

3957
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:19,120
is pour cold acidic liquid into the body,

3958
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,280
right?

3959
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:21,800
It's going to be uncomfortable.

3960
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:25,320
So you buffer it, buffer the acid with

3961
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,240
a mineral tablet.

3962
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,500
And then you filter all the little seeds.

3963
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:31,140
And so I always make fun of when

3964
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,220
I go out and see these smoothie places

3965
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:35,920
and these fresh fruit drink places said, Do

3966
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,580
you guys buffer your drinks and filter them?

3967
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:38,520
And they kind of give me this real

3968
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:39,620
dumb look like I don't know what you're

3969
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:40,160
talking about.

3970
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:43,920
Like, wow, I would open a smoothie or,

3971
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,740
you know, a juicing place and it would

3972
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:48,760
be by appointment only you text what you

3973
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:50,460
want, and you pay for it online, then

3974
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:51,720
you come and get it.

3975
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:52,180
You're right.

3976
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:55,140
And it would be seven to $8 a

3977
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:56,560
drink and up up to 20.

3978
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:58,180
Because I would use, you know, really high

3979
02:22:58,180 --> 02:22:58,980
quality stuff.

3980
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,920
And you would have that drink and you

3981
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,500
would remember for the rest of your life.

3982
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:05,640
Like I do pickled lime, pickled lemon, various

3983
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:09,300
fruit combinations, all buffered, all filtered.

3984
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:12,660
So, and I've even done experiments where you

3985
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:15,120
do smooth fruits in the blender, and you

3986
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:16,540
have someone taste it.

3987
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:17,460
Okay, how does that taste?

3988
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,380
Okay, then I filter it once as it

3989
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,640
tastes completely changed the flavor, then I filter

3990
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,820
it again, a finer screen changed it again.

3991
02:23:25,240 --> 02:23:27,780
See, this goes back to the cut, how

3992
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:30,240
the cut changes the flavor, bite into a

3993
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,220
carrot, it tastes different than if you thinly

3994
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:34,400
slice the carrot, same carrot, and it tastes

3995
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,020
different than if you graded it, you could

3996
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:37,340
try this experiment at home.

3997
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:39,900
Make a thin slice of a carrot, grate

3998
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:41,380
some carrot, and then just take a bite

3999
02:23:41,380 --> 02:23:41,940
out of a carrot.

4000
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:45,380
Sample each different cut, tastes completely different.

4001
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,980
Still carrot, but the flavor is very different.

4002
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:53,220
And it's not, it's not like intensity where,

4003
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:54,580
you know, when you have a hot bowl

4004
02:23:54,580 --> 02:23:56,440
of chili with some chopped white onion, it's

4005
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:57,220
delicious, right?

4006
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,740
Without the white onion, it's not as good.

4007
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,720
Okay, then bite a white onion.

4008
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:01,980
That's not what I'm talking about.

4009
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:04,180
That's not, even though there is a difference,

4010
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:06,280
because when you're biting into an onion, that's

4011
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:08,440
an extreme concentration of just onion.

4012
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,940
Well, when it's finely chopped over a hot

4013
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:12,320
bowl of chili, it's delicious.

4014
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:14,720
It makes the chili delicious, makes the onion

4015
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,560
delicious, right?

4016
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:16,280
Right.

4017
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:18,000
But there is a point between where the

4018
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
cut of the onion makes the difference.

4019
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,460
You know, how many times have you heard

4020
02:24:21,460 --> 02:24:23,120
like, well, I want some onion but thinly

4021
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,200
sliced, right?

4022
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:25,840
It tastes different than when it's coarse.

4023
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:28,440
And it's not, it's not as much to

4024
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:30,000
do with how much onion there is in

4025
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,520
quantity, it's the geometric form that it has.

4026
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:36,720
So these are the fine points.

4027
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:38,780
And I discussed these, I've done, I used

4028
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:40,880
to do more Skype calls about food and

4029
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,380
all this stuff and run people through all

4030
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:43,940
this stuff in private.

4031
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,680
But when you do a public call like

4032
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:49,980
this, I know as a rule, almost no

4033
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:51,660
one that's listening to me has a proper

4034
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,920
pot or pan.

4035
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:57,680
I know as a rule, that almost no

4036
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:59,620
one listening has a proper knife and a

4037
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,380
cutting board or knows how to sharpen a

4038
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:01,540
knife.

4039
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:03,680
As a rule, there are, there might be

4040
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:06,280
some exceptions, you see.

4041
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:08,800
So that's why I just wanted to stress

4042
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,600
those major points and maybe bring up a

4043
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:11,080
few others.

4044
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,580
Well, we had 15 people out there listening

4045
02:25:16,580 --> 02:25:17,080
tonight.

4046
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,640
And okay, three times more than we comprehend

4047
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:21,860
it.

4048
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:22,100
Yeah.

4049
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:25,920
So hopefully you took something home with them.

4050
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,940
And yes, I know I'm going to be

4051
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,180
doing some experimenting.

4052
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:33,980
You've tantalized my imagination.

4053
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:36,900
So that's perfectly done.

4054
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:39,100
Yeah, even though these Thank you.

4055
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:41,780
Even though these are several hours long, they're

4056
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:43,760
very surface based and redundant.

4057
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,780
There's so much more that can be done.

4058
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:52,920
But I think basically, looking at where responses

4059
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:53,500
are gotten.

4060
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,820
Also, you have to consider that anytime you

4061
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:57,200
go in public, you're going to be a

4062
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:57,940
moron magnet.

4063
02:25:58,460 --> 02:26:00,460
When you're saying things that are different, and

4064
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:02,580
most people are not going to react or

4065
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:04,100
do anything that that it matters.

4066
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:07,840
But I know that there's no reason at

4067
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:11,240
this stage in reality to go into detail

4068
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:12,600
about anything anymore.

4069
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,720
Because just the general consensus of humanity is

4070
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:19,420
so piss poor.

4071
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,600
It's not a matter of tossing pearls to

4072
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:23,160
swine.

4073
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:25,280
It's just a matter of just tossing it

4074
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,760
away and nothing is ever going to come

4075
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:27,500
out of it anyway.

4076
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:31,140
So if you did get something out of

4077
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:32,560
it, and you can use it and you

4078
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:36,840
are, let's say, the diligent type more up

4079
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,760
more to you, you know, it'll help.

4080
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:42,900
But if there's more specifics that are needed

4081
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:45,460
or ever required, I do private calls.

4082
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:48,260
And you could reach out through the email

4083
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:48,880
and all that.

4084
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:51,340
Excellent.

4085
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:54,200
Perfectly done.

4086
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:58,890
And I want to thank our caller Joe

4087
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:03,930
who's been diligently listening and hopefully he's taking

4088
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:05,470
something home with him on this.

4089
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:11,990
Don't know if he put his phone down

4090
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:12,510
or not.

4091
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:13,570
That's fine.

4092
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:14,570
Oh, well.

4093
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:17,210
So any other comments or anything?

4094
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:17,830
Let's see.

4095
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:19,910
Because we we do burn up a lot

4096
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:21,270
of the bytes we keep a lot of

4097
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:21,770
time on.

4098
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:25,270
I've been getting pretty good at keeping it

4099
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:25,870
crunched down.

4100
02:27:26,070 --> 02:27:30,150
And even a lengthy chat between us is

4101
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:33,310
coming out rather reasonable for downloading good quality

4102
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:33,610
yet.

4103
02:27:34,270 --> 02:27:36,550
So I've been getting better at that.

4104
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:40,850
Spelling on what you got here.

4105
02:27:40,930 --> 02:27:42,050
Banami cleaner.

4106
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:42,770
Banami.

4107
02:27:43,010 --> 02:27:46,630
Yeah, I'm going to drop a an image

4108
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:48,410
in it right now.

4109
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:48,990
I'm going to open.

4110
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:50,470
I'm surprised.

4111
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:54,210
I've always I've had this the entire life.

4112
02:27:54,950 --> 02:27:59,250
I think places even like Walmart sell it.

4113
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:02,690
I'm going to drop in what it is.

4114
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:05,870
And it you once you see it.

4115
02:28:06,270 --> 02:28:07,490
Well, it was instant, right?

4116
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:09,690
And talk about what happened to speed of

4117
02:28:09,690 --> 02:28:10,690
light type stuff, right?

4118
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:11,570
Yeah.

4119
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:11,870
Yeah.

4120
02:28:15,850 --> 02:28:17,410
Probably saw the image a second.

4121
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:18,370
You heard the keyboard.

4122
02:28:18,910 --> 02:28:19,450
Yeah, there you go.

4123
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:20,990
Does that look familiar to anyone?

4124
02:28:21,070 --> 02:28:21,690
It does.

4125
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:24,110
You know, and I've walked by it probably

4126
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:25,250
many, many times.

4127
02:28:26,170 --> 02:28:27,150
Never considered.

4128
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:29,370
I don't have any chicks.

4129
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:30,970
What's up with that?

4130
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:34,530
Oh, my.

4131
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:39,210
Yeah, it's it's it's basically Falspar, which is

4132
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:39,690
a mineral.

4133
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:42,790
F.A.L. S.P.A.R. in

4134
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:45,750
an industry would have come across that term

4135
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:47,750
or chemistry, organic or organic.

4136
02:28:48,690 --> 02:28:53,070
And and it uses some base alkaline surfactants

4137
02:28:53,070 --> 02:28:53,650
and Falspar.

4138
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:54,290
That's all it is.

4139
02:28:54,890 --> 02:28:56,310
You could brush your teeth with it.

4140
02:28:56,310 --> 02:28:57,830
It will swell up your lip because it's

4141
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:59,710
very alkaline pH wise.

4142
02:28:59,730 --> 02:29:01,350
It's up there over 10, 11.

4143
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:04,810
It will get anything clean.

4144
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:11,090
It works both against acidic and alkaline things,

4145
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:11,630
you know.

4146
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:13,470
Yep.

4147
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:14,330
Bon Amey.

4148
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:16,510
It's very, very good.

4149
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:17,890
Cleaning counter.

4150
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:20,950
Anything that I want a little extra oomph.

4151
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:22,870
Avoid the chlorinated.

4152
02:29:23,070 --> 02:29:26,770
Most of the powder detergents scratch and they

4153
02:29:26,770 --> 02:29:27,950
have chlorine in them.

4154
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:31,730
And yeah, Bon Amey is the way to

4155
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:31,870
go.

4156
02:29:31,950 --> 02:29:34,350
And I forgot what the initial reason I

4157
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:34,850
brought it up.

4158
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:36,450
I was using it as a polish, as

4159
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:37,310
a sharpening compound.

4160
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:37,890
Sharpening.

4161
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:38,230
Yes.

4162
02:29:38,670 --> 02:29:38,930
Yes.

4163
02:29:39,070 --> 02:29:42,010
And it should be wet when you're sharpening.

4164
02:29:42,090 --> 02:29:44,810
Always never dry unless you're in a pinch.

4165
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:46,510
And the reason why you don't do dry

4166
02:29:46,510 --> 02:29:48,470
is because dry doesn't shed the particles.

4167
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:52,190
It'll clog up whatever your abrasive or pad

4168
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:53,510
or your stone is, right?

4169
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,550
Okay.

4170
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:59,710
If you're sharpening, if you've ever done any

4171
02:29:59,710 --> 02:30:02,210
kind of sharpening with metal, it's always wet,

4172
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:03,070
even in industry.

4173
02:30:04,030 --> 02:30:06,350
If you don't, you'll see a metallic glaze

4174
02:30:06,350 --> 02:30:08,530
on the stone and then it's metal on

4175
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:08,790
metal.

4176
02:30:10,530 --> 02:30:15,800
So also, I mean, there's many reasons, but

4177
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:18,380
again, I didn't get into too many recipes

4178
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:21,120
or methods or because I wanted to stress

4179
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:23,000
what to do with the tools that you

4180
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:23,220
have.

4181
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,720
Even Fresco talks about it.

4182
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:27,040
You can't be telling people do this or

4183
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,380
don't do that without them having the tools

4184
02:30:29,380 --> 02:30:30,560
to do it or not do it.

4185
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:34,880
And again, I'm not gonna cheat anyone by

4186
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:37,140
telling them they'll figure out how to cook

4187
02:30:37,140 --> 02:30:40,680
things well if I know they don't have

4188
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:42,180
a sharp knife, if I know they don't

4189
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:43,240
have a proper pot.

4190
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,780
And if they don't have those things, what

4191
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:48,440
to do about it without going out and

4192
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:51,140
getting more, you know, because you may not

4193
02:30:51,140 --> 02:30:52,420
have the wherewithal, you might not have the

4194
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:55,220
inclination, and you know, it might just be

4195
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:56,520
wasteful to get more stuff.

4196
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:58,120
So just use what you've got.

4197
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:00,440
You never know when you'll find at a

4198
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:04,200
yard sale and just going through thrift stores.

4199
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:06,180
Yeah, thrift shops, amazing.

4200
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:11,960
Yeah, and if it's metal, even if you

4201
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:15,520
scour it, and that makes it, renders underwater,

4202
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:17,060
you know, in water and that makes it

4203
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:17,540
clean, right?

4204
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:18,600
It'll make it clean.

4205
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:19,340
Right.

4206
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:21,260
Mm-hmm.

4207
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,860
So there's your bonnet, and that's pretty much

4208
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:26,120
it.

4209
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:29,820
Well, I want to thank you as always.

4210
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:32,980
This has been quite the enlightening night.

4211
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:34,620
Okay, good.

4212
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:36,880
I definitely appreciate your time, and I'm sure

4213
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:40,060
everybody out here certainly does also.

4214
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:45,900
And a lot to think over on this.

4215
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:47,380
Okay.

4216
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:48,280
I'm hungry.

4217
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:52,040
Oh yeah, well make yourself a potato or

4218
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:52,580
some rice.

4219
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:58,660
Yeah, also one more thing before I go.

4220
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:00,460
I spoke about the yeasted bread and the

4221
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:00,880
flatbread.

4222
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:05,280
There's something called fungus that develops on food.

4223
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:07,960
It's called mold and various other things, spoilage,

4224
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:08,200
right?

4225
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:08,980
Mm-hmm.

4226
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:11,580
And certain cultures and even people that want

4227
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:13,140
to go on what's called a healing or

4228
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:15,780
health diet, if you could pass something over

4229
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:18,960
the fire quickly, that gets rid of those

4230
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:22,020
little micro spores and all that.

4231
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,700
Like for example, when I especially do a

4232
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:26,500
food discussion with people, let's say you get

4233
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,600
up in the middle of the night and

4234
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:29,800
you want to have some cheese and crackers,

4235
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:30,060
right?

4236
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:32,080
Because you just got an urge to eat

4237
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:32,420
something.

4238
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:34,200
You'll sleep better if you do, let's say.

4239
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:37,100
So you take the crackers out of the

4240
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:41,220
package and they're wrapped in plastic, they're anaerobic

4241
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:41,900
and all that.

4242
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,620
There's actually spores of fungus on the crackers.

4243
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:46,580
You can't see them, but they're there.

4244
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:49,080
But if you threw the crackers on a

4245
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:51,540
tray, if you have a toaster oven or

4246
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:56,120
a grill type thing, and you just put

4247
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:59,000
over the flame just for a second, just

4248
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,820
pass a cracker through the flame on both

4249
02:33:00,820 --> 02:33:02,100
sides, just for a second, just pass it

4250
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:04,900
through, that flame is intense enough to destroy

4251
02:33:04,900 --> 02:33:08,980
that little micro fungus that's sitting on the

4252
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:09,700
cracker, right?

4253
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:12,540
We're not talking any dwell time at all

4254
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:12,780
here.

4255
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:14,840
We're just talking about just a quick passing

4256
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:15,140
through.

4257
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,340
So if you have a toaster oven, what

4258
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:19,320
you do is you fire it up till

4259
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:22,680
the elements are red, then turn it off,

4260
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:24,260
and then throw the crackers in there on

4261
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:27,160
a tray and turn them over, or just

4262
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:28,160
for a second or two.

4263
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:31,860
That intense infrared is enough to destroy or

4264
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:35,600
to render out that fungus.

4265
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:36,940
And it's there.

4266
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:38,080
It's on everything, right?

4267
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:44,080
You'll see seaweed, what's called nori in sushi

4268
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,700
shops, the really good ones, they pass it

4269
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:47,280
over fire.

4270
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,600
It's called toasting.

4271
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:49,940
You just do it for a quick second.

4272
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,960
It takes the mold off, right?

4273
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:56,420
That's why toasting bread always settles with you

4274
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:57,840
better, a piece of toast than just a

4275
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:58,340
piece of bread.

4276
02:33:58,420 --> 02:33:58,900
You ever notice?

4277
02:33:59,400 --> 02:33:59,620
Yeah.

4278
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:02,500
I wouldn't say it's why directly, but the

4279
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:03,800
body will, right?

4280
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:05,740
So if you want to get into a

4281
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:11,300
more cleaner regimen and reducing the fungus intake,

4282
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:14,420
now I'm not saying that, you know, if

4283
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:15,980
you're going to have cheese and crackers, it

4284
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:18,240
sounds like an oxymoron because cheese is all

4285
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,280
about fungus, right?

4286
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:20,400
Not really, it's different.

4287
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:23,840
The kind of fungus that lives on dry

4288
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:28,860
things like bread, crackers, biscuits, cookies, pastry, dry

4289
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:34,000
things, it's more beneficial to, you know, have

4290
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:34,740
it fungus-free.

4291
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,760
Let's just say that.

4292
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:37,880
You see?

4293
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:38,740
Yeah.

4294
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:41,460
And also if you've had crackers opened and

4295
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:42,580
you put them away, they get a little

4296
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,280
stale after being opened.

4297
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,620
You ever notice?

4298
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:48,240
Stale bread makes the best toast also, right?

4299
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:48,960
Right.

4300
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:53,720
That gets rid of that staleness in grain

4301
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:54,380
products.

4302
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:57,640
Another way to enrich flavor, like if you

4303
02:34:57,640 --> 02:35:01,560
enrich the flavor of grains, if you want

4304
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,920
to change, let's say you make oatmeal, even

4305
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:06,380
if it's rolled oats, and you want to

4306
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:07,520
change it up and get a little more

4307
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:10,680
flavor out of it, dry roast the oats

4308
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:12,600
before you cook them the way you cook

4309
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:14,320
them with water in the pan just for

4310
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:14,720
a minute.

4311
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:17,840
You get that really, you know what I

4312
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:18,700
mean by dry roasting?

4313
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:20,840
You're going to get that wonderful and then

4314
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:22,020
go ahead and make your oatmeal.

4315
02:35:22,860 --> 02:35:25,460
And it'll be like there's a volume knob

4316
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:27,700
on the bowl for oatmeal flavor and you've

4317
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,900
just turned the volume up.

4318
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:29,480
You see?

4319
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:30,820
Interesting.

4320
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:33,000
The same with rice.

4321
02:35:33,300 --> 02:35:36,900
If you just roast it, I'm not talking

4322
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:38,020
about changing color.

4323
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:40,920
I'm just talking about, just so you get

4324
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:42,520
that aroma, even with rice.

4325
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,780
You want to change the flavor of rice,

4326
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:49,100
put it over a warm saucepan dry, turn

4327
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:51,100
up the heat until you smell that intense

4328
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:52,640
rice flavor, and then get it out of

4329
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:53,000
the pan.

4330
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:55,080
And then go ahead and soak it and

4331
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:56,480
rinse it and all that, and you'll see.

4332
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:58,600
Oh, I'm getting that.

4333
02:35:58,940 --> 02:36:02,140
Imagine a volume knob of rice flavor turned

4334
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:02,840
up slightly.

4335
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,800
All things, even cereals.

4336
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:08,440
You know how people have breakfast cereals with

4337
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:08,980
cold milk?

4338
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,320
You ever try it with warm milk?

4339
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:11,960
Even in the summer.

4340
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:14,200
Changes the flavor completely.

4341
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:17,600
How about if you have a favorite cereal,

4342
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:20,200
like I like a maple nut crunch.

4343
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:21,620
It looks like these big clusters.

4344
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:23,520
They look like granola chopped up.

4345
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:24,220
Sure.

4346
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:24,880
Yeah.

4347
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:26,220
Do that with warm milk.

4348
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:29,300
Pour warm milk or hot milk over some

4349
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:29,940
breakfast cereal.

4350
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:30,860
Watch what happens.

4351
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:33,240
Completely different experience.

4352
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:35,480
So now it's like having a hot cereal,

4353
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:37,420
but instead of, when you say hot cereal,

4354
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:39,160
it's like a oatmeal, but now you've got

4355
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:41,580
30 varieties of hot cereal you can have.

4356
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:44,240
Especially if you have the breakfast cereal that

4357
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,500
has the dehydrated fruit.

4358
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:47,860
You know what happens to dehydrated fruit when

4359
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:48,800
it hits warm milk?

4360
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,540
Completely changes.

4361
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,600
It's like eating, yeah.

4362
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:56,200
So try all these different, so yeah.

4363
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:57,060
Well, thank you.

4364
02:36:59,500 --> 02:36:59,980
Simple.

4365
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:01,020
Yeah.

4366
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,800
You already got everything that you need to

4367
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:04,180
do that.

4368
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,740
Very, very interesting.

4369
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:08,080
And it's variety.

4370
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,860
If you, let's say, have a bowl of

4371
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:14,600
cereal with cold milk and then have another

4372
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:17,580
day with warm milk, it's a completely different

4373
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,160
experience.

4374
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:20,720
So there's your variety again.

4375
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:21,580
Yeah.

4376
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:22,980
You see what I mean?

4377
02:37:26,180 --> 02:37:28,480
Opens up a whole different can of worms

4378
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:28,700
there.

4379
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:29,640
Wow.

4380
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:31,960
And you don't want it, yeah, no cans

4381
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:32,420
of worms.

4382
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:32,900
Correct.

4383
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:35,920
All right.

4384
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:36,380
Okay.

4385
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:37,540
Well, thanks everyone, I guess.

4386
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:37,940
Yes.

4387
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:38,840
And thank you, Greg.

4388
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:39,460
See you next week.

4389
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:41,480
Very, very well done.

4390
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:42,700
Okay.

4391
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,600
You take care.

4392
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:43,920
Okay.

4393
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,440
You have a good night now.

4394
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:45,980
Thanks everyone.

4395
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:46,500
Bye.

4396
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:46,940
Bye-bye.
