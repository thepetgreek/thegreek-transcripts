39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,400

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,180

whatever flavor they feel there you go So

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
what's what's on anybody's mind anything with you

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,440
Bruce, sir?

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,980
I was Past events and Unfortunately not taking

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,280
notes, but uh it was always good to

47
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,780
Take a second look, you know as you

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,440
Specifically when you were talking about the original

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
text and all that kind of stuff and

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
all the troubles and where it came through

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
and God the number of hands that were

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,600
involved in that is it's it's crazy.

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,420
Absolutely crazy Well, it's not it.

54
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,760
Yeah, it's it's a battle of the gods

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
and and man is in a terrarium It's

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,680
very simple and it's not really a battle.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,460
It's a play but not like a Shakespearean

58
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,100
play It's a play of things that have

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,220
to happen you know, in other words a

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,600
sequence of events have to happen to say

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
it's a play the way we conduct plays

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,080
is Sort of a metaphor very very lightly

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,680
just like I use the man as being

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,100
a child, you know, you raise children or

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,220
you know Supervised children how they act with

66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,440
toys and things and I mean that's basically

67
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,839
And one thing I want to bring this

68
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,560
up because I've been getting some contact this

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,740
week about some of the recent news events

70
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,860
Which are not news at all.

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,420
It's just different, you know It's a different

72
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,820
way of the same thing and the same

73
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,020
thing that that they're procuring That is being

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,200
procured people don't understand and I want to

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,160
set this Kind of make how simple it

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
is and set it in a way that

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,820
it's you can apply it every time you

78
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,520
see something going on in the media What

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,860
you see going on in the media whether

80
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,220
it's a false flag political event or whatever,

81
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,640
whatever.

82
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,100
It's all to preserve and promote the Money

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,460
system the monetary system of the United States

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,460
or in the IMF Right It's kind of

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,360
hard to Just say that and walk away.

86
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,340
So I'm not Like we'll give you an

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,840
example Let's say you figure out how to

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,320
make a flying saucer and you put it

89
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,420
in the paper for a demonstration And here

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,020
comes, you know All the agencies and they

91
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,180
shut you down and they give you a

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,320
piece of paper and say why are you

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,860
shutting me down?

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,900
Because it has a negative effect on the

95
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
monetary system of the United States Yeah, you

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,360
get it.

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,340
Oh, yeah, if you come up with a

98
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,220
cure for let's say cancer The agencies will

99
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,880
come in and serve you a piece of

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,100
paper.

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,280
You can't do this because it adversely affects

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,480
the Get it monetary system the United States.

103
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,660
Well, look at what happened to Joseph Newman,

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,200
you know Which is now up in the

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,800
archives or uploads by the way Yeah, that's

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,340
a good classic example well, even the patent

107
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,240
the circus, you know the court and Everybody,

108
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,920
you know came around, you know the patent

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,180
office all you know From the let's say

110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,580
the formal conventional side said well, you know,

111
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,260
this is tooth fairy stuff, even though it

112
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,360
wasn't But Joseph Newman had the absolute wrong

113
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,680
approach just as Tesla and Schauberger and the

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,640
others Yeah, which is I want to do

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,880
this.

116
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,740
Yep.

117
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,800
I want to make the world a better

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,420
place Look, there is no scriptural figure or

119
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,560
any anyone in any ancient writ that ever

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,340
said that either You ever notice so if

121
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,760
you need a mentor We'll look at the

122
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,920
ancient text the Christ was like you guys

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,140
are gonna You know get bloodied with rocks.

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I mean, I'm just I'm just paraphrasing here.

125
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,380
You're gonna wish you were never born and

126
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,760
woe to you He didn't say I'm here

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,220
to make the world a better place Yeah

128
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,120
Yeah, and there is no there yeah, there

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,820
is no way you're going to access anything

130
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,640
ancient by the way in English or most

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,140
of the languages you're gonna have to learn

132
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,780
to Discern not learn the language is a

133
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,480
difference of the ancient text.

134
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,560
So yes Giving an example.

135
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,560
I recently turned on some lectures on academics

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,320
on Various subjects going back as early as

137
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,620
possible and they say well this is from

138
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,500
3,000 BC Like which is like smack

139
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,620
in the middle of the flood, right?

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,420
Yeah, right No, and also these people are

141
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,080
categorically ignorant What I mean the word categorically

142
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,720
means without a doubt across the board everything,

143
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,080
right?

144
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,680
And they're telling you how horses were domesticated

145
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,360
and how history was, you know, four or

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,020
five thousand years ago Yeah, right ask that

147
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,220
idiot whether it's a live one in a

148
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,240
university, especially the Ivy League Or whatever a

149
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,420
lot of people have contact information You know

150
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,700
how the body works.

151
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,680
What day is it or anything?

152
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,760
They don't know they don't know anything they're

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,920
categorically ignorant and they're gonna stand up there

154
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,660
and tell you all this stuff so Yeah,

155
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,720
it's pretty sad.

156
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,340
So but at the same time, you know

157
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,680
The food clothing and shelter thing is being

158
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,800
worked on consistently Yes You know with whoever's

159
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,900
listening Cuz that's all you got really what

160
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,960
are you gonna do put on a lecture

161
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,340
on how?

162
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,380
Horses were domesticated 5,500 years ago.

163
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,300
Listen to some idiot tell you stuff that

164
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,080
the nerd doesn't even exist or it has

165
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,500
existed.

166
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,580
I Mean, come on guys.

167
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,340
It's about food clothing and shelter right now.

168
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,160
It's always been that way really.

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,240
I Which you will never find out using

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,400
the conventional rectangle or any other means but

171
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,960
You'd have to piece it together to see

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,400
so You know like for example, you know

173
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,280
I bring up the Middle Ages or prior

174
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,920
to that the Dark Ages The only reason

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,460
they're called the Dark Ages is because they're

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,800
dark to us Just like for example a

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,640
black ops or a dark project doesn't mean

178
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,260
that it's that way It just means that

179
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,360
it's because there's no information on it.

180
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,470
You see so Very interesting times in that

181
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,770
time.

182
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,730
Oh Yeah, super a little bit that the

183
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,570
little bit that can be garnered out of

184
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,890
that It got shut down and the shutdown

185
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,850
was known as the Renaissance remember it's all

186
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,710
backwards right the winners are the losers and

187
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,490
the losers are the winners and I'm not

188
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,930
saying this in a Philosophical way I'm saying

189
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,910
in an actual way.

190
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:34,150
So let's see Vandy posted something here We

191
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,550
have food by seasonal info would be helpful

192
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,990
Well, there's what do you say seasonal in

193
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,270
English It means two things one is a

194
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,670
flavor additive a spice added to food or

195
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,350
the other one is seasonal meaning in season

196
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,430
growing meaning Gleaned or harvested at that time

197
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,590
mm-hmm and tomato season there and He

198
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,990
preserves in jars for winter But yeah, that's

199
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,410
the best.

200
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,010
Yeah.

201
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,530
Yeah, I would say so freezing works Well,

202
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,790
but what people don't understand about freezing is

203
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,470
even though you could leave something in the

204
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,730
freezer.

205
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,630
It doesn't spoil for years All right, especially

206
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,810
when you go to someone's house.

207
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,210
I call it food museum race You know,

208
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,470
they have stuff up way back in there

209
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,430
They don't you know know about rotation and

210
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,070
cleaning things storage areas cans and various other

211
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,670
things Yeah, yeah, well freezing is good for

212
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,090
about 30 days 30 to 60 days tops

213
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,030
After that and the reason I say this

214
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,790
after that things do spoil in a different

215
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,790
way, but not spoil in a sense that

216
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,390
You have rot You have a form of

217
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,030
dry rotting actually that happens It's not freeze

218
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,250
drying.

219
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,010
It's a different kind of Thing that happens,

220
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,510
but the the reason I say that about

221
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,730
freezing is because the freezers are not cold

222
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,870
enough You have to be in the minus

223
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,850
90 Temperature range Fahrenheit or centigrade.

224
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,430
Oh, man, you know, it's interesting about Fahrenheit

225
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,530
Saturday And once you get to those low

226
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,630
numbers, they they start being pretty equal.

227
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,710
Yeah, and those are called medical freezers or

228
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,970
cryogenic, you know Not sub cryogenic, but you

229
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,250
know high Above cryogenic cryogenics goes down to

230
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,730
the minus 150 200 Right where you treat

231
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,490
certain metals and things like that and there

232
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,570
you need, you know, a four-stage type

233
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,930
deal The freezers that you typically have in

234
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,690
most people's homes or the sold out there

235
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,950
for as a freezer Is in the minus

236
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,070
20 range minus 10 minus 10 20 20

237
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,830
minus 30 I've seen some of them if

238
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,650
they're well insulated and they run often You

239
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,210
could I've tweaked one to go down to

240
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,070
minus 40, but to go below that you

241
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,410
need two-stage compressor right, so You know

242
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,730
and they get pricey now what people don't

243
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,730
get let's just talk about freezing for a

244
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,930
while most of the commercially available fish is

245
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,810
two years old and the reason they do

246
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,330
that is for to stabilize the market Because

247
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,110
if the fish market was reliant on the

248
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,210
catch of that year What if they had

249
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,790
a bad catch that year what happens to

250
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,530
the fish market?

251
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,370
Right So what they do is they have

252
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,450
two seasons on hand So they just equally

253
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,450
distribute it out.

254
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,350
So let's say you already have 40 or

255
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,070
50 percent of the two years ago fish

256
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,130
stock in these freezers This year if it's

257
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,070
a slim crop will you take like you

258
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,970
take that 50% from the two years

259
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,450
ago and you add it to this year

260
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,590
and you supplement the Supply you see To

261
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:58,700
keep the prices stable Yeah hesitating about freezing

262
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,080
for the reasons I stated is correct, yes

263
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,280
Vacuum jar preservation seems to keep pretty well.

264
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,440
It's what Van Diemen's land says.

265
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,100
Yeah Yeah, well, you know that's what the

266
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,220
traditional canning did was create a vacuum You

267
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,900
know the heat right expands and then contracts

268
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,380
you get the vacuum destruction Now the mechanical

269
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,060
vacuum will be different Than a if you

270
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,980
do one jar with a mechanical vacuum and

271
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,180
one with a heat vacuum You're going to

272
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,440
have different results because one actually, you know

273
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,540
adds heat and the other one doesn't So

274
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,400
one will produce Believe it or not.

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,520
The heating one is better for a more

276
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,700
mild Ecology what I mean by a mild

277
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,960
ecology is if you don't do a heat

278
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,680
canning and just do the mechanical vacuum That

279
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,940
will allow and give rise to more what's

280
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,720
called anaerobic creatures to come out Where the

281
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,520
heat will stabilize both the aerobic and the

282
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,180
anaerobic you'll have a less active ecology So,

283
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,600
oh nice to know.

284
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,040
Yeah, most people are not set up to

285
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,420
do strictly mechanical Vacuuming because again that to

286
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,400
do that properly Requires, you know good equipment

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,440
and all that and high quality stuff Yes,

288
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,280
this here uses the old-fashioned boiler type.

289
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
Yeah, that's that's pretty good Yeah, that'll give

290
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
you a more neutral terrain and when I

291
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
say by that meaning the the critters that

292
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,340
are in the container Yep, heat has a

293
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,580
tendency to normalize things that way Mm-hmm

294
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,420
Yeah, I'm gonna go grab a Java I

295
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,940
should go completely wireless here in a second

296
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,300
Okay, see what happens.

297
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,080
I do that if I drop I'll somehow

298
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,940
mitigate that.

299
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay, is it three two one?

300
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh Okay.

301
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,560
Now it's completely wireless.

302
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,680
That was good, right?

303
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,420
Oh, yes.

304
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,140
Yes.

305
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,990
All right, so Had the same thing on

306
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,210
my mind Oh, no, I'm so good.

307
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:08,550
Yes.

308
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,750
All right.

309
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,370
There we go.

310
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,250
There we go.

311
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,870
Yeah Lost you for that was mechanical the

312
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,690
the that was a mechanical fault not a

313
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,290
Electronic one, by the way, something just got

314
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,970
unplugged a little receiver Okay, I didn't notice

315
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,330
so I was like, oh, why is that?

316
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,710
Why is that light not on anymore?

317
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,010
Oh, I see because it's unplugged Oh, yeah,

318
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,970
but you know, by the way, that's the

319
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,830
the simplest thing You know when something mechanical

320
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,330
doesn't work is because there's a fault in

321
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,630
the in the mechanical side first You know

322
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,470
like the old adage with the computer people

323
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,070
at the computers or did you check to

324
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,150
see if it's plugged in?

325
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,370
That's half the time still Mmm, I finally

326
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,630
got myself a little preamp and thing for

327
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,250
for the headset So I'll be getting rid

328
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,010
of my noisy mic and background.

329
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,670
Hopefully in the near future Okay It is

330
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,030
a joy, by the way, if you one

331
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,870
wants to afford it, you know good equipment

332
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,610
is always a joy And believe it or

333
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,990
not good equipment doesn't go out of style

334
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,710
Unless it's the format that changes like from

335
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,350
a track to cassette, right?

336
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,790
You know, I never like for example back

337
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,950
in the audiophile days.

338
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,990
I Never invested in a Nakamichi Cassette deck,

339
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,610
you know $2,000 cassette deck because I

340
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,290
had a feeling just you could never get

341
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,410
you know sound quality out of such a

342
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,270
format right now was good, you know, right

343
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,990
and Yeah, there was a couple of other

344
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,310
European companies made high-end cassette decks and

345
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,390
I was like, yeah, that's not No, I

346
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,770
never yeah Cassette Really real is different now

347
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:55,130
Real it's not a cartridge type because said

348
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,370
is a cartridge in the alignment issues.

349
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,610
Mm-hmm Severe alignment issues, you know with

350
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,850
azimuth alignment and capstans all that but was

351
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,630
revealed real to real is pretty locked in

352
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,630
oh, yeah, Jen and the you know, the

353
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,730
sensing heads and all that are five times

354
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,030
bigger and So yeah, I remember the Tascam

355
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,329
and Tiac real to real.

356
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,069
Yeah Those are pretty good you can believe

357
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,890
it or not I would say that off

358
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,589
of them if you get a master recording

359
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,210
on a real to real quarter-inch It

360
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,490
would it would best most seat high quality

361
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,630
CDs because it's still analog and you know,

362
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,490
right if you run at a high speed

363
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,530
Right, right faster.

364
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,810
You run it more information.

365
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,170
So yeah more information Per density increases so

366
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,030
but I'll mention this I don't want to

367
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,490
make it an audio talk, but I have

368
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,650
a Sony came out with in the mid

369
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,010
80s.

370
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,370
So he came out with an elite class

371
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,770
of CD players and they use the two

372
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,890
buffers and two pre-amps to stage in

373
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,490
there So they it's you know, it's a

374
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,830
brand new Sony from you know, 1985 CD

375
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,450
player Series, I think it's the 970 or

376
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,710
something and this is over 30 years old

377
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,970
now It's still it sounds fantastic, but you

378
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,270
know to get that kind of sound Yeah

379
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,650
out of a seat and the problem with

380
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,550
when you get really good equipment just like

381
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,450
a fast car is the source material Like

382
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,950
if you have a really good system, it's

383
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,850
hard to listen to Regular CDs and things

384
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,490
because now it's too revealing and you hear

385
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,470
all the mistakes and the crap that they

386
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,790
did when they recorded it right, mm-hmm

387
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,790
a little bit of pleasure just like if

388
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,290
you have a super a super fast exotic

389
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,070
car and You know it, you know, you

390
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,710
know, it does 75 miles an hour 100

391
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,650
kilometers per hour in third gear You're not

392
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,330
gonna be able to really open it up,

393
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,650
you know, at least legally out, you know

394
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,950
Because you look at the you know, the

395
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,470
speed limits, you know So and it's not

396
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,170
like an Autobahn people say all the Autobahn,

397
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,270
you know The Autobahn is a very tough

398
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,950
place to be on because there's no shoulder

399
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,310
You're not allowed to run out of gas

400
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,150
and you're not allowed to have a mechanical

401
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,170
failure, right?

402
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,330
Right, so it's a very strict Setup, but

403
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,170
nonetheless it is a place where you could

404
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,850
exercise look on that kind of Stuff so,

405
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,410
you know exotic supercars, but when you get

406
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,170
into that kind of equipment, I Noticed you're

407
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,730
high and the source material is important.

408
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,570
Look for example There there with television monitoring

409
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,870
and stuff plasma is still the way to

410
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,850
go I mean, even though they've got new

411
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,610
LED LCD TVs, but nothing really beats a

412
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,630
plasma ultimately I guess it's subjective to say

413
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,210
that right?

414
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,610
But But Yeah, when you if you've ever

415
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,230
gotten a plasma television, especially a larger one

416
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,430
The problem is the source material everything looks

417
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,590
like crap on it now.

418
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,830
Mm-hmm, right?

419
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,230
It's so revealing play.

420
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,310
Yeah So you need a really good source.

421
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,810
So you tie that back into we were

422
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,270
saying about ancient texts, especially what's called the

423
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,330
scripture It's you know, once you start figuring

424
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,230
out That you want to operate with higher

425
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,150
level equipment, right the source material that you

426
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,690
have in your Bibles is crap So, you

427
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,370
know, I don't know who this LO cat

428
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,810
all capital LOR D guy is, you know,

429
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,470
right?

430
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,330
Well, I know there's a few hundred of

431
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,250
them in England in a house of LOR

432
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,810
DS, but these people are crazy, you know,

433
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,450
so With their Santa Claus, you know, the

434
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,230
Santa Claus is their chief deity, by the

435
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,250
way No matter how you what you think

436
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,430
whenever no matter what comes out of their

437
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,910
mouth or they say they believe in watch

438
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,590
what they do Yeah, I don't see no

439
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,810
G.

440
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,010
I don't see no JES us with long

441
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,630
hair and sandals in the shopping malls once

442
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,850
a year Do you not a one?

443
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,590
You do see that Santa guy.

444
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,730
So guess who their chief deity is And

445
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,050
the most highly celebrated It's scary stuff, you

446
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,570
know, that's pretty sick people though you're dealing

447
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,950
with right two billion Which reckons that to

448
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,350
be what?

449
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,190
Roughly 30 40 percent of the planet.

450
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,650
I'm just on that category The other I'm

451
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,050
not saying that the other six years every

452
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,530
percent are pretty sick either I'm just saying

453
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,510
let's look at what's saying because this is

454
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,710
a Western convention that we're speaking to right?

455
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,340
Mm-hmm Now you can't listen to what

456
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,380
they're saying Because it's easy to establish.

457
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,100
They're insane.

458
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,580
And the last thing you want to do

459
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,060
is Listen to a crazy person or people

460
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,460
What they do for example with analyzing crazy

461
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,200
people, even though psychology is not a valid

462
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,540
field in any way It's all revealing to

463
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,200
videotape crazy people and watch it without the

464
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,580
sound Yeah, because you can see there's an

465
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,180
actual, you know something really wrong with just

466
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,040
the way that they move and This is

467
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,820
what you when you look at the Western

468
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,840
culture with what religions they've adopted.

469
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,580
You can just look at them That's what

470
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm saying.

471
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,900
Don't listen to what they say because they're

472
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,440
insane anyway and ignorant You don't want to

473
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,140
if you're listening to them now, you're watching

474
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,020
and listening now.

475
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,740
Well guess what happens it's a form of

476
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,540
oppression, but if you can just watch what

477
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,200
they're doing and Ignore them audibly which is

478
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,220
recommended you you will get a pretty good

479
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,820
gist a good foundation of what's going on

480
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,520
Anything else going on or this is gonna

481
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,560
be a real short sonic She ran Just

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,440
checking out what Bandy had to say there

483
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:02,700
Translation translation issues Well It depends on what

484
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,200
you're what you want to get out of

485
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,620
it, right You remember when even when you

486
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,380
want to go back?

487
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,260
It's twice the work because even when you

488
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,420
want to go back and figure out what

489
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,240
was really said regarding if it was ancient

490
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,800
Any ancient text you're still going to have

491
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,640
to know what's called the received text You

492
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
know what they put out there because that's

493
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,600
what most people know So now you need

494
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,320
to know twice as much about it They're

495
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,440
gonna have to wait to find a way

496
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,300
to couch the differences Like if you if

497
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,820
you run into some people that seem relatively

498
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,900
decent I mean notice I said not are

499
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,040
but seem and they only know the King

500
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,580
James and they want to learn more and

501
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,140
that's all They know well, you're gonna have

502
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,520
to somehow create a bridge to bring them

503
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,240
over to show them where the mistakes are

504
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,740
And it's going to be very difficult to

505
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,860
break through the religiosity of that document Because

506
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,980
most for example Christians don't know they cannot

507
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,440
define Christianity But they can't you anyone can

508
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,180
define them as taking that writ that they

509
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,880
use the King James or it doesn't matter

510
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,680
where the version and Turning that into the

511
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,200
mainstream part of their religion.

512
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,600
In other words, that is the source of

513
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,220
their religion errors and all right, right So

514
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,960
So they have no discernment.

515
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,880
So so when you gain discernment by looking

516
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,900
at everything about it You know what it

517
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,220
came from and what it is and it's

518
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,580
mistakes You have to make rapid-fire decisions

519
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,000
on how are you going to discuss it?

520
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,380
Are you gonna stick on the crap that

521
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,280
they know or are you gonna be a

522
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,640
bridge?

523
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,820
Over and if you're gonna be a bridge

524
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,320
over to you're gonna show the highlights or

525
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,560
are you gonna show the mistakes?

526
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,420
Remember these people are insane So I don't

527
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,380
see it going well Nope Neither do the

528
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,700
gods.

529
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,080
That's why they're gonna do it.

530
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,560
They're gonna do right either to the gods.

531
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:04,200
So Yeah Anything else going on out there

532
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,560
or a team how do you determine the

533
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,700
first moon of previous years on folks calendar?

534
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,520
Go to a visual Go to the rectangle

535
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,080
put in moon phases and Don't get a

536
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,460
graphic.

537
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't get a written chart get a graphic

538
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,860
one, which actually shows the physical calendar You

539
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,980
know with the four weeks and the seven

540
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,380
boxes along each and they show you the

541
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,580
actual moon phase Right, and what you do

542
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,040
there is when they show you the moon

543
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,400
phase you'll see Roughly for three or four

544
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,640
days.

545
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,960
The moon looks pretty full.

546
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,500
So in the middle of those Three or

547
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,620
four, you know on the left.

548
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,700
It's not so full in the middle.

549
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,440
It gets really full.

550
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,280
They're right It's not so full sort of

551
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,300
in the middle There's where you judge and

552
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,360
you also have to know understand that those

553
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,740
boxes on the calendar Represent a midnight don't

554
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,640
they I Think you posted that in chat

555
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,100
a while back a calendar like that or

556
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,840
showed all the moon phases Physically, yeah what

557
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,280
they look like Yeah, but you remember somewhere

558
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,280
But remember when you're looking at calendar calendrical

559
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,240
Pope's work schedule delineations the lines between the

560
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,700
boxes are midnight So you have to shift

561
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,000
everything over 180 or 90 degrees.

562
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,360
So the middle of the box is really

563
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,440
when the day starts Yeah, I was I

564
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,600
used to show I don't really get into

565
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,400
too much detail anymore but years ago when

566
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,560
I got into detail, I had a whole

567
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,820
presentation on how to do the nights the

568
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,820
The deal, you know with timekeeping and he'd

569
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,620
show that just the picture of the calendar,

570
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,060
you know the regular calendar of people hang

571
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,420
up on the wall and I would have

572
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,360
a dotted line a Vertical dotted line in

573
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,840
the middle of each box and they said

574
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,560
that's really when your day starts You get

575
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,680
it, you know because they do night to

576
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,520
midnight So what just keep that in mind

577
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,880
and also noon time.

578
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,440
You're gonna have to figure out where you

579
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,880
are on the earth and the season Right

580
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,980
That's when they do the if you look

581
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,200
at that full moon graphic on the calendar

582
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,540
and you're It all various places all over

583
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,060
the planet.

584
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,940
Well, it's different different days Because remember they've

585
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,640
kicked certain days forward certain days back By

586
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,520
the way, the real date line is somewhere

587
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,560
between Jerusalem and Babylon Around there is where

588
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,100
the real date line stops, you know physically,

589
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,040
right?

590
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,340
In other words the progression of the of

591
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:48,800
the luminaries Thought I had your picture stored

592
00:27:48,800 --> 00:28:05,610
but Very good reference Yeah,

593
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,630
it's good to kick back on a lot

594
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,250
of details because I'm giving a little detail

595
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,890
is really to get people started right Sorry,

596
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,270
you know it give an analogy, you know

597
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,230
someone needs a boost, you know, the car

598
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,410
doesn't start so you pull up you pump

599
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,070
the Pop the bonnets or the hoods on

600
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,710
both cars and you give them jump Okay,

601
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,330
and then the car starts he says thank

602
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,590
you very much Pat him on the back

603
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,050
is on his way Well, you got something

604
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,270
done, but you're not done yet because usually

605
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,070
the guy who you gave or gal you

606
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,710
gave the boost to They're not done yet

607
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,530
They have to go and make sure check

608
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,650
the alternator or the dynamo is working or

609
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,910
they might need a new battery You see

610
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,530
right?

611
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,690
Otherwise, guess what happens in a day or

612
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:48,870
two?

613
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,010
They're gonna be what back where they started

614
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,650
So even though you give a little boost

615
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,990
It doesn't mean you're done So I'm not

616
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,470
buying people new batteries or checking their alternators

617
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,690
or dynamos or or their system That's up

618
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,910
to you You know what I mean, right

619
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,610
so that's why I don't do treatises and

620
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,210
reports and on the uncommon site I don't

621
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,810
do anything written at all.

622
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,730
It's just that maybe it's sparse archive or

623
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,350
whatever There'll be one are one of the

624
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,470
archives there not to be whatever say it's

625
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,010
modestly is more information than you've gotten anywhere

626
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,050
else in 2,000 years Just one archive

627
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,790
So in terms of that need to be

628
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,450
discussed That are not how can you all

629
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,610
fall for the stuff including myself years ago

630
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,190
for all the crap that you know It's

631
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,930
put out there so Yeah, you know when

632
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,730
you look back on it how easy it

633
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,410
was to slip into that And that's that's

634
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,190
a scary part.

635
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,610
I Was watching the YouTube from what was

636
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,470

the for the click-high Releasing endorphins, I

639
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,690

they Snatched people into this you know clicking

641
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,910
on it just to get this pleasure of

642
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,250
a like or whatever and it was It

643
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,230
was actually rather chilling to see how cool,

644
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,990

717
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,320
up because these screens are made of plastic.

718
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,500
You know which is oil dark Process so

719
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,900
they're processing darkness, which is crude oil Make

720
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,740
it when it's made in the dark into

721
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,240
and they're running light through it to synthesize

722
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,580
Your communication abilities And again, I've had a

723
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,880
couple of people ask me about it, they're

724
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,600
gonna take the Internet down I said absolutely

725
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,920
not And everything on the Internet is just

726
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,940
a beta test because the real purpose of

727
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,760
the Internet has not come into fruition yet

728
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,180
It won't for another decade It's a set

729
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,280
on good start.

730
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:05,900
Yeah Yeah being set up Don't feel bad

731
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,780
about it though I think at the end

732
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,060
of this little thing documentary that this fellow

733
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,100
is talking about The first thing he says

734
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,920
turn it off Take a week from it

735
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,560
and and just literally see how addicted you

736
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,020
are to the device Don't let if you

737
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,820
do it often possess you yes If you

738
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,960
if you're on the rectangle often like I

739
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,600
know when I had to do certain research

740
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,320
and things if you turn it Off for

741
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,780
a day that feels like a week Yeah,

742
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,260
whether it's a relief or a strain on

743
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,500
your system like an addict either way by

744
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,540
the way I just got a message from

745
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,580
Sammy's A little under the weather this week,

746
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,940
and he's tired so in he's out in

747
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,520
Europe So we have a big time difference

748
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,739
from here, so he says next week guys.

749
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,080
Just want to let you know Okay Well,

750
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,940
I wish him well Yeah, I'm sure we

751
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,920
all do Yeah, it's not good one slightly

752
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,740
under the weather or Energy well if you

753
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,980
really listen to Greek speak you wouldn't be

754
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:19,540
sorry Sam Actually there's a difference between hearing

755
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,180
and listening There's a difference between listening under

756
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,100
and then understanding and there's a difference between

757
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,250
understanding and doing is Knowledge power in the

758
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,170
doer or his knowledge power I mean knowledge

759
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,870
power in the knower or knowledge power in

760
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,450
the For the doer and by the way

761
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,550
knowledge is not power.

762
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,830
It never has been knowledge is life Because

763
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,650
scripture says they will be destroyed for lack

764
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,770
of knowledge, so what's the opposite of not

765
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,510
of destruction?

766
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,250
Creating creation or building right so knowledge is

767
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,190
building in creation and life Because you know

768
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,170
you can say the opposite of destruction is

769
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,850
life also Well certainly yes to a certain

770
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,730
degree no from you know something as simple

771
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,890
as that you know So it's not power.

772
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,870
It's it's creativity life and production So again,

773
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:19,240
you know yep It was just catching a

774
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,400
little bit of Andy there Let's Say what

775
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,260
is what's on the fat FB.

776
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,200
I guess is Facebook.

777
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,440
I called feces book right feces Yes, it's

778
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,840
testing.

779
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,100
Yeah.

780
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,540
Well.

781
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,280
Here's the thing the the people I was

782
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,460
telling this to someone recently The they do

783
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,840
false flag research right let me see who

784
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,860
it is and You know they analyze these

785
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,440
things and they said well, they think the

786
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,580
people public is stupid I said no They

787
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,200
don't only think the public is stupid.

788
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,940
They know the public is stupid.

789
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,100
I know the public is stupid and You

790
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,060
know the public is stupid.

791
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,420
You just don't admit it because you need

792
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,260
the you know the attention from them.

793
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,820
Yeah The public is stupid That's why these

794
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,680
thing and now the people that that sort

795
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,840
of are the actors behind the things that

796
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,580
people complain about Let me ask you where

797
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,300
do they come from alpha Centauri Mars Venus

798
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,920
or they come from the same crop of

799
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,820
idiot human on earth the latter Of course

800
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,840
these things are sloppy and you know it's

801
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,400
just you know the the people that are

802
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,340
in control the state let's say however you

803
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,060
want to define it the the financial world

804
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,700
the religious world They know people excuse me

805
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,300
They know it But they themselves also come

806
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,640
from that crop So you want to call

807
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,440
it the blind leading the blind that's fine

808
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,900
But you you know the the blind are

809
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,540
not going to make visual tricks for the

810
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,680
blind They do it in Braille or they

811
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,100
hit you on the head with the cane.

812
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,140
You know the stick right?

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,160
Right so yeah But it's about food clothing

814
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,700
and shelter.

815
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,220
I mean if you could really spend here's

816
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,060
advice I give good advice if you're wise

817
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,000
you'll you'll take the advice the Greek gives

818
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and not because I'm I'm giving it because

819
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,020
it's good advice objectively Spend more time on

820
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,760
food preparation What even if you don't know

821
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,460
what you're doing If you know if you

822
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,060
admit that you want to spend more time

823
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,600
on food preparation, let's say cooking and all

824
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,240
that If you know you're going to spend

825
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,480
more time on it guess what's going to

826
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,800
happen.

827
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,960
You're going to do it Yeah, yeah, hopefully

828
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,320
you'll say wait a second Yeah, you know

829
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,100
I'll just make it from scratch.

830
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll scratch it out.

831
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,860
You know whatever make you know so like

832
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,920
for example tonight I've made a great dinner.

833
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,140
I'm not going to get into it.

834
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,100
It's Asian, but Also someone here made a

835
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,760
dessert a tiramisu Which is an Italian dessert

836
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,420
and we used like top-shelf liquor in

837
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,280
the mix instead of you know The stuff

838
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,520
that they usually tell you to use a

839
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,500
brandy, and it's a big difference.

840
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,800
You know I mean Usually when you do

841
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,200
cooking They you know they had tell you

842
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
to add a liquor or wine to a

843
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,480
certain dish The better the the liquor or

844
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,980
the wine the better the dish You know

845
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,500
there's a there's an up-and-coming restaurant

846
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,300
I'm not going to give details and they

847
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,000
pride themselves on a regional using regional foods

848
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,580
and regional wines and I saw a video

849
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,160
of them in the kitchen And they have

850
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,860
like this box wine that they add to

851
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,100
the food Like they pride themselves as having

852
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,480
a great wine collection on the floor to

853
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
the customers But when they're cooking and they

854
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,960
have to add wine to the dish they

855
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,740
have this this box wine You know you

856
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,340
get a Kmart or Walmart right and like

857
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,400
what are you people stupid?

858
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,560
Yes, they are don't you think that cheap

859
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,100
wine is going to taste like cheap wine

860
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,880
in the food also?

861
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,310
So and by the way, let's just talk

862
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,810
a little bit about wine Usually when grapes

863
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,890
and things are fermented in the form of

864
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,110
wines They end up being quite sweet because

865
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,050
they favor a high sugar content for rapid

866
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,150
fermentation or controllable fermentation Because the less sugar

867
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,410
you have the less fermentation you have and

868
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,090
the harder it is to perceive and control

869
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,970
it right So there's a way of measuring

870
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,410
sugar.

871
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,230
It's an industrial measurement it goes from like

872
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,370
0 to 19 or something coca-cola is

873
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,810
like 12 or whatever and And You get

874
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,070
into all these details if you want to

875
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,250
I'm not right now But essentially most wines

876
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,810
are very sweet so what they do is

877
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,350
they add Sulfuric acid to them to knock

878
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,070
down the sweetness.

879
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,370
That's why when you look at a bottle

880
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,390
of wine it says Contains sulfites you ever

881
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,770
notice that Okay, so but but you know

882
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,170
I didn't say I didn't say they add

883
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,630
sulfites.

884
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,830
I said they adds Sulfuric acid and where

885
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,030
else do we find that in batteries car

886
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,870
batteries don't we?

887
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,430
Yeah, so German here's the other interesting thing

888
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,110
German wines are the highest purity in the

889
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,710
world amongst that we know of as this

890
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,990
is a formal Standard most wines California wines

891
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,050
French wines especially American wines by the way

892
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,930
will never pass German purity laws So I

893
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,530
just want to throw out there I just

894
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,070
gave you know a little bit of a

895
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,670
thing and also you have these people called

896
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,330
sommeliers that are wine tasters and wine They

897
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,930
you know a good restaurant or a good

898
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,370
food establishment of what's called a sommelier which

899
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,170
recommends wines preparing and quality of wines and

900
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,030
history of wines and tasting and all that

901
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,810
rain and I was once present because of

902
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,650
the water stuff that I did The I

903
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,790
challenged someone who sold high-end wines to

904
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,330
go get all the best bottled water in

905
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,010
their own water What they thought was the

906
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,870
best water they brought it And I just

907
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,610
took regular tap water and an overnight processed

908
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,870
it and it was better than all the

909
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,210
waters they ever brought and there was a

910
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,130
wine sommelier there and there was also a

911
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,230
coffee taster and They're the coffee taster and

912
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,770
the wine somebody were arguing They were like,

913
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,770
oh you wine somebody as you look for

914
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,650
40 or 50 characteristics in wine, but coffee's

915
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,930
got a hundred and fifty, huh?

916
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,870
You know, it's really funny.

917
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,930
How they are.

918
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,470
They get it, you know, so the people

919
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,370
that are discerning coffee Is even there is

920
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,570
more to discern in coffee than there is

921
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,330
in wine But we don't it's not doesn't

922
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,630
seem as popular because everyone can drink coffee,

923
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,050
but not everyone drinks fine wine Right.

924
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,390
And by the way people if you've ever

925
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,530
had a $700 bottle of wine or $1

926
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,930
,000 bottle of wine or $400 bottle of

927
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,610
wine It just tastes more like brandy So

928
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,910
I just tell this to people, you know,

929
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,210
no one's no one's discussing me.

930
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,590
And so I'll say it I'll just say

931
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,410
I'll make it real quick.

932
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,270
I was at this high-end restaurant About

933
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,510
two decades ago with a VP from Goldman

934
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,410
Sachs and it was like five people and

935
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,390
it was a $4,000 tab for the

936
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,610
dinner right, so well, why was it so

937
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,410
high because the wine right and So I'm

938
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,110
drinking this wine.

939
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,710
It's a seven hundred fifty dollar bottle of

940
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:46,930
wine.

941
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,390
I'm not the whole bottle but a glass

942
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,670
I'm like, oh, let's just say it's like

943
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,650
it has brandy in it if you know

944
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,610
what I mean, right?

945
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,750
So if if what I was thinking I

946
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,810
said what you do if you if you've

947
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,230
been around Let's say you're going to entertain

948
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,870
some guests and these people are used to

949
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,730
you know, really high budget wines Let's say

950
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,690
take a bottle of wine Open it very

951
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,510
quickly a good bottle when let's say $15

952
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,030
is a good bottle of wine By the

953
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,310
way, whether you buy a $3 or $4

954
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,150
bottle of wine or a $20 or $30

955
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,990
bottle of wine They all cost about a

956
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,990
dollar fifty The difference is how it gets

957
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,870
to you and what they would care they

958
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,650
put into it, right?

959
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,890
And of course the quality grapes, but it's

960
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,070
not that much Okay, so what you do

961
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,430
is you open the bottle very quickly So

962
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,630
don't let it air out and put in

963
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,330
with a drop or about ten drops of

964
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,210
high-quality brandy Put the cork back on

965
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,030
put it away for two days Take it

966
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,110
out air it out really well serve it

967
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,350
and people someone will say this is a

968
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,950
hundred or two hundred dollar bottle of wine

969
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,570
It's not that easy.

970
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,810
You have to know what you're doing, but

971
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,530
essentially that's what it's like.

972
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,550
So most people are not going to Hang

973
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,850
around with Federal Reserve people and have a

974
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,210
thousand dollar bottle of wine and I'm just

975
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,810
telling you what it's like, right?

976
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:02,690
so It's no big deal and Brandy and

977
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,850
these things all they are is it's like

978
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,470
it's a form of wine and to stop

979
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,950
the fermentation process While it's fermenting they when

980
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,090
they decide it's fermented enough.

981
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,770
They actually add a refined or distilled alcohol

982
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,990
to it just to The adding of the

983
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,530
extra alcohol stops the fermentation process because it

984
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,870
acts like a sterilizer against the existing You

985
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,430
know critters, yes, and that extra punch that's

986
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,210
why brandy has such a strong How did

987
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,550
we get into this talk about wine right

988
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,750
now?

989
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,150
Anyway, yeah, so I thought this is a

990
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,510
first that I have never heard what I

991
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,930
just said out and it's so freakin obvious

992
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,750
If you know, you know food and wine

993
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,910
and all that and I've never heard it.

994
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,890
So I figured I might as well say

995
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,910
it I'm glad you did Couple of those

996
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,830
for certainly were an eye-opener.

997
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,750
Oh my goodness Yeah, let's see is what

998
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,590
is that is vegan wine a scam Well,

999
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,630
you really can't have vegan wine because there's

1000
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,610
critters in it Yeah, veganism is a scam.

1001
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,570
Of course it is but it's a simple

1002
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,250
form of communicating Just like you use days

1003
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,250
of the week if you look at the

1004
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,250
vegans in the Vedix and all these people

1005
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,630
They were not and they were very low

1006
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,390
regard in the society They were fanatics and

1007
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,690
again when you in a Western culture when

1008
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,470
you hear veganism That's usually white people who

1009
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,810
don't know how to cook and they adopt

1010
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,510
that form of food preparation So when people

1011
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,130
say, oh your food tastes bad, they just

1012
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,770
say well instead of saying it's me too

1013
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,330
lazy how to cook I just say it's

1014
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:31,570
vegan.

1015
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,510
That's why I was vegetarian.

1016
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,470
That's why it tastes like that.

1017
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,230
What's wrong with you, right?

1018
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:34,990
So they turn it around.

1019
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,570
They're pretty you should know that already But

1020
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,890
there are some people including myself that do

1021
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,670
better without any animal products whatsoever at all

1022
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,610
Right, but I remember being in a vegan

1023
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,870
restaurant a long time ago and lady was

1024
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,990
the waitress I don't know if she was

1025
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,970
an actor in acting school practicing to be

1026
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,390
a waiter or a waiter that wanted to

1027
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,290
go to acting school but she was just

1028
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,490
talking too much and About how good the

1029
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,050
restaurant was and how there's nothing animal at

1030
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,110
all in here ever And I look at

1031
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,910
her shoes and she's got leather shoes on

1032
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,130
and I look at the wall I didn't

1033
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,110
I didn't get on I didn't talk to

1034
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,650
her about the shoes because that's too personal,

1035
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,550
right?

1036
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,790
And So I looked at the wall.

1037
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,750
I said, is this a new building?

1038
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,670
She goes, yeah, this is drywall or old

1039
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,350
mortar and plaster There's your those drywalls.

1040
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,530
Did you know drywalls uses alphabetic resins and

1041
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,570
animal glues in it?

1042
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,070
So this whole wall the whole place here

1043
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,830
is is surrounded with animal Glue and she

1044
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,410
just walked away and another waitress came These

1045
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,470
are idiots man.

1046
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,070
So yeah is it's all a scam It's

1047
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,490
all a scam.

1048
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,130
But the thing is, do you know what's

1049
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,650
going on?

1050
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,010
And why I had a conversation with someone

1051
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,470
once there's a few people and this one

1052
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,890
guy He just kept talking about how he's

1053
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,950
vegetarian at this but sharing that he gets

1054
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,770
off the call and the other person on

1055
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,970
the call Is it's like what an idiot

1056
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:52,990
and I'm like, why did you say of

1057
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:53,510
course he's an idiot?

1058
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,770
But why do you think he's an idiot?

1059
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,350
He says cuz this guy only wants to

1060
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,970
do is talk about vegetarianism and he doesn't

1061
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,790
know why I Said yeah, I never thought

1062
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,390
of it that way.

1063
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,290
That's a good point.

1064
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:09,760
Yeah Non GMO and all this other stuff.

1065
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,440
What are they?

1066
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,540
Well, GMO is another thing if you go

1067
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,680
to the shops in the markets even a

1068
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,600
farmer's market most of the veggie that you're

1069
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,880
gonna Be is GMO You know crossbreeding, but

1070
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,980
it hasn't been done Using glyphosate and other

1071
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,400
things, you know And even the Monsanto, they

1072
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,480
don't know what they're doing.

1073
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,220
They're just crossbreeding things and That are not

1074
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,960
food food grade You see because if you

1075
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,100
have food grade corn and non food grade

1076
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,660
corn guess which ones the bugs are gonna

1077
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,380
find tastier the the food grade corn so

1078
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,020
they just say just like if you remember

1079
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,620
if you've been in a big city and

1080
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,800
big Skyscrapers in the lobbies.

1081
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,960
They try to make them seem more natural.

1082
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,020
So they put or a decorative orange trees

1083
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,060
or tangerine Have you seen those decorative?

1084
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,740
Decorative fruit.

1085
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,960
So one day I was going through it

1086
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,700
was a place in Park Avenue and 46

1087
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,420
Street I think was a Seagram's building house.

1088
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,860
We're talking about alcohol again And they had

1089
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,780
these Orange trees in the middle New York

1090
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,160
City So I pick an orange and I'm

1091
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,320
like this thing as hard as a rock

1092
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,120
and I cut it open and there's no

1093
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,040
nothing inside It's just like it looked like

1094
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,780
a piece of yellow styrofoam, even though it

1095
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,360
was natural Yeah, because they're not meant to

1096
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,000
be eaten there.

1097
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,360
They're not food grade oranges.

1098
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,540
They're just decorative Right, you can't there's nothing

1099
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,060
there to eat.

1100
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,440
So there's there are plants that look like

1101
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,740
they're food grade and they're not and Those

1102
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,560
were probably some if you want to get

1103
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,220
into the history of botany how they developed

1104
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,420
or originated But also that's all their crossbreeding

1105
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,660
and doing they don't know what they're doing

1106
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,220
with genetics and all that I know that

1107
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,560
I see I used to believe that in

1108
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,020
the past.

1109
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,080
I was like, oh mesmerize Oh, they're doing

1110
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,640
this or they're doing that.

1111
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,100
No, they're not.

1112
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,140
I started meeting people.

1113
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,220
I worked in the fields I've discussed things

1114
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,260
with them as they don't know what they're

1115
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,520
doing.

1116
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,680
So you really don't know what you're doing.

1117
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,560
Do you this is not really?

1118
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,820
These are not new jacks.

1119
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,900
These are people have been working in the

1120
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,400
field for 25 30 40 years This is

1121
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,560
an experiment And all it all goes down

1122
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,740
to the occult You know the hidden stuff

1123
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,780
with everything that's being put out It's very

1124
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,140
simply just look at the paperwork.

1125
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,360
They put out the scientific paperwork read the

1126
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,320
conclusion first And at the conclusion tells you

1127
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,200
like we still haven't determined what the cause

1128
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,780
is or what this is, you know Why

1129
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,620
just look at just go back to the

1130
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,080
article of the paper look at the pictures

1131
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,840
and read the table of contents is bullshit

1132
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,600
So, but you they are being yeah that

1133
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,420
you have a severe downgrading across the board

1134
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,940
Categorically again, that's the word for tonight categorically

1135
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,040
Just low-quality crap all all to set

1136
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,700
you up because of the very reasons given

1137
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,910
in ancient Ritz, so Working real well.

1138
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,710
Well, it's like that discussion.

1139
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,930
We had that one time on regular food

1140
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,650
and then Where they call that that other

1141
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,930
stuff that they doesn't you know For love

1142
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:05,210
of me.

1143
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,410
I can't remember the name.

1144
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,730
No, what's that?

1145
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,370
Organic, yes, that's it.

1146
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,030
Thank you.

1147
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,530
Oh, that's for that's a bad play on

1148
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,790
human culture how they can allow The food

1149
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,510
to be poisoned and then we sell you

1150
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,170
non poisoned food Why don't you wake up

1151
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,870
and and go after the people that are

1152
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,710
poisoning your food?

1153
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,330
It's already admitted that they're people poisoning your

1154
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,130
food because it's our everyone admits that there's

1155
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,730
organic food.

1156
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,310
That's not poison People think it's good I

1157
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,890
think it's a very bad thing to have

1158
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,630
organic on the market because that shows that

1159
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,130
you as a society you're you're screwed We

1160
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,290
sunk to an all-time low there.

1161
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,690
Why have why not?

1162
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:43,970
Why not all of it be good?

1163
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,490
What kind of a sick person but allow

1164
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,690
it?

1165
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,810
I'm not talking about the sick people that

1166
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,450
are putting it on the market the farmers

1167
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,190
and the Marketing people in the delivery truck

1168
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,430
drivers.

1169
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,550
I'm talking about the actual public at large

1170
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,230
Why aren't they setting up a scenario like

1171
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,170
the end of the Frankenstein movie when they

1172
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,970
show up with pitchforks and torches to the

1173
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:03,450
Frankenstein?

1174
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,670
March down the street or the heavy protest

1175
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,150
or the chanting or whatever is needed, you

1176
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,190
know Those space heaters don't need much.

1177
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,430
No, they just play just plug them in

1178
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,310
they give off heat and They'll complain when

1179
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,930
their switch doesn't work or they have a

1180
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,770
kink in their cord.

1181
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,510
It's an accord.

1182
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:22,910
Yeah.

1183
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:23,750
Yeah.

1184
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:24,250
Yeah.

1185
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,110
Uh-huh space heaters No, so they're oh

1186
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,230
amazing Absolutely amazing.

1187
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,390
I shake my head every time I go

1188
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,470
in there Anyway, it's just and by the

1189
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,870
way, there still is no rational and informative

1190
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,310
discussion You might think you're being informed by

1191
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,090
the way out there on the rectangle, especially

1192
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,190
or even in print Not much.

1193
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,790
The best you're going to do is find

1194
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,490
some Unsolicited history, which means like history that's

1195
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,730
not put in front of you by these

1196
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,430
institutions You know if you go do research

1197
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,290
like, you know, for example An interesting field

1198
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:00,010
to look at is like nursing in the

1199
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,250
19th century the field of nursing Great.

1200
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,770
Well, look at those old books and you'll

1201
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,030
be like wow, man.

1202
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,890
I got to learn some of these techniques,

1203
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,230
you know So, you know and if you

1204
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,030
look at you know various, you know subjects

1205
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,670
But on the periphery the stuff that was

1206
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,050
not included in any university agenda You're going

1207
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,630
to find some good reference material, but in

1208
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,930
terms of what's being blasted, you know Or

1209
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,030
put, you know up and being amplified on

1210
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,530
the rectangle University the media or whatever is

1211
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,210
just garbage Categorically across the board and it

1212
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,910
doesn't mean that if you were dropped in

1213
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,430
an infinitely large landfill You couldn't survive you

1214
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,050
still have to dig around and find edible

1215
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:40,930
garbage, right?

1216
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,450
Right, so people's curiosity and information and things

1217
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,090
is surviving and moving along on this edible,

1218
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,910
you know garbage, basically the coprofagia is one

1219
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,070
way to do it or just like when

1220
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,810
I used to Do more sonic events.

1221
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,270
I was like dude every time I talk

1222
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,030
to you It's like I feel like I

1223
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,290
want you know You want to go eat

1224
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,690
out of a garbage can when I'm giving

1225
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,450
you a three-star meal why you know,

1226
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,610
so yeah So I don't you know You

1227
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,950
can imagine telling someone I'm going to take

1228
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,790
you to a three-star Michelin restaurant and

1229
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,150
they're like on the way there They can't

1230
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,410
you can't stop them from eating out of

1231
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,290
a garbage can after a while.

1232
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,810
You're like now I'd rather just go I'll

1233
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,150
go sit neat alone so There's many levels

1234
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,870
and that garbage can reference is what you're

1235
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,930
going to find across the board categorically again

1236
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:34,110
University the doctor's office the courts Yep, especially

1237
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,550
the religious institutions And I suppose at this

1238
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,530
point we should let people know that if

1239
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,630
they want to call in on Skype uncommon

1240
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:45,650
radio Uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com

1241
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,830
and if you want to use your celly

1242
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,850
phone and call in The area code is

1243
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,130
nine two zero seven eight five twenty forty

1244
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,530
eight And with that we can proceed Yeah

1245
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,870
Well, it's what we've been on for about

1246
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,210
an hour.

1247
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,610
Maybe you can make it a short one,

1248
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,490
too I usually don't get that kind of

1249
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:04,950
input.

1250
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,550
I don't know If it's just people or

1251
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,770
rather just sit back and be entertained and

1252
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,530
like kind of like a circus bear, you

1253
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,750
know It's then do I'm going to stand

1254
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,270
on a ball and juggle for you and

1255
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,650
we got 16 in the stream right now

1256
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:26,730
Okay, well eat in the chat Yeah again

1257
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,530
the metaphor for just giving someone a boost

1258
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,610
is where it's at I You know, I

1259
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,130
could I'd like to go to there are

1260
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,710
two different ways to go one is to

1261
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,450
write some pretty good stuff all summed up

1262
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,870
together or the other way is to just

1263
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,410
give you know cursory outline on the beginnings

1264
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:48,790
of any subject and Right, I think the

1265
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,210
latter one is the way to go.

1266
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:56,670
Mm-hmm Well, yeah of all the And

1267
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,410
here's the thing out of the past couple

1268
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,470
years that I've been discussing these things I've

1269
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,470
only had really just two or three or

1270
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,630
four people That from the public at large

1271
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,690
that have come forward and say hey, I

1272
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,870
need to learn more about this Not only

1273
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:10,990
do I want to I feel like I

1274
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,130
need to Right, right.

1275
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,690
That's and that's why I keep saying there's

1276
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,930
only three or four people out there, right?

1277
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:17,990
Right.

1278
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,310
See so even though there might be 16

1279
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,370
on the stream and 10 and chat or

1280
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,730
might get 500 emails a year Or something

1281
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,250
like that.

1282
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,090
Mm-hmm.

1283
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,710
It's still only three people four people that

1284
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,650
are really willing So I'm not going to

1285
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,210
go out and go to the extra You

1286
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,570
know ten steps to put together You know

1287
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,790
a body of work brain that they could

1288
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,850
use it's best to let you know most

1289
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,030
most of the people in the chat and

1290
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,650
on the streams and on The emails are

1291
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:51,070
just armchair yeah, there's a lot of There's

1292
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,350
a lot of stuff going on.

1293
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:52,570
Yeah.

1294
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,530
Well, I'm eating better and I'm noticing how

1295
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,170
to keep time and all this but yeah,

1296
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,030
that's fine Good But there's not a lot

1297
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,550
of there's there's no seriousness in the world

1298
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,590
right now about this stuff and in the

1299
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,910
end on the other On one hand, it's

1300
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:07,630
like oh, yeah.

1301
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,830
Yeah, it's too bad.

1302
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,590
But on the other hand, it's fine What

1303
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,110
are you going to do?

1304
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,990
You're gonna you know, like we mentioned the

1305
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,550
Joseph Newman earlier But by the way, you

1306
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,450
can do the Joseph Newman you can develop

1307
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,190
a machine Let's say or an apparatus or

1308
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,730
apparati right the plural Yeah, that uses electricity

1309
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,770
properly and you'll notice that it's not like

1310
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,370
spilling water out of a bucket as long

1311
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:33,850
as you don't Publicly verse that you want

1312
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,170
to vocal or vocalize that you are doing

1313
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,650
this to make everything better You'll be fine

1314
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,890
with it, right?

1315
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,230
and then eventually you still will notice because

1316
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,550
you're in the early states of developing that

1317
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,070
and Just you know manifesting it.

1318
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,370
It's still cheaper to use up the power

1319
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,730
that you get off the grid Ultimately because

1320
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,530
put it this way in order to make

1321
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,410
a Newman machine you're gonna need a few

1322
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,350
hundred pounds of copper That's almost a quarter

1323
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:00,750
of a mile.

1324
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:01,710
Yeah.

1325
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,330
Well it is.

1326
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,570
Yeah.

1327
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,470
Yeah I mean you have somebody else minded

1328
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:04,950
for you.

1329
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,950
Yeah, it's gonna cost you Well in the

1330
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,690
form of wire, you don't want to get

1331
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,490
raw copper you because making the wire is

1332
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,850
the hard part And most copper is they've

1333
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,410
reserved for just deep underground anyway mining because

1334
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,930
they don't want it easy To show that

1335
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,530
it's easy to get near the surface, but

1336
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,890
I would suggest that When you start working

1337
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,570
with these devices and all that you're gonna

1338
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,330
say, oh man There was it was way

1339
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,510
cheaper to be on the grid.

1340
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,510
Yeah.

1341
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,510
So what's your motivation to make the world

1342
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,130
a better place?

1343
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,690
Well, it better not be So then what's

1344
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,850
your motivation you see?

1345
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,630
Right, so it's the same thing with a

1346
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,890
lot of the stuff that you can get

1347
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,630
serious and that I brought forward through the

1348
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,290
years You know, no, there's no one to

1349
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,470
really talk to about it No, and there's

1350
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,270
no one that really cares enough about it

1351
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:54,930
either so either way it's fine, but Yeah

1352
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,130
But there's there's just still not much going

1353
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,630
on I would say to this point the

1354
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,490
Greek is still just a circus bear entertaining

1355
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,330
people and Doesn't mean that entertainment does it

1356
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,950
you know, you can't take it seriously you

1357
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,870
go, you know Look at Star Wars conventions

1358
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,350
and stuff like that.

1359
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,510
They still buy the hat and the t

1360
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,050
-shirt Maybe I should put the hats and

1361
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:21,530
t-shirts That'd be an interesting catchphrase In

1362
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,570
essence look at this point now either way

1363
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,110
it's it's okay because What you're really waiting

1364
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,530
on is just time to pass And time

1365
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,150
is just a series of events whether you're

1366
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,450
measuring it With the Pope's work schedule the

1367
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,530
wind-up toy or using the luminaries the

1368
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,670
stars the Sun and the moon or just

1369
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,630
in any event You know like someone walking

1370
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,150
climbing a flight of stairs as a way

1371
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:46,090
to keep time When you just waiting for

1372
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,170
these events to pass and certain knowledge to

1373
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:52,510
come into fruition that everyone acknowledges That's that's

1374
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,510
all that's really left.

1375
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:58,270
Mm-hmm Well, of course, you know in

1376
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,350
the mop-up crew, but I can't include

1377
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,330
them in what you have to do You

1378
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,210
know you whoever is listening brain.

1379
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,410
You're just gonna be that's why I have

1380
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,230
mentioned several times tonight how are you doing

1381
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,350
with your food clothing and shelter and Finding

1382
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,790
out what the human what your body is

1383
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,610
really because your mind is subject to your

1384
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,930
body you know if you do eliminate the

1385
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,410
body you have no mind and go into

1386
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,990
unconscious state and once you pursue the food

1387
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:28,470
clothing shelter quality improvement and discovering what the

1388
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:32,870
body mind and Soul or breath is you

1389
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,790
will find out everything there is to know

1390
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,850
that you can know at this stage at

1391
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:45,170
least You're also waiting on archaeologists, by the

1392
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,630
way, yes Yeah, you know those people spend

1393
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,650
their life their life in ruins, you know,

1394
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:57,670
yeah That's what you're waiting on why well

1395
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,650
Thanks, it's all the stuff that yeah, right.

1396
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:02,970
It's all the stuff that you can get

1397
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,590
access to then you could say I told

1398
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,890
you so Right what people don't say I

1399
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,910
told you so unless something is second Seconded

1400
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,070
right someone says something and it's naysayers It'll

1401
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,290
be too speculative when it's confirmed with evidence.

1402
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:18,370
What do they usually say?

1403
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,650
I told you so yeah every time Mm

1404
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:30,290
-hmm, so that's pretty much it.

1405
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:32,650
I hope you know so get your popcorn

1406
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,690
and ask her and you get it I

1407
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,810
hope I entertain people tonight Cuz I don't

1408
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,410
know what else to do so Well, we

1409
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:44,590
can do whatever we feel we'd like to

1410
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,530
Yeah, there's there's tons of stuff to get

1411
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,090
into and to do that you can make

1412
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:56,510
useful in your life today You know, and

1413
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,810
those are the things that I'd like to

1414
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,350
touch on generally and specifically to you know

1415
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,010
within a certain depth Right.

1416
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:07,410
So, you know water food clothing shelter Your

1417
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,010
history, you know because people are going to

1418
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:13,330
eventually come across through conversation or contemplation Why

1419
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,330
they believe what what they say they or

1420
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,030
think they believe in So how to examine

1421
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,950
those things and you're going to be no

1422
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,970
matter how objective you want to be There's

1423
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,570
still going to be elements of subjectivity You

1424
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,910
know things that you are specifically censored to

1425
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,310
that You can't see even though they're in

1426
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,690
front of you your tastes your likes and

1427
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,990
dislikes Always get in the way.

1428
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:40,230
So examine those as well You know So

1429
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,830
and the time left is relatively short and

1430
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,950
I say relatively meaning, you know to the

1431
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,870
scope of what we how we understand things

1432
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:47,970
How long things last?

1433
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,650
and How do you finish off a conversation

1434
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,230
from Greek speak watch the Middle East, right?

1435
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,750
I haven't been pounding or hammering on the

1436
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,030
Middle East too much But there is so

1437
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,090
much going on that no one is noticing

1438
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,230
and I mean no one Because I look

1439
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,590
at the emails in the chat and I'm

1440
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,330
not putting stuff in there to bring it

1441
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,390
forward and I say there's no One's no

1442
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:14,050
one's researching really, you know And I don't

1443
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,150
mean researching as you know, you set specific

1444
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,250
time aside and you you look You know

1445
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,550
and to see to find something and whether

1446
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,570
you found something is successful and whether you

1447
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,990
didn't is unsuccessful Not that kind of research.

1448
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,930
I'm just talking about are you paying attention

1449
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,370
if you're paying attention to what's going on

1450
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:30,930
in the Middle East?

1451
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,870
Right out there is a lot of setting

1452
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,010
up going on Major setup.

1453
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,310
It's no different.

1454
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,230
Let me just give an analogy Let's say

1455
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,730
you have an open public park like a

1456
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,870
sheep's meadow You ever see some parks have

1457
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,350
like a baseball field or something.

1458
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,990
Mm-hmm And you know for all your

1459
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,010
life you pass by or however long you've

1460
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,110
been in that particular locale and you see

1461
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,030
occasionally You know, they have a baseball game

1462
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,610
or something out there but one day you

1463
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:58,410
see all these trucks parked outside and they're

1464
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:01,590
unloading all this grid and scaffolding and it's

1465
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:05,150
like Okay, there's like a hundred people assembling

1466
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,550
something on this field something is about to

1467
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,170
go down And they assemble it and then

1468
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,690
it's like a big Venue all of a

1469
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,650
sudden for a big concert, you know, and

1470
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,590
and everyone in the country knows that it's

1471
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,490
happening there That's the metaphor of what's happening

1472
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,790
in the Middle East right now All the

1473
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,630
trucks are parking and ready to unload and

1474
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,430
no one's noticing anything, you know And I've

1475
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,430
noticed I give that analogy because at one

1476
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,330
point I lived a near one of a

1477
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:34,710
very large park in a city and The

1478
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,830
same exact thing happened.

1479
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,430
It was I think dr.

1480
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:38,930
John.

1481
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:39,670
Do you remember him?

1482
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,310
He was a Jazz ish kind of rock

1483
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,270
Dr. John was it?

1484
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:45,090
Yes.

1485
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:45,610
Yeah.

1486
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,610
Yes Yeah, I played a bunch of music.

1487
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:49,130
Yeah.

1488
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,750
Yeah, he wore the glasses in the hat.

1489
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,670
He had a mustache.

1490
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,950
I covered his face and And it was

1491
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,390
that it was a big deal and I

1492
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,810
noticed for two or three days or seven

1493
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,770
And no one was saying anything until like

1494
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,630
the very day.

1495
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,250
We're like 10,000 people showed up to

1496
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,630
watch it Right, you know, I was like

1497
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,490
wait something's about to go down over here

1498
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,350
I mean, they're pulling wires out in the

1499
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,710
middle of the field that are as thick

1500
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:16,990
as my arm Okay from yeah, so there's

1501
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:21,790
something going on here Um Let's see.

1502
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,770
Yeah, this is our keep an eye on

1503
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:23,990
that.

1504
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,500
Yeah Here's a dr.

1505
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,440
John song.

1506
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,420
Let's see if it comes out.

1507
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:41,040
Well There

1508
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:50,240
you go I Don't know if that sounds

1509
01:04:50,240 --> 01:05:27,260
okay Oh

1510
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,520
There's a blast from the past Not my

1511
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,380
style of music, but yeah, it sounds good,

1512
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,000
but not good enough for me to say

1513
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,040
that's what I want to listen to right,

1514
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,300
so Yeah, nothing on the emails I've got

1515
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,320
everything turned on in terms of accessible accessories

1516
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,740
Yeah, but you know the I didn't hear

1517
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,240
from Sam.

1518
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,480
There seems to be a customary thing to

1519
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,660
do thing with Sam Mm-hmm.

1520
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,380
I Turned it on about a half hour

1521
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,100
before we came on.

1522
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:12,780
I said, oh wow.

1523
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,740
Okay, it's it's called accommodating, you know I'm

1524
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:24,740
on just accommodating So Yeah, other than that,

1525
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,340
you know, I don't at this I think

1526
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:31,860
I need to be provoked more about You

1527
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,700
know moving forward on categorically speaking on things.

1528
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,560
Oh, that sounds like a plan Yeah So

1529
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,740
if any but if you got questions or

1530
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,360
whatever, I mean, I'm Burr I could burst

1531
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,040
at this I'm bursting at the seams of

1532
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,640
things that I'd like to discuss and say

1533
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,260
and bring forward But I think it's best

1534
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,880
to accommodate who's listening And it's not that

1535
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,600
I know everything about or anything that could

1536
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,820
be asked but I assure you that Anything

1537
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,780
that can be asked has been asked before

1538
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,980
and if it's done been done before why

1539
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,680
not do it again, right?

1540
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,180
Sorry Yeah, and the thing is again, it's

1541
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:12,460
really shocking to told you so you can

1542
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:17,500
prove it the the human mind the spirit

1543
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,480
is easily impressed with quantity and they can't

1544
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,740
recognize quality still and The reason why I

1545
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,480
say this is how many websites or pages

1546
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,140
are there on the web on the on

1547
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,240
the rectangle on the internet?

1548
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,840
billions and how much of it is Very

1549
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,320
very very little so little it just shows

1550
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,040
you what human kind and woman kind Does

1551
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,940
or mankind and woman that does with what

1552
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,580
they're given?

1553
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,300
You could look at the agricultural right?

1554
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,880
They'll poison everything and it's okay, and they'll

1555
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,160
say well, this is not poisoned.

1556
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,520
There's organic Okay, you look at the rectangle

1557
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,000
the internet.

1558
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,080
It's just garbage and but this is not

1559
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,440
garbage.

1560
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,760
You have some reference material here, right They're

1561
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:08,340
really just immunology across the board so yeah,

1562
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,560
and the scientists are just a joke academia

1563
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:15,060
is just a circus again a show and

1564
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,140
if anyone does want to get into Various

1565
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,700
aspects of you know, where the basis of

1566
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,340
the system that is in the world today,

1567
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,460
which is the Greek You know, they call

1568
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,760
the Greek world Greco-Roman or Judeo-christian

1569
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,819
And when you say Judeo-christian, it's like

1570
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,660
basically Hellenistic Hellenistic System if you study the

1571
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,140
classic Greek stuff, which is the latter Period,

1572
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,060
let's say that there's several golden ages.

1573
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,680
I say at least two in Greece but

1574
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,819
the one that everyone knows about is ancient

1575
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:47,300
Greek the Philosophy that's come forward in the

1576
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,399
science and all that spoke very negatively of

1577
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:54,529
established academia at the time Yeah, I don't

1578
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,290
need to say that again do I know

1579
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,310
so all the stuff that been the academics

1580
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,510
are holding up as being critical And acclaimed

1581
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:04,630
is was actually speaking poorly of them Just

1582
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:08,470
like for example the Christian pastors ministers Whatever

1583
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,950
you want to call them Pope's priests They

1584
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,149
hold up the Bible that book condemns them

1585
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,370
what they're doing everything not some of what

1586
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:17,729
they're doing everything that they're doing The same

1587
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,529
with the rabbis the same with the Muslims

1588
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:22,490
Islam or whatever you want to call it

1589
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:25,250
with the Buddhists and their own works condemn

1590
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,069
them the same with the quote-unquote government

1591
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,950
There is no one in the government that

1592
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,910
knows any law or follows any law or

1593
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,670
anything The codes or the statutes that they

1594
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,950
or their Constitution How's your Constitution today, right?

1595
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:39,609
Right.

1596
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,390
How's your kind of constitutional today?

1597
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,210
The funniest thing is when you bring up

1598
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,569
the Constitution to an attorney, it's a bad

1599
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:47,890
thing.

1600
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,450
They'll say are you constitutionalist?

1601
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,029
Well, you got to just put a list

1602
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,050
in the back of it some and it's

1603
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,390
bad.

1604
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,530
Yeah Well, there's the the church people do

1605
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,550
it, too.

1606
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:02,050
Well, they Any time now that you even

1607
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,910
try to go that way, you know just

1608
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:07,390
for conversation, no, you know, it's demonized now

1609
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:10,130
There's a lot more in a sense I

1610
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:12,890
demonize it because it the first 17 words

1611
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,770
talks about establishing justice.

1612
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,490
I'm right And but I would just use

1613
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,290
their own stuff against them is the best

1614
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:23,510
way to do it, you know They have

1615
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,010
like lights right now, you know search lights

1616
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:29,210
on helicopters and planes and Adam For 50

1617
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,930
years that are what 50 million candle what

1618
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,310
they can only burn for a few minutes

1619
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,350
something up there.

1620
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,870
Yeah Yes, something high or five million or

1621
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,090
something.

1622
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,370
It's I know it's more than five because

1623
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,490
you could buy a five million candle What

1624
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,430
for you know now?

1625
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:44,930
Handheld, yeah There are strategic lights and what

1626
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,510
they found out is if they point them

1627
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,870
at people at close range meaning like Ten

1628
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:52,350
yards or so it could damage your eyes,

1629
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,210
even if your eyes are closed Yes, that's

1630
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,190
how strong the light is.

1631
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:56,510
All right.

1632
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,570
So when you're approached with that, what do

1633
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:58,790
you do?

1634
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:59,950
You hold up a mirror, right?

1635
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,350
What does that do right?

1636
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,030
It just aims it right back This is

1637
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,810
the same with smart meters and all this

1638
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:07,930
radiological stuff.

1639
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,010
I call it radiological because essentially it's low

1640
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:13,770
-level radiation Just let them put a smart

1641
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,130
meter up Just go get a mirror and

1642
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,550
put it up against the wall on the

1643
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,610
inside and the mirror facing them smart meter

1644
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,730
So you have the back of the mirror

1645
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:20,450
facing the room?

1646
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,510
You just cover it with something.

1647
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:22,290
Mm-hmm.

1648
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:27,910
That just sends it right back So anyway,

1649
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:33,190
it's just a Ridiculous situation across the board,

1650
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,230
but you know food clothing and shelter spend

1651
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,650
a little more time, you know it's good

1652
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,330
stuff, but learn how to prepare it and

1653
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:44,170
Wear some good clothes Get the best clothing

1654
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,250
you want to afford, you know memorize.

1655
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,990
I didn't say can't afford want to afford

1656
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:53,410
because and Shelter keep your shelter clean and

1657
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:58,550
in good order, you know, and and Just

1658
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:04,070
go day by day Watch what develops Definitely

1659
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,690
good advice.

1660
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,950
I mean, there's no movement.

1661
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,330
There's nothing you're going to do That's going

1662
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,070
to change anything from the way that it's

1663
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:14,190
been set to be so even if you

1664
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:17,070
pretty much established that and past sonic events

1665
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,310
and oh Yeah, well it not even pretty

1666
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,550
clear Events are a little boost or a

1667
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,130
hint to go look around and you'll see

1668
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,430
great Again, then just like I started off

1669
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,870
tonight Anything and everything you see whether you

1670
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,410
approve or not or whether it's good or

1671
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,850
bad is to preserve the monetary system So

1672
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,410
when the you know, they have the twin

1673
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,270
towers turning into dust and they tell you

1674
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,870
it's Arab With box cutters that did that

1675
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,610
that is to preserve the money system when

1676
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,090
they tell you there's a missile going to

1677
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:49,510
Hawaii It's preserve the money system All right

1678
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,190
When they tell you there's was the last

1679
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:53,350
one missile going to Hawaii was and then

1680
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,110
that the government shut down You know, it's

1681
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,650
like let him let him shut it down

1682
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,030
and when it's shut down shut it down

1683
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,110
some more Yeah, just keep shutting it down.

1684
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:01,710
It doesn't matter.

1685
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,510
These are you know?

1686
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,590
Something back to school It doesn't matter the

1687
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,550
you know And here's the thing the ridiculousness

1688
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,630
about the issue of the government what the

1689
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,990
government's do anywhere in the world Where do

1690
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,070
these people come from that are running your

1691
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,590
government's?

1692
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:20,110
Alpha Centauri Mars Venus, where are they coming

1693
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:20,410
from?

1694
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,650
Yeah, they're coming from the same crop.

1695
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:27,750
You could take Joe Schmoe bus driver you

1696
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,930
know common and how or Dick and Harry

1697
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:34,170
it doesn't matter Put them up there that

1698
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,530
you're gonna be in the same exact position.

1699
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:44,950
Yeah So Yeah, and it's not it's not

1700
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,730
a matter of being critical it's a matter

1701
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:52,510
of being objective so It just depends on

1702
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,470
what you want to dwell in at this

1703
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,610
point I'd rather not be in an anyone's

1704
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:02,570
armpit So Or crotch or whatever they want

1705
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,670
to call it You know some unfavorable part

1706
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,230
if an opponent grabs you and puts a

1707
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:08,590
squeeze on you with a certain unfavorable part

1708
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,210
of the body That's what's going on right

1709
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:10,430
now.

1710
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:16,330
You know getting the human affairs That's what

1711
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:20,210
they don't yeah, and try to rationalize things

1712
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:24,910
and have good thoughts Yeah, and and be

1713
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:28,990
realistic Yeah, you pretty much most of you

1714
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,250
will be here tomorrow and the next day

1715
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,110
and so on what are you gonna?

1716
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,110
Do with it to up the quality of

1717
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,990
being here to put yourself in a sense

1718
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:35,270
of?

1719
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,910
Euphoria, you know when you have a meal

1720
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,870
does it make you feel really good?

1721
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,830
you know when you put on a jacket

1722
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,670
or a pair of shoes or socks or

1723
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:46,710
or Drawers or or sleep in the bed

1724
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,390
anything that you put on your body does

1725
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:49,690
it make you feel good?

1726
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,650
Right do you feel good about the place

1727
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:53,510
that you dwell in?

1728
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,270
All right all these things just up the

1729
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:58,190
quality of it little by little and if

1730
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,310
it's something that you can't change immediately Well,

1731
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,190
then just look like what you can't change

1732
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:05,710
immediately to make it better Doesn't mean discarding

1733
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,990
it or replacing it right?

1734
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:11,730
right a Very simple way to make things

1735
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,170
feel better by the way is like quote

1736
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,390
-unquote washing a car something as trivial as

1737
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:19,090
that if you have what's called a Engine

1738
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,630
driven, what's not called an engine driven wagon?

1739
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,190
Just keeping it clean just feels better.

1740
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,770
I noticed that myself sometimes.

1741
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:27,150
I'm like.

1742
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:28,890
I'm just gonna stop I got too many

1743
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:29,710
things on my plate.

1744
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:32,550
I'm just gonna go wash the car It's

1745
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:36,370
an hour Basically that is just taking time

1746
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,750
out from anything else you could have been

1747
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,450
doing and you just feel good at the

1748
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:42,410
end of it Driving around in a shiny

1749
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:45,170
new you know shiny old ride mm-hmm

1750
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,310
So something as simple as that is just

1751
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:56,480
an example Instead of it having just be

1752
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,640
this rote ritual that you know people get

1753
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:05,510
used to doing Okay, what do you think?

1754
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,610
That's like a plan there.

1755
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:09,010
Yep.

1756
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,330
We did a We did a pretty good

1757
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:14,230
chunk there yes Anything comes up.

1758
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:14,670
Thank you.

1759
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,370
I got a feeling for the schedule that

1760
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,950
you're on I know that what they call

1761
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,170
Tuesday nights is good for you for being

1765
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,270
probably have Sam next week, or we'll do

1766
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,530
another one Okay, any time any time is

1767
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:37,350
good Well, you know the schedule so yeah,

1768
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:38,530
I've got a feeling for it.

1769
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:40,230
I don't know I think I've got it

1770
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,750
down too much I know that it works
