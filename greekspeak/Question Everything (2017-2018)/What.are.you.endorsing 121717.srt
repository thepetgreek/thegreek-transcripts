1
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,330
Bring us in.

2
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,560
And there we go folks, we're live with

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,120
Greek and myself.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,240
And how are you doing today Greek?

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh okay, still here on this rock.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,460
Yeah, I figured we'd just do a quick

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,180
sonic event.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
It seems like when Sam comes on this

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
tends to go for hours, they don't have

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,100
to be.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,600
You and I were just speaking about the

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,220
money thing.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,220
Yes.

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,020
And maybe I should just recap that because

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,640
I wanted to just get into a little

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,000
bit of seasonal stuff for anyone that's listening.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,140
But here's the thing folks, I want to

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,340
take it from the top because I recently

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,420
met someone, not recently, a few months ago

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,900
on the internet.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,820
And I said, how did you find out

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,360
about the Greek?

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,960
And he says, well, I was going to

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,860
this coffee shop.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,640
It was like the office where everybody meets.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,180
Sure.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,480
And one guy said, you know, I've been

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,720
studying the money system for 20 years and

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,480
I heard of this guy called the Greek

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,740
and I listened to him and in 15

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,960
minutes I finally got it.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,100
Right?

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,460
Wow.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
So he got it.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,280
But most people don't and it's not your

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,900
fault because most people are subject to the

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,640
censorship.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,280
And if it's not meant for you to

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,760
hear it or know it or acknowledge it,

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,660
you're never going to get it anyway.

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,200
It doesn't matter if they drill a hole

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,780
in your head and put it in there

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,640
physically, you're still not going to get it.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,680
Just think about what, you know, the chip,

45
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,660
you've heard of the mind control chips and

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,240
all that stuff?

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah.

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,920
Why do you think that program hasn't been

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
put online yet?

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,880
I mean it is in certain cases, it's

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,760
experimental, but why do you think that hasn't

52
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,840
been affected or super successful?

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,080
Because it isn't time yet.

54
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,640
Well, yes, and also the cosmic censorship is

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,220
still strong.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Right.

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,300
So even if someone is trying to mind

58
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,660
control you or whatever, it doesn't work because

59
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,980
the censorship takes precedence and that comes from

60
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,400
the gods.

61
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,740
And they can censor anyone on any subject.

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,540
Right?

63
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,240
Right.

64
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll give you an example on how subjects

65
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,240
work.

66
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,600
I was recently speaking to someone on the

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,800
phone.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
They work in the health industry.

69
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,820
And I brought up, they're a cross country,

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,500
and I brought up a few things.

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,480
And their secretary or their, you know, they

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,780
said, well, they're not available.

73
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,740
They're in a class right now, teaching a

74
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,000
class.

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
I'll speak to you.

76
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,020
And I brought up a few things.

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,100
I said, well, I'm not technical.

78
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,140
I'm just spiritual.

79
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,620
I don't do technical stuff.

80
00:02:59,720 --> 00:02:59,880
Right?

81
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,680
So what I told her was, oh, I

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:02,980
see.

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,760
Well, I said, can I get – can

84
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,420
I say a few personal things maybe to

85
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,580
you?

86
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:08,840
Certainly.

87
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Or will you be offended?

88
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
That was what I told her.

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,840
Right.

90
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Yeah.

91
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,480
And she said, no, you can't.

92
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,980
I said, this is what – there's no

93
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,060
such thing as I'm technical or I'm spiritual

94
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,880
or I'm into this or I'm into that

95
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,560
because, you know, what you're into is obvious.

96
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,900
You know, like someone like Yo-Yo Ma

97
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,520
could pick up the cello at 5 and

98
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,040
be a concert instrumentalist at the age of

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,700
8 is not what I'm talking about.

100
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
This is also given to you.

101
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,140
But this chick said she was not technical.

102
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,440
So I said, okay, let me just tell

103
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,340
you a little bit about yourself.

104
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
I have never met you.

105
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,020
I've been on the phone only for three

106
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,660
minutes, and I'll tell you about yourself.

107
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,620
And she goes, oh, I'd like to hear

108
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,800
that.

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,060
And I said, well, at some point in

110
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,760
your life, probably around your formative years or

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,620
just after your formative years, around the age

112
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,500
of 8 or 9, you were around some

113
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,760
adults and you heard some adults say they're

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,180
not into technical stuff, and this adult happened

115
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,020
to be either a loved one or a

116
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,160
relative or someone that was considered in respect

117
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,260
and in honor, and they got away with

118
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,360
saying that, and you decided that you're going

119
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,820
to go ahead with your life saying that

120
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,000
same thing because now you know you don't

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,360
have to get into exercising the mind in

122
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,720
that area, and because as a child you

123
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,840
realized an adult that was considered honorable or

124
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,660
recognizable or respectable said it, it was fine

125
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,060
for them, it'll be fine for you, and

126
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,860
you took that on to yourself as a

127
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,180
crutch.

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
And she was really, really quiet, and I

129
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,500
said, are you still there?

130
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,640
She goes, yeah, I'm still here.

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,080
And she was just really, really quiet, just

132
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,880
could not carry on the conversation with me

133
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,180
anymore.

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
And I was like, is there anything else

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,740
you want to have for Dr. So-and

136
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:40,900
-so?

137
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
And I said, no, that'll be it for

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,260
now.

139
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,640
And I said, did I give you a

140
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,380
lot to think about?

141
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,300
She said, too much.

142
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,100
But I said, don't worry, once we hang

143
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,500
up, you won't remember a word that I

144
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:50,800
said.

145
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,720
And I spoke, I called back about a

146
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,440
month later and asked, remember that conversation?

147
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,280
Yeah, I remember I spoke to you.

148
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,500
Do you remember what we spoke about, maybe

149
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,240
something that was a little penetrating?

150
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,720
And she goes, no, I don't.

151
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,460
Power of suggestion?

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,820
No, no, it's just, remember Men in Black,

153
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,000
the little red flashing thing?

154
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,540
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,160
Neuralizer, yeah?

156
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,200
Right, the neuralizer, yes, yes.

157
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,380
You will be neuralized if it's not meant

158
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,680
for you.

159
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
So back to the money system.

160
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,340
It's really, really, really simple.

161
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,380
There is an odd – before I start

162
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,880
off on how simple it is, here are

163
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
conspiracy theories.

164
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,180
Here's a conspiracy theory.

165
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,280
There's a legislative body of the government that

166
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,940
makes legislation with a quasi-government agency to

167
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,960
collect taxes to fund government actions and government

168
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,620
things, right?

169
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,320
That's a conspiracy theory.

170
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,720
In fact, that's not what is happening at

171
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,040
all.

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,780
Basically what I just said in regular English

173
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,500
would be you have bodies of government that

174
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,720
make laws with another quasi, meaning it's not

175
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,620
really a body of government, known as taxing

176
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,400
authorities, agencies all over the world.

177
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,920
And they levy taxes on people and people

178
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,560
in themselves in their minds think that they

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
need to do this in order to pay

180
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,480
for government services and things and roads and

181
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,020
whatever and the military.

182
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,000
And I'm telling you that is a conspiracy

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,040
theory, conspiracy meaning because there's more than one

184
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,400
body or individual doing it, but it's a

185
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
theory because that's not how it works at

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,440
all.

187
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
What is going on is – let's just

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,660
take it from the top.

189
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,300
Whenever you're living in a credit-based economy,

190
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,480
which is 99 percent of all the countries

191
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
in the world, if not more than that,

192
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,720
there is no money.

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,760
So you're living in a society under a

194
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
jurisdiction of a certain government.

195
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,440
No matter where you go, even if you're

196
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,160
a tourist, if you ask someone, do you

197
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
know what country you're in?

198
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,560
Yes, they'll tell you usually.

199
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,540
And then this is, well, who's in charge

200
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,700
here?

201
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,400
And they'll usually refer to some government entity,

202
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,820
right, whether it's a monarchy, socialism, republic, democracy,

203
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
communists, whatever, right?

204
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,940
They'll either mention an individual or a corporate

205
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,880
body politic, right, always.

206
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,720
In order for those corporate body politics to

207
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,460
exist, they have to have several things.

208
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,580
One of the things is a post office,

209
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,980
right, a way to move the post.

210
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,780
Another thing they have is a military, which

211
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,240
is not necessary really.

212
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,740
And another thing that they have is the

213
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,640
ability to control and issue currency or money.

214
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,540
All the countries have lost that ability and

215
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,200
they were put under a credit system.

216
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,480
So when you are in a country, it

217
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,880
puts the authorities, no matter who they are,

218
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,400
in a quandary for you to be there

219
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,560
to do work because there's no way to

220
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,080
pay you.

221
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,720
So they have to wrap you up in

222
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,780
all these unconscionable contracts or deeds, you know,

223
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,420
birth certificates, registration forms, literally wrap you up

224
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,820
legally.

225
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,140
So if you ever did anything and demanded

226
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,040
payment, well, they could just kick you out

227
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,340
and say, well, you waived that right.

228
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,900
So what everybody is functioning under is credit.

229
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,960
Let me just function.

230
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
Let me just go back to the functional

231
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
part of this conversation.

232
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,180
In America, there's a little bit of what

233
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
I'll cry there was politically and in the

234
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,160
media about these illegal aliens, right?

235
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
Illegal is just a sick bird, right?

236
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
An ill eagle.

237
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,200
Right, right.

238
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,060
OK, so the reason why there's such a

239
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,960
big deal, it's not because they're taking jobs

240
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,640
or jobs or anything like that.

241
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,760
It's because if you're here and you're working,

242
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,460
you can legally and lawfully demand lawful money

243
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,960
for payment.

244
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,780
You better get it.

245
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,340
Otherwise, it's thievery and slavery.

246
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,000
So it's very important that they wrap them

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,020
up with a registration form for citizenship because

248
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,180
then they waive that right to make that

249
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,660
demand within the body politic.

250
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,700
Why?

251
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,580
How does that done?

252
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,720
Because they issue you a number, a green

253
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,540
card, a Social Security number, registration number.

254
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,060
And that actually is not what you think

255
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,360
it is.

256
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,180
It is it goes through various agencies of

257
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,420
the quote unquote government that process it and

258
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,360
create another credit line for you.

259
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,580
That's how the banks work, and that's how

260
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,300
the government agencies work.

261
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,240
So the reason you are being taxed directly

262
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
when you work for a corporation, they don't

263
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,180
know anything.

264
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,240
That's why, you know, if you knew how

265
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,700
the money system work, you couldn't be an

266
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,020
accountant.

267
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,640
If you knew anything about law, you wouldn't

268
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,800
be a lawyer.

269
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,440
You know anything about the body, you wouldn't

270
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
be a doctor, so on and so forth.

271
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,280
Right.

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,740
Even if you knew a lot about food,

273
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,700
you couldn't be a chef.

274
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,560
It would be very because you would look

275
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,060
at all the quality of the crap that

276
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,100
you're getting to prepare and you wouldn't do

277
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,360
it.

278
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,000
All right.

279
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,500
So there's many levels to this.

280
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,460
So the level back again with taxation is

281
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,760
this.

282
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,680
It is simply a use fee because that

283
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,980
credit line is put out by a private

284
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,860
company.

285
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,940
Quasi government.

286
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,460
You know, how many times have you heard

287
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,820
someone taking something for granted simply by location

288
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,360
and time?

289
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,080
Like they have something called common law or

290
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,320
whatever.

291
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,060
And so like if you live if you're

292
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,140
a man and live with a woman or

293
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,160
a woman and live with a man for

294
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,840
long enough, they consider you to be husband

295
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,880
and wife, even though you're not married.

296
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,200
Right.

297
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:13,980
Right.

298
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,940
That's all the taxing authorities have that relationship

299
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,560
with the government because they've been around for

300
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,380
such a long time.

301
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,680
Now, to cover themselves from the beginning, they

302
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,140
actually gave themselves some kind of federalistic or

303
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,620
monarchistic logo.

304
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,380
You know, they make themselves look really official.

305
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,020
Do you know to cover those that are

306
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,660
paying attention?

307
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,700
OK.

308
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,140
So these taxing authorities, when people get a

309
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,460
25 or 30 percent of their paycheck shaved

310
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,740
off, that is simply a use fee for

311
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,880
using private currency.

312
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,600
No different than going to a rental tool

313
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,380
shop and rent an auger or a steamroller

314
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,500
or a jackhammer or a tile saw.

315
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
And you take it out for a month

316
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,780
or a year and you bring it back.

317
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,040
Do you just drop it off and say,

318
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,640
bye, guys?

319
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,080
Thanks.

320
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Or do you have to pay a rental

321
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,260
fee?

322
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,740
You're paying that rental fee.

323
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,660
And if you don't pay it, there is

324
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,540
something owed and they take it serious as

325
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,120
a heart attack.

326
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,100
Oh, yeah.

327
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,580
Now, this goes under old laws of admiralty

328
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,200
and seizure and commercial laws.

329
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,980
Now, all of these taxation offices in the

330
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,520
U.S. and all over the world, those

331
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,220
little offices, you ever get a letter from

332
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,360
them?

333
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,680
It's not from the capital city.

334
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,700
It's usually from some other state or something,

335
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,840
no matter where you are.

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,500
Right.

337
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,360
Those are called franchise offices.

338
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,280
Whatever they collect, they keep a third of

339
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,540
it.

340
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,780
You see?

341
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,660
And the same with the police and detectives.

342
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,020
Police, not so much.

343
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,060
They get 5%.

344
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,680
Detectives and others get more.

345
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,480
Like DEA agents, CIF, they get up to

346
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
a third or a half sometimes, a third

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,260
usually, what they seize.

348
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,060
That's why they're so anxious to seize stuff.

349
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,940
So these old piracy laws are still in

350
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,220
place.

351
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,460
Now, they have to give you, if you

352
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,000
look in law, something called a remedy in

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,200
law.

354
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,000
That means that you're making someone sick and

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,160
then you have to also – if you're

356
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,700
going to make someone sick, you also have

357
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,480
to give them the remedy or the antidote.

358
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,700
You see that in film all the time.

359
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,640
They poison someone.

360
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,140
Tell me where they are and I'll give

361
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,220
you the antidote or you die.

362
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,740
Right, right.

363
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,300
Get it?

364
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,600
This is what's going on with the economic

365
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,060
system.

366
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,620
So there's a law in the US.

367
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,780
It's in the US codes, which have never

368
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,960
been validated as law, but they use this

369
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,220
prima facie law, right?

370
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,500
Just like what I mean by when you

371
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,320
see police, they're prima facie police.

372
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,220
They're not lawful.

373
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,620
If you go see what they're supposed to

374
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,680
be doing and were they ever really formally

375
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,320
in the position through the state, none of

376
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,740
them are.

377
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,240
Never.

378
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,100
It's just one of those things.

379
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,760
But do they still – does everyone still

380
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,280
call them?

381
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,580
Yeah.

382
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,440
You see what I mean?

383
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,520
So it's just prima facie.

384
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Something you call on, it's good enough, right?

385
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
If you go to an American food market,

386
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,500
that's all prima facie food, meaning people don't

387
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,460
– they're hungry.

388
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
The package looks good.

389
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,780
It's cheap.

390
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,540
I'll buy it.

391
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,860
And if you ask them how does it

392
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,360
taste, oh, it's good or bad.

393
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,060
What does that mean?

394
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,160
It doesn't tell me anything about taste.

395
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,180
There's five flavors in the taste.

396
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,340
Which one is it?

397
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,220
I mean forget it.

398
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,120
It is too far gone.

399
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,040
Back to the tax thing.

400
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,840
What you will find out, the laws here,

401
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,460
Title 12, Section 411, basically tells you you're

402
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,860
not authorized to use that.

403
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,820
USC code, Title 12, Section 411.

404
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,000
United States code, Title 12, Section 411.

405
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,720
It's interesting.

406
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
It has a ring to it like 12,

407
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,740
non-metric number, and 411 is the information.

408
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,440
Right.

409
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,620
Right.

410
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,860
Basically it says you're not authorized to use

411
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,020
it and you could make a demand for

412
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,720
lawful money.

413
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,920
And there's also Title 12, 95A, 95B.

414
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Those are other rules.

415
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
It will tell you about – by the

416
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,860
way, there's someone recently.

417
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Someone sent me a Skype message, a talk

418
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,500
show person on radio, and they're doing like

419
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,300
five years in prison for tax fraud because

420
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,480
they sent paperwork in and they got –

421
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,380
you could basically take a piece of paper,

422
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,020
write half a million dollars on it, sign

423
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,580
it, send it into the right agency.

424
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,880
They will send you a check for half

425
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,220
a million.

426
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,860
But then when they get audited, they'll look

427
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,640
at it and say, wait a second.

428
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,140
We can't do this for this guy, so

429
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,540
let's just tell him it's fraudulent.

430
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,840
And if you don't know how to get

431
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,860
out of it, they're going to throw you

432
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,220
in jail.

433
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,520
Oh, my.

434
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,380
Because there is no money.

435
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,380
They're taking your signature.

436
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,080
Yeah.

437
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,060
So anyway, this guy isn't going to do

438
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,160
anything to you.

439
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,940
I said, are you joking?

440
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,560
No way.

441
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,600
Because – but I showed him a code.

442
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,240
It's in Title 12.

443
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,820
I think it's within the 95A, 95B.

444
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,380
And it states because it's a credit-based

445
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,060
economy basically and it's all spurious, there is

446
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,780
nothing that anyone can do that can be

447
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,880
considered fraudulent and held against them.

448
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:49,980
Right?

449
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,960
Because you know that comes from just signing

450
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,460
your name.

451
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,140
Right.

452
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,920
So you ever go into a store and

453
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,840
it says bad – attorney general will prosecute

454
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,800
bad check writers?

455
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:00,980
Yes.

456
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,540
There's no such thing as a bad check.

457
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,140
You can sign as long – because it's

458
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,340
credit, you can take – here's the thing.

459
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,020
You can take a bubble gum wrapper.

460
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,720
You can go into the trash bin right

461
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,700
now and all the used – as long

462
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,940
as it's not used toilet paper.

463
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,940
Whatever you could write on, sign your name

464
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,880
and give it to a banker.

465
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,040
Excuse me.

466
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,620
They can use it.

467
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,620
You can't use it.

468
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,420
Very few people know how to do that.

469
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,760
So here's the aspect of it.

470
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,860
You know I've talked about the cosmic censorship,

471
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,480
one's ability to see or being denied access

472
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,260
to information.

473
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,080
Right.

474
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,380
The word censorship in Greek is logokrisis.

475
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,560
Logo meaning word and krisis meaning crisis.

476
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,740
So censorship in Greek literally means a word

477
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,260
crisis.

478
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,770
But anyway, you have the censorship and then

479
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,630
you have people's infallible desire and unending desire

480
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,270
to want to prank each other.

481
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,210
You get it?

482
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:04,810
Right.

483
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,410
And you combine those two together, the pranking

484
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,150
and the censorship, and that's a really bad

485
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,570
formula.

486
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,010
And I'm not talking like – some things

487
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,470
they tell you don't do together and you

488
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:15,710
should.

489
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,350
Like for example, when we were really young,

490
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,650
I mean everyone knew someone was somebody's parent,

491
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,590
a teenager years.

492
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,650
Everyone knew someone had a parent that was

493
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,190
a hypochondriac and if they were away for

494
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,190
the weekend, they had a big medicine chest

495
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,890
full of hundreds of prescription drug bottles.

496
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,150
Right?

497
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,690
Everyone knew someone like that.

498
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:34,950
Yeah.

499
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,810
So we would all go there.

500
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,710
Teenagers, you're just learning about pot and alcohol.

501
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,130
So this triptych medicine chest with literally hundreds

502
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,470
of bottles and they were like, what should

503
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,110
we do with this?

504
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,990
Because we were – some guys were –

505
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,010
people were already starting to pop pills at

506
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,850
14 or 15.

507
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,890
This is in the 70s, right?

508
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,670
Oh, yeah.

509
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,990
So it was popular then and some of

510
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,130
the best suppliers were like those who had

511
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,070
uncles or dads that were cops because they

512
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,270
would always steal stuff from the evidence or

513
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,510
these medicine chests that were loaded.

514
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,829
So the point here about not doing two

515
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,690
things together is I said, well, if you

516
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,770
want to find the most effective one, find

517
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,490
the one that has the warning label on

518
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,970
it to not take with alcohol because we're

519
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,170
all drinking anyway, right?

520
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,670
Right.

521
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,470
That's the one you want because when they

522
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,010
tell you don't take it with alcohol, that

523
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,630
means you should take it with alcohol for

524
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,589
maximum effect.

525
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:25,869
Exactly.

526
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,430
Yeah, this is from the people back in

527
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,550
the 60s and the 70s, all the drug

528
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,130
experimentation and all that.

529
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,910
It was never really for me but I

530
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,650
just happened to be in the neighborhood where

531
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,410
I grew up in an upper middle class

532
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,010
neighborhood and this is what they did.

533
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,870
Don't think it's – you hear in the

534
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,810
news that it's ghetto and lower middle class

535
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,170
or lower classes do the most horrendous stuff.

536
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,070
It's actually – I've seen upper – they

537
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,070
can afford more, believe it or not, and

538
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,490
they get into more crazy stuff.

539
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,550
I mean they get into levels of violence

540
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,150
that you wouldn't believe it if I told

541
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,910
you because they have all the toys.

542
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,530
So anyway, so what you don't do and

543
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,690
do together is what people don't understand, and

544
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,390
what they're stuck in is the pranking and

545
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,010
the censorship.

546
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,850
Now, Title 12, Section 411, if you understand

547
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,030
old admiralty, old, old admiralty stuff, it's not

548
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,970
even in books anymore.

549
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,270
I mean it is but not online.

550
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,250
I've been looking for it.

551
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,850
Actually, there were a couple of good books

552
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,350
that were written in the 1800s and they

553
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,370
stopped because they just discuss admiralty, which is

554
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,610
piracy, seizure, trafficking and all that, right, for

555
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
thousands of years.

556
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,690
So they got tired of it and they

557
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,690
went into legal statutory stuff in the 19th

558
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,010
century.

559
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,450
But there are maxims in admiralty, and one

560
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,210
of them is that if you endorse something

561
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,930
in a transaction unconditionally that you are implying

562
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,910
that you are never looking for redemption of

563
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,450
that thing.

564
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,200
OK, what does that mean, right?

565
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,340
If you sign off on something, just your

566
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,900
name here, you can take this.

567
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,660
You should never expect it back because there's

568
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,800
no conditions on there.

569
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,740
What if you sign your name on something?

570
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
You could take this rowboat, but you have

571
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,360
to bring it back in a week and

572
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
it's $50 a day, let's say, right?

573
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,040
Well, that's different, isn't it?

574
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,360
Now that's a condition, right, you see?

575
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,540
But if you just take the rowboat unconditionally,

576
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,660
you're a fool to expect it back, to

577
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,840
have it redeemed or have it redeemed.

578
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,780
Like if the boat was lost by the

579
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,960
user, well, they're not going to bring you

580
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,220
the boat back because it's lost, but they're

581
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,160
going to bring you something of equivalent value,

582
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,840
coin, money or something on another boat.

583
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,300
You get it?

584
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,520
Reimbursement, yes.

585
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,920
Right.

586
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,580
So whenever you sign a check or just

587
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,300
sign whatever you saying that, hey, guys, I

588
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,540
got an unlimited credit line and I don't

589
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,960
care.

590
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,220
And you guys could change the rules.

591
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,620
And instead of me being the boss now,

592
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,260
I'm a slave.

593
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,220
It doesn't matter.

594
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,700
I'll just do whatever you say.

595
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,660
Any time you don't have to even play

596
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,860
by the rules.

597
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,560
You know, I'm just here.

598
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,280
Anytime you need something, let me know.

599
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,440
That's what you're saying when you just sign

600
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,760
your name.

601
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,420
Did you know that?

602
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,240
I did not.

603
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,920
How many times do you go to a

604
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,660
bank account or sign your name on something?

605
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,640
And that's what you're saying.

606
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,100
Let me just take it from the top.

607
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,380
Yeah, I'll just sign my name because I

608
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,220
got all the credit.

609
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,280
You see, I was given a credit line,

610
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,780
you know, when I was born and I

611
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
can just sign my name.

612
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,660
That's value.

613
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,200
And you guys can have it.

614
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,660
You could do whatever you want.

615
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
You can change the rules.

616
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,820
You could use any rule.

617
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,540
You don't even have to use rules against

618
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,160
me.

619
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,440
And just if you ever need anything, just

620
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,080
let me know.

621
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,820
That's what you're saying when you sign the

622
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,800
name.

623
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,560
Just like that.

624
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,600
Also, I want to bring up what they're

625
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,920
doing on electronic signature pads.

626
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,080
Yeah, you did mention that.

627
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,380
Yeah.

628
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,000
They're harvesting those signatures as original because the

629
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
moment you sign that thermal or active pad,

630
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
it goes into a digital form, and that

631
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,180
digital form in storage is the original because

632
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,340
obviously because the minute you sign it, they

633
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,320
clear it, and the next person comes and

634
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,720
signs it.

635
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,840
It's just a transmitting utility, you see.

636
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,340
The actual original is what's held in memory,

637
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
you know, on the file somewhere.

638
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,300
Those signatures are sold and used on other

639
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,680
contracts constantly, and you don't know it.

640
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,600
If anyone wants to go investigate what Wells

641
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,540
Fargo was doing a few months ago, there

642
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,060
was a few articles that they opened a

643
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,640
few million credit cards accounts and started drawing

644
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,500
credit, unbeknownst to anyone whose name they were

645
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,840
using.

646
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
You go look it up.

647
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,880
It's just happened about a year ago.

648
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,900
Yeah, about, you know, I was going to

649
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,260
say a year, year and a half or

650
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,420
so.

651
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,080
Well, it happened years ago, and it's still

652
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,880
going on, but they just happened to get

653
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,860
a little bit of a slap on the

654
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,320
wrist for that.

655
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Now, whenever you're dealing with credit transactions, they

656
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,640
won't let you go unless you sign or

657
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
use the digital, you know, verification.

658
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,680
So how did they – how were they

659
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,800
able to get all – where did they

660
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
harvest all – where did Wells Fargo harvest

661
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,780
all those signatures from?

662
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,480
Let's see.

663
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,560
Little leprechauns coming into the bedroom at night

664
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,140
while you're sleeping and putting a pen in

665
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,640
your hand.

666
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,940
Let's see, maybe.

667
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,380
Did they clone you in Area 51 and

668
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,440
your clone signed it?

669
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,180
No, no, no.

670
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,360
Let's see which one.

671
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,320
Could it be those signature pads that you're

672
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,660
using?

673
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,860
Oh, yeah, I think it's the signature pads,

674
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,140
yeah.

675
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,080
And now the same thing is done with

676
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,500
the chip.

677
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
The chip is going to be a tough

678
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,620
one, and there's many reasons for that.

679
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,280
But the chip – there's a chip in

680
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,560
the car, there's a chip in the phone,

681
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,180
there's a chip in the car as well.

682
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,880
If you get a new car, any new

683
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,560
American car, it says right – there's a

684
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,260
sticker somewhere in the car by the trunk

685
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,380
or by the driver's door, and it says

686
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,180
that this car is equipped with electronic devices

687
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,720
that law enforcement can take control over.

688
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Yes, yes.

689
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,480
See those stickers?

690
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,660
New cars?

691
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,540
Mm-hmm.

692
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,740
Something like that.

693
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,480
They all use a slightly different verbiage.

694
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,220
OK, so the deal with money is whenever

695
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,880
– there is no money, and you're not

696
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,640
going to get any money.

697
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,900
There is no way you're going to get

698
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,560
any money because this is coming from a

699
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,420
primal point from the gods.

700
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,280
But what people don't understand is when you

701
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,900
deal with the taxing authorities, you file a

702
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,500
return.

703
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,160
You have to return something for using, right?

704
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,860
So the idiots that if you work for

705
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,540
an employer, they don't know and they never

706
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:37,980
will know.

707
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,360
You don't even bother talking to them.

708
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,080
If you can evidence that you have not

709
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,820
been signing just the name and you write

710
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,660
a condition on it, meaning like lawful money

711
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,160
only, 12 USC 411 is a simple way

712
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,700
to write it on a check.

713
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,980
Now, most people get direct deposit.

714
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,760
Cut that shit out, I tell people.

715
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,300
Get it out.

716
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,860
You could say you want a hard-written

717
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,200
check.

718
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,320
Even if you want to take a dollar

719
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
out of it or whatever, it's fine.

720
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,180
I can't do the direct deposit.

721
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,360
You have to have it written out.

722
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,800
That's why I haven't done the PayPal yet

723
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,860
or anything on the site.

724
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,420
Because there is no way between all of

725
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,520
the shenanigans that they do, using the name

726
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,220
or the account that it's going to end

727
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,340
up into, that can be shown that you're

728
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,640
making a demand for lawful money or a

729
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
conditional endorsement each way.

730
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,620
And I got into it with them and

731
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,400
American Express and some other people on prepaid

732
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,680
cards.

733
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,240
They wanted all this.

734
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,660
I'm not asking for credit.

735
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,220
This is a prepaid card.

736
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,120
No, it's all credit.

737
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,020
I said, I know it is.

738
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,460
And I kept going up and up and

739
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,340
up, and it turns out that it is

740
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,720
all credit.

741
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,360
There's no way.

742
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,040
So it's very difficult to do anything electronically.

743
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,940
But the thing is, there is another way

744
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,680
I haven't developed.

745
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,740
It has to be developed where you develop

746
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,820
an electronic ledger that shows that each thing

747
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,820
is unconditional.

748
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,860
There's a condition to it versus unconditional.

749
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,720
That's why there's no PayPal for the Greek

750
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,980
or anything like that.

751
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,580
So what's going on is when you sign

752
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,640
the name on anything, you should make your

753
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
intention clear.

754
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,960
In other words, if someone says sign here

755
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
and you just sign the name, what you're

756
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,040
saying is, yeah, you know, I've got all

757
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,420
the credit and the signature is important because

758
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,100
it's the key element in the economic gear,

759
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,180
the workings of everything.

760
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm the basis of it.

761
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,800
I'm the one that's got all the credit.

762
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
And I know you guys got laws that

763
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,080
govern this, but if you don't feel like

764
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,500
using the laws, that's okay.

765
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,580
I'm always here for you.

766
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,460
Right.

767
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,820
That's what you're saying when you sign the

768
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,060
name.

769
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,880
I hope I'm trying to make this simple.

770
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,180
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,820
There's people.

772
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,300
There's lots of evidence.

773
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,840
There's a couple of people that do lawful

774
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,120
money.

775
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,620
If you do a search, there's David Merrill

776
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,060
and his sidekick Joe and all that.

777
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,900
They do pretty good research.

778
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,640
He's got a good mind on the admiralty

779
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
side and all this, but in terms of

780
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,480
the other stuff, it's just hogwash.

781
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,480
I mean, they're just as censored as everyone

782
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,840
else.

783
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,240
And I'm not saying that because I like

784
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,020
them or don't like them.

785
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm just subjectifying.

786
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,980
This is just hogwash.

787
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,460
So I can't send anyone over to any

788
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,940
place.

789
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,860
But it's a saving to suitors club or

790
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,580
something like that.

791
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,980
These guys get into all this stuff.

792
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,580
Right.

793
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
But when you look at their biblical analysis

794
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,960
and their biblical metaphors, it's laughable.

795
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,840
So they're very censored when it comes to

796
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,300
anything outside of the redeeming for lawful money.

797
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,680
So I can't recommend them.

798
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,200
See, because people are too naive.

799
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,440
Well, the Greeks said I should go to

800
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,860
this site or check this out.

801
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,180
So that means because if the Greeks said

802
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,460
it, that means everything there is good.

803
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,680
No, it's junk.

804
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,080
You know, they're morons, but they've got this

805
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,860
thing downright.

806
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,740
You know what I mean?

807
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,240
Right.

808
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,000
So anyway, that's just how it works.

809
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,120
You know, you don't go into a shoe

810
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,360
store demanding a chocolate milkshake because you're in

811
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,800
the wrong.

812
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,580
You get it.

813
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,760
You go next door where the ice cream

814
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,440
shop is.

815
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,520
So you have to be aware what you're

816
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,540
saying and what you're looking for, where you

817
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,920
are.

818
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,580
So how do you know it's a shoe

819
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,860
store?

820
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,480
Well, you know, you've got a shoe.

821
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,440
You've got a sign outside.

822
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,280
You know, you've got shoes inside.

823
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,720
It smells like even if you're blind, you

824
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,120
can smell it's a shoe store.

825
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,480
Right.

826
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,460
Just like when you go down certain supermarket

827
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,320
aisles, you know if you're in the garden

828
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,340
chemical aisle.

829
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:30,860
Right.

830
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh, yeah.

831
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,960
So anyway.

832
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,680
So anyway, so this is what's going on.

833
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,460
Most people, you know, like I could go

834
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,920
to anything on the Internet and I'll tell

835
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,260
you, people send me links.

836
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,760
Hopefully, I mean, thankfully not anymore.

837
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,580
And in 0.2 seconds, I could tell

838
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,520
if it's junk or not.

839
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,240
0.2 seconds.

840
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,980
I could do five websites in one second.

841
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,960
I know it's an exaggeration, but that I

842
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,660
could, you know, even if you're blind, you

843
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,980
could open the door and you could smell

844
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,240
it.

845
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,760
You see.

846
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,280
So, but it doesn't mean that it should

847
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,060
be condemned and there's nothing good there.

848
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,680
Back to the money.

849
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,060
There's a lot of history of people that

850
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,300
have done the standard route dealing with, you

851
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,400
know, the taxing authorities.

852
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,340
And at the end of the year, instead

853
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,240
of doing a return, they send them a

854
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
letter and say, hey, listen.

855
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,860
I got – these are all these copies.

856
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,080
You know, if you're getting paid every two

857
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,220
weeks, you could probably do it.

858
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,140
That's 24 checks, right?

859
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,220
But if you're doing more transactions on a

860
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,380
private business, you have to keep really good

861
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,000
record keeping.

862
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,980
You must show that you did endorse it

863
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,120
conditionally versus unconditionally.

864
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,040
Right.

865
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,220
And say I haven't used any – you

866
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,880
know, I haven't used any money this year.

867
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,700
And by the way, if you want me

868
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,980
to pay taxes, I have to get some

869
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,060
lawful money to pay taxes.

870
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,820
Oops, oops.

871
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,160
OK.

872
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,080
Well, if we ever took any money out,

873
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,180
we're going to give it back to you

874
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,780
plus 5%, not a return, a small percentage.

875
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,560
We have to show deductions and all that

876
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:48,880
bullshit.

877
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,320
What they do is they give it all

878
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,480
back plus 5%.

879
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,600
Then you could go to the employer and

880
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
show them the letter and say they should

881
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,360
have never taken it out in the first

882
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,820
place.

883
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,920
And the accountant will implode.

884
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,280
He can't acknowledge it because if the accountant

885
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,080
that works for the company acknowledges that he

886
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,560
shouldn't do withholdings on you, he acknowledges that

887
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,060
his whole life is a lie and he's

888
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,100
partaking in – you know.

889
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:11,740
Right?

890
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,580
Right.

891
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,020
Yeah.

892
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,240
So, yeah, that's why, I mean, if I

893
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,020
was king, all the accountants get taken out

894
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,260
back.

895
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,060
They all get shot.

896
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,320
All the attorneys, they all get taken out

897
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,420
back.

898
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,160
They all get shot.

899
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,260
Well, we don't have any accountants or attorneys

900
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,500
anymore.

901
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,860
Great.

902
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,520
We just start some new ones right away.

903
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,460
It takes 15 minutes to train an attorney

904
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,020
or an accountant.

905
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,060
Not 10 years in school.

906
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,700
Yeah.

907
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,800
Anyway, no questions asked.

908
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,080
Yeah, brutality, right?

909
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,720
Yeah, right.

910
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah, you're really brutal for sure.

911
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:41,900
Exactly, yeah.

912
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
Because they don't know what universe they're in.

913
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,260
They're still – they have no idea.

914
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,420
So the idea here is that there is

915
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,740
no idea if you are going unconditionally in

916
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,620
everything that you do.

917
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,080
Right?

918
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,780
It's kind of like the old engineering student.

919
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,420
I'll give you a quick joke.

920
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,640
The old engineering student, he lives on the

921
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,260
far end of the dormitory on the campus,

922
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,480
and all the other engineering students live right

923
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,960
there by the buildings.

924
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,220
And they have really short breaks between classes,

925
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,020
and he's always late because he has to

926
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,260
go all the way down to his dorm

927
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,400
and walk back.

928
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,900
Everyone's like, you need to get a bicycle.

929
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,840
You need to get a bicycle.

930
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,400
And he says, OK, I'll get a bicycle

931
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,940
one of these days.

932
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,080
I'm tight on cash.

933
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,440
I don't know how that will happen, but

934
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,980
I'll look to get into a bicycle.

935
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,500
Well, a little time goes by, and he

936
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,420
rolls up on time on a bicycle.

937
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,740
They're like, well, you're right.

938
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
You got a bike, man.

939
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
How did you get the bike?

940
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,860
He says, well, I was walking over here

941
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,160
the other day, and this beautiful girl, she

942
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
was braless in a sweater.

943
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,840
She was on a bicycle.

944
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,880
She throws the bicycle down on the ground

945
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,360
and takes her shirt off and says I

946
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,460
can take anything I want.

947
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,180
So anyway.

948
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,960
The girl pulls her shirt up, throws her

949
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,640
bicycle down.

950
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,920
You can have anything you want, and he

951
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,700
goes for the bike.

952
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,400
Of course, you see.

953
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,040
Anyway, because you see, her intent for doing

954
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,780
that was obviously a sexual one.

955
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,400
Right.

956
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,000
But she said unconditionally you could have anything

957
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
you want, right?

958
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,340
Right.

959
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,420
She was not expecting.

960
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,000
There's no reason to explain this.

961
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,440
This is a joke.

962
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,480
It's stupid to explain it.

963
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
That's what you're doing.

964
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,080
Every time people sign their names on anything,

965
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,500
I don't care what it is, you're basically,

966
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,300
instead of pulling your shirt up, you're pulling

967
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,840
your pants down and bending over.

968
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Yeah.

969
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,380
And say you could have anything you want.

970
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,880
And you know what?

971
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
The banker is going to take the signature,

972
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,600
but some scumbag attorney or accountant or whatever

973
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,140
down the line or banker is going to

974
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,260
take the other part, and you're going to

975
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,520
get it without a reach around.

976
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,310
Holy smokes.

977
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,450
You get it?

978
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,110
Yes.

979
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,110
Yeah.

980
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,570
And you're getting it, but you're so used

981
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,750
to it, you don't mind it.

982
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,130
How's that for one?

983
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,870
Ah.

984
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,210
You see?

985
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,130
Crazy world.

986
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,030
But if you've gotten this far and haven't

987
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,570
gotten anything out of what I've said, just

988
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,930
hit the delete button and do something else

989
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,930
because you're not going to get it.

990
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,810
I'm not saying it's hopeless because you're probably

991
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,410
censored.

992
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,770
You probably don't understand how the money system

993
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,170
works.

994
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,110
Another idea of how the money system works

995
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,230
is very simple, credit.

996
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,350
You have something called a potluck.

997
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,090
White people like doing this stuff all the

998
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,670
time because if you have ten people at

999
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,830
a potluck, you're expecting ten people to bring

1000
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,190
ten items, right?

1001
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,630
Ten dishes, yeah.

1002
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,190
So usually when you go to a potluck,

1003
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,570
whoever is there, it's almost mandatory that they

1004
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,510
brought something to eat.

1005
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,910
So no one will go hungry.

1006
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,270
Everyone is chipping in.

1007
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,290
There's an abundance of stuff, right?

1008
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,490
That's what the credit system is like.

1009
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,670
When you're born in a country, they create

1010
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,370
a credit line.

1011
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,690
It's 1.8 million in America.

1012
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,230
I think now it's up to 2.6.

1013
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,330
You could look at the Social Security Act

1014
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,130
of 1935.

1015
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,750
They've upgraded it in 2006.

1016
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,310
I think now it's up to 2.7

1017
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:15,690
million.

1018
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,350
That's why if you know anyone that works

1019
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,330
at the administrative part of a hospital, when

1020
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,610
the long-form birth certificates, they're long-form

1021
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,870
with the baby's footprints on it, when they're

1022
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,330
transported out of the hospital, how are they

1023
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,870
transported?

1024
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,580
Wells Fargo security truck, armored truck comes and

1025
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,100
picks them up.

1026
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,420
Have you ever seen that?

1027
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,280
Go to any county.

1028
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,400
I have never personally seen it, but that

1029
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,160
would make sense.

1030
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,040
Yeah, I have personally seen it.

1031
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,560
Yeah.

1032
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,160
Yep.

1033
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
So, and they do it every three days.

1034
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,000
So, yeah.

1035
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Anyway, it's kind of sad, but it's not.

1036
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,400
I mean, it is the way it is.

1037
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,920
Now, here's the other thing about laws.

1038
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,080
What people don't understand is how they vary

1039
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,699
from country to country, even though they're the

1040
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,580
same, really.

1041
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,080
Like I know all the building codes were

1042
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,420
made universal, meaning throughout all countries in the

1043
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,600
90s.

1044
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,600
So, for example, if I'm having a conversation,

1045
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,900
if I know the building codes here in

1046
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,520
America, and I'm speaking to someone in Australia,

1047
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,540
which I've done, who works in that field,

1048
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,719
I can tell them specifications on layouts of

1049
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,960
plumbing, electricity, and certain things, and they will

1050
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,620
say, yes, that's right.

1051
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,520
That's how it has to be.

1052
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,179
How do I know that?

1053
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm in the States.

1054
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,880
Well, because I know that in the 90s,

1055
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,139
those codes were made universal, international.

1056
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,739
You get it?

1057
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,080
So, it's pretty simple.

1058
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,960
Now, when it comes to laws, for example,

1059
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,900
you have something called reciprocate, reciprocity.

1060
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,440
An example of reciprocity would be like a

1061
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,460
driver's license or a passport.

1062
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,800
For example, if you have a passport in

1063
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,240
England, can you use it in the US?

1064
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,420
Yeah.

1065
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,980
Can you use it in France?

1066
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,300
Yeah.

1067
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,340
Use it in Russia?

1068
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,160
Yeah, because it's through the State Department, right?

1069
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,900
Same with driver's licenses.

1070
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,780
Have you ever heard of someone having a

1071
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,480
driver's license in a foreign country, and they

1072
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,980
come and rent a car somewhere else, and

1073
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,180
they get pulled over, and they have a

1074
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,320
driver's license to drive a commercial vehicle on

1075
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,040
the road, and the cop says, fine, because

1076
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,140
it's only a few days, right?

1077
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,240
It's reciprocating, right?

1078
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
Money is reciprocating.

1079
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,440
Can't you convert dollars to euros and euros

1080
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,180
to dollars, right, where there's an established value?

1081
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,640
So you can literally, if you know what

1082
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,160
you're doing, I'm not suggesting this for the

1083
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,700
listeners, and maybe you could, if you're savvy

1084
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,580
enough, you can reciprocate any law to anywhere

1085
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,000
that stands unless it's restricted only for that

1086
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,340
area.

1087
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,160
We've lost our stream, but keep going.

1088
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,940
We are recording.

1089
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,500
Okay.

1090
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,780
So if you've ever seen, you want to

1091
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,680
get the stream back up?

1092
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm working on it right now.

1093
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:58,860
Okay.

1094
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,530
But you can keep going.

1095
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,530
We've got it recorded.

1096
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,190
Now, this isn't going to help anyone directly,

1097
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,550
because I've given you the fishbowl analogy.

1098
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,070
If you come too soon, you can't come

1099
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,110
too soon or too late, right?

1100
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,010
This is just a mindset talk.

1101
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,510
So let's take a pause.

1102
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,630
I'm going to let me know when you

1103
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,050
get the stream.

1104
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,010
I'm going to get some coffee.

1105
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,730
I could still keep speaking.

1106
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,410
Yeah, okay.

1107
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,430
But I'm not because of the distance.

1108
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,170
I'm going across the house here, and I

1109
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,590
might start losing the signal, so I'm going

1110
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,690
to mute, and I'll be right back.

1111
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,650
Okay, sounds good.

1112
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,150
And we apologize for that, folks.

1113
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,970
Apparently, the stream decided to shut down, so

1114
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,150
we're getting her back up.

1115
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,550
We'll get her going.

1116
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,820
I'm back in the office.

1117
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,840
Actually, I got some coffee down.

1118
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,960
Did you stop the recording, or are you

1119
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,280
still recording?

1120
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,440
I got her.

1121
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,440
I believe we're back online.

1122
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,700
I'm just double-checking my work.

1123
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,910
What do we got here?

1124
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,240
Yep, I believe we're up and running.

1125
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,220
I'm back in the office.

1126
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,180
I actually got some coffee down.

1127
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,320
Did you stop the recording, or are you

1128
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,680
still recording?

1129
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,040
There.

1130
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,020
Okay, we're good.

1131
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,340
All right, there we go.

1132
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,260
Okay, folks, we're back.

1133
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1134
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,480
So I don't know.

1135
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,200
Sometimes I think this conversation, the conversation, that

1136
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,480
sermon at best, sermon just means speech, might

1137
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,220
go unwarranted for most or not necessarily.

1138
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,360
But I think it needs to be said

1139
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,860
to fill in the veracity of what is

1140
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,960
going on, meaning and how strange I see

1141
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,160
it.

1142
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,140
I think I was discussing something with someone

1143
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,080
the other day, and I've said this on

1144
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,500
calls with – I think when I was

1145
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,520
doing the solo events.

1146
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
The difference between those that know what's going

1147
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
on and those that don't is not marginal.

1148
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,740
It's not like whispering a secret into someone's

1149
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,240
– to bring them up to speed.

1150
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,080
It is so distant.

1151
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,780
You might as well be across an ocean.

1152
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,380
You're not even within the same – you

1153
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,520
can't even see the person.

1154
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,900
That's how far away they are in terms

1155
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,100
of the mindset required.

1156
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,320
Right.

1157
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,200
So that is a physical aspect or a

1158
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,420
social way to describe it.

1159
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,760
But the cosmic primacy of it is that

1160
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,980
they're being censored by the gods, you see.

1161
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Right.

1162
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,860
So I'm going to put it

1163
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:05,400
– attributes of the coming perfect society before

1164
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,700
mop-up crew arrives.

1165
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,900
Is it to be perfect as in all

1166
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,100
follow the lawful teachings of the scriptures for

1167
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,760
a brief time or perfect by more modern

1168
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,720
-day standards, i.e. Both.

1169
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,660
Things as they are now just working better?

1170
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,060
Both.

1171
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
But also if you remember what I haven't

1172
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,740
stressed but I have mentioned continuously is –

1173
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,720
I'm going to give it as a metaphor.

1174
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
Water is necessary.

1175
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,940
Water is good.

1176
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,360
Just like good law, good instruction.

1177
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
But also water is, if you look at

1178
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,860
the insurance manuals, the number one destroyer of

1179
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,280
property.

1180
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,240
Right.

1181
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,280
Water can kill you.

1182
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Is it possible to take a set of

1183
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,880
instructions, rules, and laws and tweak them to

1184
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,860
make them so overbearing that you end up

1185
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,780
eliminating a third of the Earth's population?

1186
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,340
Oh, yeah.

1187
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,140
Yep.

1188
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,570
Then he had something here regarding 2,500

1189
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,310
years ago, Greeks comments that some people had

1190
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,730
started to work out how to break free

1191
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,650
from this realm.

1192
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,630
Would that be the Egyptian pharaohs?

1193
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,530
Often wondered if the mummification process was some

1194
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,630
type of suspended animation where the mind was

1195
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,050
able to wander and act in other realms

1196
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,510
for a certain amount of time after mummification.

1197
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,190
No, nothing like that.

1198
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,310
You could be thrown into the landfill or

1199
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:35,850
burned up.

1200
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,830
It doesn't really matter.

1201
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,870
Mummification is a form of – what do

1202
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,770
you call it when you formally bury people?

1203
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,390
But a funerary rite, just like in the

1204
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,270
Hindi culture, their funerary rites was a funeral

1205
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,670
pyre where they burned the body.

1206
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,810
Right, right.

1207
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,470
I remember that.

1208
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,030
Yep.

1209
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:57,750
Yeah.

1210
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,890
And in other countries, they just wrap you

1211
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,070
in cloth and put you underground.

1212
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,070
Yeah.

1213
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,730
No, that's just a funerary rite.

1214
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,590
It has no significance on anything other than

1215
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,590
– to think that it does means you've

1216
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:15,130
sort of fallen into their teachings, which are

1217
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,550
false according to what we know from higher

1218
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:17,970
teachings.

1219
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,490
That's the other thing.

1220
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,130
Higher teachings and lower teachings sometimes run parallel

1221
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,410
and you can bounce from one to the

1222
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:25,890
next, right?

1223
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,650
Like three-phase electricity, you've got three hots

1224
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,450
coming in, right?

1225
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,990
That means they're all equal to an extent

1226
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,950
but not really.

1227
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,190
But then I have found in most cases

1228
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,830
lower-level teachings are contrary to higher-level

1229
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,290
teachings.

1230
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,530
Look, we were just talking about the money

1231
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,330
system.

1232
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,770
Right.

1233
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,070
I was having a conversation a while back

1234
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,670
with someone regarding credit cards, and he says,

1235
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,150
I called you Greek because I had a

1236
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,190
really funny conversation with a credit card company.

1237
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,270
I said, what are you doing using credit

1238
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,570
cards?

1239
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,410
He said, well, just hear this out.

1240
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,650
They told him that he couldn't use a

1241
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,330
credit card to settle the bill with another

1242
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,010
credit card.

1243
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,990
OK.

1244
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,930
Then if I can't do that, then how

1245
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,830
am I supposed to do it?

1246
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,590
And they couldn't give him an answer.

1247
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,170
Write a check.

1248
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,070
Well, what is a check?

1249
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,170
Where does the money come from?

1250
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,930
And he went back and forth and they

1251
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,110
kept switching him through all these people.

1252
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,490
No one there knew who had an answer

1253
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,790
for him.

1254
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,270
Oh, my.

1255
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,490
That's how stupid people are.

1256
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,420
Electrolytes.

1257
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, I'm a drinkator.

1258
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,700
I'm a drinkator and it's got electrolytes.

1259
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,740
Yeah, it's in Brondo.

1260
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,700
Well, what's Brondo?

1261
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,640
It's got electrolytes?

1262
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,400
Yeah.

1263
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,240
This is the state – and I'm not

1264
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,100
just talking about the common people, which are

1265
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,440
just – don't even bother.

1266
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm talking about your higher-ups are in

1267
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,760
total crap.

1268
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,040
They're high-level people.

1269
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,280
Whenever you hear me talking about people who

1270
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,040
are stupid, I'm not talking about the commoner,

1271
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,280
by the way.

1272
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,540
I hope you people – Bill, I'm talking

1273
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,820
– speaking of your very high-ups in

1274
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,700
academia, medicine, legal, they don't know.

1275
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,100
They don't know at all.

1276
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,660
I mean just like in mediocrity.

1277
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,000
The higher-ups didn't know at all either.

1278
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,680
No, they didn't.

1279
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,790
Excellent movie, by the way.

1280
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,290
Oh, yeah.

1281
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,130
It's a documentary.

1282
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,310
Yeah, it's one of the best films ever

1283
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,570
done.

1284
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,470
So anything else?

1285
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,850
Is Thomas hot?

1286
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,410
Is he live?

1287
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,730
There are 11 people on his – I

1288
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,110
see – yeah, I see the 11.

1289
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,170
You had a final one.

1290
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,030
And thanks if you answered any or not.

1291
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,250
I cannot listen live, so don't know with

1292
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,670
regards to Ramos and Colossi and a bunch

1293
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,310
of names here.

1294
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,150
I see.

1295
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,010
Oh, you got it.

1296
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,690
Go ahead, go ahead.

1297
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,570
Tall, I mean, one of the grandiose statues

1298
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,570
of representatives of men's gods.

1299
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,330
It's a very – Yeah, yeah.

1300
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:49,910
No.

1301
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,250
Thanks.

1302
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,230
Low-quality questions.

1303
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,670
Yeah, they are, but that doesn't mean you

1304
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:56,970
are.

1305
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:58,430
Right.

1306
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,170
That's fine.

1307
00:43:59,370 --> 00:43:59,830
Thank you.

1308
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,410
Thank you for bringing these up.

1309
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,730
Now, Egyptology is a real interesting thing because

1310
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,890
there were several Egypts, by the way, right?

1311
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,390
People don't know about that.

1312
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,390
You've heard of the dynastic and then post

1313
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,470
-dynastic, the exos, where they were ruled by

1314
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,990
foreigners, right?

1315
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,770
And then you have to couple that with

1316
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,050
the information that we get about that society.

1317
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,730
There was an Egyptology craze in the late

1318
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,310
19th century that lasted up until the 20s

1319
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,770
of the 20th century.

1320
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,190
That's why if you look at a lot

1321
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,530
of architecture and haircuts and things like that,

1322
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,690
they're affected through the early art deco thing,

1323
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,330
a lot of furniture and styles.

1324
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,090
And also here's the other thing.

1325
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,130
When you're dealing with the Egyptians, their academics,

1326
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,890
they're all liars.

1327
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,210
I know it sounds like a pejorative thing

1328
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:49,730
to say Greek.

1329
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,550
How can you say are you nationally profiling

1330
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:53,750
them?

1331
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,230
Not really, but the Egyptians are liars.

1332
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,290
This has been what I just said I

1333
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,190
read out of something in the 19th century,

1334
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,270
and it still holds true today.

1335
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,510
What I mean about that is that if

1336
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,450
you go to Egypt and you do research,

1337
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,170
and every time you run into an Egyptologist

1338
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,630
who is Egyptian, they have been told to

1339
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,430
skew the information according to what's been put

1340
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,090
out already.

1341
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,010
You get it?

1342
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,990
They don't want you knowing anything about what

1343
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,450
they are.

1344
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,930
Don't have one guy telling you this happened

1345
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,610
here and this time, and the other guy

1346
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,690
says that never happened here.

1347
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,850
Yeah, so the hard thing about Egyptology is

1348
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,510
you're on your own.

1349
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,220
Speaking of links, I dropped one in this

1350
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,520
morning about the— I think it was Egypt

1351
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,160
that was going to start allowing the public

1352
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,560
to see their ancient library in Sinai, I

1353
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,200
believe it was.

1354
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,380
Oh, okay.

1355
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,500
Egypt reopens ancient Sinai library housing 4th century

1356
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,420
New Testament.

1357
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,480
Oh, New Testament.

1358
00:45:59,760 --> 00:45:59,940
Yeah.

1359
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,820
That's going to be in Greek.

1360
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,180
That's going to be interesting.

1361
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,140
That's like saying 150 years from now, if

1362
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,640
we had that much time, they're opening a

1363
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,380
library to show the U.S. Constitution.

1364
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,280
But it's written in Spanish, though, and it

1365
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,460
was written in Spanish around 2050.

1366
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,820
You get it?

1367
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,120
Yeah.

1368
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,800
I've been keeping an eye on that.

1369
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,320
I love the fact that we can go

1370
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,700
and check out last 24 hours, last hour,

1371
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,840
last 24, and that's worked out quite well.

1372
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,400
There's a lot of interesting stuff in there.

1373
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,120
Say that again?

1374
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,860
About the archaeology, yeah.

1375
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,760
Well, how else are you going to evidence

1376
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,440
to the past?

1377
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,440
Exactly.

1378
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,940
Yeah, we're not talking about good records because

1379
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,860
people, no one cares about evidence anymore, and

1380
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,680
also no one cares about what's happening in

1381
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,520
front of their face, what they actually see.

1382
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,040
So the beauty of archaeology is it does

1383
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,500
two things.

1384
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,440
It provides physical evidence, and also archaeology seems

1385
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,240
to be important.

1386
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,880
It just hits that note in the mental

1387
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,360
vibe.

1388
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,720
Oh, archaeology means it's important.

1389
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,540
Yeah.

1390
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,060
Right?

1391
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,980
Yeah, it's not like philosophy.

1392
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,960
People will always use philosophy to downplay the

1393
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,500
conversation.

1394
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,660
Well, I don't want to listen to your

1395
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,620
philosophy or something, right, or these other OGs

1396
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,980
or isms or whatever.

1397
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,940
But when you say archaeology, it means it's

1398
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,600
implied that it's true and correct to a

1399
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,720
certain degree, which it's not, by the way.

1400
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,660
It's funny when they pull out 3rd century

1401
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,180
B.C. pottery and they say it's 12

1402
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,000
,000 years old.

1403
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,400
I mean, prove it.

1404
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,400
I mean, the thing is loaded with carbon

1405
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,960
-14.

1406
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,920
It can't be more than .500. Yeah, yeah.

1407
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,760
So it's just really sad.

1408
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,940
But, again, you know why people are endorsing

1409
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,080
this stuff unconditionally.

1410
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,760
What's funny when you go across even financial

1411
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,520
sites and archaeology sites, history sites, these people

1412
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,100
have forums.

1413
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,860
Even computer hackers have a forum.

1414
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,620
If you want to know about what's going

1415
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,180
on with computer hacking, they have a forum.

1416
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,600
Go look at it.

1417
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,640
They're hackers themselves.

1418
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,400
MIRC used to host thousands of channels.

1419
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,420
I'm just that subject alone.

1420
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,760
Yeah.

1421
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,760
So I'm going to move this.

1422
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,960
I'm trying to mute for a moment.

1423
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,080
Okay.

1424
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,700
So I'm going to maybe either say we

1425
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,500
should call it an hour, or do you

1426
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,920
want to delve into anything else?

1427
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,240
I hope I hit people over the head.

1428
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,000
I was going to say, remember when you

1429
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,420
were talking about Genesis and you gave the

1430
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,340
analogy of the starship, which is vast and

1431
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,100
huge, and is it possible that the tree

1432
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,060
was some type of mainframe artifact that the

1433
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,360
ship itself used?

1434
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,900
And I realize this is really a stretch.

1435
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,780
Because I was thinking about the word fruit,

1436
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,360
and if you look at the fruit of

1437
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,120
a laptop, let's say, it's the programming, it's

1438
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,300
the architecture, it's the bearings, it's goods.

1439
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,780
Would that not be somewhat the same analogy?

1440
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,420
It could.

1441
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,000
It could be the writing room.

1442
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,480
Right.

1443
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,080
The word for garden not only means garden,

1444
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,540
it means enclosed area.

1445
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,300
Right.

1446
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,380
A contained area.

1447
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,120
Not separate, which is Kodesh, but gone is

1448
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,520
gone.

1449
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,860
Like vineyards are in a gone.

1450
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,600
Right.

1451
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,860
When you look at an orchard, an orchard

1452
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,420
is a gone.

1453
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,020
I would suggest that the control is at

1454
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,700
the capstone at the top.

1455
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,500
I would suggest.

1456
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,160
We don't know.

1457
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:53,780
Okay, yeah.

1458
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,740
And I found it interesting that this happened.

1459
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,880
They put it as the windy part of

1460
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,140
the day, which leads you to believe there's

1461
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,140
environmental aspects to this whole thing.

1462
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,220
Just a lot of interesting questions came out

1463
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:12,500
of that.

1464
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,180
Yeah.

1465
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm sure it had its own weather system,

1466
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,540
if you make it large enough.

1467
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,520
The ether in there was large.

1468
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,140
It was larger than a small country.

1469
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,560
It would be big.

1470
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,580
It was larger than, you know how in

1471
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,740
American geography they compare size.

1472
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,240
Usually they say it's bigger than the state

1473
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,800
of Rhode Island.

1474
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,160
They use Rhode Island a lot, right?

1475
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,540
Right.

1476
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,660
This was definitely bigger than the state of

1477
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,060
Rhode Island.

1478
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,220
It would have gone from New York to

1479
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,600
Florida.

1480
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,320
It was bigger than the state of Texas,

1481
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,660
right?

1482
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,680
That's huge.

1483
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,440
Remember, only two things come from Texas.

1484
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,520
Right, exactly.

1485
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,780
So I would suggest that talking about the

1486
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,160
Book of Generous, right?

1487
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,520
Like we say, we'll talk about the Book

1488
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,400
of Generous or, you know, when a baby's

1489
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,640
born.

1490
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,840
When a baby's born, they cut the biblical

1491
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,580
cord, right?

1492
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,120
Right.

1493
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,080
So anyway, I mean these things, people need

1494
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,260
to lighten up about it and look at

1495
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,160
what's being said.

1496
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,620
One thing I threw in some comments after

1497
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,180
we did that last Sonic event was with

1498
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:19,440
Sam there, who's also new at this, by

1499
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,280
the way, and not to, you know, say

1500
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,060
I think people like coming on and hearing

1501
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,820
him and I go back and forth.

1502
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,420
But he'll tell you, I mean, all this

1503
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,000
stuff is new.

1504
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,460
He heard the Greek on Freeman, so it's

1505
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,400
been less than a year.

1506
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:32,980
Yeah.

1507
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,760
Actually, perspective.

1508
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,060
He's doing very well for his time well

1509
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,700
spent in it.

1510
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,080
Yeah, he's got as much time in it

1511
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,560
as everyone else, so don't be impressed.

1512
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,200
But he has a good way of articulating

1513
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,520
his own way of saying things.

1514
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,140
So Sam and I have had at least

1515
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,960
100 hours offline communication, you know, I mean

1516
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,060
on private Skype calls.

1517
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,540
Sure.

1518
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,040
So, you know, frequent calling.

1519
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,400
You know, I'm easy to reach and I

1520
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,940
give time freely if I can.

1521
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:01,600
Right.

1522
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,820
But the questions, the things that I threw,

1523
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,680
I believe, or, you know, what's going on

1524
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,240
in there is when you look at the

1525
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,940
book of Genesis, it was done.

1526
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,120
The setting is the Israelites are out of

1527
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,380
Egypt and Moses is in command.

1528
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,300
Right.

1529
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,140
And proof of that is when.

1530
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,740
And there was, well, he was the only,

1531
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,720
well, we just, there are verses in there

1532
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,000
that show that he was in command of

1533
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,060
them in a very unique way where you

1534
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,560
could see verses in there where the gods

1535
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,200
said we choose to speak to Moses face

1536
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,000
to face with other men.

1537
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,080
We just communicate with them through dreams and

1538
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,560
visions, meaning, you know, the other prophets and

1539
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:44,740
stuff.

1540
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,520
Moses, remember when his brother Aaron and his

1541
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,760
sister decided to kick in with Moses and

1542
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,640
they got ousted.

1543
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,180
No, no, you can't just because I'm talking

1544
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,260
to him doesn't mean I want to talk

1545
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,480
to you and she got leprosy.

1546
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,800
Remember, you could read that anyway.

1547
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,240
Right.

1548
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,620
They got kicked to the side, you know.

1549
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,480
So, so anyway, there's stuff going on here.

1550
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,040
This is later on in Exodus.

1551
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,060
I'm speaking on, but book of Genesis was

1552
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,560
penned around there but also you have to

1553
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,120
remember the influence that Moses's wife's father in

1554
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,740
law had yet throw he was a king

1555
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,880
of the area, and just like any king

1556
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,760
you keep records.

1557
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,420
And one aspect he advised Moses on how

1558
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,080
to judge the people or reckon the what

1559
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,260
the people had brought to him.

1560
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,980
And you know, you have you appoint the

1561
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,400
leaders of 10s of leaders of hundreds in

1562
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,240
the leaders of thousands, you know, so it

1563
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,520
would be like, would be like county state

1564
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,260
and federal that's you know that's that's what

1565
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:42,840
that is right.

1566
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,080
The 10s would be the county state would

1567
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,760
be the hundreds and the federal the monarchy

1568
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,820
would be the leader of the thousands, you

1569
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,680
know, and that just means that requests of

1570
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,680
the thousands right.

1571
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,680
And the requests of the hundreds and the

1572
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,080
requests of the tens So he was knowledgeable

1573
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,080
enough to take advice Moses take advice from

1574
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,820
him at Moses did and I would suggest

1575
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,560
that when you look At the genealogies these

1576
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,880
genealogies were written Now they were not written

1577
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,220
on stone because we don't see a repeat

1578
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,640
of verses by the way I think I

1579
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,200
did give a little hint whenever you see

1580
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,260
something written and the sentence is duplex like

1581
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,580
it's You'll see like the cat is black

1582
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,800
and then it says the cat is black

1583
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,640
again, right?

1584
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,080
Yep, that's off the tablet.

1585
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,220
That means that means it's off of a

1586
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,440
stone tablet Yes, or a clay tablet because

1587
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,540
that's how they put them in order The

1588
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,740
last that's first sentence was the last sentence

1589
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,880
of the previous tablets.

1590
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,080
That's how you put them in order, right?

1591
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,120
So Very rudimentary, but usually when it's transcribed

1592
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,800
they they write, you know, they write the

1593
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
whole thing out So it's a kind of

1594
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,400
a neat thing to note, you know, you

1595
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,420
don't see that in Genesis too much if

1596
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,060
not at all So when you get around

1597
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,280
what they call chapter 5 when it states

1598
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,980
This is the book of the genealogies Yes

1599
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,880
Five of Genesis.

1600
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,700
Well, guess what?

1601
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:00,680
All right.

1602
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,280
This is another book within the book another

1603
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,020
book also starts right around chapter 2 that

1604
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,280
no one realizes You know, it's a total

1605
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,060
it's a different.

1606
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,580
It's not much of a book.

1607
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,260
You can have a book.

1608
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,460
That's one page long, right?

1609
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,440
So is it really called a book that

1610
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:15,740
really?

1611
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,980
But if you read Genesis where I've been

1612
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,860
saying this for a very long time over

1613
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,120
a decade if you read Genesis chapter 1

1614
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,620
It shouldn't end where they ended it.

1615
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,120
It should end where it's signified or signed

1616
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,640
off which is around Chapter 2 verse 3

1617
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,560
or 4 or 2 or somewhere around there

1618
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,580
Right where he says things were done and

1619
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,400
then the father's name is used for the

1620
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,720
first time That is another literal writing.

1621
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,980
So that first chapter of Genesis is a

1622
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,700
separate writing When I mean separate writing it

1623
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,920
could be years Separate it could be hundreds

1624
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,080
of years, right?

1625
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,240
We don't know but it's not the same

1626
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,660
document.

1627
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,620
So Genesis is in essence a compilation of

1628
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,700
Various books and it changes again around Noah's

1629
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,800
flood because if you one way to recognize

1630
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,520
that as a look at the blessings of

1631
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,280
the sons of Noah Right.

1632
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,220
Well one son does something bad, but he's

1633
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,860
not cursed his grandson is cursed or his

1634
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,180
son is cursed So, why does that happen

1635
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,040
so we can get into all of that

1636
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,960
and we get into the book of generous,

1637
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:19,800
right?

1638
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,800
So and don't get your biblical cords cut

1639
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,580
one too soon, but yeah Anyway, I would

1640
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,520
suggest that this is an undertaking that is

1641
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,540
beyond me.

1642
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,480
I mean I can do it.

1643
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,900
I know I can do it I don't

1644
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,100
have the inclination to do it directly, you

1645
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,100
know right now, you know, meaning Hey, I'm

1646
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,540
gonna do this presentation and all you guys

1647
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,680
get right, you know, I'm not inclined.

1648
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,120
Actually.

1649
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,620
I think it should be done by others

1650
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,740
My my best work is done by just

1651
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,260
telling people how How badly they've been pranked

1652
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,200
and censored?

1653
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,760
About anything any subject, you know Because you

1654
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,780
remember no matter how much information you put

1655
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,880
out about the ancient Ritz if you're censored

1656
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,340
and pranked It's just gonna irritate you more

1657
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,460
All right, you got the censorship and the

1658
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,320
pranking taken care of first Mindset now this

1659
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:16,760
message.

1660
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,460
Yeah.

1661
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,140
Yeah, the mindset has to be correct.

1662
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,120
Yeah It's not you know, we're not inanimate

1663
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,780
objects like a computer Well, you know, isn't

1664
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,900
it possible to get based on you know,

1665
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,960
the capability any computer and download anything on

1666
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,200
it?

1667
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,340
Correct as long as you take certain CAD

1668
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,600
programs and things we have minimum requirements Let's

1669
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,080
just say, you know, you can download anything

1670
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,180
on any on any machine We're not like

1671
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,460
people are not like that if you are

1672
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,600
being subject to heavy pranking and are just

1673
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,700
endorsing anything that you run into unconditionally Would

1674
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,540
be like a human in malware Yeah, yeah

1675
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,720
walking him malware.

1676
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,640
My my thing is to address the walking

1677
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,440
human malware or those Those that are ready

1678
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,340
to not be under the malware anymore through

1679
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,400
the pranking and the and the censorship and

1680
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,640
also Motivated by penalty is another, you know

1681
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,420
people do things because if they don't do

1682
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,080
them, they'll get in trouble That's not the

1683
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,780
right the good a good reason why you

1684
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,500
should do something You see ultimately that ends

1685
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,860
up being the low level stuff.

1686
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,400
So you I'm thinking Like, you know when

1687
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,800
you when you sift or sort valuable things

1688
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,280
out of junk or like when mining In

1689
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,420
mining, you'll you'll crush ten tons of rock

1690
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,780
just to get an ounce of gold, right?

1691
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,780
All right, you know and and you know,

1692
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,420
they're like, oh they call it a tailings

1693
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,500
pile and a lot of times guys are

1694
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,540
like Oh, yeah, let's go to this tailings

1695
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,400
this mine shut down.

1696
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,340
They have a tailings pile.

1697
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,720
Let's go get what they missed Well, you

1698
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,380
got to do both I like to do

1699
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,980
both I like to get the good stuff

1700
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,800
out right away and then go back to

1701
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
the tailings pile and get whatever is left

1702
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,640
That's valuable, right?

1703
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,940
Oh in any for any subject, you know

1704
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,120
So like recently there was someone with us

1705
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,280
a health issue And what should I do?

1706
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,560
And I said, well, you know do this

1707
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,880
and he says well he'll quick I said

1708
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,300
no that'll take about a month and they

1709
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,220
were shocked because you know, everything else that

1710
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,080
I've given them Advice on medical advice.

1711
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,720
They it was healed and I'm immediately like

1712
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,280
a day or two or three, you know

1713
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,420
stuff That would have taken weeks But this

1714
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,580
time I said this is going to take

1715
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,420
and I had to I haven't really fully

1716
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,100
explained to them.

1717
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:25,340
Why?

1718
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,560
Because it's to me it's obvious, right?

1719
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,020
Because you have two two things working in

1720
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,360
the universe two forces and they're opposing forces

1721
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,100
And it comes to move one is implosive,

1722
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:42,000
which is contractive cooling condensing then the other

1723
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,940
one is explosive force, which is expanding and

1724
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,960
heating and Evaporative and decomposing get the two

1725
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,480
just straight, right?

1726
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,240
So this manifestation this person had was explosive,

1727
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,040
but it was from the inside coming out

1728
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,980
Not from the outside coming in you see

1729
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,440
right so fire would take a month So

1730
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,320
there's not you see there's you see not

1731
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,680
every there is no broad.

1732
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,580
There is no broad brush You know swiping

1733
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,780
every situation with what the Greek says You

1734
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,120
have to learn how to diagnose how to

1735
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,000
discern and all that But I see that

1736
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,940
there is so much censorship and so much

1737
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,940
pranking and so much motivation through penalty that

1738
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,340
yeah Why bother you know, but I know

1739
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,520
that there's some value to be gotten with

1740
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:34,880
some individuals and in some situations so and

1741
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,180
I've been saying the same thing for over

1742
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,740
a decade and There's things that I'd like

1743
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,620
to say and it's just simply not time

1744
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,460
yet Because you have to get the background

1745
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,240
on it And I will be saying those

1746
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,180
things in the future about every about the

1747
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,200
again about the money system about the body

1748
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,640
about how to Eat about scripture and all

1749
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:50,840
that.

1750
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,960
So I'm still a little reserved right It's

1751
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,760
kind of like here's another analogy if you're

1752
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,960
in like a fun park, you know They

1753
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,360
have all the rides and the roller coasters

1754
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,400
and stuff, which by the way, I don't

1755
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,960
like those things make me miserable Right, there's

1756
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,540
no reason, you know, you know, there's no

1757
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,620
reason to rush to one on the other

1758
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,740
side of the you'll get to it Just

1759
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,320
ride this way.

1760
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,120
You know, I don't want this one.

1761
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,060
I'll just go to this one You know,

1762
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,200
it's like it's no big deal.

1763
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,860
You know, if you're really young you want

1764
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,540
the cotton candy?

1765
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,160
I want to go do this ride first,

1766
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,500
you know, and I want to ride it

1767
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,840
again and all that I'm all I'm over

1768
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,440
that you see so yeah, that's why I'm

1769
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,240
back I don't think I was I'm the

1770
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,440
right person to do the scriptural stuff I

1771
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,080
might be more right than others right now

1772
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,740
But we'll see let's give it some time

1773
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:36,500
we'll give it another year or more Yeah,

1774
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,520
I Mean, I do that.

1775
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,320
Anyway, my favorite thing.

1776
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,900
I mean look don't you want to know

1777
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,780
about the gods?

1778
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,780
You know, that's just a rhetorical question and

1779
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,180
who they are and what they've given us

1780
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,740
about Information about them other than look at

1781
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,920
them what they've manifest and knowing their archetypes.

1782
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,760
Yeah, sure Who doesn't well actually a lot

1783
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,540
of people don't but you see so I

1784
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,200
do that every day And I'm constantly meditating

1785
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
on the the you know The books of

1786
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,960
wisdom and all the commandments and all the

1787
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,060
things in there constantly every day There actually

1788
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,220
doesn't go a few a few minutes in

1789
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,320
my waking hours that I do Not think

1790
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,400
of these things but to put them together

1791
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,160
and Do a presentation.

1792
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,740
Yeah that can be done, but I don't

1793
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,120
see it happening at the moment but I

1794
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,600
think little spurious discussions coming across with those

1795
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,560
that have the The ability to ask some

1796
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,280
questions and in to have the insight to

1797
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,240
delve a little further I'm all game for

1798
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:28,440
it.

1799
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,480
Just like you know with you or Sam

1800
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,280
or anyone else, right?

1801
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,780
But but it's it's all it's all right

1802
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:34,900
there.

1803
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,800
I think one of the things that can

1804
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,300
help people out very much With their studies

1805
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
is to just show how simple it is

1806
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,180
You know, it's there the whole time right?

1807
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,060
Why are you you know, just to well

1808
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,620
Oh, here's the thing how to read out

1809
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,840
of a situation how to just constantly read

1810
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,240
out in other words When you go into

1811
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,640
anything, whether it's legal financial health, even what

1812
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,400
you're gonna eat for lunch or scripture or

1813
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,720
whatever Don't deny your emotional desires and your

1814
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,620
personal desires for but re-examine them You

1815
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,860
say is that really what I should be

1816
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,060
doing?

1817
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,400
Just like years ago people used to come

1818
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:09,900
to say Greek.

1819
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,620
I hear you're good with healing and the

1820
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,040
body and all that Well, I've got this

1821
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,480
blah blah blah.

1822
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,460
Oh, hold on.

1823
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:14,880
Hold on.

1824
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,240
Hold on.

1825
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:15,620
Hold on.

1826
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,300
I don't want to know I said the

1827
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,240
only one that knows why you're sick is

1828
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,340
you the reason You didn't slip and fall

1829
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,460
or break something or have a been shot

1830
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,940
with an arrow or burned, you know so

1831
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,540
this is something that is conditional you make

1832
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,700
a list of all the things that you

1833
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,880
normally do and Make a list of all

1834
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,880
the things that you normally don't do and

1835
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,400
should be doing and then switch places Yeah,

1836
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,720
and there's no way you're going to be

1837
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,060
sick because you're sick because of what you'd

1838
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,060
regularly do So what if most of the

1839
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,940
questions and most of the comments that I

1840
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,320
get is still regular?

1841
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,360
So people are still going about how they're

1842
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,780
going about whatever they're doing and they hear

1843
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,580
some interesting Greek speak And then they ask

1844
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,160
a question and it doesn't mix too well

1845
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,520
or it wrestles or it doesn't it can't

1846
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,220
elevate them out of that condition because they're

1847
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,280
still considering what they're doing is what they

1848
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,320
Can't is the only thing that can be

1849
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:12,400
doing so Yeah, only Let's tie that back

1850
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,660
into the book of Genesis, let's say Doing

1851
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,160
a project on it I think Thomas brought

1852
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,780
up doing the the two four hours or

1853
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,660
four two hours or whatever is still just

1854
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,360
scratching the surface But we could do that.

1855
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,340
That's not a bad idea And it have

1856
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,800
to be for the reasons that he stated

1857
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,040
which would which would be great either way

1858
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,280
You know the 50 bucks a person donating

1859
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,040
50 people.

1860
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:34,500
I'd be great.

1861
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,660
I'd bring it or it why not?

1862
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,880
I do 20 hours in Genesis then.

1863
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,020
I mean, you know, no, we're only gone

1864
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,780
to chapter 2.

1865
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,160
But anyway, so then going on Looking at

1866
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,640
for example the book of Genesis and when

1867
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,760
you're getting information on that I'm really not

1868
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,880
saying anything that you you couldn't see yourself

1869
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,560
So there's even more importance there and instead

1870
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,200
of giving the fish called the book of

1871
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,180
Genesis speech or talk or sermon Which all

1872
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,120
means the same How about instead of giving

1873
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,920
you fish showing you how to fish You

1874
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,340
see right Have I ever told you anything

1875
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,860
out of Scripture that you couldn't go and

1876
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,600
find in Scripture?

1877
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,260
It's there for everyone and maybe it's the

1878
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,940
way that I'm explaining and showing it to

1879
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,700
you proving it out, but it's still there

1880
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,280
So how about just having discussions on how

1881
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,700
to prove things out and how to read

1882
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,380
out of something?

1883
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,100
Right, and that wouldn't yeah, that would be

1884
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,520
fair enough.

1885
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:37,680
Yeah I think that there's more value in

1886
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,700
that Well, that's what everybody's people to speed

1887
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,200
a little bit more to and it teaches

1888
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:48,460
discipline All of which is highly needed Well,

1889
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,700
the highest discipline is the anti discipline because

1890
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,960
when you say discipline It means that you've

1891
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,260
borrowed it from somewhere in most people's minds,

1892
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,620
right?

1893
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:57,700
Right.

1894
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,720
So let me give you an example like

1895
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,120
When you say the Bible I was in

1896
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,180
a conversation a little while back these two

1897
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,360
people they have internet presence They're into scientific

1898
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,360
stuff and Walter Ross and I brought up

1899
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:09,640
biblical.

1900
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,120
So no, I don't want that's not biblical

1901
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,580
I grew up in a non-denominational Christian

1902
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:14,900
Church.

1903
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,980
I know Bible said nope.

1904
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,440
You don't know anything in the Bible if

1905
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,280
you know that's really hard for them to

1906
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,400
You might be familiar with this or I've

1907
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,460
heard through principality of some sort But the

1908
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,120
Hobby Lobby billionaires opened up the Bible Museum

1909
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,000
in Washington DC.

1910
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:33,520
Yeah.

1911
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,180
Oh Boy, you know and what I looked

1912
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,460
at it and I was like, yeah Well,

1913
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,760
it's exactly what I've been saying for years

1914
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,120
and years and years Not only are you

1915
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,600
going to have the destruction of Christianity, you

1916
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:45,780
know?

1917
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,540
In other words the destruction of these houses

1918
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,820
of worship and all that and the attendance

1919
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,540
dropping But you're going to have more attention

1920
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,560
to the scripture None of it will be

1921
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,140
accurate like that.

1922
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,200
You you can't have a week in the

1923
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,960
since two years ago every week There's a

1924
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,780
church bombing or a church blown up or

1925
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,560
a church shooting or a church closing down

1926
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,040
go look on the internet every now Yeah,

1927
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,580
but now fast enough But this is what

1928
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,680
and I've talked about this before when I

1929
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,360
used to do the roundtables with Seth years

1930
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,600
ago four or five years Oh, yeah, watch

1931
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:17,980
that.

1932
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,240
And also you're gonna watch the the biblical

1933
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,760
text itself is Going to rise in prominence.

1934
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,500
None of it will be accurate Now in

1935
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,320
other words the reason why churches are being

1936
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,160
Dispossessed and closed and burned or whatever is

1937
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,020
not for the reason why that's happening up

1938
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,740
what you're being told Obviously, it's not like

1939
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,860
some Islamic terrorist or some whatever doesn't know

1940
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,280
the gods are doing this, right?

1941
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,780
All right, because they're tired of it.

1942
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,380
You know, if the gut imagine if the

1943
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,540
gods are tired, but no one's noticing it

1944
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,260
doesn't matter They're still tired of it.

1945
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,820
How do I know that they say it

1946
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,960
read the text?

1947
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,700
So what was your take on this you

1948
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,780
know, you know that you brought that that

1949
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:56,800
place up about the million names That they're

1950
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,600
trying to collect.

1951
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,020
I That was a just like a left

1952
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:01,440
turn.

1953
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,520
Yeah Well, I don't know you mean from

1954
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,260
the Bible Museum is trying to collect Yeah,

1955
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:09,020
you're collecting like millions of names and such

1956
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,300
and I'm like, well, what are you gonna

1957
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,860
do with that?

1958
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,880
Well ask Wells Fargo.

1959
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:13,800
Yeah.

1960
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,899
Oh, well, yeah, you did bring up that

1961
01:08:15,899 --> 01:08:16,240
too.

1962
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:21,740
Yes, I Cross my mind These people look

1963
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,240
anyone public in any religious context right now

1964
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,500
is rotten to the core It doesn't matter

1965
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,960
how much lipstick and a mascara and if

1966
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,040
they got a four thousand dollar suit on

1967
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,620
it doesn't matter There are a few men

1968
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,040
and pig.

1969
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,760
Yeah They are rotten to the core And

1970
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,779
and if it doesn't and the more that

1971
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,960
better they look as human beings, you know

1972
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,380
As people say or moral or whatever I'm

1973
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,220
telling you that is just a strong facade

1974
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,500
Some of them have a weak facade like

1975
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,520
recently I see in the news.

1976
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,380
The Pope is telling reporters inaccurate reporting as

1977
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:52,819
a sin.

1978
01:08:53,260 --> 01:09:03,279
Oh, yeah All the cocaine and Yeah,

1979
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,060
so, you know, I mean it's just sick

1980
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,319
I mean it's just rotten to look I

1981
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,819
mean Yeah, it's just and I'm not saying

1982
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:09,340
it's rotten.

1983
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:09,700
You know what?

1984
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,640
I took the shortcut to find out these

1985
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,000
people are rotten, you know, I got this,

1986
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,100
you know I got the shortcut.

1987
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,420
I read it out of Scripture Right.

1988
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,640
That's how I that's how I figured out.

1989
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,760
These people are rotten to the core, but

1990
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:27,380
they're being used you see so Let's see.

1991
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,340
There's another question that popped up here for

1992
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:33,120
34 about 14 minutes ago or so greetings

1993
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,020
just happened to glance.

1994
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,920
Okay I'm unable to listen live right now

1995
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,140
But if you're looking for discussion topics appreciate

1996
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,460
hearing with the Greek in part regarding emission

1997
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:45,300
theory relative visual and audio perception Appreciate the

1998
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,260
links in chat the other night.

1999
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,720
Okay, the mission theory the You know, you're

2000
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,439
like it your eye gives off light and

2001
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,479
your ear gives off sound.

2002
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,100
That's how you hear and these These organs

2003
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,540
I'll get into it a little bit and

2004
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,020
we'll see if it develops or we'll just

2005
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,820
call it a shorter recording, right?

2006
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,000
Have you ever heard of like people that

2007
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,700
worked on a rigger as riggers or music

2008
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,380
musician?

2009
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,900
band and you know sound people right and

2010
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,360
they do the job for 20 years and

2011
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,940
you know There's a guy walking around in

2012
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,400
his 60s.

2013
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,220
Oh, I worked with Pink Floyd for 20

2014
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,460
years.

2015
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,920
I've lost most of my hearing, right?

2016
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,780
You've heard of that before When they and

2017
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,500
they examine the ear the cochlea and all

2018
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,040
that and whatever and they look at it

2019
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,200
and they look at it There's nothing wrong

2020
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,120
with it.

2021
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,100
Nothing wrong at all, right?

2022
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,460
I think it's a murder Or something, you

2023
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:36,100
know follicles degrading Yeah, but they still can't

2024
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,200
you know, it's not enough though They look

2025
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,160
at Yeah, sometimes they'll say people got better

2026
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,960
hearing than you and their hair follicles are

2027
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,440
almost gone.

2028
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,220
So what's going on?

2029
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,440
Well This is the it goes into the

2030
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,680
realm of Fantasia here.

2031
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,920
But hear me out This is how you

2032
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,180
do therapy, by the way The ear gives

2033
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,160
off sound and it's a carrier sound a

2034
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,060
carrier frequency.

2035
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,680
No, it's beyond frequency.

2036
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,660
It's actually longitudinal Right in many cases it

2037
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,960
does in other words doesn't go far beyond

2038
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,820
the body But it's really intense and because

2039
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,520
you're used to it.

2040
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,540
You don't know it just like you You

2041
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,420
know, how many times have you realized that

2042
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,840
you're walking down the street or walking across

2043
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,280
the room?

2044
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,340
When you're doing so You can describe it,

2045
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,580
but it's not it doesn't fascinate you anymore.

2046
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:27,240
Does it because you're used to Right, whatever.

2047
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,500
So or speaking, you know, you know, there

2048
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,600
was a point in your life where you

2049
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,020
couldn't walk or speak Right, you had to

2050
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,740
develop that okay, so it's developed like that

2051
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,720
and you take it for granted So when

2052
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,960
you have a sound coming in That it

2053
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,160
has to meet that sound and and there's

2054
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,340
no not real funky wave stuff going on

2055
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,240
where they compound or cancel each other out

2056
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,820
But what happens is there is a preponderance

2057
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,600
of sound being emitted by the body and

2058
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,020
a preponderance of sound Coming in that also

2059
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,620
gauges.

2060
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,200
Is it going to be detrimental pleasant or

2061
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,840
negative or positive to your being?

2062
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,600
Right, that's why some people are inclined to

2063
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,420
like certain kinds of music and others are

2064
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,860
not yeah, you heard of that.

2065
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,220
Yes.

2066
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,760
Yeah Okay Like I've heard someone say well,

2067
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,400
I like music, but I can't stand anyone

2068
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
No, no lyrics and no singing in it

2069
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,240
and I'm like what you know other people,

2070
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,920
you know I could see they look real

2071
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,060
formal and they're into heavy metal and other

2072
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,200
people, you know can't listen You see that's

2073
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,300
where that makes a big difference on your

2074
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,380
preference and taste.

2075
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,280
Yeah Yes, the same the same with the

2076
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,980
eye how many times do you heard someone

2077
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,860
say oh I don't like the way that

2078
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,580
looks right Or the same thing someone else

2079
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,160
was that I like the way that looks

2080
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,320
or that color Which obviously heard what's your

2081
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,020
favorite color?

2082
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:46,820
Yeah, I Because you have a specialized emission

2083
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:47,580
from the eye.

2084
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,680
There's a guy named Ross or something in

2085
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,180
the 20s.

2086
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:53,540
It was a psychotherapist and He said that

2087
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,180
the eye remits light and he set up

2088
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,960
a black box that people put their face

2089
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,700
in and it had a Photoelectric relay and

2090
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,080
they told him just stare at this just

2091
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,500
look forward and he would they would set

2092
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,820
off the relay, right?

2093
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,700
You know, it was a very sensitive one

2094
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,180
You saw him look right and just by

2095
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:10,740
the moment.

2096
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,600
He's into chromotherapy and all that what you

2097
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,260
brought up before too, which is Another one

2098
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,140
that's just Mind-blowing Gaudi Aldi and Babbitt

2099
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,440
century and Dinshaw Gaudi Aldi Dish I got

2100
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:27,960
all these play.

2101
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,140
I like to bring him up because in

2102
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,560
the 1930s he had a house on the

2103
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,820
Jersey Shore and The the FDA I think

2104
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,320
was new then and they were going against

2105
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,600
him and he kept beating them in quarter

2106
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,140
He beat them once on the suit.

2107
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,960
So they Either he read in the paper.

2108
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:43,940
I think he was gone or he was

2109
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,920
and then arrived later that his house Which

2110
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,260
was also his lab burned down And that's

2111
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,020
what they put in the in the paper,

2112
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,580
and that sounds pretty plausible Right.

2113
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,880
Yeah that happened, but it also sounds plausible

2114
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,120
that it was an accident but no the

2115
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,700
eyewitnesses in the neighborhood said an army plane

2116
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,700
flew really low and dropped something on the

2117
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,140
house and Then it caught on fire right

2118
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,200
a little bit different Yeah, yeah, so I

2119
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:11,980
mean that interesting.

2120
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,300
I mean you get the because by the

2121
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,020
way the American military is for hire by

2122
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,320
the way Oh, yes, they are Yeah, and

2123
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,060
if you've got enough cash you could legitimately

2124
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,020
do it you go through the JAG you

2125
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,320
go through the attorneys there and they Set

2126
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,400
up a contract and they do it and

2127
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,940
you have to pay for all that stuff

2128
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,480
and make sure there's no blowback You know

2129
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,340
that right?

2130
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,160
Yeah, there have been several.

2131
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,520
I'm not going to talk about it now

2132
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,100
Maybe in the future, but I'd like not

2133
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,120
to the several cases where the Air Force

2134
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,900
was used on people I mean, I'm not

2135
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,080
talking about Waco now.

2136
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,280
That was different.

2137
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,520
That's governor gave up the National Guard I'm

2138
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,120
talking about straight-up f-16s coming in

2139
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,660
and you know shooting a missile at someone

2140
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,440
and there was call then it was called

2141
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,960
a Gasline exploded and you know those, you

2142
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,300
know Then like all of a sudden you

2143
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,000
see all these photographs of these old pipe

2144
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,820
that after the truck showed up This was

2145
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,960
the gas line that exploded.

2146
01:14:59,180 --> 01:14:59,280
Sure.

2147
01:14:59,420 --> 01:14:59,600
Yeah.

2148
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,360
Yeah.

2149
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,580
So anyway Yeah, it's pretty pretty crazy bunch

2150
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:09,560
of people on this planet Fix this country

2151
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,140
or no, they're not gonna fix anything.

2152
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,480
It's gonna be just the way it is

2153
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,460
until it's not So I didn't get much

2154
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,060
into the eye in the in the ear

2155
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,700
because you know I really don't know enough

2156
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:23,120
to really pontificate on it and tell you

2157
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,580
this is what's going on And this is

2158
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,640
what we can do about it.

2159
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,200
It's a fascinating start.

2160
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:31,040
That's for that's for sure and And it

2161
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:36,060
does require more and more research in It's

2162
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,040
extremely subtle Yeah, because if you're going to

2163
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,540
measure make the compression devices I call them,

2164
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,580
you know measuring tools to measure it you

2165
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,220
think about how clean or how?

2166
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,280
Neutral the environment has to be to pick

2167
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,220
up such a subtle effect Light coming out

2168
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,840
of the eye and sound coming out of

2169
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,740
the ear, right?

2170
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,840
You know some that's why sometimes people you're

2171
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,100
I hear ringing in my ear and especially

2172
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,420
if it's not in the head where it's

2173
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,660
just One ear left or right like when

2174
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,780
I have someone around me if I hear

2175
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,800
ringing in the right ear I tell them

2176
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,780
put your ear against my ear.

2177
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,560
Do you hear ringing?

2178
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,060
Because that ring that ringing is not not

2179
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,340
just neuro it's actually audible it could yeah,

2180
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,040
you can actually you can actually yeah Oh

2181
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,080
my wow You ever hear anyone saying I

2182
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,420
ring in my ear get someone I'll stick

2183
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,660
a microphone in there Very young.

2184
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,380
Yeah, or if it's sensitive enough and you

2185
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,400
will pick up a sound not I know

2186
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,460
in some cases that tinnitus and all that

2187
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:27,940
is different.

2188
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,240
This is that's a swelling That's a glandular

2189
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,060
swelling and it pushes on which then produces

2190
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,920
a sound and then goes to the next

2191
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,080
nerve Here's the other thing of other people

2192
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,920
say, oh, yeah, this is a nerve thing.

2193
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,280
Yeah, but how does it work a mechanism

2194
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:39,740
works?

2195
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,080
Just you can't just chalk it off as

2196
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,820
it's the nerves.

2197
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,520
No, it's good.

2198
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,760
So we've got to trigger it now Now

2199
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,360
the nerve actually has the output and then

2200
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,740
that's picked up by another nerve and it

2201
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,300
goes down because if it's just the nerve

2202
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,420
That doesn't it's like if you sit on

2203
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,760
a microphone, it doesn't make make any sound

2204
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,320
It needs it needs an input it needs

2205
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,480
an analog input there is there is an

2206
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,760
animal function And this is still not comprehended

2207
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,640
But these little things that I've brought out

2208
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,620
if you have a deep Understanding of how

2209
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,540
the body works and you add that to

2210
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:08,660
it.

2211
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,420
You'll probably be able to render some good

2212
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:13,100
therapy Yes, yes.

2213
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,480
Oh You know, how about you know recording?

2214
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,260
Well the fact that we're inductive says a

2215
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:24,640
lot And that's on every aspect of the

2216
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,740
whole human body.

2217
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,080
Oh for God's sakes you take a lifetime

2218
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,920
Which That's where the potluck or thing comes

2219
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,000
in you everybody brings something to the table

2220
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,320
Yeah, something that took four hours to cook

2221
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,820
you just show up with it So, you

2222
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,920
know, we don't have to wait the four

2223
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,040
hours, you know, bring bring what you cooked

2224
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,580
up already, you know And that's used in

2225
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,420
a negative sense, right?

2226
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,380
You cooked something up.

2227
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,840
So But bring it bring bring it forward.

2228
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,920
Yeah there was a program that I was

2229
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,400
While I used to use a long time

2230
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
back where it was like a radio station

2231
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:03,600
Walkie-talkie kind of setup and you could

2232
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,660
have many people come in and it was

2233
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,860
just basically push-to-talk kind of stuff

2234
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,400
one in the only way that it would

2235
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,940
work is one person could talk at a

2236
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,680
time and Usually took a pause in between

2237
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,100
but you had the ability to have large

2238
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,540
amounts of people Contribute at once and I

2239
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,400
might just dig back into that again.

2240
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,820
That might be something of use But maybe

2241
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,860
perhaps in the future and you can privatize

2242
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:29,980
it.

2243
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,300
Keep it to yourself and only the people

2244
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,960
who know where it is can get in

2245
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,960
and It's an online thing like it is.

2246
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,900
It is an online thing.

2247
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,520
I believe it was called Zello Zello was

2248
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,200
what it was called caught with the call

2249
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,120
letters on that Zello it's an application.

2250
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,740
It can work on a computer or your

2251
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,980
silly rectangle devices and Okay, yeah quite the

2252
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,980
interesting feature I set up one a long

2253
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,200
time back and I think it's still active

2254
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,760
to this day I haven't really used it

2255
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,540
in years, but I know it's still there

2256
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,260
But uh, yeah, it was quite the quite

2257
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,320
the fascinating little piece of the architecture Could

2258
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,980
be of use for us somehow some way

2259
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:17,020
somewhere And can always be recorded if needed.

2260
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,700
I think that's just as easily possible with

2261
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,760
the with this program Yeah speaking of before

2262
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,780
we check off I got the Greek speak

2263
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,760
Chetango open and it shows about 10 sometimes

2264
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,300
11 If someone would if they could hear

2265
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,360
us if anyone's on chat I'll give them

2266
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:37,020
the 20 seconds just type even just something

2267
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,960
I could hear you or yes in the

2268
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,460
chat box to see if it's integrating or

2269
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,520
facing off well with the chat or it

2270
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,740
just happens to be out of consequence or

2271
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,360
Coincidence coinciding that there are that many people

2272
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,700
on chat right so if you're on chat,

2273
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:55,340
but it is a message Put in and

2274
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,700
see We have exactly 10 anonymous users at

2275
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:03,580
this point And let me check the stats

2276
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:06,940
on the stream here and At this moment

2277
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:10,200
we have one two three four five people

2278
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,660
listening So it's always good.

2279
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,460
Oh, that's good enough.

2280
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,880
Yeah, so in other words.

2281
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,580
We're still hot.

2282
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:16,980
We're still We're hot.

2283
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,940
Oh, yeah, I've got Stream running in the

2284
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,180
background just to make sure that and periodically

2285
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:26,330
when I'm muted Okay, just like right now

2286
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:27,490
right just like night.

2287
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,470
Yeah, and there she is yeah, okay.

2288
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,690
Yeah, she's good.

2289
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:33,810
Okay good Yeah, just curious because it's checking

2290
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:34,730
on the technology.

2291
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,470
It's not a van.

2292
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:35,930
You know.

2293
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,550
Yeah, so it does cause we saying yes

2294
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,330
Okay, cool.

2295
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:44,430
Greetings cause would be All right If there's

2296
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,710
not anything else, it's just call it call

2297
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,950
it an hour and a half, right?

2298
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:50,110
I'm gonna edit out what would you like

2299
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:51,990
those to title this for today?

2300
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:55,410
Not any oh, yeah, I'll let you pick

2301
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:55,930
it this time.

2302
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,130
Oh I'm not sure I didn't know that

2303
01:20:59,130 --> 01:20:59,970
they were being titled.

2304
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,670
I'm I think I've been titling them in

2305
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:06,490
rather Interesting format I think last one was

2306
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,470
Greek salmon.

2307
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:11,710
I and Okay, yeah, oh that's that's an

2308
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:14,170
easy one just about what are you endorsing?

2309
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:14,870
Yeah.

2310
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:15,730
Oh good one.

2311
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:22,710
Very nice I mean very good Yeah Whenever

2312
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:27,070
you get just give someone An unconditional endorsement

2313
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:28,030
with no conditions.

2314
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:32,230
Yes You're giving them in this particular plane

2315
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,670
as the New Agers say or this Society

2316
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:37,170
or the people that are alive today and

2317
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,890
have been alive Before you are going to

2318
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:44,270
be Let's just say screwed shafted Manipulated.

2319
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:49,390
Yeah And there are entire agencies corporations and

2320
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:53,350
entire societies like the legal society financial society

2321
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:57,410
banking society medical society Religious society that are

2322
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:01,830
set up Everything To take of your unconditional

2323
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,630
endorsement.

2324
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,570
Yeah, and I remember once O'Chelle asked

2325
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:05,590
me what do you mean by endorsement?

2326
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,750
I just shook my head and I was

2327
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,270
like, never mind.

2328
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,530
Let's just go on to the next thing

2329
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,190
Yeah, you know you're doing it all the

2330
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,230
time and you don't know what it is.

2331
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,450
Perfect example, right?

2332
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,750
Yeah humanity, so Figure out what that you

2333
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,390
know, people use it loosely in language.

2334
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,850
Also, I endorse that you know, or you're

2335
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:25,450
franchising Chasing so so this is an interesting

2336
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:30,970
thing to consider How because it's all based

2337
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,890
on the conspiracy theory known as taxation that

2338
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,890
is a conspiracy theory that is the bankers

2339
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:40,350
quasi government agencies what's left of the government

2340
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:44,110
and Other societies that have all conspired together

2341
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:48,370
To get the public to believe that when

2342
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,950
they pay taxes That's a putting that in

2343
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:54,950
air quotes That is actually the fundamental underlying

2344
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:58,010
economic underpinning of the services They get public

2345
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:58,530
services.

2346
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:02,070
That is It is not And it's not

2347
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,410
at all.

2348
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,550
All of that is just taken from you

2349
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,650
as a use fee I used to research

2350
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,630
what they were using the money they collect

2351
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,490
for and then I stopped because I I

2352
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,330
got some blowback and Also, I got you

2353
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:13,990
know, it's some dead ends that I didn't

2354
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,450
want to turn around and start all over

2355
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:18,230
Mm-hmm, but they can't use it Like

2356
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:19,770
when you if you show up to a

2357
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,770
taxing authority say hey you guys I you

2358
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:22,990
told me I owe you a thousand bucks

2359
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:23,670
Here's a thousand bucks.

2360
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,450
No, no, no, no.

2361
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:25,870
No, you can't just do that.

2362
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:27,930
You have to fill out a form Because

2363
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,530
they take the check the check gets thrown

2364
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,050
out in the garbage They can't use that

2365
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,490
then they take the other The the form

2366
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,470
that you fill out and deposit that that's

2367
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,810
where the current the funds come out of

2368
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:37,810
the form signatures.

2369
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:44,650
Yeah Yes, yes Endorsement Yeah, now you're the

2370
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,130
bank, you know now when the taxing authority

2371
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,870
takes the the tax check and throws it

2372
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,710
in the garbage They tell the bank They

2373
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,350
get the information up to tell the bank

2374
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,070
that you wrote the check off of that

2375
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,470
they did that and the bank your own

2376
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:57,490
Bank, then takes a thousand on keeps it

2377
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,130
themselves and you think that it went to

2378
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:04,230
the taxing authority Because there's another fascinating subject

2379
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,890
on the cage code and where that money

2380
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:08,410
went after it was taken out and held

2381
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,570
and Yeah, you get a bank statement and

2382
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,470
it shows you where you know Not only

2383
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,410
you know the statement with the the activity

2384
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,310
on the account and where you spent it,

2385
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:20,690
you know circle K this bank utility It

2386
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,290
doesn't say that it actually they sent them

2387
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:22,610
anything.

2388
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,530
It just says they were notified by them,

2389
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,190
right?

2390
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:30,830
carefully notifications So you you swipe the card

2391
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:32,530
you get, you know Ten bucks at the

2392
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,390
convenience store and you see that on the

2393
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:37,370
statement that the bank is nowhere Don't you're

2394
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,990
presuming the bank sent them the money?

2395
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:44,850
Yeah Yeah that institution notified them that you

2396
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:46,570
swipe the card so that bank now has

2397
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:48,810
to take out the money that's visible to

2398
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:51,570
you So to keep plausibility going but that

2399
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:54,250
money never left bank So they used to

2400
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,730
say assuming makes an ass out of you

2401
01:24:56,730 --> 01:25:00,490
and me that's right and this Yeah, if

2402
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,530
the planet is full of asses, can you

2403
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,390
call them asses?

2404
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,230
I mean, it's it's actually a downgrade on

2405
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,590
the real asses, which are correct and the

2406
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:11,790
donkey So this is really that that's why

2407
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,530
I've said before this is you you're in

2408
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:18,630
an unreal big unrehabilitated Unrehabilitatable condition can't fix

2409
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:18,930
it.

2410
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,850
You just have to it's kind of like

2411
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:23,250
the junk cars now Society and the whole

2412
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,710
surface not the planet itself, but what you've

2413
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,170
done with it you ever go to a

2414
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,450
junkyard and they put the car in the

2415
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:32,010
crusher and You know, they haven't quite hit

2416
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,650
the lever yet to make it into a

2417
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,270
ball of steel But you know at that

2418
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,530
point who's thinking let's get some Bondo and

2419
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,270
some new parts and make it a let's

2420
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,930
bring it back Yeah, only an idiot think

2421
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,010
that it's already in the and it just

2422
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:46,130
didn't get to the crusher because it's a

2423
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:48,890
mistake or a coincidence There was a lot

2424
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,130
of determinations made before I got to that

2425
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:53,770
condition Right, and it's not fixable.

2426
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,690
It was considered unfixable way before it got

2427
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,650
to the crusher right now You're at the

2428
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:00,030
crusher and they're ready to pull the lever

2429
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,730
the gods are you ain't gonna fix anything?

2430
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,950
Best thing you could do is if you're

2431
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:06,270
near it just you know, look the other

2432
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,710
way So a piece of glass might shoot

2433
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:09,990
out or whatever, you know, or a piece

2434
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,690
of shard and catch some shrapnel, you know

2435
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,870
So that's yeah, it's not fixable, you know,

2436
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:18,090
the way The redo is yeah, you're waiting

2437
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,790
for the ultimate This is what people are

2438
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,850
waiting for and they don't know it the

2439
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,390
ultimate police state but it won't be done

2440
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:26,190
by a bunch of sniveling ignorant cops and

2441
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:29,710
Law enforcements or whatever you call police state,

2442
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,310
you know military or whatever No, no, no,

2443
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:33,150
it's gonna be done by the gods and

2444
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:34,610
they're gonna be benevolent, right?

2445
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:37,230
Get ready for a non privacy state.

2446
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:39,250
You will know you will have no secrets

2447
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,850
at all You don't have any secrets right

2448
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,310
now to those that matter Anyway, can you

2449
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,230
tell someone a secret or put something away

2450
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,470
that you're gonna hide from the gods or

2451
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,290
the angelic beings?

2452
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:51,390
No All right, don't they matter more than

2453
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,150
what people do?

2454
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:54,270
Yes, so if this is going to be

told right now You're gonna have a new

2457
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:57,710
world order.

2458
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,090
Yes, you are, but it's not going to

2459
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,850
be the one they now these are things

2460
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:05,150
to look forward to a Global level police

state a no privacy state and a new

2462
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,590
world order, but it's not going to be

2463
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,390
run by men It's going to be run

2464
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:14,790
by the gods and that's how the restarts

2465
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:23,950

how to read it.

2468
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:26,630
Isn't that funny?

01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:28,950
Well, they see it But they all they

2470
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:31,190
do is snivel and complain about it based

2471
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:33,210
on the censorship and based on the poor

2472
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:41,850
input that they've got So, all right Yeah,
