1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:10,300
I'm one of the last people to work with him to take his methodologies, which were from Reichensteiner to advancing it.

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:19,800
What you see on YouTube and a lot of methodologies were like cell phones in the 80s or 90s, and now we've taken it up to current advancement.

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,480
It got to the point with Trevor that I was sending him devices and he says, well, I don't know how it works.

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,420
I mean, I don't understand what you're doing, but it works even better.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,400
So it got to the point where the student, you know, the master was now the student.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:46,960
So I felt very humbled and at the same time exalted to be able to take it to the next level where at this point, we have full spectrum dominance over the weather on this planet.

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:57,440
And I say we, whoever we is, you know, you can guess, I've done demonstrations for quote unquote, government people, and they just give you an example.

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,940
I did 15 demonstrations.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,480
I drove a couple of colonels back to drinking because they had bet that if I did, I got three out of the 15, that was the real deal.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,040
I got 13 out of 15.

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:27,700
So demonstrations, you know, like, you know, they pick a city and then like make it rain here and it was the middle of the dry season or, you know, there's rain here, stop it or throw down a tornado here or make a hurricane there or stop a hurricane here, you know, and it's like, OK.

12
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:42,260
So, yeah, I just I don't mind saying at this point, you know, because it's just everything is just so ridiculous at this point that anything that's sane or duplicatable, technically accessible, that sounds fantastic.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,540
You know, it sounds ridiculous.

14
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:52,440
So but it's it's about being a technical, technically accessing, you know, anyone can do it, you know, if you know if you know what's going on.

15
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:59,260
So, yeah, but someone else they could speak up if they want to introduce themselves or just listen either way.

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Hey, my name's Matthew.

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,620
Hey, Matthew.

18
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,220
Good to have you.

19
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,940
Cool.

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,600
Thanks.

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,380
I'd rather just listen if that's all right with you guys.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,460
Mm hmm.

23
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,780
OK, so I just want to give a little bit of a spoiler.

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:21,790
Some of the stuff that I had kind of penciled in to discuss only because about 90 percent of the emails that I get privately are regarding explaining what's called scripture or Bible and things like that.

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:36,180
And again, I was prefacing earlier, I think it'll it'll show up on the audio that it's just the most amazing thing to be amazed about is how you go on something called the Internet or the stupid rectangle or whatever.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,540
And you notice how no one has picked up on what is obvious yet.

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,320
I mean, all the stuff being discussed is just a dummy load.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:58,700
And also, I just want to, you know, I appreciate Chuck Ocelli's, you know, putting up with me for 60 hours and all that, you know, for him to get away from the dummy load he usually delivers and go go to something like this and then obviously go back to it.

29
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,280
It was a big jump for him.

30
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,740
You know what I mean?

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,440
So but it put out quite a bit of really good stuff.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:18,820
It's just sitting there and, you know, and here's the other aspect of it is there's a lot of, quote unquote, academia that doesn't get a lot of play on the it gets a lot of play on the Internet, by the way, academia.

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,260
But even if you go look at the academic circles about the subjects brought up in Greek speak, they fail miserably as well.

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:41,380
So I'm just trying to get pieces together on how to continue presenting things, anything or any things in a very simple way that anyone can, you know, be edified by it.

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:53,900
And I get stupefied myself when I see how little information of quality there is being put out, you know, in public or on what's called the what I call the stupid rectangle, you know, the Internet, the computer.

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,580
So, you know, from that point of view, then, you know, why not to start hitting on the things of order of importance?

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,180
Now, give you an example.

38
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:15,980
A few weeks ago, there was a group of people that met in what's called Idaho, and they demonstrated not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but about six what's called free energy devices that work.

39
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,340
And the one and the one that's the most easy to access of it is the the energy machine of Joseph Newman.

40
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,920
You know, so this stuff has been around.

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,160
It's provable and all that.

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,440
Right.

43
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,240
But still, you have people looking for free energy.

44
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,240
You get my point.

45
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,780
Yeah, it exists.

46
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,280
I mean, it's just that do you want to get into it?

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,620
You want to go down and let me just share an experience.

48
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,880
Could you imagine that you could read between the lines?

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:53,760
It's about one or two a.m. in the morning and you get a knock on the door and you look outside and there's like a semi SWAT team type cops, heavily armored body cams, the whole thing.

50
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,480
And they're like, well, we got a suicide call from this address.

51
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,320
And you're like, well, that's not possible because there's no phone here.

52
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,820
Well, it was from a disabled cell phone from about 300 yards in this area.

53
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,520
Really.

54
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,760
So this is the only house that you decide to knock on.

55
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,420
Interesting.

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,280
This is what we'd like to come inside and see if you look around because it was a suicide call.

57
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,520
Right.

58
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,040
So you're like, well, OK, why don't you come on and look through?

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,440
And they just march on through, you know, with all their heavy armor and machine guns and all that.

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,740
Yes.

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,380
And then walk out and say, well, thanks.

62
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,560
Have a good night.

63
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,140
So this is the kind of stuff you end up to read between the lines and who that happens to.

64
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,360
Right.

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,940
So so this is the type of society you live in because, you know, eventually, you know, you could be suicidal anyway.

66
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,860
I'm not going to I'm not a conspiracy type or whatever, you know, thing.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,380
But that's already been shown.

68
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:00,380
So so the thing here is it's all just one big kind of like prank prankaliciousness that I call it, you know, from one level to another.

69
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:10,480
So, again, one thing that the reason I've been holding back is just I've got to just wipe my brow and say, like, what the hell is going on on this planet and just take a break?

70
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,100
And again, just to reiterate, I promised a sonic event soon after the solos I was doing on AFR.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,980
And then I said, well, let me take a week off.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,920
And I started looking around.

73
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,880
I said one week became two weeks and three weeks and four weeks.

74
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,540
And I know there's interest.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,760
I know there's plenty of interest, but I don't really see it.

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,980
And I think that enough has been said that even if no more was said, it would be pretty honky dory, like they say.

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,480
But I think more should be said, because like I mentioned before, I've had a I remember listening to an old radio broadcaster from the 50s.

78
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:52,320
He says, never share more than 10 percent of what you found out in public, you know, and but you could hide all of it in the public library.

79
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:11,760
Right, so so let's let's just continue, I wanted to just throw another spoiler, perhaps, on the biblical text, and because it has nothing to do, I think if anyone spends 15 minutes researching the history of the biblical text, you'll find it has nothing to do with any religion on the planet right now.

80
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,180
Right now.

81
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,440
Now, notice, I didn't say that there are other religions that have hijacked it.

82
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,120
No, but there but the text itself has nothing to do with any religion.

83
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,300
Now, there's plenty of evidence that there are other religions that have hijacked it.

84
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:31,540
Plenty of groups of religions and sorts that have hijacked it and are telling you things that are supposed to be out of there that you will not find in their characters, events or anything.

85
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,100
So I just want to make that clear.

86
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,600
And and and I never recommend that anyone go and read or study the biblical text, contrary to what most people say.

87
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,000
And the reason why I never recommend anyone go read it or study it is because if you tried, you don't understand a dang thing in it.

88
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,340
So why would I tell you to do that?

89
00:07:52,300 --> 00:08:00,980
But you see, so the other point here is why not start having a legitimate, rational discussion on what is really there and then see what happens.

90
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,700
Right.

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:23,580
So one of the spoilers, again, I wanted to give is how to comprehend prophecy and the same way you understand if you're, let's say, traveling on the earth in a motorized engine driven wagon, which is a car, if they want you to slow down, they'll show you a sign showing a very low speed limit.

92
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,860
And if you miss that sign, they'll put a speed bump in front of you to make you feel it that you should be slowing down.

93
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,140
Right.

94
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,780
And that's what happens very often when you read a lot of these ancient texts.

95
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:43,080
I wanted to give an example and explain it just to kind of like see how people would expand in their own studies with it, because there's many examples I can give.

96
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,380
I'll just give this one because it's pertinent, because it also ties into what's called geopolitics.

97
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,860
Now, let's just call it a verse.

98
00:08:49,860 --> 00:09:02,960
Now, I don't like if you ever heard me discuss biblical texts, I'll never give chapter and verse like these, you know, who's do because they sound like preachers, McMinisters, like you when they they all they always shout a verse at you.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,820
And it sounds like to me when they start shouting verses and chapters, all I hear is two old beef patty, special sauce, cheese, lettuce and a sesame seed bun.

100
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,820
That's all I hear when they start all these, you know, Christian, I call them pastors, McMinisters, Mick, whatever, Mick churches.

101
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,100
That's what it sounds like.

102
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh, yeah.

103
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,700
You ever hear like Matthew 25, 17, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

104
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm like two old beef patties, special sauce.

105
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,460
I was like, what the hell are these?

106
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,900
You know, if you want to, you know, you know, if you want to do your demonology, go ahead.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
But, you know, say it is so, you know.

108
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,820
But anyway, that's what it is, by the way.

109
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,520
When they do that, it's a form of spell casting.

110
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,180
They don't know it.

111
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,920
But but so the verse or the part that I'm going to be explaining is in what's called the book of Isaiah.

112
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,280
It's around the first chapter.

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,580
And I know I don't study it in chapter and verse.

114
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,260
Very often when I have conversations with people on the biblical texts, I'll say like, you know, in the book of Isaiah, such and such.

115
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,600
And they're like, well, what's the chapter and verse?

116
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm like, heck, I don't know.

117
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,020
It's around the middle somewhere of the book, you know, because that that's how it's supposed that you either know it or you don't.

118
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,940
You know, how many times people watch a movie and are like, remember in The Matrix at exactly one hour, 32 minutes and 43 seconds?

119
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,060
Like who talks like that?

120
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:13,900
Right.

121
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,020
It's like, you remember in The Matrix or on the office building or whatever, you know, yeah, I remember that, you know, you know, one, you know.

122
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,360
So one thing I tell people is you either know it or you don't.

123
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,420
And forget about this, this demonology that's been put on humanity for hundreds of years.

124
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,880
Or the McPreachers, the McMinisters, the two old beef patty special sauce, you know, cheese kind of crap.

125
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,320
And not to use McDonald's as a reference.

126
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,580
But yeah, they and the only reason I use McDonald's as reference is because their own CEO publicly says they're crap.

127
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,800
So if he says they're crap, I can say they're crap, I guess, you know, even though I'm not a stockholder.

128
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,020
So let's go back to the verse.

129
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,760
It's in the first what's called the first chapter of Isaiah.

130
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,780
And if you look, I think it's in the middle of that chapter, down the middle or a little past.

131
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:12,380
It says something like, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges or your judges of old.

132
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,320
And then you will be known as a righteous people.

133
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,800
Now, let me repeat that.

134
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,400
That sounds very benign, doesn't it?

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,420
Most people will just read over that and keep reading.

136
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:21,680
Right.

137
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,060
He says, when I return you into the land, I will restore to you your former judges or some version, say the judges of old.

138
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,720
It's actually pretty close to the original text.

139
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,120
And then he says, and then you will be known as a righteous people.

140
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,060
Right.

141
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,320
So let's just look at that.

142
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,140
So they meaning the Israel as a political group, you know, where they set up borders known as Israel.

143
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,340
And they're going to be ruled by judges like they were in the past.

144
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,560
Like, in other words, when they went into the land, they were not ruled by kings or ruled by judges, as you see in the Book of Judges.

145
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,800
Right.

146
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,560
And as long as they have, you know, and then they will be known.

147
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,880
In other words, after this period of judges, they will be known as a righteous people.

148
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,220
So that means that during this period, they will not be known as righteous.

149
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,620
Right.

150
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,980
So if we look at the verse again and how it's prophetic and geopolitics now, by the way, I get a lot of flack.

151
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,560
Well, the people that are in Israel now are not the real Israel.

152
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
So that's not the point.

153
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,980
The point.

154
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,680
This is a geopolitical issue of how the people are viewed, whether they're in Israel or not.

155
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,220
You see.

156
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,200
So let's go look at this again.

157
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,560
When I return you back, this is in the first chapter of Isaiah, near the end somewhere.

158
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:42,160
When I return you back to the land, I will restore to you your former judges of old and then you will be known as a righteous people.

159
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,480
OK, let's go look at this now.

160
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,320
So they're sort of established as a nation again in around 1948, 49, actually sooner than that.

161
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
But let's say 48, 49, commonly accepted.

162
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,880
And they're ruled by prime ministers.

163
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,300
Now, a minister is a judge and a prime minister is a head judge.

164
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,100
So whenever you see a country ruled by a prime minister, that is a judgeship ministerial position.

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,960
Now, for example, a country that has a prime minister as their top dog is also has a president.

166
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,600
But you don't hear about it because they have that the president signs all the executive orders.

167
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,180
If you look this up on your own, you'll see, like, for example, who rules Israel?

168
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,420
It's the head of the party, Netanyahu, who is the prime minister.

169
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,940
But if you research who is the president of Israel, they will show you there is also a president.

170
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,420
Most people are not aware of this, right?

171
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,140
Because the president is the president that signs the executive orders for the corporation and all that.

172
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,020
So you could look it up.

173
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,340
I don't know who the president is right now, but he's some bloke sitting there, you know, doing, you know, pen.

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,600
OK, so Israel is now being ruled by prime judges or prime ministers.

175
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:03,200
Now, what's interesting is if we go back to the prophetic aspect of this, when Israel initially went into the land with the Book of Judges, they were ruled by a roughly 14 to 16 judges.

176
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,700
That means whether, you know, you count Joshua as one of them or Moses or such, but not really.

177
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,480
So we say specifically around 14 to 15 judges ruled ancient Israel.

178
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,820
Now, if we look at the judges of ancient Israel, we will see something interesting because the first three were men.

179
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,760
And the fourth judge of ancient Israel was a woman, Deborah.

180
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,320
Now, if we look at modern Israel, we will see the first three prime ministers are men.

181
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,280
But the fourth one is a woman, Golda Meir, Grandma Moses.

182
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:47,700
And the only woman to ever be prime minister of Israel, because Israel never had, only had one woman or female as a judge, you see, or a prime minister.

183
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,180
So we have a repeat.

184
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,400
Now, Netanyahu is the 12th position.

185
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,520
So we have one more, and then we have the 14th position, which was Samson.

186
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:05,000
Now, what's interesting, if you read in the Book of Judges, a lot of them only get one or two verses attributing to their judgeship or ruling of Israel.

187
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,240
But when you get to Samson, he's like the bulk of the book, you know, in terms of what's dedicated and like Samson and Delilah fame.

188
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,500
Right.

189
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,580
All right.

190
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,300
The Nazarene.

191
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,600
So so the Nazarite oath and all that.

192
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,740
So with the hair, you know, everyone, even storybooks have been made about it.

193
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,680
What's interesting about Samson, it was all about the engagement with the Philistines.

194
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,520
When I say engaging the Philistines, I don't mean like fiancee getting married, but there was a lot of dynamicism between them.

195
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:40,500
OK, so what you're going to see in the next, not Netanyahu, but the next prime minister and the one after him will take the position of Samson.

196
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:50,420
That's why very often I've said there is going to be carnage in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians that has never even been imagined.

197
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,200
Forget about what you what you've seen in the past.

198
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,660
Right.

199
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,380
And he will probably also perish.

200
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:06,900
And then the prime minister that comes after that one will probably be very spiritual, more like someone like Eli, because what I'm trying to say is the prime ministers of modern Israel are a repeat of ancient Israel's judges.

201
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,740
Now, here's the kicker to the end of the verse.

202
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,400
Remember, the verse in Isaiah says, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you will be known as a righteous people.

203
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,900
Now, as long as Israel has prime ministers, they will not be known as a righteous people.

204
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:33,480
How many times now do you hear, oh, the Jews, oh, the Israel, the Zionists or this or that constantly, no matter what they do, they will never be held as a righteous people.

205
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:48,120
So roughly you have about three more prime ministers left in modern Israel before they have, I would say, not a civil war revolution, but a political turnaround almost overnight where they're going to install some form of a loose monarchy.

206
00:16:49,940 --> 00:17:01,780
OK, so this is do you see how this very benign statement in Isaiah that says in chapter one, it says, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you'll be known as a righteous people.

207
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,740
That's very benign.

208
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:14,079
But do you see how when you look into it as a speed bump, slow down and say, wait a second, you know, what do you mean when I return you back and I will restore your former judges?

209
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
What's going on?

210
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,859
You know, yes, they are back in the land.

211
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,380
And what's going on, you see, and you see the repeat.

212
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,839
There was only one judge that was a woman, Deborah, in ancient Israel.

213
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,820
And there was only one woman who was going to be prime minister of Israel, which was Golda Meir and also in the same position, fourth position.

214
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,940
Give you an example on how accurate and powerful this is.

215
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:45,440
A few folks remember the not this previous election, but the previous one when Netanyahu was going against Tzipora Livni and she was about 90 percent in the polls a week before the election.

216
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,420
They were ready to paint her name on the door and people were coming and saying, hey, Greek, you know, that prophetic stuff doesn't seem to work.

217
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,240
I said, it doesn't matter.

218
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,440
She's not going to be in.

219
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,840
It's going to be Netanyahu because there's only one prime minister that's going to be a woman.

220
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,520
So everyone was like, oh, no, Tzipora Livni, she's ready, she's in, you know, she's 90 percent in the polls a week away.

221
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,960
She's got it like, nope, she's got nothing.

222
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,440
And what happened?

223
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,820
She didn't get in.

224
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:21,900
Because I'm not following what CNN says or the media or alternative media or the people even on the boots on the ground, I'm not following what I'm not looking at their stuff as the BL end all.

225
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm listening to what they're saying, but I'm saying, no, it's not going to happen.

226
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,160
And guess what?

227
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,640
It didn't.

228
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,100
And they're only she's, you know, so so this is very powerful stuff once you understand it.

229
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,500
Also, as long as Israel has prime ministers, they will never be considered a righteous people.

230
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:45,800
And from discussing and having discussions with people in Israel, a lot of the negative stuff that you hear coming out of there just isn't true.

231
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Like, I wouldn't say all of it, but a lot of it is not true.

232
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:59,060
Like, for example, years ago with the war with Lebanon, they had put they had blamed Israeli troops for killing a few hundred Lebanese prisoners.

233
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,080
Now, that wasn't true.

234
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:13,900
What really happened, this is I spoke to one of the guards, the Israeli guards that was stationed there at that temporary holding area, was that there was a group of Lebanese that pleaded with the Israeli guards to let in some more Lebanese.

235
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,000
And they ended up being a rival faction of Lebanese, the same people.

236
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,540
And they started killing their own people.

237
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,870
But then but internationally, it was the Israeli guards that killed them, you see.

238
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,750
So and this and there's a lot of stuff going on with the Palestinians.

239
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,130
Now, there's all this oppression.

240
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:41,570
If you look at how much money the Palestinian Authority gets international aid and how much of it gets bought and distributed to the people, it's less than one percent.

241
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:51,150
The rest of it, the rest of it goes to buying the Palestinian Authority, uses it to the current Palestinian Authority, is it for personal investments?

242
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,130
So, you know, there's a lot of interesting stuff.

243
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:04,050
And also they breed in Palestine what they have, you know, how years ago in America, they used to have the Pledge of Allegiance.

244
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,650
Right.

245
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:15,570
Well, in modern day, like the Gaza Strip and places like that, all the school children are pledged to kill an Israeli every morning or Israel will be doomed, you know, just just for the hell of it.

246
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,270
This is the pledge.

247
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,830
So you don't hear this stuff.

248
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,470
So it's very biased and skewed.

249
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,250
Now, I'm not for or against either one of those groups.

250
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm just saying what I see and what can be said about it.

251
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,070
So they're not going to be known as righteous people as long as they've got prime ministers.

252
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,230
So as long as you see prime ministers in Israel, they're always always going to be the Zionism.

253
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,590
Oh, the Jews are faulty.

254
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,010
Oh, it's Israel or this or that.

255
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,430
And how much of that do you still hear?

256
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,030
Quite a bit.

257
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,110
It's not going to go away until another several prime ministers.

258
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,310
Now, the prime ministers have a term of roughly four years, but it is possible to exchange.

259
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:56,150
I think in the late 90s, they went through three prime ministers in four years due with due to assassination illness and I think a short vote or something.

260
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,770
So you have quite a bit going on.

261
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:12,030
So anyway, I just want to recap that very benign verse in the first chapter of Isaiah, which states, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you will be known as a righteous people.

262
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:19,730
How that is a very strong geopolitical prophetic statement hidden within a very benign language of that chapter.

263
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,170
So I just wanted to explain that.

264
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:28,660
I hope that makes sense from one level to another.

265
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:38,780
So, again, one thing that the reason I've been holding back is just I've got to just wipe my brow and say, like, what the hell is going on on this planet and just take a break?

266
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:44,420
And again, just to reiterate, I promised a sonic event soon after the solos I was doing on AFR.

267
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,260
And then I said, well, let me take a week off.

268
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,200
And I started looking around.

269
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,160
I said, one week became two weeks and three weeks and four weeks.

270
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,720
And I know there's interest.

271
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,040
I know there's plenty of interest, but I don't really see it.

272
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,440
And I think that enough has been said, you know, and but you could hide all of it in the public library.

273
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,580
Right, right.

274
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,580
So so let's just continue.

275
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,700
I wanted to just throw another spoiler, perhaps on the biblical text and because it has nothing to do.

276
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:21,900
I think if anyone spends 15 minutes researching the history of the biblical text, you'll find it has nothing to do with any religion on the planet right now.

277
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,580
Right, right now.

278
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,600
Now, notice I didn't say that there are other religions that have hijacked it.

279
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,260
No, but the text itself has nothing to do with any religion.

280
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,320
Now, there's plenty of groups of religions and sorts that have hijacked it.

281
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,740
They are telling you things that are supposed to be out of there that you will not find in their characters, events or anything.

282
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,320
So I just want to make that clear.

283
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:51,820
And and and I never recommend that anyone go and read or study the biblical text, contrary to what most people say.

284
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,200
And the reason why I never recommend anyone go read it or study it is because if you tried, you don't understand a dang thing in it.

285
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,580
So why would I tell you to do that?

286
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:11,220
But you see, so the other point here is why not start having a legitimate, rational discussion on what is really there and then see what happens?

287
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,840
Right.

288
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,780
So one of the spoilers, again, I wanted to give is how to comprehend prophecy.

289
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:28,780
And the same way you understand if you're, let's say, traveling on the earth in a motorized engine driven wagon, which is a car.

290
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,780
If they want you to slow down, they'll show you a sign showing a very low speed limit.

291
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,860
And if you miss that sign, they'll put a speed bump in front of you to make you feel it.

292
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,060
They should be slowing down.

293
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,280
Right.

294
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,920
And that's what happens.

295
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,020
Very often you read a lot of these ancient texts.

296
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:53,300
So I wanted to give an example and explain it just to kind of like see how people would expand in their own studies with it, because there's many examples I can give.

297
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,580
I'll just give this one because it's pertinent, because it also ties into what's called geopolitics.

298
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,060
Now, let's just call it a verse.

299
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:13,160
Now, I don't like if you ever heard me discuss biblical texts, I'll never give chapter and verse like these, you know, who's do because they sound like preachers, McMinisters, like when they always shout a verse at you.

300
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:21,980
And it sounds like to me when they start shouting verses and chapters, all I hear is two old beef patty, special sauce, cheese, lettuce and sesame seed bun.

301
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:30,040
That's all I hear when they start all these, you know, Christian, I call them McMinisters, McMinisters, whatever, McChurches.

302
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,240
That's what it sounds like.

303
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,820
Oh, you ever hear like Matthew 25, 17, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

304
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm like two old beef patties, special sauce.

305
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,620
I was like, what the hell is right now?

306
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,040
If you want to, you know, if you want to do your demonology, go ahead.

307
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,660
But, you know, say it is so, you know.

308
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,640
But anyway, that's what it is, by the way, when they do that.

309
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,640
It's a form of spellcasting.

310
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,320
They don't know it.

311
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,000
But but so the verse or the part that I'm going to be explaining is in what's called the Book of Isaiah.

312
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,380
It's around the first chapter.

313
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,080
And I know I don't study it in chapter and verse very often when I have conversations with people in the biblical texts.

314
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,380
I'll say, like, you know, in the Book of Isaiah, such and such.

315
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,740
And they're like, well, what's the chapter and verse?

316
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,660
I'm like, I don't know.

317
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,120
It's around the middle somewhere of the book, you know, because that's how it's supposed to be either know it or you don't.

318
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,060
You know how many times people watch a movie and they're like, remember in The Matrix at exactly one hour, 32 minutes and 43 seconds?

319
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,220
Like, who talks like that?

320
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,820
Right.

321
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,040
Right.

322
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,880
It's like you're in The Matrix or on the office building or whatever.

323
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,500
You know, yeah, I remember that, you know, you know, one, you know, so one thing I tell people is you either know it or you don't.

324
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,560
And forget about this, the demonology that's been put on humanity for hundreds of years.

325
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,020
Or the McPreachers, the McMinisters, the 2LB patty special sauce, you know, cheese kind of crap.

326
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:55,700
And not to use McDonald's as a reference, but yeah, they and the only reason I use McDonald's as reference is because their own CEO publicly says they're crap.

327
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,920
So if he says they're crap, I can say they're crap, I guess, even though I'm not a stockholder.

328
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,140
So let's go back to the verse.

329
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,900
It's in the first what's called the first chapter of Isaiah.

330
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,920
And if you look, I think it's in the middle of that chapter, down the middle or a little past.

331
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:25,420
It says something like, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges or your judges of old, and then you will be known as a righteous people.

332
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Now, let me repeat that.

333
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,500
That sounds very benign, doesn't it?

334
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,520
Most people just read over that and keep reading.

335
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,760
Right.

336
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:40,180
It says, when I return you into the land, I will restore to you your former judges or some versions say they're judges of old.

337
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,840
It's actually pretty close to the original text.

338
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,220
And then he says, and then you will be known as a righteous people.

339
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,420
So let's just look at that.

340
00:26:48,420 --> 00:27:00,440
So they, meaning the Israel as a political group, you know, where they set up borders known as Israel, and they're going to be ruled by judges like they were in the past.

341
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:07,660
So, like, in other words, when they went into the land, they were not ruled by kings or ruled by judges, as you see in the book of Judges.

342
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:07,960
Right.

343
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,680
And as long as they have, you know, and then there will be known.

344
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,000
In other words, after this period of judges, they will be known as a righteous people.

345
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,380
So that means that during this period, they will not be known as righteous.

346
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,740
Right.

347
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,640
Right.

348
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,080
So if we look at the verse again and how it's prophetic and geopolitics now, by the way, I get a lot of flack.

349
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,680
Well, the people that are in Israel now are not the real Israel.

350
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,680
So that's not the point.

351
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,100
The point.

352
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,340
This is a geopolitical issue of how the people are viewed, whether they're in Israel or not, you see.

353
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,340
So let's go look at this again.

354
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,660
When I return you back, this is in the first chapter of Isaiah, near the end somewhere.

355
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:52,240
When I return you back to the land, I will restore to you your former judges of old and then you will be known as a righteous people.

356
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,560
OK, let's go look at this now.

357
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,420
So they're sort of established as a nation again in around 1948, 49, actually sooner than that.

358
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,980
But let's say 48, 49, commonly accepted.

359
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,980
And they're ruled by prime ministers.

360
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,380
Now, a minister is a judge and a prime minister is a head judge.

361
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,180
So whenever you see a country ruled by a prime minister, that is a judgeship ministerial position.

362
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Now, for example, a country that has a prime minister as their top dog is also has a president.

363
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,720
But you don't hear about it because they have that the president signs all the executive orders.

364
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,300
If you look this up on your own, you'll see, like, for example, who rules Israel.

365
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,580
It's the head of the party.

366
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,560
Netanyahu is the prime minister.

367
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,080
But if you research who is the president of Israel, they will show you there is also a president.

368
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,520
Most people are not aware of this, right?

369
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,200
Because the president is the president that signs the executive orders for the corporation and all that.

370
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,100
So you could look it up.

371
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,420
I don't know who the president is right now, but he's some bloke sitting there, you know, doing, you know, pen.

372
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,680
OK, so Israel is now being ruled by prime judges or prime ministers.

373
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:13,320
Now, what's interesting is if we go back to the prophetic aspect of this, when Israel initially went into the land with the book of judges, they were ruled by a roughly 14 to 16 judges.

374
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,820
That means whether, you know, you count Joshua as one of them or Moses or such, but not really.

375
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,120
So you say specifically around 14 to 15 judges ruled.

376
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,820
Ancient Israel.

377
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,940
Now, if we look at the judges of ancient Israel, we will see something interesting because the first three were men.

378
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,940
And the fourth judge of ancient Israel was a woman, Deborah.

379
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,460
Now, if we look at modern Israel, we will see the first three prime ministers are men.

380
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,440
But the fourth one is a woman, Golda Meir, Grandma Moses.

381
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:57,860
And the only woman to ever be prime minister of Israel, because Israel never had only had one woman or female as a judge, you see, or a prime minister.

382
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,320
So we have a repeat.

383
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,540
Now, Netanyahu is the 12th position.

384
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,040
So we have one more.

385
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,660
And then we have the 14th position, which was Samson.

386
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:15,160
Now, what's interesting, if you read in the book of judges, a lot of them only get one or two verses attributing to their judgeship or ruling of Israel.

387
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:22,380
But when you get to Samson, he's like the bulk of the book, you know, in terms of what's dedicated and like Samson and Delilah fame.

388
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,620
Right.

389
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,720
All right.

390
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,440
The Nazarene.

391
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,740
So so the Nazarite oath and all that.

392
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,820
So with the hair, you know, everyone, even storybooks have been made about it.

393
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,800
What's interesting about Samson, it was all about the engagement with the Philistines.

394
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,660
When I say engaging the Philistines, I don't mean like fiancee getting married, but there was a lot of dynamicism between them.

395
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,660
OK, so what you're going to see in the next not Netanyahu, but the next prime minister and the one after him will take the position of Samson.

396
00:30:51,260 --> 00:31:00,580
That's why very often I've said there is going to be carnage in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians that has never even been imagined.

397
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,340
Forget about what you what you've seen in the past.

398
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,800
Right.

399
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,520
And he will probably also perish.

400
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:17,040
And then the prime minister that comes after that one will probably be very spiritual, more like someone like Eli, because what I'm trying to say is the prime ministers of modern Israel are a repeat of ancient Israel's judges.

401
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,860
Now, here's the kicker to the end of the verse.

402
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:27,540
Remember, the verse in Isaiah says, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you will be known as a righteous people.

403
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,040
Now, as long as Israel has prime ministers, they will not be known as a righteous people.

404
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:43,620
How many times now do you hear, oh, the Jews, oh, the Israel, the Zionists or this or that constantly, no matter what they do, they will never be held as a righteous people.

405
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:58,260
So roughly you have about three more prime ministers left in modern Israel before they have, I would say, not a civil war revolution, but a political turnaround almost overnight where they're going to install some form of a loose monarchy.

406
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:11,920
OK, so this is do you see how this very benign statement in Isaiah that says in chapter one, it says, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you'll be known as a righteous people.

407
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,900
That's very benign.

408
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:24,200
But do you see how when you look into it as a speed bump, slow down and say, wait a second, you know, what do you mean when I return you back until I restore your former judges?

409
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,120
What's going on?

410
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,000
You know, yes, they are back in the land.

411
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,820
And what's going on?

412
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,520
You see and you see the repeat.

413
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,920
There was only one judge that was a woman, Deborah, in ancient Israel.

414
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,960
And there was only one woman who was going to be prime minister of Israel, which was Golda Meir and also in the same position, fourth position.

415
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,080
Give you an example on how accurate and powerful this is.

416
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:55,580
A few folks remember the not this previous election, but the previous one when Netanyahu was going against Tzipora Livni and she was about 90 percent in the polls a week before the election.

417
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,560
They were ready to paint her name on the door and people were coming in and saying, hey, Greek, you know, that prophetic stuff doesn't seem to work.

418
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,360
I said, it doesn't matter.

419
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,580
She's not going to be in.

420
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,980
It's going to be Netanyahu because there's only one prime minister that's going to be a woman.

421
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,700
So everyone was like, oh, no, it's Tzipora Livni.

422
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,420
She's ready.

423
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,660
She's in, you know, she's 90 percent in the polls a week away.

424
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,140
She's got it like, nope, she's got nothing.

425
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,560
What happened?

426
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:28,100
She didn't get in because I'm not following what CNN says or the media or alternative media or the people even on the boots on the ground.

427
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,060
I'm not following what I'm not looking at their stuff as the BL end all.

428
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,600
I'm listening to what they're saying, but I'm saying, no, it's not going to happen.

429
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,280
And guess what?

430
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,780
It didn't.

431
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,240
And they're only she's, you know, so so this is very powerful stuff once you understand it.

432
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,640
Also, as long as Israel has prime ministers, they will never be considered a righteous people.

433
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:55,940
And from discussing and having discussions with people in Israel, a lot of the negative stuff that you hear coming out of there just isn't true.

434
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,740
Like, I wouldn't say all of it, but a lot of it is not true.

435
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:09,199
Like, for example, years ago with the war with Lebanon, they had put they blamed Israeli troops for killing a few hundred Lebanese prisoners.

436
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,239
Now, that wasn't true.

437
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,080
What really happened?

438
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:24,040
And this is I spoke to one of the guards, the Israeli guards that was stationed there at that temporary holding area was that there was a group of Lebanese that pleaded with the Israeli guards to let in some more Lebanese.

439
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,139
And they ended up being a rival faction of Lebanese, the same people.

440
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,699
And they started killing their own people.

441
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,040
But then but internationally, it was the Israeli guards that killed them, you see.

442
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:36,839
Right.

443
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:43,280
So and this and there's a lot of stuff going on with the Palestinians, how there's all this oppression.

444
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:51,620
If you look at how much money the Palestinian Authority gets international aid and how much of it gets bought and distributed to the people, it's less than one percent.

445
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:01,320
The rest of it, the rest of it goes to buying the Palestinian Authority, uses it to the current Palestinian Authority, is it for personal investments?

446
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,260
So, you know, there's a lot of interesting stuff.

447
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:14,200
And also they breed in Palestine what they have, you know, how years ago in America they used to have the Pledge of Allegiance.

448
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:15,780
Right.

449
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:25,700
Well, in modern day, like the Gaza Strip and places like that, all the schoolchildren are pledged to kill an Israeli every morning or Israel will be doomed, you know, just just for the hell of it.

450
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,380
This is the pledge.

451
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,940
So you don't hear this stuff.

452
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,600
So it's very biased and skewed.

453
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,400
Now, I'm not for or against either one of those groups.

454
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,440
I'm just saying what I see and what can be said about it.

455
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,220
So they're not going to be known as righteous people as long as they've got prime ministers.

456
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,340
So as long as you see prime ministers in Israel, they're always always going to be the Zionism.

457
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,640
Oh, the Jews are faulty.

458
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,140
Oh, it's Israel or this or that.

459
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,560
And how much of that do you still hear?

460
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,160
Quite a bit.

461
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,260
It's not going to go away until another several prime ministers.

462
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,540
Now, the prime ministers have a term of roughly four years, but it is possible to exchange.

463
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,240
I think in the late 90s, they went through three prime ministers in four years to do it due to assassination illness and I think a short vote or something.

464
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,900
So you have quite a bit going on.

465
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:22,160
So anyway, I just want to recap that very benign verse in the first chapter of Isaiah, which states, when I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges and then you will be known as a righteous people.

466
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,860
How that is a very strong geopolitical prophetic statement hidden within a very benign language of that chapter.

467
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,300
So I just wanted to explain that.

468
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,240
I hope that makes sense.

469
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,180
It does.

470
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,920
It does.

471
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:40,300
And by the way, just to interject here, Reuven Rivlin is the president right now.

472
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,240
Right.

473
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,160
They do have a president.

474
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,880
He's not acknowledged like the prime minister, but they do have one.

475
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,120
Yes.

476
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,160
Reuben Rivlin, you said?

477
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,260
Yeah, Reuven Rivlin.

478
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,140
Rivlin.

479
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,500
OK, there you go.

480
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,780
But you see, why isn't he acknowledged as a top dog?

481
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,720
Because it's not it's not meant to be.

482
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,000
Because they're not ruled by the rule by judges, as it is prophetically, so.

483
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,360
So just a question.

484
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,920
Do you feel that the people of Israel have a grasp on this?

485
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,780
No.

486
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,420
Hold on.

487
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,420
No, no.

488
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,300
They're very censored on their own also.

489
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,260
Oh, yeah.

490
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,740
Yeah, there's some I do communicate with some people from Israel and, quote, unquote, you know, of that national heritage.

491
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,340
And what I've gotten from them is they've been discouraged their whole life to stay away from the Bible and just read the mystical writings like Talmudic stuff.

492
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,060
Really?

493
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah.

494
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,560
I've even read I've even met a rabbi's daughter in California, and I said, you know, I study scripture and all that.

495
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
She goes, you mean the Talmud?

496
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,240
I said, no, no, no, not the Talmud.

497
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,600
Scripture goes, well, I only know the Talmud.

498
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,740
I don't read the rest of it.

499
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,960
I don't read that Bible stuff.

500
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,320
No.

501
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,140
Wow.

502
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:54,040
OK, and also the highest percentage of atheists are in Israel right now.

503
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,840
If you were on a bus in Israel and you public bus or a public place and you said, well, how many of you are atheists?

504
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,460
About half the people would raise their hands.

505
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,900
Without thinking about it immediately.

506
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,420
I say really now, maybe it's about a third.

507
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,660
But I remember someone discussing this with me that was there in the 80s.

508
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,100
So that was clearly half.

509
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,860
But I think that was a third.

510
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,280
But still, that's very significant.

511
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes.

512
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,360
Yes.

513
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,760
They're under some heavy censorship still.

514
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,780
But now remember the point of this of them is, you know, I've listed before a various sundry list of what the how the gods work.

515
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,480
And one of the ways is if they give you too much information, you don't want to jump off this rock and be like them.

516
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,340
So they have to hide the information and limit it, but still have to make it accessible.

517
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,060
So what a better way to hide it and limit it by not giving it originally to some people that everyone is going to dislike.

518
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,660
So the moment you want to go and study it, they're going to say, oh, that's those people's book.

519
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,800
Oh, I don't want it, you know, because they're so unlikable.

520
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,400
You see, I'm glad that you brought something up.

521
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,320
I've got it.

522
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,540
I had a question.

523
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,140
And when you mentioned about Assyria, how much are they going to play?

524
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,920
Because they were a very hardy little warring machine.

525
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,120
Well, a very big, a very big part, because they they are.

526
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,740
It's important that they're geo geographically and geopolitically in place, which they are coming.

527
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,580
Right.

528
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,300
And then they're going to take land from Syria and Turkey.

529
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:28,000
But when they're in position, they they're they're going to satisfy a spiritual request also.

530
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,220
Also, the there's a figure that is going to be known as a world leader type in the near future.

531
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,140
He's about 20 right now, 19 or 20.

532
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,640
He was born around 1998.

533
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,640
He is of Assyrian extraction.

534
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,420
Right.

535
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:54,280
And I'm not saying the name, I'm not saying what, you know, the title is even biblically, but if you know what I mean, there's a world leader that's coming on the scene.

536
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,840
It's not going to be him explicitly.

537
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:02,440
He's going to have a group around him that's going to be very important in the late 2020s and pretty much be known as an international world leader.

538
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,400
And he is of Assyrian extraction.

539
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,680
So that is the importance there.

540
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:13,000
That is, you know, how can you be a world leader of Assyrian extraction and you and your country is in shambles or you don't have a country?

541
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,540
Right.

542
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:13,800
You see.

543
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,940
So that will be established for that reason and many others.

544
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,800
Because remember what when the Assyrians come together, they're also going to be reviving much of their culture.

545
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,520
Right.

546
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,900
Most most people now are not aware of their culture, who they are.

547
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,120
As a matter of fact, even today, if you if you discuss the Assyrians, people think you're talking about the Syrians.

548
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,300
They don't know about the Assyrians.

549
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,660
Yeah, they were a bad mofo crew when it came to war.

550
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,800
That was their industry.

551
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,380
You know how various countries have industry, their industry was war.

552
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,100
Yeah.

553
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,020
And I have.

554
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,540
Yeah, I have a personal, you know, statement, opinion, which I don't give much is that if they were not, let's say, eliminated as a group, as they were, they would.

555
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,500
I don't think there'd be anyone on the planet left today because they would just be munching everybody up.

556
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,400
They were they were bad.

557
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,480
Now, do you feel that they're going to come to the aid of Palestine?

558
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,840
No.

559
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,180
No, not at all.

560
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,160
What will happen if you want to get into a little bit more prophecy?

561
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:30,160
What will happen is with this, not the next prime minister, the current prime minister, not this one, not the next one, but the next one is going to heavily engage the modern day Philistines, which were which are the Palestinians at large.

562
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,060
And they're going to be completely expelled from the West Bank completely.

563
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,040
Most of them will perish because there's over 150 or 200,000.

564
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,120
The Gaza Strip will be expanded and that will become a legitimate nation of Palestine, you know, with a political.

565
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,260
And also when that happens and the prime minister that will be responsible for this will probably lose his life just like Samson did.

566
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,120
Oh, right.

567
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,320
Right.

568
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:06,640
And, you know, we're talking, you know, tens of thousands, if not 100,000 Palestinians being slaughtered over a very short period of time, matter of days or weeks.

569
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,480
Right.

570
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,620
Yeah.

571
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,440
And this is coming.

572
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:17,340
You know, this is, you know, I'm not I'm just stating what I've discovered is, you know, want to believe it or not, that's their prerogative.

573
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,100
But it's worth banking on and it's worth filing away for sure.

574
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,760
Banking on it, meaning you'll get interest on it later, you know, kind of thing.

575
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,180
I mean, because you'll be able to discuss what the results when these things start to begin, you will be recognizable.

576
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, after all of this happens in the Gaza Strip is expanded and becomes a formal aspect of Palestine and Israel is more formalized.

577
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:51,440
Israel and Palestine will become extremely close allies to the point where they will be going into wars and doing squirmishes and battles together.

578
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,780
As allies.

579
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,580
Oh, yeah.

580
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,540
So it's going to be a major, major change.

581
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,960
But since 1989, on the Pope's work schedule, people have been used to very sudden major changes.

582
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:14,640
You know, if you discuss the the Iron Curtain and the Soviet Union in the summer of 1989 and you said, well, in the next few months, it'll completely go away and there will be no Iron Curtain by next year.

583
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:21,220
People will say, great, that sounds ridiculous because it took 30 or 40 years to put in place almost 50 years.

584
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,700
And there's no way it's going to just go away overnight, probably maybe and maybe in 20 or 30 years it will.

585
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,500
Well, what happened in 1989 in the fall?

586
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:29,780
Right.

587
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,460
It only took a few weeks.

588
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,660
So, yeah.

589
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:42,050
So, yeah, these sudden changes also with what's called 9-11, which is a small axial period.

590
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:49,250
People even use the term, the definition of an axial period regarding 9-11 accurately because they call it a post 9-11 world.

591
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,390
An axial period is a period that changes the entire world view.

592
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,250
Right.

593
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,930
That happened almost overnight.

594
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:05,030
I mean, if you told people what would you know, the the the apparatus that will be put in place on September 10th, 2001 on the Pope's work schedule, what would be in place in a month or two?

595
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,150
They said that will never happen.

596
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,270
But after that event, it did.

597
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,770
It was readily accepted.

598
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:11,590
Right.

599
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,410
So you're going to see quite a bit of that.

600
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,670
That's why I don't get attached on commenting on political things and views and stories.

601
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,110
I think I said recently, you know, people define the news as things that are changing.

602
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,890
Well, why don't why isn't there news about things that don't change?

603
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:28,410
Right.

604
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,850
Right.

605
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:29,210
Yeah.

606
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:30,490
Yeah.

607
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,170
So.

608
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:49,970
So anyway, I hope that I gave a little bit just to reiterate there's an explanation of how the geopolitical world is seen prophetically and simple, benign versus like the one you'll find in Isaiah, which is when I return you back into the land, I will restore to your former judges and then you'll be known as a righteous people.

609
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,430
I hope that gave a pretty clear explanation on how to attach that and read out of it.

610
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,290
What's going on with a very simple, benign verse like that.

611
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:10,830
And there are many other verses, actually, most of it of the scripture where you can hear Marcus prophetic as about things that need to be, you know, looked into so you could read out of it.

612
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,670
But I hope that it did.

613
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,650
It was very good.

614
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:34,150
When I listen to you and Seth talking about scripture and things, and he brought up how he's taken a week to two weeks on a on a small couple of verses or verse, I found myself doing that.

615
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:39,820
And just having you almost have to.

616
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,480
You almost have to run a lot of that stuff.

617
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,660
Well, you do in the beginning.

618
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:59,820
And then after a while, when you get an idea of the history, both past, present and future, because history is constantly happening, you know, the and you understand how the scripture is put together, you know, about a certain it's like explaining a Swiss watch.

619
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,400
You don't have to explain the chair and the and the and the floor and the ceiling lamp or anything like that.

620
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,120
When you read scripture, it's really talking about a clock.

621
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:18,700
Really, if you want it, that's another way to explain basically what you know, what's going to be happening to mankind, because they've already tried a life expectancy of a thousand years.

622
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,680
And that didn't work out.

623
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,800
That ended up with killing most people with a flood.

624
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,840
And they tried out, you know, leaving angelic beings and other demonic beings to communicate openly with men.

625
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,740
That didn't work out too well because then they had to, you know, confuse all the languages.

626
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,840
So they're like, you know, we're just going to batten this thing down.

627
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,040
We're still keep the some of the information out and we'll just make it distasteful.

628
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:50,780
Well, it harkens back to the statement you made one time about how the the battle was that matter could be corrupted.

629
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:00,960
And matter, matter or life, the creation could be corrupted because it was made of matter.

630
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:01,440
Right.

631
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,380
And, you know, how true, how true.

632
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,480
Well, it's about combining a certain combination shouldn't be done.

633
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:21,320
And anyone that's worked in even the co-academic chemistry labs, you know, they have certain acids and certain compounds in double or triple boxes, you know, not just on the shelf.

634
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,640
So, you know, but it's like, why is this thing in three boxes?

635
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,100
Well, so you're thinking, you know, as you're getting it out of all these containers, you got lots of time to think about it.

636
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,320
You know, what do you is this what you really want to reach for?

637
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,560
Right.

638
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,060
Yeah.

639
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,040
Right.

640
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,760
So there's certain kinds of acids that are extremely dangerous and things.

641
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,580
So so there's things like that.

642
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,580
There's attitudes, there's behaviors that are like that, that mankind engages in.

643
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,100
And see, now it's OK.

644
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,920
It seems it's being let out more because there's a the goddess religion has got a very heavy influence.

645
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:58,820
And what people don't understand when the spiritual realm now, or especially the past 2000 years, influences mankind, it's more hidden.

646
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,140
In other words, it's more covert.

647
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,560
You see, they don't that, you know, the people aren't going around and saying, well, I'm doing this because I'm a follower of the goddess religion.

648
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,940
They don't know what they're doing at all.

649
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:22,320
But if you understand how the characteristics of the goddess religion or the one that this is a particular malevolent one, you will see that this is as obvious as day that what's going on, the influence on society and individuals.

650
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,440
Yeah.

651
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,140
So, OK, so you think we had enough just for a short first little Skype deal?

652
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:37,340
You know, I think I'm I'm grateful again because you keep my curiosity on many things.

653
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,400
And I look forward to my my time of search.

654
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,200
Yeah.

655
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,340
Yeah.

656
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,640
Great.

657
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:48,960
And go back and read that that verse in what's called and ponder it and then, you know, keep stay on your toes.

658
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,740
You know, don't, you know, fall asleep behind the wheel, right?

659
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,960
It's like speed bumps, you know, just don't slow down when you see them.

660
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,240
Well, I'm I'm I'm very grateful.

661
00:48:59,440 --> 00:48:59,740
Greek.

662
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:00,880
Same here.

663
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,540
Been very enlightening.

664
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:11,900
And I look forward to any time that you got a few minutes if you want to rub together, I'm available and can fire this bad boy up anytime you want.

665
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:12,740
OK.

666
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,500
Looking forward to it, then.

667
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:14,940
All right.

668
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, we'll call it.

669
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,540
That's it for now.

670
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,680
And we'll we'll do it again soon.

671
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,760
You take care.

672
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:20,620
Thank you.

673
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,540
You're welcome.
