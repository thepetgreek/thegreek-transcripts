1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,740
Good evening there, folks.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,860
We're live with the Greek.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,440
And how are you doing tonight, sir?

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,740
Greetings.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,100
Another stream.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,880
Doing okay.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,320
Doing.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,340
Still on this planet.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,960
Let's see if we get any stream monkeys to call in this time.

10
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,360
I kind of dubbed that.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,520
You know, might as well have fun with it.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,280
Yeah.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,900
So I just put on the chat again.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,840
And do we have a link on the chat for the stream?

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,460
I will get that up.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,080
I'll get that up right away here.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,960
Okay.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,200
And see.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,920
So let's see if someone might want to come in.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,940
Basically, I was thinking just calling it just speak instead of just Greek speak, right?

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,380
Sure, sure.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,260
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:19,500
This is, these sonic events are, I would say essential, but let's just say essentially about what it's like to be on planet Earth if you're a bipedal anthropomorphic looking kind of creature and what you're going to expect when you encounter them, right?

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Yeah, there's a handful of things that could come up on that one.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,960
Yep.

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,040
And you're going to hear stuff that you've never heard before, but it makes sense because it is full of sense.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,060
That's why it's called common sense also.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,400
And it's not because I'm saying it.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,040
It's because it's really sad and piss poor and pathetic that no one else is.

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,840
So how else can we, you know, make a claim or say anything unless it's self-evident and back it up.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,440
Because whenever you make a claim, they'll say back it up, you know.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:59,420
So, you know, I put a video, by the way, recently with Denzel Washington saying if you don't read the newspaper or media, I guess, you're uninformed.

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,940
But if you do, you're misinformed.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,100
So you have all this crap going on everywhere.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,160
And we have someone calling, it looks like.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
We'll see how she wants to announce herself.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,600
She's calling, so I'm going to hang up on her and bring her in.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,190
So, yeah, there's nothing out there, by the way.

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,470
And I've looked.

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,250
It's pretty sad.

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,390
Yeah, it's about as sad as it gets.

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,730
It's sadder today than it was yesterday, but not as sad as it will be tomorrow.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,550
And I'll get into that, how.

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:50,250
You and I have got a few years on us, and we've watched news throughout our whole lifetime in some way or fashion.

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,490
There's a steady progression going downhill.

46
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,390
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:56,830
Oh, yeah.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,850
But it's done in a proper way.

49
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,810
Okay, so we'll see.

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,270
Oh, here we have our first.

51
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,010
Who's that?

52
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,210
Oh, and she hung up.

53
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:05,850
Oh, no.

54
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,170
I lost you.

55
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,330
Okay.

56
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,310
Well, maybe we'll let you reclaim her.

57
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,490
Back there she goes.

58
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,570
Oh, and she's off.

59
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,130
On and off.

60
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,450
We could hear the tinkle.

61
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,270
Yeah.

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,890
Uh-huh.

63
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,430
Well, yeah.

64
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,850
Okay, so.

65
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:33,770
Otherwise, we do have a dial-up preference if, of course, cell phone charges could apply on your end.

66
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,810
We also have the other Skype connection if we need, depending on.

67
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,670
What is that?

68
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,250
Oh.

69
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,970
I've just put her on a mode that Skype aids me.

70
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,930
I'm going to put in a message for her to restart.

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,270
There you go.

72
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:54,770
Yeah.

73
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,240
Let's see.

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,160
I can probably get rid of that one.

75
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
I hate messing with this stuff.

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,600
Delete conversation.

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,960
Let's try that.

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,360
Yeah.

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,900
It's all deplorable, but you have to use it.

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,280
I recently had a conversation with someone.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,420
Oh, I see.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,680
Okay.

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,080
Well, I'm watching your conversation be twixed earlier, you and her.

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,180
That's what was going on.

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,740
That's okay.

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,079
Recently someone in conversation wrote, well, where are you on the Internet?

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,640
You know, basically, you know, because of that whole thing, all the.

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,360
Yeah.

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,960
Well, I'm not going to start printing a magazine, you know.

90
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Right, right.

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,160
It's just bad.

92
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,080
You know what?

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:42,880
I think essentially, because most people are so censored, by the way, that I know that about 100,000 people have heard Greek speak, and only about four or five really can react favorably or not even favorably, just rationally to it.

94
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,320
Right?

95
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,520
Sure.

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,540
I don't think anyone's reacted to or listened to Jack Presco's.

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,880
The people are irrational, and there's a reason why, and there's many reasons why.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,620
Right.

99
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,380
And there are very sound, firm reasons why.

100
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:04,220
So, the thing is, if anyone's going to get anything out of it, it's a little bit of irritation and maybe some entertainment, so I try to bring in some humor.

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,280
And, you know, that's why I always say I want to make one more serious comment every time.

102
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,920
Correct.

103
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,740
But essentially, bring your popcorn, bring your aspirin.

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
And we're basically speaking about what's going on on Earth.

105
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:33,280
Most people are so caught up into their own subjective, opinionated perspective of how things should be, and they don't have the information to do it properly.

106
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Well, I've got to share the fact that prior to my ever hearing of you...

107
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,160
Or this talk.

108
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,740
Or this kind of talk.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:57,660
The programming that was given was, to me, you just never took it for...

110
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,820
you just took it for granted.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,000
It was there, it was like a tree or a car or whatever.

112
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,160
Never questioned when I woke up.

113
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,700
Never had a reason.

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,040
Yeah, the humans...

115
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,520
well, people have been targeted by higher powers to not see any of this.

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,860
And at the same time, it's so thin of a veil.

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,240
In some cases, it could be very heavy of a veil.

118
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,140
For example, how the natural world really, really works.

119
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,580
In other words, where you can walk through walls and, you know, snap your fingers and make something appear or disappear.

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,380
Right.

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,160
You know, the difference between humans and the gods is technology.

122
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,420
When I say technology, I don't mean like, you know, microprocessors and things like that.

123
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,160
Right.

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,640
This is from far, far advanced still.

125
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:53,640
Yeah, what they're doing, the gods, in terms of technological achievement and attainment and ability, is when you're studying, let's say, martial arts, that's a technology.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,660
When I say technology, meaning it could be technically accessed.

127
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,120
For example, if anyone went to God's school, God's school, you know, where...

128
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,620
There are many things in media where they show you, you know, training, you know, like Karate Kid or Harry Potter or whatever.

129
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:21,280
If they had a school here on Earth to train you about how they do and what they do and how they do it, actually, and why they do it, you'd be able to do it as well.

130
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,080
Right.

131
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,520
And that's where the censorship is very, very thick.

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,180
And rightly so.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,840
You don't see that.

134
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,500
Yeah.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,980
Rightly so.

136
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,200
All right, let's see.

137
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,320
It should be, yeah.

138
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,720
I mean, just look at people.

139
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,600
Yeah.

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,460
Let's see if this will work.

141
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,800
She should just come on in on her own.

142
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,680
Taking a pause here.

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,100
There we go.

144
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,300
Oh, and it dropped her again.

145
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,400
Wow.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,500
Comes on and drops off.

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,160
I wonder if she's got some kind of Wi-Fi or something.

148
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,340
What I'm going to do is send you a contact request and accept it.

149
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,580
And then we'll see if that helps.

150
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,000
Because I'm running a really old version of Skype.

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,260
If you accept her contact request, maybe it'll tie the digital profanity into something that makes sense.

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Sure, sure.

153
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Let's see if I can find her here.

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,120
If you go to the Uncommon Radio, I just dropped in a contact request that she shows every so often.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,460
Okay.

156
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,960
I hate this new version.

157
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,690
Yeah, I think part of the requirement is that, let's see.

158
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,730
Someone else wants to come on also.

159
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,470
Yeah, anybody's welcome.

160
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,250
Yeah, let's bring in.

161
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,050
I'm going to try to go to the other one.

162
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm going to add her to a group call.

163
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,490
There we go.

164
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,050
That might help.

165
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,790
Okay.

166
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,590
I'm going to add Jason to a group call.

167
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,950
She's dropping.

168
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,910
Yeah, yeah, she is.

169
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,950
So we'll see.

170
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,750
And it looks like we have Jason.

171
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,130
There we go.

172
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,050
Jason, yeah.

173
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,350
Hey.

174
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,370
Good evening, Jason.

175
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,890
Hi, Bruce.

176
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,130
Yeah, Bruce.

177
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,190
And we have someone else that's trying to come on.

178
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,030
Yeah.

179
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,390
Yeah.

180
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,490
So, Jason's not all that bad.

181
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,870
He has a black cat as a moniker.

182
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,970
Ah, okay.

183
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,090
Yeah, it's just for whoever can't see.

184
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,290
So, greetings, Jason.

185
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,630
Greetings, Greg.

186
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:36,970
Oh.

187
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,250
By the way, are you on speaker?

188
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,690
Let me know if that's a problem with the echo or anything.

189
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,190
Nope, everything sounds clear.

190
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,210
It's gating properly.

191
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,970
Okay.

192
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:45,850
Yeah.

193
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,630
And Nicole is trying to come in and she can't.

194
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,890
I'm sending her a message and see if we can get her in this way over here.

195
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,550
Yeah, tell her it's probably a device.

196
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,870
Yeah.

197
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,830
Could be the device.

198
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,620
Sorry about that, Jason.

199
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,340
We're just trying to walk and chew gum here.

200
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,200
Okay.

201
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,000
Sorry.

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,620
Just send a message.

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
We'll see how it works out.

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,760
It's a deplorable program, but we like it anyway.

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,560
Yeah.

206
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,300
I think through the years, many have tried to mimic its capabilities with little or little popular success, so here we are.

207
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,280
Okay.

208
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,440
So, Jason, greetings.

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,840
By the way, for everyone, Jason also does, I shouldn't say also, but he does stuff on the Internet, right?

210
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,500
Am I correct?

211
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
You have a website and all that?

212
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,740
Yeah.

213
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,580
If you want to just plug all that in.

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,460
If anyone likes what you're saying enough to go and visit and support what you're doing, you should.

215
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,940
So tell us what you do.

216
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,340
You're not ashamed of it like I am.

217
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,620
Well, I'm not ashamed of it, but I'm not.

218
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,280
I mean, I feel like I'm sort of out on the frontier now talking to you, so it's not necessarily that I'm doing it.

219
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm definitely not doing it to get more listeners or anything like that.

220
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Yeah, what's it called?

221
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,920
How do we find it?

222
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,360
It's called Auticulture.

223
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,580
Auticulture.com All right, great.

224
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,700
Yeah, so for a while we were doing what they call, on the Pope's work schedule, a Tuesday night stream, and we're doing it again.

225
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,140
And one of the reasons, you know, today I came out and just basically said just to discuss the existence of humanity on this planet we call Earth.

226
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:48,680
So if you notice, I didn't say anything good or bad or society or culture or the times, just the state of affairs on this planet.

227
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,960
And I think trying to objectify it, you know, like I say, try is the best way to see things clearly.

228
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,600
Oh, and here, I keep hearing Nicole trying to tinkle and come in and out, so it's all over the program.

229
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,060
I'm sending her messages also, and we'll see if we can pull her in on this one over here.

230
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,880
Okay, so maybe we'll leave the tech talk in the background.

231
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,800
Jason, since you're here, go ahead and plug away, Jason.

232
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
Talk to us, say something.

233
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,880
Well, I came with some questions, so that's probably what I would start plugging.

234
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,820
If you put me on the stove, I'd just start asking you questions.

235
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Yeah, sure.

236
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,520
Yeah, sure, you know, there's also the possibility of asking questions that there is no answer.

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,220
So, those are the best kind, you know, but anyway, yes, please go ahead.

238
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,860
Well, I was planning to start with the tall, as far as that goes.

239
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,680
Right.

240
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,860
Yeah, the tall poppies, yeah.

241
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,100
So, as you know, I haven't been listening to your stuff for very long,

242
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,460
so some of my questions might seem obvious, I don't know, because I don't know how much you've covered,

243
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,080
but one of the things I've heard you say quite a few times,

244
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,300
and obviously you talk a lot about the gods, you talk about the most high god,

245
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:21,040
you talk about hierarchy of gods, but I've also heard you say that there's no one god,

246
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,680
you know, there's a multiplicity of gods versus one god, like you seem to posit a dichotomy there,

247
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,780
or an either-or thing.

248
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,640
Not verses, not verses, but go ahead.

249
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,260
There's no verses anywhere.

250
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:44,980
Everyone, let me just interject this, all the gods are, as far as we know, have a god also, and that's the one that's ruling everything.

251
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,560
That's the thing, when I used to discuss, by the way, the gods, people say, do the gods have a god?

252
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,040
And I said, I don't think you can handle that.

253
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:01,040
And for many years, now I just say it, well, the god that we read about in the attempted biblical versions is the god of the gods.

254
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:13,540
So let's say we were to go to the heavenly realm where the gods are, or the non-physical realm where the gods are predominantly, and we walked into a bar, you know, and there are all these gods hanging around in a bar, and we said, do you guys have a god?

255
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,480
And they said, yes we do, and this is who he is.

256
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,680
And when they identify him, it will be the one that is supposedly in the biblical text, which is not identified.

257
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,240
Right?

258
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,540
Because in the biblical text you just say, god this, lord that, and I'm like, which one?

259
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,260
So, anyway.

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
It's not identified by name.

261
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
Right, and that means it's not identified.

262
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,100
So what about Yahweh then?

263
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,380
Yeah, that's the identification, correct.

264
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,220
It's very simple.

265
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,420
So how is it not identified?

266
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,380
It's not in any of your versions.

267
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,820
Right.

268
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,980
Right?

269
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,300
You won't find it anywhere.

270
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,720
There are attempts, for example, I was speaking to someone who's Hebrew is their native tongue, and they use the term Yehovah.

271
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,640
And I'm like, ooh, that's not good, because that means actually to bring mischief, doesn't it?

272
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,780
And he's like, yeah, actually it does.

273
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,640
And no one really uses it.

274
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,980
These things are very simple.

275
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:21,900
So imagine, I'd say the question can be, let's lean the question against something that would be a concept of, imagine that people were not able to do math clearly.

276
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:30,240
Sometimes two and two is four, sometimes people just said there's no answer, sometimes people, you know, two and two is five, you know.

277
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,740
And the reason I use math as an example is because it's a very simple, rational communication.

278
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,600
So it is possible to rationally communicate the gods based on what information we have.

279
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,400
There is much license and much right given to the way that you research anything.

280
00:15:49,020 --> 00:16:00,020
You know, if you can't see over a tall wall, you can build a device to go over it, or you can make a human pyramid, have someone climb and describe, make a jet pack, get in an airplane, many ways to see over things.

281
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:11,780
But once you start making things up that were not based on getting to the real information, that you're not allowed, you have no license and you have no right to do that.

282
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,520
Meaning, regarding this subject, many people say, well, I think it's this.

283
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,160
Big buzzer, the gong, you have no right to do that, and there's no license to do that, you're an idiot.

284
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,360
You have no right to do that regarding something that can be firmly established as factual.

285
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,340
You see, a lot of times you hear, well, I think this means that.

286
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,200
You see, no.

287
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:49,260
With no research, now, you could still produce that within a cultural element where people, let's say, are studying an ancient writ, and there hasn't been a firm answer.

288
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:55,660
Then we go into the scientific mode, where you can do the hypothesis in theory, and bring up, well, I think it might be this, I think it might be that.

289
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,280
And then you're correct, because you're still leaning on the reference material that anyone can see.

290
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:13,780
And too often I hear, even today, and it's been going on since ancient Greece, well, I think it means this, and I think it means that, and they have no support of what's been established about it already.

291
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,460
Let's go back to the question, the gods versus many gods.

292
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm not clear on how your interpretation of the scripture is so radically different from my own, for one thing.

293
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm not a Christian, but...

294
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh yeah, thankfully.

295
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,480
I've become less hostile to the Christian mindset, let's say, in recent years.

296
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,600
And some Christians, I've spoken to, do seem to have a pretty good grasp of...

297
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:59,020
well, I shouldn't put it that way, not necessarily a good grasp, but their interpretation of the deity seems sane, let's put it that way.

298
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,680
Yes, in appearance, yes.

299
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,920
In appearance only, yeah.

300
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,320
Well no, I don't mean in an appearance-only way.

301
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,680
It gets complicated when we talk about individuals, because how they live their lives and how they act is much more important than what they say anyway.

302
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:21,720
But what I'm trying to get to is that, yes, there's legions of Christians who, when they open their mouth, they have contradicted themselves before they even finished the first sentence.

303
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,780
I've been well aware of that kind of Christianity my whole life and been very hostile towards it.

304
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:46,420
But in more recent years I've talked to what I call more discerning Christians, who seem to have thought about it a lot more deeply, but they still have a more or less, certainly a recognizable interpretation of Scripture in terms of the One God and the Incarnation and the Trinity and so on and so forth.

305
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:55,080
And you've often expressed, let's say, disparagement for that worldview and suggested that it has nothing to do with Scripture.

306
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:55,700
Correct.

307
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:10,000
And yet I don't see very clear distinctions between what you've described in terms of a multiplicity of gods with a supreme or a most high god that they're all beholden to or extensions of, or however you describe that.

308
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,060
And what I understand is the Christian view.

309
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,460
I mean, that does allow for less powers and principalities.

310
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,420
Yes.

311
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
You could say that going down...

312
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,460
The only thing I can do with what you've just brought up, the Christian view, is a critique on the Christian view.

313
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,620
I would say that on the surface, many things seem to be similar.

314
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,040
But the genuine value is radically different.

315
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:50,240
I think once we discuss the difference between a real Rolex watch and a fake Rolex watch, at a distance, most pedestrians would say they're the same thing.

316
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,100
But when you really come down to the nuts and bolts in value, one is junk and the other one's not.

317
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,620
Literally junk.

318
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:10,260
So that's an analogy, a very quick way, sort of damocles, to cut anything that might produce a lengthy critique.

319
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,620
So, I mean, I could see how that could be tested over a very long period in terms of their understanding of script, but...

320
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,800
Which is minimal to nothing.

321
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,980
Well, OK.

322
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:34,180
What they understand is their traditions, Christian traditions, and they'll tell you that.

323
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,000
Not scripture.

324
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,920
And part of the Christian tradition, hear me out, part of the Christian tradition, they're fully aware of Christian tradition, or Churchianity, I call it.

325
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,740
Many call it that.

326
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:53,520
Part of that tradition includes using verses and parts of the Bible and certain versions of the Bible to build doctrine on.

327
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,300
How many times a year is it?

328
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,900
The King James Version is the only true word of God.

329
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,120
What a hunk of rubbish.

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,160
Right?

331
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,060
So they do use that.

332
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:18,200
Just like, for example, anything that man is engaging in, any field, they promote it as being such, but when you look into it, it changes based on the era, the times, and who was controlling it, and the doctrines change.

333
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,060
And they tend to go so far away from anything that's force that it no longer resembles it.

334
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,540
Which, obviously, Christianity resembles nothing scriptural.

335
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:42,160
It's a social phenomenon that you'll find in Hellenism, in Zaroism, in any other type of world culture, defining the era.

336
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,160
That's all it is.

337
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,620
It's powerful, by the way.

338
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:58,890
If you were living in a Zaroistic Parthian empire, wherever you went, call it bullshit or not.

339
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,070
Let me just repeat that.

340
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:13,190
If you were living in a Zaroism culture and tradition, let's say in ancient Parthia, no matter what you did, thought, or whoever you spoke to, would be heavily affected by that, you see.

341
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:27,340
So this is what you're, you know, like I think I've mentioned, the academics who are self-professed atheists, not all of them, but if you said they're atheists, it's pretty accurate, because most profess that they are.

342
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,720
They have dubbed this historical era of the past 2,000 years as the Christian era, so they know more.

343
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,380
By the way, one of the things, I took a mental note, just to divert for a moment, does anyone want to bring up the Hippocratic Oath?

344
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,620
Because we're on the topic of the gods.

345
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:59,840
Put in Hippocratic Oath on the Wikipedia, I could start reading it in Greek, ancient Greek, but the translation right below it is pretty accurate, believe it or not.

346
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,600
They did a banging job on whoever translated that.

347
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:11,720
Right below it, if you start reading it, it says basically that you swear to the gods Asclepius, Hygieia, right?

348
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,780
It's a pledge to the gods, Asclepius, right?

349
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,640
And Hygieia, which we get the word hygiene, which just means balanced.

350
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,640
And all these other gods in the Hippocratic Oath.

351
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,420
Many times, when you were asking me about the gods there, Jason, I said, people get their law, their morality from their gods.

352
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,340
Like in this culture, they ask for justice all the time.

353
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,000
Justicia.

354
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,800
Go ahead and scroll down to where the Greek is, and scroll down below that and read the first sentence.

355
00:23:42,220 --> 00:24:02,160
I swear by Apollo, the healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

356
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,740
All right, let's stop for a minute.

357
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,180
This is the Hippocratic Oath, which is involved as being part of the convention of your medical, what?

358
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Sciences.

359
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,360
This is not some minor cult that we're talking about.

360
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:33,560
This is, whether you're walking down the street in a small place that has one traffic light, that guy, including the largest cosmopolitan arrangements and laboratories, this is one of the things that they lean on as being where they get their moral judgment.

361
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,780
Now, I just want to add that they have taken the gods out of it.

362
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,440
There's the modern oath now, that has been adjusted several times, that left the gods out.

363
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,160
But nonetheless, they're adhering to the deification of the oath.

364
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,920
In other words, there's enough of the body there that you could remove the part about the gods, but it's okay.

365
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,120
The rest of it that doesn't show the gods was still dedicated to them anyway.

366
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,940
So that's why my...

367
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:18,800
Jason, my point of speaking is not to tell people, this is that, or I have an interpretation, it's to say that don't you bipedal anthropomorphic figures on this planet notice that your morality, your law, and what you consider right and wrong comes from a god?

368
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,520
This is part of your operating system.

369
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,620
You can't escape that.

370
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,020
And that's the point.

371
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:40,140
And as many times as that, just that point of notice goes out, whether you want to discuss Christianity versus the scriptures, or, you know, Buddhism in the ancient pre-crit, or Hinduism, or Islam or anything is irrelevant, is do you realize what's going on?

372
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,420
Well, and they made contact with us.

373
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,380
Back then, yeah.

374
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,340
Yeah, back then.

375
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
They made contact with us big time.

376
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,300
And gave us basic principles as a species.

377
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,600
Yep.

378
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,760
Done.

379
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,120
Weaponry, chemistry, physics, all this, many of the sciences.

380
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,060
Just like today, ask anyone, you know, how did you figure that out?

381
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,960
Well, I don't know.

382
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,020
It happened by accident.

383
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,640
Yeah, right.

384
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
I'm pretty sure it did.

385
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,680
I want to bring it back to this question of the one god and the many, if I can.

386
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,500
Sure.

387
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,420
Well, let's just start with a very specific.

388
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:39,600
Then, in the scripture, the I, Natta King James Version, it's a very famous thing about Yahweh being a jealous god, there are no other gods beside me.

389
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,520
Jealous.

390
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,340
Jealous, not jealous.

391
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,680
Right.

392
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:56,580
And, in other words, because when the scripture is given, it's given as a constitution to the people of Israel to show that the Most High God also takes a position as the son of gods, but a righteous one, right?

393
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:19,860
See, because each nation has a principality, or even a sons of gods, their job is to dictate the borders and the nationalities and the separations, and they weren't doing their job, let's say, to a point where one can justify that you can see the history of what's going to happen, because you could have history of the future.

394
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:30,840
So, he ended up taking, Yahweh ended up taking a group of people and giving them the oracles of the orders of the universe, of the orders of human society, until, you know, the next step, right?

395
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:47,160
So, he took a position with one of the group of people, just as if you're a father and you have many children, and they're playing a game, that you bought them, let's say, you know, and can't you take a position and go into the game also as one of them?

396
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,680
You see what I mean?

397
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,600
Can't you be a player also?

398
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,070
So, anyway.

399
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,370
Okay, so...

400
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,490
So, he's a zealous god that way, yeah.

401
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,630
And you're equating Yahweh with the Supreme God, the Boss God.

402
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,030
Yeah, he's the Boss God, but he's just so half-king.

403
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:16,210
You know, when all the workers at a factory take lunch, you know, can the boss of the company come down and have lunch with them?

404
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,670
Of course.

405
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,990
On their level?

406
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,350
He doesn't have to be at the top floor, you know, in the...

407
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,650
wherever, you know, corporate lounge.

408
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:35,990
Well, I mean, maybe this is where I'm going with this, because it seems like this is mirrored by the mystery of the Incarnation and all that, like, can God incarnate as human and still be God?

409
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,190
Right?

410
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,150
That question.

411
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,750
Yeah, there's a danger when they do that, though, because if you...

412
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,890
that's why I tout the best thing in the movie, The Matrix, is remember when they told you if they kill you in The Matrix you die in real life?

413
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,330
If you're a god and you incarnate, and you're killed in that condition, you die on the other side as well.

414
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,530
Okay, so, but if you're THE god, then, presumably, that's not a possibility.

415
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,690
Sure it is.

416
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,410
If you're the Most High God.

417
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,390
Sure, can you...

418
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,410
I mean, he did die.

419
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,290
He did die.

420
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:06,850
Sure.

421
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,810
In other words, can an inventor of an automobile be run over by the same automobile that he invented?

422
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,230
Of course.

423
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:14,750
Very simple.

424
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,330
Well, I guess this is what I'm trying to get to, because what's your concept of God?

425
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:24,630
Because my concept of God is what incorporates everything.

426
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,910
The infinite, eternal, complex...

427
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,750
Yeah, see, I don't have a concept of God.

428
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:36,530
What I'm doing is just reporting on what's been memorialized for thousands of years that no one is talking about.

429
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,710
In Scripture.

430
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,490
Yes, in Scripture, right.

431
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,270
What's inside people's heads is irrelevant.

432
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,520
Okay, so, but when you're in Scripture, it becomes inside your head.

433
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,940
Yes, but in other words, what's inside their head, what's inside their head that people are speaking, and it's not really inside your head, you know, it's being transduced.

434
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:09,560
There is, on the surface, some discussion through the eons about Scripture, and then they veer off into culture and tradition.

435
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,740
I'm saying, why don't we keep it pure, don't cross-contaminate what we've been taught through the ages, through various cultures.

436
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:28,600
Keep it pure, just look at what's been memorialized, you see, and then talk about that, and then there'll be less to bitch and moan about, you see.

437
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
And there'll be less division.

438
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:39,380
You know, how many times have you heard of armies going to war, and they each opposingly, you know, oppose each other in battle, and they're each carrying the same cross, right?

439
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,460
Have you heard it?

440
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:40,940
Right?

441
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,640
Does that make any sense?

442
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,440
No, it doesn't.

443
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,720
And yes, to many people it does, because they say, well, that's the way it is, you see, and Scripture has a lot to say about the way things are.

444
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
And no one's discussing it.

445
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,500
When I mean no one, I mean no one, publicly, either in written or spoken.

446
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:09,500
There's many aspects, there are many people that have attempted to do it, and when anyone attempts this type of, what would you call it, a project or a life direction, guess what?

447
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,840
You have to eat.

448
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,700
You need to do exchange, you know, what they call credits or money.

449
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:26,600
The people that I've spoken to in the past that have tried to do an objectification of the Scriptures stopped at a certain point, and when I confronted some of them, well, why are they omitting X, Y, and Z, or A, B, and C?

450
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,000
And they said, well, because if we put that in, no one will buy our books, or it'll separate everyone, and no one will listen to us.

451
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,980
And then what are we going to do?

452
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,060
Live on a park bench and eat out of a garbage can?

453
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,400
Oh, how little faith you have in the gods.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,360
You see?

455
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:50,600
Sort of, but isn't an objectification of Scripture what all of these different denominations have been doing over millennia and been fighting about, essentially?

456
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,080
They might not be doing it right, but that's kind of...

457
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,020
Yeah, but ultimately they have to eat, and they like conquest.

458
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:12,740
You know, I've given many, like if you're around the mob, the underworld, they view who they're going to victimize by what level of a sucker, or a punk, or a bitch they are, what level, you know?

459
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:19,580
And they say, oh, this group here, or this individual is a sucker, and he's going to lose his assets and his money anyway.

460
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:27,040
We might as well be the ones that benefit from it, because if we don't go there and take it from him, the next guy is, and where does that leave us?

461
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,760
It's an opportunity loss, you see?

462
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:37,280
That's why they went to all these different countries, you know, converting people, because if they didn't, the Muslims might.

463
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:50,960
You know, this was, if you read some of the writings around the 16th, 14th, 15th, 16th centuries, we better go and make sure that we rule with a heavy hand in using Christianity, because if we don't, the Muslims will do it.

464
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:03,900
In other words, they're saying, these people are stupid, they're going to lose anyway, we might as well take advantage of them and gain from it anyway, because if we don't act on it, someone else will, you see?

465
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:13,300
So basically, you know, humans have been relegated as a bunch of punks or suckers that are going to lose what they have anyway, and who's going to be the first predator to come in?

466
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,020
Oh yeah, who's going to be the first predator when you have the carcass on the road?

467
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,440
Is it going to be the vulture or the coyote or the dog, you know?

468
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,360
There's a little bit of a battle there.

469
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,160
This is what's been going on with religions, whether it's Islam, Christianity, or whatever.

470
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Well yeah, when they become movements and when they become mob mentalized.

471
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,800
which is three or more.

472
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,740
Right.

473
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,980
Three or more, right.

474
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,060
We're just on the edge of that right now.

475
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:51,280
But my point is that all of those things, or most of them, probably all of them, presumably started with one person or two people trying to work out scripture and get it right.

476
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,260
Don't leave the spirit, there's always a spirit behind this too.

477
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,280
Yeah.

478
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,440
Well, okay, so my question is, or my thought, my feeling is, maybe the problem is just with attempting to objectify scripture, period.

479
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:25,500
Or to find the spirit in a letter, inside a letter, or to think that the law of the gods, or the reality of the gods, can be set in stone and then adhered to or understood as something other than a living moment that is constantly changing.

480
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,980
No, well, yes and no.

481
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,420
Let me just backtrack a little bit so we have something to lean on.

482
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:44,060
I remember reading somewhere once that if you, why don't you wash the outside, or why don't you wash the inside of the cup and that will also wash the outside of the cup, you see.

483
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:45,940
Right?

484
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,659
Remember that?

485
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:56,560
Christ was commenting on the Parashima, the Pharisees, on their rituals, and he says, look you fool, if you wash the inside of the cup, just focus on that, the outside will get washed anyway, right?

486
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
This is without any information.

487
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:18,180
How are you going to have a rational discussion regarding anything, whether it's the human body, timekeeping, physics, natural law, anything, if the people are just focusing on being rational on only one aspect of their lives and completely irrational on the rest?

488
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,720
You can't.

489
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,480
It's the whole being that has to be.

490
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,300
A sick being cannot act healthy in just one aspect.

491
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:33,180
If someone is really sick, they can't just go to work and fake that they're well, and then when they're home act like they're sick.

492
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
It's going to catch, it doesn't work.

493
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,760
You're either healthy or you're not.

494
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,020
Humankind has a very unhealthy, unrational approach to anything, you see.

495
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,000
That's one of the problems, by the way, it's personal, but I'll bring it up in personal situations.

496
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,220
I've run, when I started studying scripture, I ran into people that recommended, oh, you want to study scripture?

497
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,960
I know someone who's been doing it for 60 years, and they were part of this group.

498
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:03,200
I said to myself, oh, that's going to be great, because I know the concept of mentorship and all this, right?

499
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,940
They're going to save me a lot of time.

500
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,080
And they're full of crap.

501
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:16,120
They had a couple of nuggets, but the moment you bring up the Pope's work schedule, or what about this, what about that, oh, no, no, you can't do that, who do you think you are?

502
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,560
Everybody else is on this, you see.

503
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,940
So they're sick, and they're going to be sick until the day they die, in that perspective.

504
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,760
Then I'm saying you don't have to be.

505
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,100
You know?

506
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,840
In science, it's like cross-contamination.

507
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:46,880
When you do one experiment, you have to reset all the instruments and clean up before you do the next one, because if you don't, you have residue from the previous that will infect or affect the results of the next experiment.

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:59,220
So there's no way you're going to comprehend scripture if you don't know how the body works, that you're limited to the Pope's work schedule, that you've been lied to, the nature of the culture that you live in.

509
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,740
You see?

510
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:09,760
Yeah, well, I understand that, but does it follow from that that in order to get your body working, you've got to understand scripture?

511
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,200
Ah, yeah, is it a catch-22?

512
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,680
Is it what came first, the chicken or the egg?

513
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,700
Obviously, all things were created in their own kind, so the chicken came first.

514
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,500
But there's a little scripture in there that says that no one comes to the Father unless he goes through the Son, but he doesn't go to the Son unless the Father draws him.

515
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,780
So, then again, it's kind of like going to a private club.

516
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,540
Well, they won't let you in without a pass, but how do you get a pass?

517
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,640
Well, you have to be invited.

518
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:39,960
Uh-huh.

519
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,770
So, knowledge, I mean, how important is knowledge?

520
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:57,610
Well, you go to the God by knowledge, not by anything else, because if he if you have the wrong faith, you're not going to the gods, and the wrong faith is based on knowledge again.

521
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:05,750
You know, if you believe in Santa Claus and Guy Nelson across wearing a diaper in the Easter Bunny, you're not going anywhere right now.

522
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,230
Right.

523
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,730
You're going to have to wait until the Resurrection.

524
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:18,220
Well, I could see how bad knowledge would prevent a state of faith, or whatever we want to call it, but...

525
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:25,580
Well, technically, Greek, wouldn't the people going after Santa Claus and all that kind of stuff be actually worshipping Baal at this point?

526
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,920
Oh, yeah, Molech, specifically.

527
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,620
Yeah, Molech, yeah.

528
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,220
Yeah, which is mentioned in Scripture as well, which is mentioned very clearly, yeah.

529
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,240
So, what about knowledge as a nail to drive out a nail?

530
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:53,250
Yeah, you can, but what if, you know, if you're having a problem with wood and nails, just set fire to the whole thing, and then you'll just have the nail separate and the wood separate, you see what I mean?

531
00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:01,570
Well, what I mean is that, what if knowledge is only good for driving out, good knowledge is good for driving out bad knowledge, and then that's it.

532
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,410
So, you need all the right knowledge in order to...

533
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,810
Well, then, if all knowledge is...

534
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,930
Well, the thing is, it's knowledge of what?

535
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:20,410
Knowledge of the truth or knowledge of the lie, and most people that believe in the lie think it's good, because no one's going to say, hey, I know it's a lie, but I believe in it anyway.

536
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,250
Actually, I've had people say that to me before.

537
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,950
So, that's not a good analogy.

538
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:26,710
Yeah.

539
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,730
Those are the unrehabilitatable ones.

540
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:39,510
Those are, you see, what everybody has in common is that everyone takes up space, you know, you can measure that through displacement, and everyone gives off heat when they're alive.

541
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,630
So, that defines everyone on this planet as your starting point as a space heater.

542
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,850
So, now, do you have an intelligence, what kind of, what kind of space heater are you dealing with?

543
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,870
You see.

544
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,870
And then, that's the best starting point, because that's the common denominator.

545
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:13,950
By the way, most of the great literary works that have survived to this point that are considered helps, or, you know, something like Art of War, or whatever, the author first contemplated what everyone has in common as a common ground, you see, and that's where you start.

546
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,330
So, now, we're going to space heaters.

547
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,950
Is it a smart space heater?

548
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,730
Is it just a real dumb one that you plug in and it gives off heat?

549
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:29,670
Plug in meaning, you know, whatever culture is supplying it with its operation, you know.

550
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,330
And then, you have the ones that complain, my cord is kinked, you know, my switch isn't working.

551
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:47,490
Then, you got a place that repairs the space heaters, you know, the space heater repair the psychiatrist so they can adjust you to whatever fucked up culture you're in, you know.

552
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,190
But, the scripture is very simple.

553
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:59,410
But, it doesn't mean that it's easy and it doesn't mean that it's going to be comprehended because, again, it's written by the gods to mankind.

554
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:07,550
So, later on, no one can say we never got anything from you, but at the same time, you have to comprehend they don't act in futility.

555
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,870
They work on a very high level of efficiency, even when they're pranking you.

556
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:23,030
So, like ghosts, you know, someone sees a ghost of their grandfather, that's not their grandfather, that's a god or an angel or a demon pranking you.

557
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,890
They're operating on a high level of efficiency there and you need knowledge for that as well.

558
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,350
So...

559
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,530
Well, don't the gods give us that body to...

560
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,630
Well, they set up a system.

561
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:42,670
The best thing is, you know, people who set up businesses, for example, they set it up so they put a manager in there and they could walk away.

562
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,850
They don't have to be there all the time.

563
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,070
So, we have the ability...

564
00:41:48,970 --> 00:42:00,590
There's a life force that comes in to the planet, a very specific life force that generates through various forms of what we call biological functions and geometry.

565
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,690
All that we see that is alive, including people.

566
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,190
You know, like the plants are one expression of the...

567
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,970
of this ether, let's say, this primary field.

568
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,830
Humans are another.

569
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,390
Chipmunks are another.

570
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,270
Birds are another.

571
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,130
Fish are another.

572
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,790
Well, humans are a very special one, you know.

573
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,490
Yes.

574
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:27,510
Yes, because we're very special because we have so much and we have so little and we're absent of so many things at the same time.

575
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:28,890
Yeah.

576
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,290
We have no download like the animals have.

577
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,390
Animals, when they come into the world, they get everything, all the knowledge they need.

578
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,790
We don't.

579
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,430
We have zero knowledge when we come in.

580
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:57,950
That's interesting, but I think there's an opportunity in that, which, like, I once noticed that the word book, I once was looking for acronyms in words, like, so, for example, the word book, I came up with body of organic knowledge was an acronym for book.

581
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,590
And, the reason...

582
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,430
It came from somewhere, though, but...

583
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:10,110
Yeah, it's just imaginative, whatever, you know, speculation, but I'm remembering it now as many years ago.

584
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:10,890
Yeah, yeah.

585
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,170
It makes sense.

586
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:27,910
Because my sense, what I'm grappling to express now, I'm trying to express it from a bodily place rather than from a mental place, is that the body already has access to all of the knowledge and information in scripture and beyond.

587
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,190
Yes, access to it, right.

588
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:42,910
We don't need to refer to the book, we don't need to study Greek or Hebrew, we don't need to, you know, unpack every syllable of scripture in order to access that knowledge.

589
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,630
Well, scripture says you do, temporarily.

590
00:43:47,810 --> 00:44:02,090
But, because we're smart to a certain degree, we look at how it's been preserved, even with its failings, and we see that there's another pattern in there as well that accommodates our level of technology, right.

591
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,970
I found that everything that I discuss can be considered counterintuitive.

592
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,830
You know, how many times have you heard, go to a doctor, you'll get better.

593
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,070
It's the contrary.

594
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,470
It's like, you want to throw dice?

595
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,030
Because that's what they don't know anything.

596
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:25,990
And, you see, you want to go, spiritual, go to a guru or a priest or a rabbi, no, they don't know anything anymore.

597
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,950
Actually, they never really did.

598
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:35,230
And the ones that did were promptly disposed of or dispatched into unreality.

599
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,870
So, meaning the reality of what people can access.

600
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,750
Because, you know the concept of a lease, when you get a lease agreement?

601
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:50,130
This whole existence, even spiritual one, has been leased to the malevolent entities, and their lease is over now.

602
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,270
You see, so there's going to be a new re-arrangement, a new tenancy.

603
00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:00,770
In legal, they call it joint tenancy with humanity and these malevolent beings, you know.

604
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,590
So, that's the beauty of it.

605
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,230
In the meantime, you're going to have a struggle.

606
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:08,270
You know,

607
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,030
let's say you have

608
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,470
a roommate

609
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,270
who is a serious

610
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:10,930
drug dealer

611
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,530
and a pimp

612
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,730
and involved in

613
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,350
the underworld

614
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,430
and you didn't know

615
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,750
that,

616
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,050
but after a while

617
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:16,750
you wonder why

618
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,890
he's most active

619
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,330
in the middle

620
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:18,830
of the night

621
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,830
and he has some

622
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,010
real surly characters

623
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:21,730
coming over

624
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,030
and why things

625
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,590
go missing

626
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:23,970
and,

627
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:24,830
you know,

628
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,350
why he went

629
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:25,990
into the bathroom

630
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,550
and looked under

631
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,970
the sink

632
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,590
and there's a hundred

633
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,430
grand in cash

634
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,350
that's stashed there.

635
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,190
You know, like, what's going on?

636
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,870
Nothing makes sense when you look at the rest of the neighbors.

637
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,070
So, this is the planet Earth.

638
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:49,660
And when I say the rest of the neighbors, there's a harmony in the universe that you can see through a telescope that we don't see here on the planet.

639
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,140
So, we're it.

640
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,540
We're part of that harmony.

641
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,660
Yes, in other words, it's like an apartment complex.

642
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,060
This particular flat just happens to be the pimp and drug dealer with this other guy.

643
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,280
But the rest of the complex, the apartment building is fine, you see.

644
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,600
So, I'm not making this up.

645
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,980
This is not what I believe and this is not my, this is what I've discovered.

646
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,880
I'm trying to give reports.

647
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,300
Well, it seems like you said two different things there, at least I got two different things.

648
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:25,560
Because,

649
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,640
I mean,

650
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,680
what I was getting

651
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,160
was that

652
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,860
it only seems like

653
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,420
the problem

654
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,480
with the drug dealers

655
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,440
and that part of the

656
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,680
apartment building,

657
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,240
because actually

658
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,100
the apartment building

659
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,220
is part of a town

660
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,360
which is part of a city

661
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,500
which is part of a street

662
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,660
which is part of a planet

663
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,720
which is part of a,

664
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,060
you know,

665
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,520
a whole universal system

666
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,960
in which something

667
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,880
is unfolding

668
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,420
and therefore

669
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,140
the drug deal

670
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,980
going down there

671
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
is just part of

672
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,640
a much larger unfolding

673
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,200
and everything

674
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,260
is just fine

675
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,880
because the gods

676
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,000
are doing what

677
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,780
the gods do

678
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,360
and whether...

679
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,000
They're not just fine because they tell us that there's war in heaven also.

680
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,420
So even though we have a bad situation in this specific flat the block is under conflict as well.

681
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,980
Well, even that must be fine somewhere, like even the war in heaven.

682
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:20,300
I mean, well, this is where concepts become problematic, but there's some part of it that's fine no matter what's going on, right?

683
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,040
There's some part of it that's fine with absolutely anything.

684
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,020
Yeah, because no matter how fine something is if you're subject to death it really sucks.

685
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,840
It's when you're no longer subject to death that it's really, really fine.

686
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,140
That's what you're supposed to say.

687
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,260
So it's part of us that isn't subject to death.

688
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,240
Yes, but it's because that part of it goes into complete disanimation when you do die it's irrelevant.

689
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,780
In other words, if I can experience it now while I'm talking to you then it's not irrelevant.

690
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,060
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

691
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,940
If you die you go into complete stasis or disanimation and if you're never reanimated it's as if you've never existed.

692
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,360
Well, okay, but that's your opinion from my point of view.

693
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,300
You can cite all your scripture and all the rest of it, but you don't want me to believe you because you said that.

694
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:19,080
So all that is the nugget of quasi-information that someday I'll find out if it's true or if it's true I won't find out and if it's not true whatever, you know.

695
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,280
Sure, well, let's put it this way.

696
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,960
It's information for the wise, right?

697
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,760
You never want to convince the fool that what he believes in is wrong.

698
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,660
It's a different kind of system.

699
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,420
You have two systems.

700
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:40,880
You have the foolish majority that engages in all that, then you have the quiet and the wise that retract and, you know, it's kind of like...

701
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:47,080
But what if you get two people together head-to-head and they both think they know something and they both appear equally wise?

702
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,700
Appearances can be deceiving.

703
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,080
Well, absolutely they can.

704
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,820
So, it's back to this objectification as well.

705
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,760
Yes, very important.

706
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:12,340
If you want to objectify your subjective experience of scripture and tell me that when I die I'm going to be disanimated and et cetera, et cetera, well, I mean, that's an imposition and all I can say is no, you can't impose that on me.

707
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,100
Yeah, that's fine.

708
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,260
I don't know if that's true or not.

709
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:24,600
It's okay if it is, you know, it's not like I'm fighting to say it's not true, but I'm going to stand my ground and say I don't know if it's true and I don't know if you know it either.

710
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,640
That's fine.

711
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,580
So then we're in a big liminal space of I don't know.

712
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,520
No, you are or anybody else is.

713
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,300
In other words, I'm not invested in your belief or what level of belief you have.

714
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:44,560
I have no investment in anyone else's concepts of what truth is or what scripture is or anything else.

715
00:49:45,020 --> 00:50:03,360
The only reason I'm saying what I'm saying is because what's important, what I've been saying for a long time, even when I discuss people in industry and they don't want to do something, I say why don't you just file it away for later because obviously now is not the time and because it's one of these things that people like to go around circularly with, it's just a waste.

716
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,040
I see it as a lack of efficiency.

717
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,260
Just file it away for later.

718
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,100
In other words, let's just take, for example, let's be poignant.

719
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,560
What I said and what you just said in the past few minutes, let's just stop right there and file it away.

720
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:23,920
Well, this guy Jason thinks it doesn't work this way and the Greek says it works this way on his report.

721
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,660
Let's just file it away for later.

722
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,560
That's all you can do.

723
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:32,660
Otherwise, we get engaged in the I call it the time spin.

724
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:38,760
You know, for example, Hollywood is based on taking up your time.

725
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,480
You don't get anything out of motion pictures or entertainment.

726
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,940
Years ago, I remember meeting someone and he says I'm going to the movies in the summer because I don't have air conditioning and it's real cheap.

727
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,380
I could stay in there on the weekend from the matinee all the way to night and I'm in an air conditioned room.

728
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,020
I never thought of it that way.

729
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:07,520
Why would I compromise all these possible interests that I could have in my life in the world with just staying in a dark room with a projection because it's air conditioned.

730
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,100
That's what he does though, you see.

731
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,020
So, um.

732
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,020
Yeah.

733
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,960
In other words, it's comfort.

734
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:26,400
In other words, everyone has their comfort space but what is comfortable for one person is really discomfort or what do you call it a compromise to another, right?

735
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,480
So.

736
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:52,140
Well, I don't know if it's necessary about comfort because I mean I said last time we talked that a lot of the stuff that you disseminate I'm actually quite comfortable with it but I but That's too bad because it's very contrary to what's been said out there and if you're comfortable with it maybe you're not listening but this is not a personal critique I'm just Well, no.

737
00:51:53,180 --> 00:52:00,380
It's very disturbing what I'm saying It is very disturbing but there are people who have a predilection for disturbing scenarios Okay.

738
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,200
That's different.

739
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:01,480
Yeah.

740
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,080
That's different.

741
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,540
Yeah.

742
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,500
Of course.

743
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:03,820
Yeah.

744
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,160
That's why some people are morticians and surgeons and other people can't do it.

745
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,400
Yeah.

746
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:25,640
I mean I'm not interested in whether something makes me uncomfortable or comfortable in terms of what we're talking about knowledge or at least I know myself and knowledge well enough to know if it makes me uncomfortable that's not a good reason to back away from it I tend to go into stuff that does That's personal though.

747
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:26,360
Right.

748
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:36,580
So I'm just saying I don't have that tendency but what I do try and discern now is what kind of knowledge is actually useful to me Oh.

749
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,300
Food, clothing, shelter Yeah.

750
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:57,880
What's going to just generate obsession or unnecessary fascination let's say It doesn't have to be negative It can be positive Like I could think for hours on end about your scenarios about the gods and it would be like porn for me that's like mystical metaphysical porn that stuff Huh?

751
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:08,080
There's nothing wrong with going out and doing a history search and looking around on things either you know to gain more knowledge to get more input Yeah.

752
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,800
There is going to be more

753
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,260
by the way

754
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,760
if you're

755
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,460
like with Jason

756
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,600
and even what you're saying

757
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,040
for us to get more input

758
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,900
on what he's saying

759
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,260
it would be

760
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,880
a form of

761
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,620
you know

762
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,540
porn or whatever

763
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:18,960
to them

764
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,060
I hope you're aware

765
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,360
or have the sensitivity

766
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,540
and the sensibility

767
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,180
to notice that

768
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,900
as we go through

769
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,860
this time period

770
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,140
there will be more

771
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,940
and more discussion

772
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,200
regarding the metaphysical

773
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,820
the spiritual

774
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,380
the gods

775
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,160
the supernatural

776
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,760
paranormal

777
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,560
all of that

778
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,940
but it will increase

779
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,680
in a way

780
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
that it will be

781
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,120
as part of the norm

782
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:37,680
it won't be

783
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,760
a trend

784
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,660
where it booms

785
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,420
and everyone's like

786
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,560
oh we're tired of this already

787
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,980
it will be incorporated

788
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,260
It's funny

789
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,180
you mention that

790
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,240
you know

791
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,860
last couple of weeks

792
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,600
I've seen these cars

793
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,740
and trucks

794
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,940
with advertisements

795
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,600
on them

796
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,900
for paranormal

797
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,700
research

798
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,900
that will come

799
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,700
out to your house

800
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,160
and

801
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,440
God knows

802
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,840
they have radios

803
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,400
all of them

804
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,940
yeah

805
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,440
they don't know

806
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,860
what they're doing

807
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,520
but I just

808
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,600
I was just thinking

809
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:04,820
now

810
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,560
right when you said

811
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,060
that I said

812
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,720
yeah you know

813
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,620
it's the last couple

814
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,160
of weeks now

815
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,840
I've noticed

816
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,160
never seen them before

817
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
you know

818
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,740
and if you did

819
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,540
you went to these

820
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,520
like hole in the wall

821
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,020
shops

822
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,780
you know

823
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,580
read my palm

824
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,580
or some kind of thing

825
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,700
you know

826
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,900
well they have

827
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,780
the ghostbusters

828
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,320
things

829
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:20,940
and they are

830
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,680
each major city

831
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,740
does have a paranormal

832
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,500
research

833
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,240
PI

834
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:26,960
you know

835
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,580
investigator

836
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,460
that they'll know

837
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,220
if you call up

838
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,760
a professional

839
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,180
investigator

840
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,040
they know someone

841
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,880
usually

842
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,940
that's in that field

843
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,780
but they're all idiots

844
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,020
they actually think

845
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,160
they all fall

846
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,340
for the thing

847
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,620
you know

848
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,600
they fall for the spirit

849
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,860
all of them

850
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,040
yeah

851
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,520
even the best ones

852
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,100
I heard an interview

853
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,120
with this one guy

854
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,020
Pagano or

855
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,600
something a while back

856
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,540
and he actually thinks

857
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,680
these were disembodied

858
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,020
spirits

859
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,100
and all that

860
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,120
and he was the best

861
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,620
in the world

862
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,360
the same

863
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,780
you know

864
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,580
it's like

865
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,740
the doctor

866
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,840
let's check your blood pressure

867
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,280
why

868
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,980
there is no blood pressure

869
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,840
get out of here

870
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,520
or the guy

871
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,600
or the guy

872
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,220
in the train

873
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,720
so you

874
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,720
you can see the future

875
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,420
he gets slapped

876
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:08,720
across

877
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:08,860
you know

878
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,000
anybody

879
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,820
oh yeah

880
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,300
the psychic

881
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,180
you didn't see

882
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:14,780
that coming

883
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,120
did you

884
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,960
you didn't see that one

885
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,420
did you

886
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:16,900
yeah

887
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,980
but anybody

888
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,140
can see the future

889
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,140
based on whatever

890
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,120
skills they have

891
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,820
including psychic skills

892
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,140
you know

893
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,340
but

894
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,020
again

895
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,680
if you go back

896
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,160
to scripture

897
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,940
there's a caveat

898
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,320
there

899
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:28,840
in the end

900
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,440
the psychics

901
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,780
will be

902
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,500
shut down

903
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,760
they'll just be

904
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,460
babbling and

905
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:32,920
murmuring

906
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,560
murmuring

907
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:33,820
you know

908
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,220
bullshit

909
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,820
blah blah blah blah blah

910
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,980
just like

911
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,300
look at

912
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,980
has anything

913
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,400
these public psychics

914
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,840
ever said come true

915
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,900
no

916
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,620
so

917
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,640
has there ever been

918
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,240
a time period

919
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,880
where a psychic

920
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,620
did say something

921
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,220
and it came true

922
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,760
yes

923
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,860
many instances

924
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,000
so

925
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,500
to be considered

926
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,960
yeah

927
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,640
and privately

928
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,220
by the way

929
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,100
I do consult

930
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,720
with people

931
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,320
on the concepts

932
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,080
of the gods

933
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,340
you know

934
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,700
in other words

935
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,200
prayer

936
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,640
the spirit

937
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,760
the spirit world

938
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,800
in terms of

939
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,360
you know

940
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,740
contrary to what

941
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,180
most people

942
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,720
consider the spirit world

943
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:13,960
you know

944
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,580
dead people

945
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,380
and so they're all

946
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,220
demons or ghosts

947
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,640
you know

948
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,400
being spirits

949
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,160
demons

950
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,760
angels

951
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,900
minor gods

952
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,200
you know

953
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
territorial gods

954
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,880
based on

955
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,360
what I call

956
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,060
elementals

957
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,340
you know

958
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,760
like if you're

959
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,520
in the tropics

960
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,540
it's going to be

961
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,440
a very different

962
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,300
set

963
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,220
than if you're

964
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,820
in the desert

965
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,680
usually the desert

966
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,720
has the worst ones

967
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,720
by the way

968
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,540
and

969
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,140
how to

970
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,040
cognitively

971
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,500
you know

972
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,400
deal with that

973
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:39,780
you know

974
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,460
and what

975
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,160
prayer is

976
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,420
and

977
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,320
from a technical

978
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:45,720
aspect

979
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,260
which is just

980
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,020
a communication

981
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,200
if you see

982
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,100
an army battalion

983
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,980
out in the field

984
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,600
you'll

985
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,460
near the

986
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,580
commanding officer

987
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,440
there's always a guy

988
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:54,940
with a couple

989
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,440
of boxes

990
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,120
and some long

991
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,660
antennas

992
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,640
that's why

993
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,220
in the field

994
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,480
they always look

995
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,000
for the long

996
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,480
antennas

997
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:00,700
you know

998
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,380
that's where you

999
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,060
want to shoot at

1000
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:02,680
because that means

1001
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,300
you're usually a

1002
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,100
commanding officer

1003
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,000
nearby right

1004
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,760
but that would be

1005
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,340
the guy that's

1006
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,680
praying

1007
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,160
that's sending

1008
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,740
the messages

1009
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,700
back and forth

1010
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
you know

1011
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,360
it's a technology

1012
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,620
so just like

1013
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,880
anything else

1014
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,370
I have another

1015
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,390
question for you

1016
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,690
it might seem

1017
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,110
it might seem

1018
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:24,630
like a total

1019
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:25,450
non sequitur

1020
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:25,910
but I

1021
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:26,830
if you want

1022
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,450
I can tell you

1023
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:27,910
why I think

1024
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,470
it's related

1025
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,310
it's about

1026
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,090
circumcision

1027
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,030
do you have

1028
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:34,870
thoughts on

1029
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,390
circumcision

1030
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,190
and the covenant

1031
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,210
and what that's

1032
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:37,710
all about

1033
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,850
oh I don't

1034
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:39,290
want to think

1035
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:39,890
about that

1036
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,170
getting your

1037
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,970
thing chopped

1038
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:43,730
right

1039
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:44,570
is that something

1040
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,250
anybody wants

1041
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:45,950
to think about

1042
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:46,730
well it's the

1043
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,270
first on my

1044
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,690
plate

1045
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,010
yeah

1046
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,110
knowing the

1047
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:53,490
society

1048
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,130
we saw

1049
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,270
the cut offs

1050
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,930
to deep

1051
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,290
pride

1052
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,570
as snacks

1053
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,210
for rabbis

1054
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:58,990
oops I just

1055
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,070
said that

1056
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,670
what kind of

1057
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,090
God

1058
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:03,750
would ask

1059
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,350
for that

1060
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,130
and why

1061
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,690
well you gotta

1062
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,270
realize

1063
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:08,870
it was

1064
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:09,790
well you said

1065
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,150
why

1066
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,930
do I need to

1067
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,250
repeat

1068
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:11,810
why

1069
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:12,230
what the

1070
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:12,810
purpose of it

1071
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,030
is

1072
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,970
a cursory

1073
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:15,570
study of

1074
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:15,850
scripture

1075
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,470
will tell you

1076
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:16,810
what the

1077
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:17,470
purpose of it

1078
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:17,730
is

1079
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,650
right

1080
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,250
if you want to

1081
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:20,750
get into

1082
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,790
other aspects

1083
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,270
of it

1084
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,410
which I've

1085
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:24,830
been saying

1086
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,070
more

1087
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,270
I've always been

1088
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:26,970
saying but only

1089
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:27,450
more recently

1090
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,230
publicly is the

1091
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,910
gods don't care

1092
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,270
about your

1093
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,310
physical condition

1094
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,030
unless they have

1095
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:32,730
a purpose for you

1096
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,290
to have a good

1097
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,130
physical condition

1098
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,010
as a reward

1099
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,110
or to accomplish

1100
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:36,710
something

1101
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,250
so they have

1102
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:37,870
no problem

1103
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:38,550
taking 80

1104
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,170
million people

1105
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,870
out for target

1106
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,410
practice

1107
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,350
and if you

1108
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,010
ask them why

1109
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,890
did you just kill

1110
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,530
80 million people

1111
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,210
like why we don't

1112
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:44,750
need a reason

1113
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,450
maybe we just

1114
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:45,930
needed something

1115
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:46,490
to do

1116
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,570
fuck off

1117
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,360
you know

1118
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,020
you're still

1119
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,320
here

1120
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,220
yeah

1121
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,060
they have

1122
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,180
what do you mean

1123
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,640
by you're still

1124
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:56,840
here

1125
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,220
you know

1126
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,260
you tell somebody

1127
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,520
fuck off

1128
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,860
you're still

1129
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,380
here

1130
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,160
so they're

1131
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,680
not

1132
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,660
well they do

1133
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,200
care about

1134
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,160
physical condition

1135
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,840
if they're

1136
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,480
asking for

1137
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,620
circumcision

1138
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,760
as a covenant

1139
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,280
then

1140
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,460
so they do

1141
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,300
care in some

1142
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:17,600
way

1143
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,460
and they care about

1144
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:18,740
it's a

1145
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,380
communication

1146
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:19,900
yes

1147
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,620
it's a

1148
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,200
communication

1149
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,720
yeah like

1150
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,100
but that be handed

1151
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,760
down to the

1152
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,440
generations

1153
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,320
so like if

1154
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,540
your generations

1155
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,320
gave a damn

1156
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,120
you know

1157
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,200
you would pass

1158
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,760
that along

1159
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,500
it's

1160
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,940
strictly as a

1161
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,540
communication

1162
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,140
as well

1163
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,720
right to show

1164
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,160
do you remember

1165
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:36,600
in Genesis

1166
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,580
when Joseph and his

1167
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,200
brothers went

1168
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,800
off to the

1169
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,360
back room

1170
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,060
what why did they

1171
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,560
have to do

1172
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,340
what was the purpose

1173
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:42,800
of it

1174
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,380
it's not just

1175
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:43,780
the soul

1176
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,620
it's to communicate

1177
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,460
that we are

1178
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,340
right you see

1179
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,720
you know someone

1180
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,060
was once contemplating

1181
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:49,980
the purpose of being

1182
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,360
an artist

1183
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,700
or art

1184
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,300
I'm like listen

1185
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,240
dude get over it

1186
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,400
art is just a

1187
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,060
communication

1188
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,740
that's why it's

1189
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,500
used in many

1190
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,400
other ways

1191
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:57,900
than just

1192
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,520
a simple

1193
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,260
expression of

1194
00:59:59,260 --> 00:59:59,480
art

1195
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,240
the female

1196
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,200
of the species

1197
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:31,820
doesn't have

1198
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:32,460
that ability

1199
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,020
by the way

1200
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,900
it doesn't peak

1201
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,480
at 8 days

1202
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,120
it only peaks

1203
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,660
in the male

1204
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,560
you mean it has

1205
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,280
less ability

1206
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,360
after 8 days

1207
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,020
yes

1208
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,040
and less ability

1209
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:41,700
before it

1210
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:41,940
yeah

1211
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,680
right

1212
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,100
so what about

1213
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,860
the effect

1214
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,160
of the circumcision

1215
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,200
ritual on

1216
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,320
that infant

1217
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,740
psyche

1218
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,360
well the infant

1219
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,580
fortunately at that

1220
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,480
point is too

1221
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,760
small to receive

1222
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,620
external input

1223
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,620
it's kind of like

1224
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,400
you're just

1225
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,040
plugging the

1226
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,840
motherboard in

1227
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,720
you could start

1228
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,120
trying to

1229
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,720
download from

1230
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,020
the internet

1231
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,660
nothing's going

1232
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,160
to happen

1233
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,080
frankly I think

1234
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,940
that's bullshit

1235
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,120
yeah that's fine

1236
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,300
you're entitled

1237
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,800
to it

1238
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,580
there are lots

1239
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,260
of flowers that

1240
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:12,860
need bullshit

1241
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,440
if you've got

1242
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
some real bullshit

1243
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,320
well so what

1244
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,200
about an infant

1245
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,180
that is

1246
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,680
gestated

1247
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,300
in a

1248
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,100
womb of an

1249
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,920
alcoholic mother

1250
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,540
who's drinking

1251
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,340
the whole time

1252
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,840
you're saying

1253
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,440
that doesn't

1254
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,000
affect the

1255
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,660
development of

1256
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:27,960
the infant

1257
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,360
oh physically

1258
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,140
it does yes

1259
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,340
but the infant

1260
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,500
is not cognizant

1261
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,320
of it

1262
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,420
no I didn't

1263
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,060
say physically

1264
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,760
are you talking

1265
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,420
about physically

1266
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,280
or the memory

1267
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:40,660
of it

1268
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,500
I'm confused now

1269
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,560
well I said

1270
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,040
psyche

1271
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,780
no there is

1272
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,700
no psyche is

1273
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,100
the mind

1274
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,820
no the psyche

1275
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,420
is in the

1276
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,200
most base

1277
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,660
state

1278
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,360
it's like

1279
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,480
what we're

1280
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:52,980
discussing

1281
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,460
with the

1282
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:53,920
calculus

1283
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,620
at that point

1284
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,400
it's

1285
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:55,740
yeah

1286
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,640
stick around

1287
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,500
well psyche

1288
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,320
isn't the mind

1289
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,060
first of all

1290
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:00,600
psyche is

1291
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,380
Greek for soul

1292
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,440
so like an

1293
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,080
infant baby

1294
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,740
doesn't have a

1295
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,060
mind

1296
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:04,720
it doesn't have

1297
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,320
language

1298
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,380
so ok

1299
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,680
hold on

1300
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,140
the soul

1301
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,240
is pneuma

1302
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,920
the breath

1303
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,160
and psyche

1304
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,000
is the mind

1305
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,960
that's where

1306
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,200
you get

1307
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,860
psychologist

1308
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,680
and psychotic

1309
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,280
you can go

1310
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,760
to any

1311
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,040
dictionary

1312
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,060
will define

1313
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,740
it as such

1314
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,300
the soul

1315
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,660
you know

1316
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,640
a car is not

1317
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,060
a house

1318
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:22,620
and an elephant

1319
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,580
is not a banana

1320
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,040
right

1321
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,220
the shoe

1322
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,160
is not the sock

1323
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,240
there are three

1324
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
different aspects

1325
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,240
to it

1326
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,760
if you want

1327
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,600
to throw away

1328
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,220
um

1329
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,640
the reference

1330
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,260
on that

1331
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,100
and refer to

1332
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,140
how it affects

1333
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,960
the person's mind

1334
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,620
that's fine

1335
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,020
but to say that

1336
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,640
the psyche

1337
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,540
is the soul

1338
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,000
I have some notes

1339
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,560
I ran into

1340
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:43,960
by the way

1341
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,940
from a decade ago

1342
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,800
regarding that

1343
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,000
and

1344
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,380
one of the

1345
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,080
there was a

1346
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,320
little thin book

1347
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,500
I found

1348
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,600
on linguistics

1349
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,560
I don't have

1350
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,340
its name

1351
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,820
but the reason

1352
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,140
why

1353
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,800
one of the reasons

1354
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,300
that I saw

1355
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:58,640
that the

1356
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,420
disturbing

1357
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,580
whites

1358
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,040
disturbing

1359
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,880
the most people

1360
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,040
to define

1361
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:04,580
the psyche

1362
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,360
was because

1363
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,660
of the nature

1364
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,760
of such a definition

1365
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,100
and having

1366
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,120
something workable

1367
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
and what I

1368
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,780
started doing

1369
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,020
by

1370
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,640
defining it

1371
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,260
and I noticed

1372
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,360
that they put

1373
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:15,780
psyche

1374
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,520
it's the spirit

1375
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,200
or the soul

1376
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:17,780
or the breath

1377
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,420
like the wind

1378
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,380
what they did there

1379
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,080
to define it

1380
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,800
as the soul

1381
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,340
and the breath

1382
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:22,940
and the wind

1383
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,340
was

1384
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,080
in ancient writs

1385
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:25,720
when people

1386
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,020
were asked

1387
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,940
or even the Christ

1388
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,140
what is the spirit like

1389
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:29,960
he says it's like

1390
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,420
the wind

1391
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,200
it's not the wind

1392
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,560
in other words

1393
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,080
meaning that

1394
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,980
you don't see

1395
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,300
the wind

1396
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,780
but you see

1397
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,500
its effect

1398
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,720
you don't see

1399
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,260
the spirit

1400
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,760
but you see

1401
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,420
its effect

1402
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:39,740
right?

1403
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,980
there's a difference

1404
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:42,460
between

1405
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,340
saying

1406
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,260
I have an elephant

1407
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,120
on my chest

1408
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,960
or it feels

1409
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,020
like I have

1410
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:47,500
an elephant

1411
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,560
on my chest

1412
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,900
there's a lot of

1413
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,380
commentary

1414
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,080
that's been written

1415
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,480
on this

1416
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,620
but the moment

1417
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,760
it's very scary

1418
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,220
to people

1419
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:55,780
to define

1420
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,180
the soul

1421
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:56,680
the spirit

1422
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,300
and the body

1423
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,180
because now

1424
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,460
what that does

1425
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,300
is guess what

1426
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,260
it makes them

1427
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,000
responsible

1428
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,960
the legal system

1429
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,080
is based on that

1430
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,000
when they're not

1431
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,540
completely

1432
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,700
trying to destroy

1433
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:10,780
someone

1434
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,100
they

1435
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,440
through each step

1436
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,000
of the process

1437
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,120
they have to make sure

1438
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,600
do you understand

1439
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,320
do you comprehend

1440
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,040
and if you don't

1441
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,040
you don't continue

1442
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
so to have

1443
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,920
a firm grip

1444
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,840
on the mind

1445
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,920
is one of the keys

1446
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,540
to manipulating

1447
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,200
people

1448
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,700
you never define it

1449
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,020
you can't define

1450
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,580
the mind

1451
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,200
or the spirit

1452
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,520
that's

1453
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,500
that would be

1454
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,040
throwing

1455
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,360
casting pearls

1456
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:33,940
just flying

1457
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,700
go ahead

1458
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,420
soul is your breath

1459
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,460
I mean

1460
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,460
psyche is a

1461
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,040
Greek word

1462
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,320
right

1463
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,480
so it seems as though

1464
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:44,900
they

1465
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,200
conflated

1466
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:46,980
these different

1467
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,780
concepts

1468
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,520
of soul, mind

1469
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,440
and spirit

1470
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,020
no, they're accurate

1471
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,580
there's

1472
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,240
three distinct

1473
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:55,620
things

1474
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,100
in other words

1475
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,580
when I

1476
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,100
when I say

1477
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,860
let's go to

1478
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,480
for example

1479
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,000
soul

1480
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,640
it's not just

1481
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,320
your breath

1482
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,500
it's your metabolism

1483
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,460
your heart rate

1484
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,560
is tied into that

1485
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,480
right

1486
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,140
your metabolic

1487
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:07,900
rate

1488
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,680
which is

1489
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,180
you know

1490
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:09,960
when you're upset

1491
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,260
your metabolic rate

1492
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:11,860
is very different

1493
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,740
than when you're happy

1494
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:13,360
like you don't want

1495
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:13,780
to eat

1496
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,000
you see

1497
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,340
so your metabolic rate

1498
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,420
is your soul

1499
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,980
it functions

1500
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,580
autonomously

1501
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,640
or involuntarily

1502
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,440
because

1503
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,100
how do I know

1504
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:24,400
because

1505
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
you're still breathing

1506
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,280
when you're asleep

1507
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,140
so it does have

1508
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,140
an auto

1509
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:29,900
auto

1510
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,120
autosimplistic

1511
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,620
form

1512
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,360
where it functions

1513
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,100
on its own

1514
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,040
you see

1515
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,600
once it's attached

1516
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,480
to the body

1517
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,860
you see

1518
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,840
now if you have

1519
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,240
no soul

1520
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,180
the body dies

1521
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,260
no heartbeat

1522
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:43,860
no breathing

1523
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:44,700
that's what they

1524
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,840
look for

1525
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,300
and the spirit

1526
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:47,600
is

1527
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,300
you know

1528
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,020
is

1529
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,800
the mind

1530
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,240
that

1531
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,280
when people

1532
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,840
say they're of

1533
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,580
the same mind

1534
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,300
they still are

1535
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:54,900
distinct

1536
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,200
unto themselves

1537
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,000
but on that

1538
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,920
particular topic

1539
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,560
they do share

1540
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,380
the same spirit

1541
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:00,960
or mind

1542
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,460
I'm kind of

1543
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,040
a little confused

1544
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:04,800
when we started

1545
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,160
then

1546
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,840
because you were

1547
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,440
saying the soul

1548
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,040
was the mind

1549
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:07,500
and now you're

1550
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,020
saying the spirit

1551
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,300
no

1552
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,100
the soul

1553
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,880
is the metabolism

1554
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,720
or the breath

1555
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,880
if you want to

1556
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,440
see your soul

1557
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,100
it's very simple

1558
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,200
take a piece of glass

1559
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,880
and exhale on it

1560
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,840
and when it fogs up

1561
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
that's evidence

1562
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,660
of the soul

1563
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,140
anyone in the

1564
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,980
medical profession

1565
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,180
when they

1566
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,200
approach someone

1567
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,800
they look for

1568
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,540
evidence of the

1569
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:24,840
soul

1570
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,340
breath

1571
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,260
pulse

1572
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,680
body temperature

1573
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,980
so what about

1574
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,820
spirit as an

1575
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,560
inspiration

1576
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,900
or respiration

1577
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,720
like the root

1578
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,660
the word spirit

1579
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,800
is also rooted in

1580
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,400
those words

1581
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:35,740
like

1582
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,760
respiration

1583
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,180
right?

1584
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,860
right

1585
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,740
so

1586
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:40,680
it might be

1587
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:41,960
esperito

1588
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,520
uh-huh

1589
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,890
but it has to be

1590
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:47,430
because

1591
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,110
if you have to

1592
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,210
make anything

1593
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,190
as tangible

1594
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,010
as possible

1595
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:52,790
for people to

1596
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,390
work with it

1597
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,010
if you put someone

1598
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,570
in front of an

1599
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,290
assembly line

1600
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,250
and you said

1601
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:57,710
you're going to

1602
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,290
assemble this

1603
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:58,890
but you can't

1604
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,330
touch it

1605
01:06:59,330 --> 01:06:59,890
well how am I

1606
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,510
it's you know

1607
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,110
it's torture

1608
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,150
then you'll never

1609
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,370
get anything done

1610
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,090
yeah

1611
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,570
well

1612
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,010
of course

1613
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,070
and these

1614
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,570
concepts are

1615
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,350
notoriously intangible

1616
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,390
or even by definition

1617
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,650
they're somewhat intangible

1618
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:14,930
so

1619
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,130
let's bring it back

1620
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,030
to the body now

1621
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:17,630
but hold on

1622
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:18,590
the spirit is only

1623
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:19,290
intangible

1624
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,130
completely intangible

1625
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:21,810
unless you have

1626
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:22,330
the right

1627
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:23,550
system

1628
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:24,830
uh

1629
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,070
a record

1630
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,070
a vinyl record

1631
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:27,730
or a CD

1632
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,290
no one

1633
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,390
knows what's on it

1634
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,090
unless you put it

1635
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:31,950
in the right system

1636
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,210
and if that

1637
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:33,870
system's not

1638
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:34,430
plugged in

1639
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,330
you'll never get

1640
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:35,950
what's on that

1641
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:36,490
DVD

1642
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:37,970
or record

1643
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,890
I even

1644
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,710
as a joke once

1645
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:41,810
as a retired

1646
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:42,710
material scientist

1647
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:43,230
I brought him

1648
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:43,710
a DVD

1649
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,250
and I said

1650
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:44,910
what is it?

1651
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:55,150
and he gave me a three page report on it on its weight its chemical composition did XRF analysis on it he gave me all the dimensions I said it's the Beatles White Album did you see that?

1652
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:55,490
nope

1653
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:59,680
you see

1654
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,160
because he didn't

1655
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,200
all the science

1656
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,000
did not have

1657
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,780
the right equipment

1658
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,320
to play

1659
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,000
the information on it

1660
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,340
that's where it's intangible

1661
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,980
and that's the difficult part

1662
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,000
okay

1663
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,700
and what are you

1664
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,819
referring to then

1665
01:08:15,819 --> 01:08:16,560
as the instrument

1666
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,319
for playing

1667
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:17,979
the body

1668
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:19,140
the body and the soul

1669
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:19,600
okay

1670
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,060
the body

1671
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,380
right

1672
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,180
so

1673
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,080
and soul

1674
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,760
if you kill

1675
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,479
the dead people

1676
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,020
don't have a spirit

1677
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,439
right

1678
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:27,939
and if

1679
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:29,800
a body without a soul

1680
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,479
is

1681
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,520
what

1682
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:31,939
dead

1683
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:32,479
or

1684
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:33,880
a vehicle

1685
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,960
for something else

1686
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,939
it's dead

1687
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:36,500
well

1688
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,080
it's just

1689
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,420
a biological machine

1690
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:39,819
and

1691
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:41,060
you have to also

1692
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,240
and you do know

1693
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,779
I'm sure

1694
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:44,600
that once the body dies

1695
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,300
you have

1696
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,200
a rapid

1697
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:46,939
inset

1698
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:47,700
of decomposition

1699
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,180
that degrades it

1700
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:49,660
to the point

1701
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,720
where it could not go back

1702
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,560
to it's original

1703
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:52,420
function

1704
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,140
very rapidly

1705
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:54,520
right

1706
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:54,859
okay

1707
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:56,600
and before it's born

1708
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,680
the body is in the womb

1709
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,340
and it's

1710
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,939
breathing

1711
01:08:58,939 --> 01:08:59,819
well it's breathing

1712
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:00,700
through the

1713
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,240
umbilical

1714
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:01,700
yeah

1715
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:05,240
the umbilical cord

1716
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,200
yeah

1717
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:06,979
it's in a vacuum

1718
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:08,020
it's in the most

1719
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,979
optimum condition

1720
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:09,620
to do that

1721
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:09,920
yeah

1722
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,600
right

1723
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,600
so

1724
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,060
and a newborn baby

1725
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,020
is

1726
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,040
has a soul

1727
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:18,880
absolutely

1728
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,540
it shares

1729
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:19,960
it shares the soul

1730
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,500
with the mother

1731
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,120
that's why

1732
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,399
you said earlier

1733
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,399
if the mother's

1734
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,319
soul

1735
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,300
she's taking

1736
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:25,859
uh

1737
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,600
she's

1738
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:27,960
she's

1739
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,880
what do you call it

1740
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,920
marinated in alcohol

1741
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,600
I call it

1742
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:30,819
right

1743
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:31,160
yeah

1744
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:31,979
you know when you

1745
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:32,640
marinate something

1746
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,160
and it goes through

1747
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,500
and through

1748
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,240
yeah

1749
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:34,680
pickled

1750
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,240
yeah of course

1751
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:35,779
pickled

1752
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:36,060
pickled

1753
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:36,520
thank you

1754
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:36,819
yeah

1755
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:37,300
yeah

1756
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:37,640
yeah

1757
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,580
that's of course

1758
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,899
so um

1759
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:42,060
yeah that baby's

1760
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:42,939
screwed basically

1761
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:43,720
if it's pickled

1762
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,819
if the mother is pickled

1763
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:45,120
yeah

1764
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:47,540
right

1765
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,140
so

1766
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,260
which is proven

1767
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,319
provable scientifically

1768
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,060
by the way

1769
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,120
right so the baby's

1770
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,560
born

1771
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,830
whatever happens

1772
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,630
to that baby

1773
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,310
physically

1774
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:02,310
uh

1775
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:03,590
it goes into the body

1776
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,870
right

1777
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,650
like you talk about

1778
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,230
how objects

1779
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:07,950
memory

1780
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,350
well certainly the human body

1781
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,010
has memory

1782
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,250
just because babies can't

1783
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:11,970
form memory

1784
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,310
the way we later

1785
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,930
form them

1786
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:14,870
doesn't mean that the

1787
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,090
body doesn't remember

1788
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,390
isn't imprinted

1789
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,170
with what happens

1790
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:18,730
to it

1791
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,470
you know

1792
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,610
to the womb

1793
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,290
you do lose a lot of

1794
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:23,310
your juvenile memory

1795
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,230
when you lose your

1796
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,230
first set of teeth

1797
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,540
ok

1798
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,420
there's memory

1799
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,140
and the memory

1800
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:30,020
is uh

1801
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,440
the illicit memory

1802
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,460
is held in the bones

1803
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,080
heart tissue

1804
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:33,400
the

1805
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,320
the early

1806
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:34,880
uh

1807
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,660
schlocky

1808
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,140
and who's the other guy

1809
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,240
maybe Bruce you can help me

1810
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,960
the earliest

1811
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,120
chip

1812
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,200
chip

1813
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,920
memory chip

1814
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:42,940
and transistor

1815
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:43,860
researchers

1816
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,520
oh boy

1817
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,120
schlocky was one of them

1818
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,580
right

1819
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,020
in the 1920s

1820
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:48,320
uh

1821
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,900
one of the guys

1822
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,100
that was part of the

1823
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,780
bell labs

1824
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,320
he said

1825
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,260
these memory chips

1826
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:53,940
that you're building

1827
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:54,560
look at this

1828
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,560
and he gave them a list

1829
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,180
of all these compounds

1830
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,760
and he says

1831
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,540
well where'd you get that

1832
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,600
that's exactly what we're using

1833
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,540
he says this is a list

1834
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,460
of all the compounds

1835
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,320
found in teeth and bones

1836
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,140
oh that's interesting

1837
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,520
yeah

1838
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,320
mhm

1839
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,500
and you know

1840
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,600
to touch back on

1841
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,460
that uh

1842
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:14,960
when you mentioned

1843
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,760
about the spirit

1844
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,380
that is the most

1845
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,700
valuable to the god

1846
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,080
or to the gods

1847
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,180
right

1848
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,400
that's right

1849
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,340
because when you're done

1850
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,160
being animated

1851
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,880
they check you off

1852
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,400
in the book

1853
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,580
that this one came through

1854
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:26,900
this

1855
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,680
living

1856
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,720
freaking hell

1857
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,660
from a

1858
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:31,800
cognitive

1859
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,400
language

1860
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:32,980
point of view

1861
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,560
and we're putting him

1862
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,840
back on the hard drive

1863
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,440
on the shelf

1864
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,800
until the resurrection

1865
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,080
or it might be

1866
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:39,600
one of the ones

1867
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,220
that we destroy

1868
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:40,540
but anyway it never

1869
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,320
comes back

1870
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,540
right

1871
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,300
so

1872
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:43,860
low level

1873
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,200
yeah

1874
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,280
they say

1875
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,560
basically everyone

1876
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,380
will come back

1877
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,580
so uh

1878
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,320
yippee

1879
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,820
anyway

1880
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,620
so

1881
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,780
bringing it back

1882
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,060
to

1883
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,760
what I was trying

1884
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,520
to explore here

1885
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,340
and this is kind of

1886
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,000
I guess a living

1887
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,060
example of why

1888
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:02,820
I'm so wary

1889
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,280
of

1890
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,080
high concept

1891
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,640
stuff

1892
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,200
to me all this

1893
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,840
stuff that you're

1894
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,600
talking about

1895
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,240
resurrection

1896
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,200
and reanimation

1897
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,860
and the gods

1898
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,720
and all of that

1899
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,580
is

1900
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,100
way less real

1901
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:14,980
than the reality

1902
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,080
of an infant child

1903
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,080
being traumatized

1904
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,960
to 8 days

1905
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,820
in such a way

1906
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,120
that

1907
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,520
it's development

1908
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,260
is probably

1909
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,280
severely

1910
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:23,960
sabotaged

1911
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,640
let's say

1912
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,420
yeah it is

1913
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,580
don't get over it

1914
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,620
by that ritual

1915
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,240
where I wasn't

1916
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,040
circumcised

1917
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:29,700
I'm glad to say

1918
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,900
I'm the pickled baby

1919
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,700
with the alcoholic

1920
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,180
mother

1921
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,140
and I'm still trying

1922
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,000
to get over that

1923
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,320
but

1924
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,180
so that's why

1925
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,040
I try to bullshit

1926
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:38,740
that because

1927
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,160
it seems as though

1928
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:40,520
you were

1929
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,800
disregarding

1930
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,020
what I see

1931
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,720
as a reality

1932
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,080
there

1933
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,100
the circumcision

1934
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,600
ritual had some

1935
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,580
purpose besides

1936
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,520
just identifying

1937
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,380
the tribe

1938
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,900
that it had to do

1939
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,860
with what I call

1940
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,680
traumagenesis

1941
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,400
which is

1942
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:54,600
interfering with

1943
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,860
the natural process

1944
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,900
organic process

1945
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,200
by which the soul

1946
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,180
becomes

1947
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,200
embedded in the

1948
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:00,620
body

1949
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,880
well it's

1950
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,540
all trauma

1951
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,140
because

1952
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,420
Eve was told

1953
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:05,920
she will

1954
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,960
bear her children

1955
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,800
with trauma

1956
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,400
and if anyone

1957
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,160
has been around

1958
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,340
any other creatures

1959
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,280
that bear their young

1960
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,300
a cow

1961
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,100
most cows

1962
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:14,780
will just be

1963
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,520
chewing the cud

1964
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,380
and oops

1965
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,100
what's that

1966
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,720
mmm

1967
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,940
ok back to chewing

1968
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:19,620
the cud now

1969
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,140
I just drop the calf

1970
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:21,800
no big deal

1971
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,580
I've seen a cat

1972
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,320
come to me

1973
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
comes into the closet

1974
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,520
comes out

1975
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:26,860
I look

1976
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,460
oh there's a kitten

1977
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:28,240
she looks at me

1978
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,600
I'm going to go

1979
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,620
nibble on some food

1980
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,480
comes back

1981
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,420
drops another kitten

1982
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:31,940
meow

1983
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,440
hi

1984
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,120
you know

1985
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:34,820
it's like wow

1986
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,480
you know

1987
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,820
it's all trauma

1988
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:37,760
ok well

1989
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,240
but that

1990
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,900
I mean

1991
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,620
at that point

1992
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,420
you can justify

1993
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,280
MKUltra

1994
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,000
and you know

1995
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,840
satanic ritual

1996
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,280
abuse

1997
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,780
and whatever

1998
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,240
just

1999
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,460
throw a

2000
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,620
it's all trauma

2001
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,380
get out of jail

2002
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,080
free card

2003
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,340
no because you

2004
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,200
can do something

2005
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,600
for example

2006
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,940
on a social

2007
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,100
cultural level

2008
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,460
you could get

2009
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,240
you could stop

2010
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,460
the satanic

2011
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,480
satanic just

2012
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,260
pretty much

2013
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,780
all the major

2014
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,540
stuff right

2015
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,740
those are just

2016
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,320
satanic

2017
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:03,940
manifestations

2018
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:04,760
aren't they

2019
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,260
yeah but

2020
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,000
but if you say

2021
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,400
we're going to

2022
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,120
stop the trauma

2023
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:07,860
by stopping

2024
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,600
childbirth

2025
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,640
at least

2026
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,040
and all that

2027
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,500
then everything

2028
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:10,960
stops

2029
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,460
and by the way

2030
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,020
they're going

2031
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:12,840
on that direction

2032
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,760
the goddess religion

2033
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,980
is that

2034
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,760
is

2035
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,280
is

2036
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,180
anything to

2037
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:17,660
stop

2038
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,920
the plan

2039
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,060
but it has to be

2040
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,880
done voluntarily

2041
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,740
in other words

2042
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:23,640
the goddess religion

2043
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,100
she will not

2044
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:25,480
shoot you

2045
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,380
she'll just convince you

2046
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,080
to buy a gun

2047
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:27,620
and then say

2048
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,640
oh pat you on the back

2049
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,580
you got the gun great

2050
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,800
I'll see you next week

2051
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,460
and next week she says

2052
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,360
why don't you aim it at your head

2053
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,040
and pull the trigger

2054
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,720
no not this week

2055
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,920
I'll come back next week

2056
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,200
and convince you to do it then

2057
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,680
you see

2058
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,800
well my point was just

2059
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,800
that it's an unnecessary

2060
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:40,660
conflation

2061
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,520
like you can say

2062
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,560
everything's traumatic

2063
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,500
and that'll be true

2064
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,380
but they're not all

2065
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,160
the same kinds of trauma

2066
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,740
and

2067
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,680
there are more reasons

2068
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,100
to identify trauma

2069
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,080
genesis

2070
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,840
rituals

2071
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,860
than to say

2072
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,680
trauma's bad

2073
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,640
and it shouldn't be done

2074
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,060
like it's

2075
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,380
also a way

2076
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,160
to understand

2077
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,340
better

2078
01:14:59,640 --> 01:14:59,880
the

2079
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,420
well the way

2080
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:01,840
in which

2081
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,520
we've been

2082
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,760
psychically configured

2083
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,900
I suppose

2084
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,880
but if you could

2085
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,360
say for example

2086
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,020
real quick

2087
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,080
from a

2088
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:09,680
a pseudo

2089
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,600
philosophical

2090
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,180
theological

2091
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,340
point of view

2092
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,520
is

2093
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,440
circumcision

2094
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,100
necessary

2095
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,300
for the resurrection

2096
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,540
and what's the answer there

2097
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:17,840
no

2098
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,000
so you can stop

2099
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,980
all the circumcision

2100
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,160
and it has to be done

2101
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:23,740
voluntarily

2102
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,660
either way

2103
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,580
you see

2104
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,180
I suppose

2105
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:28,680
but I mean

2106
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,460
I'm not talking about

2107
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,460
social change

2108
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,220
or social reformation

2109
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,500
either

2110
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,580
no I'm not either

2111
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,300
I'm just saying

2112
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,020
is it possible

2113
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,440
yes

2114
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,740
but that's

2115
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,400
that's

2116
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,640
that's a generational

2117
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,280
thing

2118
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,080
I mean it's

2119
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:41,860
it's

2120
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,580
mom and dad

2121
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,120
making the

2122
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,820
yeah it's making

2123
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,060
it's mom and dad

2124
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,120
making the decision

2125
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:46,820
it's not like

2126
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,700
the baby's getting up

2127
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,460
and grabbing the guy

2128
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,180
by the

2129
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:49,800
by the shirt

2130
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,120
hey

2131
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,260
put that

2132
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,940
many western cultures

2133
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,800
do the chop

2134
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,580
at the hospital

2135
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:56,560
unreal

2136
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,140
unritualistically

2137
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,180
meaning scripturally

2138
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:00,460
I mean

2139
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,160
but it still is

2140
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,980
ritual to them

2141
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,260
if you

2142
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:03,820
I think

2143
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,740
I think with a boy

2144
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,540
if you don't

2145
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,780
unless you

2146
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,640
you object to it

2147
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,620
they do it automatically

2148
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,180
don't they

2149
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,120
in western culture

2150
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:10,540
supposedly

2151
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:10,840
yeah

2152
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,520
in high school

2153
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,040
so that's an interesting

2154
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,240
from an objective

2155
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:15,840
point of view

2156
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,040
to see what's going on

2157
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,280
yeah

2158
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:18,640
mhm

2159
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,340
so I mean all of this

2160
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:20,820
I think

2161
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,880
for me all this

2162
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,920
and the reason I said

2163
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,240
it was somewhat congruent

2164
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,320
with my earlier questions

2165
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,080
is that for me

2166
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:26,940
it comes back to

2167
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,400
to my own sense

2168
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,060
which is that

2169
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,560
if the body is healthy

2170
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,700
and the energy

2171
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,200
of the body

2172
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,060
is all flowing

2173
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,200
in the way that

2174
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,160
it's supposed to be flowing

2175
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,760
then we have

2176
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,120
just natural access

2177
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,580
to the realm of the gods

2178
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:39,540
as you call it

2179
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,240
to reality

2180
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,320
as it is

2181
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,240
no you don't

2182
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,800
ok

2183
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,500
so

2184
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,340
why not

2185
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,100
if you have

2186
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,520
let's just

2187
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,300
put it this way

2188
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,000
it's very simple

2189
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,500
let's say you're living

2190
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,280
in a big city

2191
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,780
in New York

2192
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,480
and you walk by

2193
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,520
the Waldorf Astoria

2194
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,180
and there's a big party

2195
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:54,820
going on

2196
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,440
and you say

2197
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,500
well I have natural

2198
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,680
energy flowing

2199
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,400
through my body

2200
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,240
I'm going to go into

2201
01:16:59,240 --> 01:16:59,800
this party

2202
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,600
at the Waldorf

2203
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,480
mhm

2204
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,560
they're going to

2205
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,640
stop you right there

2206
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,200
well how is that

2207
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:05,780
a parallel

2208
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,700
so explain to me

2209
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,380
how the Waldorf

2210
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:08,940
I don't know

2211
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:09,600
how more simple

2212
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,440
can that could be

2213
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:11,820
there's somewhere

2214
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,560
I read that

2215
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,640
if you invite yourself

2216
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,180
you may not

2217
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,740
be wanted

2218
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,440
in that position

2219
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,120
you might be told

2220
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:16,460
to go

2221
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,260
either leave

2222
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,140
or sit in the back

2223
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,060
yes but this is all

2224
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,080
so in other words

2225
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,540
the gods

2226
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,400
the gods are not

2227
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,000
some kind of

2228
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,840
pond scum

2229
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,180
uh

2230
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:27,980
purely like

2231
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:28,340
ooo

2232
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,400
goop

2233
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,640
that oh

2234
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,880
you just go into it

2235
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,120
you know

2236
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:32,960
they'll surround you

2237
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,300
and all that

2238
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:33,760
no no no

2239
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,220
they have a

2240
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,060
they're a parallel

2241
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:35,940
society

2242
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,580
in other words

2243
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,220
if you're like

2244
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:38,980
a headhunter

2245
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,280
and you come to a society

2246
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,080
that has electricity

2247
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,000
cars airplanes

2248
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,500
and all that

2249
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,480
hey I'm at your

2250
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,040
customs let me in

2251
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,340
let me into your

2252
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:47,140
country right now

2253
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:47,560
they're going to say

2254
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,380
hold on a second

2255
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,260
where's your papers

2256
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:49,820
where's this

2257
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,360
where's that

2258
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,060
were you invited

2259
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,340
mhm

2260
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,120
they'll stick you

2261
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,180
in a detention cell

2262
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:57,720
well let me know

2263
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,620
this movement

2264
01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,260
that's your viewpoint

2265
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,420
that's the very thing

2266
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,040
I'm questioning

2267
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,480
is that hierarchical

2268
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,040
well I think

2269
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:03,220
you're

2270
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,280
god's viewpoint

2271
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,200
that's fine

2272
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,040
I do respect the questions

2273
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,140
but let me just make a

2274
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,100
criticism on it

2275
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,440
most people think

2276
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:10,880
because

2277
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,720
when you hear

2278
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,300
even the word

2279
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:12,600
neter

2280
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,520
which is the ancient

2281
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,300
Egyptian word

2282
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,060
meaning gods

2283
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,960
when you hear nature

2284
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,760
right away you think

2285
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,860
gods oh god is nature

2286
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,680
all this other stuff

2287
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,920
this natural stuff

2288
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,460
that's part of the creation

2289
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:23,720
um

2290
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,500
uh

2291
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,360
the gods

2292
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:25,760
um

2293
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,500
the thing that

2294
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,900
I like to report on

2295
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:28,660
is that they are

2296
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,120
a parallel society

2297
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,680
of very high

2298
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,280
advancement

2299
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,460
this is just

2300
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,660
language that I'm

2301
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,360
using now

2302
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,440
more than advanced

2303
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,540
because they're primary

2304
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,200
to us

2305
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,260
um

2306
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,140
and to associate them

2307
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,080
with palm scum

2308
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,020
or air

2309
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:44,720
or a

2310
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,060
mountain valley

2311
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,840
or something

2312
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,820
that you just lay down

2313
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:48,360
in the grass

2314
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,200
and you're with the gods

2315
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,080
it's total rubbish

2316
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,120
uh

2317
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,320
from what can be reported

2318
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:52,960
on that's been

2319
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:53,680
memorialized

2320
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,140
now I'm not

2321
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:54,900
am I saying

2322
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,220
you don't have the right

2323
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:56,840
to think that

2324
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,740
of course you do

2325
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,200
as a matter of fact

2326
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,780
you've reinterpreted

2327
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,880
I mean you don't really

2328
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,820
know what I'm thinking

2329
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,700
I might not have expressed

2330
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,240
it very well

2331
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,120
but I certainly didn't

2332
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,380
express what you've

2333
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,440
echoed back at me

2334
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,820
now a lot of people

2335
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:09,660
think that

2336
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,000
let me just

2337
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,660
maybe it's not

2338
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,340
directly to you

2339
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,220
but the thing is

2340
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:13,520
that

2341
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,460
how difficult

2342
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,860
is it to comprehend

2343
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,700
that the gods

2344
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,620
are just a parallel

2345
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,320
society

2346
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,140
of much higher dynamics

2347
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,520
basically

2348
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:21,860
they're still

2349
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,100
parallel societies

2350
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
yeah they're

2351
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,020
that's all they are

2352
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,320
how difficult is that

2353
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,700
in other words

2354
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:28,700
just like we have

2355
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,320
a society

2356
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:29,800
you know

2357
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,240
with different

2358
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,160
orders and levels

2359
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,060
the street sweeper

2360
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:32,640
and the king

2361
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,580
and the guy who

2362
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,280
drives the train

2363
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:34,940
the guy who makes

2364
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,620
the airplanes

2365
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,360
all the various

2366
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,280
aspects of a society

2367
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:38,900
I'm not saying

2368
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,080
just a family

2369
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,060
because you know

2370
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,200
when I say society

2371
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:42,760
in other words

2372
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,600
there's a very big

2373
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,940
cross section of industry

2374
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,320
they have a big industry

2375
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,400
going on over there

2376
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,140
as well

2377
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:49,940
ok well I mean

2378
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:50,580
it's fascinating

2379
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,140
it's a fascinating model

2380
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,200
it's your model

2381
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,400
in your interpretation

2382
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,280
well it's not

2383
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,060
my interpretation

2384
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:57,780
when I read

2385
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,240
in scripture

2386
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,960
all the writs

2387
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,240
they have one god

2388
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:00,600
for this

2389
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,420
one god for this

2390
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,220
one god for that

2391
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,000
and it keeps going on

2392
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,920
with a list of a thousand

2393
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,140
different things

2394
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,920
that can be done

2395
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,820
with a thousand different

2396
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:07,700
gods to do them

2397
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,560
and even their gods

2398
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,100
they actually have

2399
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,140
helps to do this

2400
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:10,920
and they call in another

2401
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,700
god to do that

2402
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,160
shit

2403
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,180
that sounds like

2404
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:13,640
you know

2405
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,200
mid-century America

2406
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,020
TV's broken

2407
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,540
what do we do

2408
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,740
call a TV repairman

2409
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,540
a tooth hurts

2410
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,320
go to the dentist

2411
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,620
oh the roof needs to be fixed

2412
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,360
you see all the various

2413
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,480
things you have access to

2414
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,000
and the various

2415
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,700
hats and jobs

2416
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,420
that people have

2417
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,180
that's what I'm noticing

2418
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,020
and reading the ancient

2419
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,260
writs

2420
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:28,900
I'm like whoa

2421
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,400
there are very

2422
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,480
they have a tremendous

2423
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,580
variety of things

2424
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,660
going on over there

2425
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,620
well maybe you're

2426
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,740
projecting your own

2427
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,240
experience onto that

2428
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:37,980
and

2429
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,700
well I'm

2430
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,540
I know

2431
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,600
because I'm doing it

2432
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,920
familiar in such a way

2433
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,060
that it works for you

2434
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,780
well I'm not

2435
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,000
this stuff was written

2436
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,960
before you and I

2437
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:48,480
were born

2438
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,220
in that way

2439
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,280
you can go read it

2440
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,040
yeah I know

2441
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,720
but I see your

2442
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,520
interpretation

2443
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,440
that you're interpreting

2444
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,080
I don't have an

2445
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,220
interpretation on it

2446
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:55,760
well you do

2447
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,520
I'm just reporting

2448
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:56,880
what's

2449
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,920
I'm just reporting

2450
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,640
what's there

2451
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,820
you're reporting your

2452
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,580
interpretation

2453
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,560
well my version

2454
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,380
there's only one

2455
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:03,940
interpretation

2456
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,680
there are many

2457
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,180
versions

2458
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:05,920
it would be more

2459
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,700
accurate if you said

2460
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,160
my version of it

2461
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:08,500
right

2462
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,980
and I can only

2463
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,020
give my version

2464
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:13,840
of the report

2465
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,320
that's why I always

2466
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:15,820
suggest people

2467
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:16,400
why don't you go and

2468
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,260
study and come back

2469
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,100
and give us a report

2470
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:18,580
on what you've

2471
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,080
discovered

2472
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,980
well I have

2473
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:20,500
you know I have

2474
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,820
been doing my

2475
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,180
studies

2476
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:22,700
for the last

2477
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,460
whatever how many

2478
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:23,840
years

2479
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,300
just because I

2480
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,000
haven't studied the

2481
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,860
same things

2482
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,940
or in the same way

2483
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,300
so let me show you

2484
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,040
where is it

2485
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:29,760
my version

2486
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,640
when he says

2487
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,140
for example

2488
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:31,920
let's use the

2489
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,960
biblical text

2490
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,540
I'm going to send

2491
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,520
a destroying angel

2492
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,320
oh I'm going to

2493
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:35,880
send an angel

2494
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,620
who's going to

2495
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,120
show you how to

2496
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:37,820
build these things

2497
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,480
oh I'm going to

2498
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:38,980
show you another

2499
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:39,960
angel that's

2500
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,400
going to give you

2501
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:40,680
knowledge

2502
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,160
oh I'm going to

2503
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:41,620
give you another

2504
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,380
angel that's going

2505
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,980
to torment you

2506
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,880
give you another

2507
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,360
angel that's

2508
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:44,820
going to make you

2509
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,300
stubborn

2510
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,980
and send another

2511
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,560
angel that's going

2512
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,140
to make the frogs

2513
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:47,620
come out of the

2514
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:47,800
water

2515
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,800
send another angel

2516
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,460
and make the rivers

2517
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,880
turn red

2518
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,640
and send another

2519
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,300
angel that's going

2520
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,660
to do this

2521
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,440
where am I off

2522
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,880
where am I off

2523
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,740
well can you

2524
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:58,020
mention the Gods

2525
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:58,760
that come to all

2526
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,220
the different

2527
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:00,220
countries

2528
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,620
you can choose

2529
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,520
how literally

2530
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,340
you interpret

2531
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:03,760
that

2532
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:09,780
and even if you choose to interpret literally, you can choose whether you interpret that

2533
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:15,740
in a way that matches your experience as a human, a socialized human being.

2534
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:29,900
Like when the Egyptians talked about the netas, as I understand it, my limited way, the neta means principle, something like principle, and that the netas were an extension of Atum, which was the single god, and all these other gods were merely extensions of that one god.

2535
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:42,520
So when you read about a destroying angel in the scripture, you can just as well interpret that as the one all-high god extending some part of his awareness into the chattel realm and causing something to happen.

2536
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:49,280
And by that same token you could see that human beings were made in God's image, therefore we are also extensions of the most high.

2537
01:22:49,520 --> 01:23:01,580
Therefore everything that happens is an extension of the most high, from the gods all the way on down to our, you know, crack-smoking, fucked-up, traumatized, circumcised baby, you know, culture that you're reigning against.

2538
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:15,120
So that's what I mean by access to the realm of the gods, because the realm of the gods is embedded in everything, it's in me, it's in the sinews of my flesh, and then every thought I have is an extension of that.

2539
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:26,540
So I can go straight to the source, not with my ego, not with my concepts, but some part of me can't extricate myself from that anyway, like I'm only here because of that.

2540
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,200
Sure, what you just gave is accurate in a corporate sense.

2541
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:39,680
Like for example, when the washing machine breaks down, I'm not discounting it, just consider this, Maytag, someone's at the door, who is it?

2542
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,500
It's Maytag.

2543
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,560
Oh, come on in, the washing machine's broken.

2544
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,940
What Maytag?

2545
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,220
What do you mean it's Maytag?

2546
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,660
It's a guy that works for Maytag in the uniform.

2547
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,180
Of course he's an extension of Maytag.

2548
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,920
And you know, for example, if

2549
01:23:52,920 --> 01:24:01,080
you read a lot of the corporate covenants of banks, most people don't know this,

2550
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:06,400
but you could look this up, is that when you go into a bank, which is an association,

2551
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:12,280
all banks are called associations, they have a corporate side to them also, to confuse people,

2552
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:17,900
but in the association side of the bank, if you go to a bank and they admit that you're

2553
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:23,760
now dealing with the association of the bank, whether you're speaking to the teller, or the

2554
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:29,160
janitor, or the CEO, or the head boss, they all have the same authority.

2555
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:35,480
In other words, they cannot discount one's position over the other, right?

2556
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:36,980
You see what I mean?

2557
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,620
It's because it's an association.

2558
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:59,020
So now corporations are different, and there's different layouts and different groups, but from an association point of view with the gods as a realm, I would say yes, they all are extensions, of course, just like the Maytag repairman is Maytag, and no one questions that.

2559
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:06,360
But what's really going on, is what I'd like to bring forward, is that when he sends a destroying angel, that is an entity unto itself.

2560
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:16,580
In other words, if we went over into the world of the gods, and walked into the bar, where they all go and have their drinks, and you say, do you guys know the destroying angel?

2561
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,960
Oh yeah, he's over there in Iraq right now.

2562
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:19,880
Right?

2563
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,120
Well, the cells are all entities unto themselves also.

2564
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:42,170
Yeah, they're an expression of the ether, of the life ether, because when you actually start examining, which is extremely difficult, a live cell, all this talk about biology is rubbish, because everything that they're talking about biology is dead stuff.

2565
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:49,770
Once you view it and put out the information, as they do academically, you know they're talking about dead things.

2566
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:55,590
Very rarely can they deeply analyze or observe things that are alive in a cellular nature.

2567
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:00,030
The moment you extract the cell from its living host, it goes into death mode.

2568
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:00,670
Right?

2569
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:05,030
Who's doing the live research?

2570
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:08,210
Oh, there's quite a few, and they always get shut down.

2571
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:08,710
Right.

2572
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,890
Yeah, always get shut down, because it goes against the laws of physics.

2573
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,790
You know, things appear out of nothing.

2574
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,010
It's not one of the man hunters.

2575
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,290
Right.

2576
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,950
Plants are a wonderful thing to study.

2577
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:32,290
If you have asphalt that hasn't been rolled that well, or even one that doesn't, you'll see sprouts push up through the asphalt.

2578
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,430
You get where I'm going with this, right?

2579
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:36,270
Yeah.

2580
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:49,670
That doesn't work with physics, because, you know, a scientist engineer will pull out his, you know, tablet or whatever, and say, wait a second, you know, you need 350 pounds per square inch to do that.

2581
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:55,630
And, you know, wait, how does that sprout that you can crush in your finger do that?

2582
01:26:56,470 --> 01:27:00,550
It's geometric expression, you see.

2583
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:21,030
Once you start to contemplate that, if you really want to get into what the gods are expressing to us is the signal that's being sent to the earth, this free-form primal field, which, by the way, there is no branch of science that can define a field.

2584
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,870
They always tell you it's a wave or something.

2585
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:37,110
Once you comprehend that is what pretty much everything that we consider alive is being affected by in this expression geometrically, you know, your body is a geometric expression, you know.

2586
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:46,530
That's how other, if it wasn't, then cells would not be able to be identified, because cells are identified visually through their geometry, by the way.

2587
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:51,330
You know, so, right?

2588
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,810
And chemically, of course.

2589
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:56,010
But that's all.

2590
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:01,610
Outside of that, they stop and say, well, what keeps procuring this rigid geometric pattern?

2591
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,230
They can't deal with that.

2592
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,230
Wilhelm Reich spoke about that.

2593
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:08,490
It's the emotional armoring.

2594
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:16,250
You know, just like a knight in shining armor, he feels real confident, but once you get under the armor, he gets really perturbed.

2595
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:26,900
I try to stay away too much discussion on the ether and the life force, because guess what?

2596
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:34,240
I spend every day, a little bit of every day, researching it on my own, through direct experimentation.

2597
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:40,080
When I mean direct experimentation, I mean not thought experiments, you know what I mean?

2598
01:28:43,360 --> 01:29:03,060
It's quite a thing to heat a rock to incandescent and put in some potassium chloride distilled, you know, reagent grade, sterile, and sucrose or even sucralose that's been heated to sterilization, close it off under some UV light, and three days later see critters coming out of the rock.

2599
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,040
You know, little moving things.

2600
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:24,400
It's quite a thing to see that, and you know, part of you tells you that's not really happening, but for sure, there must be some contamination here that allowed this, you know, some spore, or not a spore, but we're not talking about spores like fungi, we're talking about things with legs and antennae moving around too, you know?

2601
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:34,220
So the part of you that you're, the culture that you're in, says this should not be happening, but all of your sensory perception is telling you that it is.

2602
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,640
Um, we're live on three right now.

2603
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:43,520
Oh, um, I started looking to identify them, and there is no identification for them.

2604
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,760
They look very similar to, like, a translucent crawfish.

2605
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:48,560
What's that?

2606
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,360
Without the claw.

2607
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:50,620
Go ahead.

2608
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:59,060
In other words, that species, that type of cross-section, you know, the thorax, and the tail, and the leg length, that's how things are done by proportion.

2609
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,580
Um, you know, we've got another guy going right now.

2610
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,520
We've got another one.

2611
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,320
The trunk is, it's purporting, you know, to express its body and all that.

2612
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,440
I'll see if I can get you broader in on this, too.

2613
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:13,740
Yeah, there was an interesting guy named, uh, Peter Cross, I think, back in the 1700s.

2614
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:25,980
He took rusted pieces of iron, and he wanted to dissolve the rust in, uh, sulfuric acid, and he put a lid on it, and about, he forgot about it, and two months later, he opens the lid, and a lot of microscopes...

2615
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,020
Oh.

2616
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,800
Let's see if we get you in.

2617
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:32,880
Am I still there?

2618
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,240
Yeah, go ahead.

2619
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:41,720
Oh, and a creature crawled out of the sulfuric acid mixture, which shouldn't be happening.

2620
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:45,160
Yeah, we got another fella calling in here also.

2621
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:46,620
Okay.

2622
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,680
See, we'll bring him in.

2623
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,080
Okay, go ahead.

2624
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,360
No, but do you see how these...

2625
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,100
Greetings.

2626
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,100
Oh, we have a telephone caller, you mean.

2627
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,000
Another Skype line.

2628
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,420
Oh, Skype, another Skype line.

2629
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,100
Okay, great.

2630
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,800
So we got, we got three of us on here now.

2631
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,180
Okay.

2632
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,800
Four, Peter.

2633
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,170
Yeah, four.

2634
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,310
It's amazing what happens when some of us can count.

2635
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:18,890
Yeah, yeah, anyway.

2636
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,090
Uh, you had a question?

2637
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:24,790
Go ahead, introduce yourself, let us know what...

2638
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:28,910
Uh, we were...

2639
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,930
We could be talking about you.

2640
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,520
Go ahead, produce that.

2641
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:37,060
What would you like?

2642
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,080
Have you, have you heard of what we're discussing?

2643
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,120
You want to add anything?

2644
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,240
Okay.

2645
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,160
So, so anyway, Jason.

2646
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,700
Yes, we got a, we got a beautiful copy.

2647
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,840
Can you hear us real good?

2648
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:58,270
Right.

2649
01:31:58,690 --> 01:31:59,010
Right.

2650
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:01,210
Yeah.

2651
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:02,030
Yes.

2652
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:10,840
You're welcome.

2653
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,440
Okay.

2654
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:25,300
When you get older, you might feel like they're dropping, but anyway.

2655
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:38,230
By the way, uh, I don't think, I don't think you can hear us.

2656
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:38,570
Yeah.

2657
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,140
Sure.

2658
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,100
Well, uh, can you, you probably can't hear me, can you?

2659
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,320
Can you, can you hear Greek?

2660
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:03,740
Oh, you can, yeah.

2661
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,660
All right, so you could speak, uh, uh, well, does he hear, if Jason speaks, does he hear Jason?

2662
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,680
Can you hear me?

2663
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:12,620
You hear me?

2664
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,480
Can you hear me?

2665
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:16,740
Yeah.

2666
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:20,420
No, I would tend to think, let's see if we got it.

2667
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,720
Apparently they call him on the, on the stream.

2668
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:35,740
Yeah, the gods are doing, remember I said they're parallel, so we have a parallel conversation, Jason, uh, the Greek and Bruce, and, and then we have Bruce and the caller.

2669
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,260
Yeah, Bruce here, I guess.

2670
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:42,520
And the guests, so Bruce and, oh, down here, yeah, so that's a parallel condition.

2671
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,640
So, Bruce, it's up to you to juggle three on one side and one on the other.

2672
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:47,380
Correct.

2673
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:50,220
There we go.

2674
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,000
You got your hand.

2675
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:51,780
Okay, there we go.

2676
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:56,390
The gods.

2677
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:16,270
We're talking, okay, yeah, yeah, the gods and the body, yeah, the extension, the gods, everything being an extension of the gods, um, and essentially I basically said, you know, like the pot is the extension of another metaphor, be the, the pot is the extension of the potter, but you can smash the pot to bits and the potter won't mind, or won't, you know, he can, you see.

2678
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:18,850
Well, he might mind a little bit, if he's a good potter.

2679
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:24,570
Yeah, if it's his prized pot, he's going to mind, and that's actually a better analogy for what's going on.

2680
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:39,040
So, oh, gravity?

2681
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:40,940
No, it's not.

2682
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,820
Gravity, gravity is just an incoherent field, and this is the secret.

2683
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:51,200
If you understand how to make it coherent, then you can, then you can go whichever way you want.

2684
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:03,640
It's an incoherent field that gives the impression of pull, but it's actually push, and it's not really a pressure as much as it's, it's by voidance.

2685
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:12,320
You know, when, when there's a voidance between two things that come together, you get the impression that they're being pulled together, but they're not.

2686
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,580
It's because of the voidance.

2687
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:25,020
It's like when you're stuck in, when you're stuck in the soda pop through a straw, the liquid comes up because of the voidance in the straw, not because you're really sucking, right?

2688
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:31,830
Through voidance.

2689
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:37,050
Yeah, it's a void that when you bring them together, they're not really attracting, and you could prove that.

2690
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:43,810
I think in chat, I gave an example of how you can take two magnets that are what they call

2691
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:49,350
the same pole that repulse each other, but if one magnet's really small and the other one's really

2692
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:54,650
large, you can, even though they're the same poles, they repulse, but once you center them perfectly,

2693
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:58,170
you'll push the small one into the large one, and it will actually stick,

2694
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:02,310
because in the center of every magnet is its opposite pole.

2695
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:15,710
So, this is perfectly illustrated in the yin and yang symbol, but it's not perfect because it shows, the squiggle shows a little bit of white in the black, and a little bit of black on the white on the other side.

2696
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,290
Those need to be folded over on each other.

2697
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:28,630
And didn't you say one time that if you did that and got the magnets to stick, and then went like 10, 15 feet away, and pointed another magnet at it, it would just fall apart?

2698
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:29,350
It jumps off.

2699
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:30,110
Yeah.

2700
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:36,450
Right, which means that the field is not just what they show you with the iron columns.

2701
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:38,550
It affects everything.

2702
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:39,290
Yeah.

2703
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,830
No.

2704
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:45,670
No.

2705
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,410
I'm going to disconnect here.

2706
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:52,190
I hope I don't lose you guys here for a moment.

2707
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:53,710
Just give me three seconds.

2708
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,290
Hopefully, this will work.

2709
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:55,970
Okay.

2710
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:11,690
What is most conducive to human health is a mixture of what we call air, with the corresponding elements, which happen to be mostly nitrogen, 78% or more nitrogen.

2711
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:28,570
When the nitrogen goes into the lungs, the lungs convert through low L-E-N-C, I call it, or it's been called low energy nuclear conversion, the nitrogen into oxygen and other things, water also, on the inside of the body.

2712
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:34,390
And if you look at the periodic table of elements, when nitrogen goes to oxygen, guess what it passes?

2713
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:35,530
Carbon, doesn't it?

2714
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:36,550
On its way.

2715
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:44,710
That's why you get the illusion that you're taking in oxygen and giving off carbon dioxide.

2716
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:46,250
You're not.

2717
01:37:46,390 --> 01:38:00,910
When the nitrogen turns into oxygen inside of the body, one of the residual effects, because it's going through the cycle from nitrogen to oxygen, passing through carbon and other elements, those are also created and bonded and given, and the scientist is fooled.

2718
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:08,330
He has to give an explanation that is based on his lack of being able to see what's really going on.

2719
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:10,450
They're not allowed to say what's going on, by the way.

2720
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:36,310
Now, the other aspect of that is if you're doing a L-E-N-C conversion of carbon into iron, I do this all the time at a rate of 15% per cycle, meaning you can give me a 99.999 or 100% chunk of carbon, and within a few seconds, I'll turn 15% of that by volume into pure iron.

2721
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:37,590
Right?

2722
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:38,630
In the kitchen.

2723
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:43,010
Now, in this iron, you can have it measured, it's pure iron.

2724
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,290
No one's like, well, how did you get such pure iron?

2725
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:51,690
But the thing is, it won't rust when you put it in water at all, because when carbon goes to iron, and guess what?

2726
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,450
It passes through nickel, doesn't it?

2727
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:59,170
So you get all the attributes of nickel in the iron, even though it measures as pure iron.

2728
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,250
Now, the ancients knew of this.

2729
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,730
Anyone can look this up, that's within earshot.

2730
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:10,070
You go online and research in India, in India somewhere, there is an iron pillar.

2731
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:14,410
About eight feet or six feet is sticking out of the ground, most of it's underground.

2732
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:19,790
And people touch it, it gets rained on, it's been there for hundreds of years, and it never rusts.

2733
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:23,550
And they've done chemical analysis on it, and it's pure iron.

2734
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:29,470
It's not stainless steel, it's not an alloy, and there's no oxidation happening on it whatsoever.

2735
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:32,190
And I have to chuckle, like, how does that happen?

2736
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:42,250
Well, that iron that they're showing you was, they understood transmutation, they took carbon and converted it to iron at a rate of, like I just mentioned, and they used that iron, that's why it doesn't rust.

2737
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:44,870
Well, iron created this way will not rust.

2738
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:51,470
I had, there was a Native American tribe here that wanted to, got a big grant, they wanted to do some technology.

2739
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:52,930
I said, do you guys have any garbage?

2740
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:58,890
And they looked at me and laughed, they said, we got more garbage per capita than most other societies do, you know.

2741
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:05,790
I said, let's go to the landfill and start burning the garbage and capturing all of the heat to turn turbines to make electricity.

2742
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:13,550
And the carbon that's left over, we convert to this pure iron, you see, and also power your homes, you see.

2743
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:21,770
And you have no, in other words, now you're burning garbage, but you have no heat waste, no toxic waste, and you're producing iron from the waste, from the carbon.

2744
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:26,030
And you see, it's a purely closed system, you know.

2745
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,250
We're going to run this by the university first.

2746
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,470
Oh, yeah, sure.

2747
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:35,230
An iron cap, what do you mean by, what do you mean by an iron cap?

2748
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:39,330
No, no.

2749
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:47,150
Yeah, you could, but what I'm discussing is just basically what's going on in the natural material world, how one thing becomes another.

2750
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:51,390
In other words, it's called transmutation or low energy nuclear conversion.

2751
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:55,830
This is a field that is completely open, that no one is researching.

2752
01:40:56,750 --> 01:41:00,450
Silver, for example, this is a, cars are something different.

2753
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:10,130
Cars work, the reciprocating engine is only popular because of its pound to horsepower ratio and price ratio.

2754
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:17,870
In other words, a reciprocating motor, for the cost that it takes now to make one, will give you pound for pound, cost for cost, the cheapest way to make power.

2755
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:26,490
But we know pound for pound, an electric motor gives more energy pound for pound than a reciprocating car engine.

2756
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,590
But the problem with electrics is your power source.

2757
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,530
The battery technology will not advance.

2758
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:34,890
And then, of course, I've brought forward that electricity is not what we're told.

2759
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:43,070
If anyone investigates the energy machine of Joseph Newman, the free energy thing is already, that book is closed 40 years ago.

2760
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:47,110
You know, free energy, it's not free.

2761
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,190
You just have to understand how the field works.

2762
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:50,830
Electricity really works.

2763
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:56,050
But no, what I'm discussing here, we went off because you mentioned the body and gravity and all that.

2764
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:05,050
Once we get over the fact that things are, you know, everything seems to be ephemeral, not empirical.

2765
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:09,650
When they show you an element of gold, well, it just so happens to be gold.

2766
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:11,190
Now it can change into something else.

2767
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:14,690
I don't know why you'd want to change gold into lead, let's say.

2768
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:15,870
You want to do the reverse.

2769
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:18,310
By the way, lead doesn't go to gold.

2770
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:20,810
Copper or silver goes to gold.

2771
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,290
So that's another misnomer.

2772
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:28,930
The only reason they say lead goes to gold is when they bombard it in nuclear, high nuclear situations.

2773
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:31,670
They get a little bit of gold out of lead.

2774
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,530
So we're just talking about the human body.

2775
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:40,310
By the way, I'd like to read an email if you guys are still there.

2776
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:41,790
I'm going to move again.

2777
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:44,590
Hopefully, I just traveled quite a bit.

2778
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:46,930
We'll be right back in the office here.

2779
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,670
I'm going to read an email regarding the human body.

2780
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:55,670
And I'm going to comment on it because even though the outcome was good, this is not exactly how I would have done it.

2781
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:58,170
Meaning with the with the limb.

2782
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:28,070
I had a thumb injury unloading my pickup, jammed my thumb on a piece of metal just underneath the nail.

2783
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:30,090
Hurt like H-E-L-L.

2784
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:33,690
So immediately wrapped it with napkin and duct tape.

2785
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:37,110
Later applied more duct tape and bandage over the previously wrapped.

2786
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:39,570
Never removed it for one or two days.

2787
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:40,910
First night hurt like hell.

2788
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,350
That morning pain subsided.

2789
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:44,450
That evening no pain at all.

2790
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:48,170
Following day, removed all tape, bandage, washed soap and water.

2791
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:50,010
Looked almost as if nothing happened.

2792
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,510
Normally would have lost the entire nail.

2793
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:53,310
Not this time.

2794
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,450
Four or five days later, can't even tell it happened.

2795
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:58,950
Okay, that's a success story.

2796
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:09,750
But what I would suggest is that you, within the first 15 minutes or an hour, you do want to unwrap it in case it's too tight to let circulation take place.

2797
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:17,870
Obviously, this person did not have it so tight where, let's say, the finger would be in danger of losing circulation.

2798
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:20,790
I'm presuming because it is a happy ending.

2799
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:25,390
But usually, the tighter it is for the first 10 or 15 minutes, the more effective.

2800
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:31,690
But in this case, this email that I just read, it was a one or two day healing.

2801
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:37,370
You know, versus something that would take days or weeks, you see.

2802
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:43,410
But I suggest that the only thing I have here is that it was not removed for one or two days.

2803
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:50,030
I would suggest after the first 15 minutes or an hour to remove it or open it and make sure everything looks okay.

2804
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:53,210
It hasn't discolored or gotten numb, you see.

2805
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:58,250
So that was the only thing that I wanted to comment on that.

2806
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:16,940
Yes, well, I wanted to call in and report back also on this whole, how do I say this, the ex-Christians.

2807
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:20,300
The Christians, they're moving into the yoga field.

2808
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:25,940
Like you said, all the yogis are ex-washouts, Christian washouts.

2809
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,560
Well, that's totally true.

2810
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:31,600
I've been experiencing that first-handedly.

2811
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,940
So they try to convert the Sanskrit into the King James Version.

2812
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:46,260
And they even write it out as in the Sanskrit, and then they put the colon, and then they put the number.

2813
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:52,280
And I think you said that was some type form of spellcasting, and I've been seeing it everywhere.

2814
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:55,980
And so when they try to preach, it could be.

2815
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,180
But also keep in mind, there is a Romanized Sanskrit as well.

2816
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,000
In other words, Roman letters that we can all read.

2817
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,580
I didn't quite get the gist of it.

2818
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:15,540
So what they're doing is translating the King James, or they're just basically making signage with old Sanskrit.

2819
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:16,940
Print, print.

2820
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:30,860
They're making signage with their own old Sanskrit, and then they're bringing the passages that they chose, they choose from the King James, and putting it into, they're like measuring it up and incorporating it into one.

2821
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,920
And they're teaching it like this.

2822
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:40,740
And I was in a class with this woman, and she had her master's degree.

2823
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:45,580
And I was in a room, and I was the only male in the room.

2824
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,640
It was all females.

2825
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:51,300
And it had this Sunday school type vibe to it.

2826
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,920
And I started asking questions, you know.

2827
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,880
And I was asking a lot of questions.

2828
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,420
And it wasn't the presenter who was looking at me bad.

2829
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,800
Everybody else in the room started to look at me.

2830
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:13,560
And it went from a positive vibe, and almost instantaneously, everyone looked at me with hatred, because they thought I was offending the speaker.

2831
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:21,440
When I was just asking questions, and the speaker wasn't offended, but since yoga, it was practicing yoga, is very subjective.

2832
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:26,660
And subjective is feelings, and objectivity, you don't really have feelings.

2833
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:30,140
And so I got, my feelings were like, well, I'm feeling all these emotions.

2834
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,560
And I just had to leave the room.

2835
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:36,500
But it was very, an interesting experience with all these people.

2836
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:39,640
I just wanted to share that.

2837
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:41,000
Well, thank you.

2838
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:42,560
Yeah, there's a spirit behind that.

2839
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:53,740
And right now, and has been for a while, and will be, these lower level spirits that are involved in all the world's religions are really having a hard time.

2840
01:47:54,520 --> 01:48:02,920
There's even a book that says something like, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, for, you know, the adversary has come down with great wrath.

2841
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:09,620
And, you know, so that means these lower minions also are having a hard time with what's coming.

2842
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:21,560
And by the way, I've said this before, I'll say it again, these lower level entities or spirits are just as ignorant as humans in many cases, even though they are in the realm of the gods.

2843
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:30,290
Yes, and then capturing these lower level entities, would it be just a form of getting carbon and making it into carbon?

2844
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,950
So you capture the carbon, or no?

2845
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:33,590
No, I wouldn't.

2846
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:34,610
It's not chemical.

2847
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,050
They're smarter than that.

2848
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,910
Yeah, I'm sure there are some of them that are susceptible.

2849
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:45,890
Are you familiar with what's called an old Assyrian or Sumerian demon catcher?

2850
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:55,790
What you did back then in their homes, what they would do is they had a terracotta bowl and there'd be writing on the inside of the bowl.

2851
01:48:56,350 --> 01:49:01,530
And the writing would go around and around the bowl, starting from the upper outer edge to the center in a spiral.

2852
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:03,790
And it sometimes had a symbol in it.

2853
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:07,010
And what you did is you put water in the bowl.

2854
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:11,490
So if a demon came through the house, it would go to the bowl and be captivated by the writing.

2855
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:20,030
You know, there's a whatever story they wanted to tell the demon, they would spiral into the bowl, into the water, and it would be held there so you could sleep peacefully, right?

2856
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:24,950
So, you know, some of these people are dumb and primitive, but I'm telling you, they're not.

2857
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:28,710
You know, have you ever heard of it?

2858
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:35,370
Anybody want to look up a Sumerian or Assyrian demon trap bowl?

2859
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:38,610
I don't even know if there's something like that online.

2860
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:41,150
As a matter of fact, I'll go to the office right now and look it up.

2861
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:46,090
But yeah, so when you brought up carbon, I'm not, you know, putting them in carbon.

2862
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:47,850
I'm not totally discounting them.

2863
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:51,590
Remember, it has to be discounting that chemical side or aspect of it.

2864
01:49:51,610 --> 01:50:00,410
But I'm telling you that there's a voluntary nature in the world, and you could also call forms of entrapment.

2865
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:09,870
You know, marketing people, advertising people, politicians, religious leaders, they all use these techniques, because they're also used in the spiritual world, you know?

2866
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:24,090
I mean, I've read somewhere that King David, as a young man, was playing an instrument to pretty much take up the time of a spirit that was sent to torment King Saul, for example, you know?

2867
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:32,030
What, if the spirit is sleeping on the job, he's sent to torment someone, but he won't when the music is playing?

2868
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:33,950
I mean, what's wrong with the guy, you know?

2869
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:37,010
That's the OCD.

2870
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:41,470
They're called incantation bowls, apparently.

2871
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:42,490
Are they?

2872
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:42,790
Okay.

2873
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:46,750
Majority were written in Jewish Aramaic.

2874
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:51,430
Right, Aramaic, which would be the language of the Assyrians also.

2875
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,510
Incantation bowl, okay.

2876
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:57,730
Yeah, there they are.

2877
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:58,830
I just went to images.

2878
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:00,310
There's quite a few of them.

2879
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,620
So I'm going to have to look that one up.

2880
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:10,120
Did you capture a mind parasite in that way, too?

2881
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,500
Yeah, sure.

2882
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,440
Well, they hang on to you, you know?

2883
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:22,060
What do you call those little, they show it in cartoons often, where, you know, someone has to make a decision.

2884
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,520
They have a devil on one side of their shoulder and an angel on the other.

2885
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,880
You see it personified in cartoons.

2886
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,840
Yeah, it doesn't mean that they're going to go away once you've made the decision.

2887
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:40,040
I mean, we've read somewhere that I think one human being was able to house 5,000 of these guys.

2888
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:56,680
This also regards the people that are most susceptible from the oppressive side and the victimization side and being oppressed and possession, which is very rare, are the ones that are ignorant of everything.

2889
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:02,720
See, if you know exactly what's going on, they leave you alone and go usually and go for the next one that doesn't know.

2890
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,980
It's kind of like the tax authorities are like that.

2891
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:14,800
Usually when you hear people have problems with tax authorities, it's because they don't know any of the laws and they're dealing with the authorities that don't know any of the laws anyway.

2892
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,720
And there's only one law for taxation.

2893
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,600
It's very simple.

2894
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,540
It's lawful money or private credit.

2895
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,780
If you're always endorsing private credit, you're going to pay or you're going to jail.

2896
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,160
So anyway, it's very simple.

2897
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,460
It's the same thing with the gods.

2898
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,080
Who do you have your allegiances to?

2899
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:39,220
If you say Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy, you're in trouble, potentially.

2900
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:49,560
I'm not saying that your life won't be difficult if you have allegiances to the Most High, but at least you've cleared up anything and everything you can do, you see, in that respect.

2901
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,860
Because Paul the king had allegiances to the Most High.

2902
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,720
He just didn't behave, you know, he was tormented.

2903
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,380
Yeah, that's helped about.

2904
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:05,000
I just wanted to add in to another report.

2905
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:06,400
Just applying.

2906
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,180
I don't think this is called Greek speak.

2907
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:11,660
I mean, this is just a separate chat, right?

2908
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,420
Or no, are you labeling it Greek speak?

2909
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:16,720
Yeah, it could be.

2910
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,540
But this is the sonic event.

2911
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:27,420
I think we're eventually going to just call it just speak because I'd like to see just this kind of speak in the world to counter the bullshit.

2912
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,540
But go ahead.

2913
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,080
So applying that, I just recommend everyone listening.

2914
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:49,200
Get a spray bottle of alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, water, mix it in, and just start with your little square corner wherever you are and start from there and just work your way up and just keep building.

2915
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,560
And get an etymology dictionary.

2916
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,880
I found three old ones real fast.

2917
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:59,400
And I found two random house college dictionaries.

2918
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:05,700
One was printed in the 1969 and the other one was printed in 1993.

2919
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:11,920
And when I was printed in 1993, Webster bought them out in the 80s.

2920
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:17,020
And you can see the parallels that are different between those two dictionaries.

2921
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:30,660
Like in the 1969 dictionary, the word kid, the third informal definition is a younger child or alike.

2922
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:34,700
So the first two is a baby goat or a lambskin.

2923
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:42,040
And then in the Webster dictionary in 1990s, they switched it.

2924
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:45,780
So the informal is first and then the kids are going back down.

2925
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,660
I thought that was interesting to share.

2926
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:51,200
There's a bunch of different similarities in these dictionaries.

2927
01:54:51,980 --> 01:55:00,880
And I wonder if you've mentioned something about the after the World Trade Center event about all the dictionaries being.

2928
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:01,600
Yes.

2929
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:02,940
Ground zero.

2930
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:14,820
Yeah, before 9-11, ground zero, 99% of the time was a very technical term referring to zero time and zero box.

2931
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,900
Zero time is when the device is detonated.

2932
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:22,280
Zero box is the device and ground zero is the location of where the device is detonated.

2933
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:33,820
And by the way, when the term ground zero was used on 9-11, it was done by the technical people going to inspect the site from the NNSA, which is the National Nuclear Security Agency.

2934
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:39,740
And you don't send out the National Nuclear Security Agency to investigate jet fuel incidents.

2935
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:40,300
You know what I mean?

2936
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:41,300
Right.

2937
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:48,660
But yeah, what happened after that, there was an obfuscation, a public obfuscation of dictionaries.

2938
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:59,180
And eBay within a year, by 2002, 2003, any time an eBay, a dictionary was put up on eBay at any price, it was purchased immediately.

2939
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:07,040
And part of the joke was, let's just put up, let's go to the Salvation Army, get a dictionary for a dollar and put it up for $75 on eBay.

2940
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,480
It got sold in eight hours.

2941
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,520
Someone bought it for $75 just to start pulling dictionaries off the market.

2942
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:18,720
And when they started putting them back on the market, they started changing the definition of the term ground zero.

2943
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,920
Oh, very interesting.

2944
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,300
So is that still happening then?

2945
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:27,620
Like, can I still sell dictionaries for $75 on eBay?

2946
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:28,480
Try.

2947
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:29,480
Yeah, I would try.

2948
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:31,940
There's something called apathy.

2949
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:37,580
And what is it when the general public is really interested in something and then they're not?

2950
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:40,600
There's a term, a psychological term for that.

2951
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:44,440
But yeah, I would try it for sure.

2952
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,340
If you're so inclined.

2953
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:53,140
I don't do private credit, electronic banking or all that stuff, so I'm out of that loop.

2954
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:57,480
Well, I was curious, I mean, about testing your theory for one, but also working...

2955
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,060
Oh, it's not a theory.

2956
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,700
This was going on pretty actively.

2957
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:09,300
The FBI, by the way, in America, does have what's called a book confiscation list.

2958
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,440
A book seizure, yeah.

2959
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:13,360
Book seizure program, yeah.

2960
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:18,720
Yeah, I found that very interesting.

2961
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:27,960
And then, yeah, if you just go to yard sales and if you want an etymology dictionary, I'm just finding that more helpful than reading the King James version.

2962
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,480
I don't plan on reading it.

2963
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,460
I don't want to read it.

2964
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,300
But yeah, so...

2965
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,500
Yeah, that's OK.

2966
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:41,300
Well, you know, the less stupid you become, the more stupid the people around you appear to be.

2967
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,300
You're familiar with that concept, right?

2968
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:50,180
Yes, and it takes a lot of energy just to deal with people, you know?

2969
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:54,240
So I'm losing a lot of energy.

2970
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:59,240
Pretty soon, you're going to have to cut some ties with people pretty soon.

2971
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:02,900
Oh, you could be more efficient.

2972
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:10,280
You don't have to cut ties or lose a lot of energy.

2973
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,260
That's just to get more efficient at it.

2974
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,380
Yeah, you become more objective.

2975
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:20,980
And it's still kum-tsi kum-tsa to everybody else that drank the Kool-Aid.

2976
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:22,660
Oh, yeah.

2977
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:24,500
Doesn't mean I got to be a jerk.

2978
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,780
No, no, you don't have to be a jerk.

2979
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:33,180
Sometimes it's just all the, you know, the people.

2980
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:34,580
People will get to you.

2981
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:36,240
But you try not to.

2982
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:42,260
But ultimately, if you start thinking, what can I do to help this individual?

2983
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:47,020
Anything, you know, not, you know, without being imposing in that.

2984
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,620
Just keep thinking that thought.

2985
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,580
And all of a sudden, things, they pick up on that feeling.

2986
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:55,280
And they get, the event becomes more streamlined.

2987
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,080
To be of service.

2988
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,760
Right, right.

2989
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:02,360
To serve and being served, they're both of the same cloth.

2990
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,060
Yeah, stewardship.

2991
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:06,720
Got big fish to fry.

2992
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,180
Big fish to fry.

2993
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:17,040
Well, Rama, I'm just calling in just to say, hello, I'm driving right now on mobile.

2994
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,440
Feel like I'm out in the field.

2995
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:24,100
If each bit of information is, helps me out a long way.

2996
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,460
And I thank you guys for keeping on there.

2997
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:30,400
I know Sam sounds like he's getting a little agitated and frustrated.

2998
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:32,560
But for me, it's just working out.

2999
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,340
I'll try to call in more.

3000
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:46,340
And I guess on the final note, I'm going to say is, for anyone who's listening, is when your parents tell you that they sacrificed everything for you, they have it twisted.

3001
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:50,560
They sacrificed you so they can have everything.

3002
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:55,120
And maybe that's just a little harsh on the parents, but it's okay.

3003
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:56,760
That's the kid culture.

3004
01:59:56,900 --> 02:00:00,140
So maybe next week I'll call in and we can talk kid culture.

3005
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:02,360
Sounds good.

3006
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,740
I appreciate you calling in.

3007
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:04,840
We appreciate the interest.

3008
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:06,560
Okay.

3009
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,600
All right, boys.

3010
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:08,480
Have a good night.

3011
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:11,300
All right.

3012
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:11,720
Bye bye.

3013
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:12,540
Bye bye.

3014
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:17,480
So there we go.

3015
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:21,440
I think I know who that is, by the way, from chat.

3016
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:27,540
I think someone a week ago put in some screenshots or shots of an etymology dictionary.

3017
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,520
So yes, yes, that's right.

3018
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:34,790
So where were we?

3019
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:37,150
Or we were nowhere as usual.

3020
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:40,910
Gods and body.

3021
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:44,250
Yeah, I think we have Jason here.

3022
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:45,730
Yes, yes.

3023
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,630
I'm still there.

3024
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:47,330
You were on a thought.

3025
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:48,190
You were on a thought.

3026
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:48,610
Do you want to?

3027
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:53,050
We were just talking about the gods, everything being an extension of the gods.

3028
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:53,770
Yes and no.

3029
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:57,350
I think more specifics, you know.

3030
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:10,810
You know, for example, if you hang around with car engineers or car designers, one of the, if you just had a few minutes with them about their philosophy, they always say the car should be an extension of your body, right?

3031
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:15,290
Or a good hand tool should be as an extension of your body.

3032
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:20,790
So there is validity in using those terms in that regard.

3033
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:28,990
When a demon, you know, for example, they have something called the history channel on cable, which I once saw an episode.

3034
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:30,590
They said God versus Satan.

3035
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:33,950
Never going to happen.

3036
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:38,730
You know, I mean, where are they getting?

3037
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:39,990
Where are they getting the audience?

3038
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:44,890
You know, if you, you know, what audience are they catering that nonsense to?

3039
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:54,150
So then the gods, I mean, if they regard our bodies as their instruments, it seems that they would care for them more than we do.

3040
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:57,800
Let's say that again.

3041
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:07,580
So if the gods see our bodies as their instruments, then it seems as though they would care for our bodies more than we do.

3042
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:13,780
They do tell you they only care about certain people to keep the plan going.

3043
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:17,590
You see what I mean?

3044
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:29,430
In other words, they have, you know, what's interesting when you study, for example, Abraham, a lot of promises and a lot of claims about things are to be done or made.

3045
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:32,070
And do you know what Abraham had to do on his end?

3046
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:32,770
Nothing.

3047
02:02:33,570 --> 02:02:39,610
You know, we're talking about after, you know, the revelation of he didn't have to sacrifice his son, right?

3048
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:40,710
Mm hmm.

3049
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:46,130
All these things were good that the gods, the Elohim said he was going to do for Abraham.

3050
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:48,150
Did he say, as long as Abraham, you do this?

3051
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:50,610
No, it was all on their side.

3052
02:02:50,690 --> 02:03:02,230
And then as it goes, as it continued, when we go to Moses, he presents basically a constitution of set of laws for a group of people or a nation to act as.

3053
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:04,550
And he asked him, do you agree to this?

3054
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:05,390
Basically, right?

3055
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:08,310
You see, it was voluntary that then they agreed as well.

3056
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:12,070
If you agree and you don't do it, then this will happen to you.

3057
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:21,370
So when I say they don't care and all that, it's, again, based on agreements.

3058
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:27,970
You know, how many times have you heard of these pagan cultures that prospered?

3059
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:30,670
Have you ever heard of the Mayans and the Aztecs?

3060
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:33,490
Well, actually, the Aztecs, actually, they both prospered.

3061
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:37,750
I mean, they murdered thousands of people towards the middle and end of their kingdom.

3062
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:50,350
They were doing, you know, if I told you they found, they estimate over four to five million headless bodies in Mexico and northern part of South America that still haven't been uncovered, would you believe me?

3063
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:56,450
This is the level of carnage that they were doing on a social level, as a normal social gratuity.

3064
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:00,060
And they prospered.

3065
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:06,360
So where were the gods helping the people that were being sacrificed, you know?

3066
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:11,460
Well, that doesn't mean they don't care, though, does it?

3067
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,040
Because...

3068
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,760
No, they do care about their plan.

3069
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:18,140
And they do, you know, they do, you know, like the human body can last a thousand years.

3070
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:25,560
The onset of aging and disease is, you know, something that is like switched on almost at a certain time.

3071
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:26,940
Yeah.

3072
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:36,240
There's no reason why the body can't keep reproducing and be, have the vigor and health between 20 and 40 years old for another, you know, thousand years or so.

3073
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:37,460
There's no reason for it.

3074
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:42,560
You know, so it's been switched off to limit...

3075
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,480
Yeah, there's no simple answer.

3076
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:59,960
But what I'd like to state is, you know, let's start examining what's going on, what has gone on, and what's been memorialized about these things.

3077
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:03,640
And can we approach them rationally?

3078
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:06,180
Can we meditate on these things from a rational perspective?

3079
02:05:08,330 --> 02:05:09,230
You know what I mean by meditate?

3080
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:12,750
Just keep thinking, you know, like over and over and over.

3081
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:37,480
And I would suggest, from a personal note, what I've come down to, once you are cognizant that anything and everything you consider law and morality comes from a god, and you have to, you know, go into it consciously or, quote-unquote, unconsciously, where you don't care, just do what everyone else does, but consciously you have to pick a god.

3082
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:41,360
And when they tell you, well, the law is based on justice, what do you know about justice?

3083
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:41,780
Nothing.

3084
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:44,500
Well, that's a problem, you see.

3085
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:48,500
So, once you start figuring out which god, and you are going to get...

3086
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:56,820
you're going to at least personify whether you have an allegiance to or decide cognizantly and consciously to be aware of that.

3087
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,540
Other than that, it's food, clothing, and shelter.

3088
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:03,700
And discovering how to optimize, you know, who you are.

3089
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:07,960
And you can't optimize yourself without optimizing people around you.

3090
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,580
You can't, by the way.

3091
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,700
You know, this is a fact in even musicians.

3092
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:20,520
Musicians, they have this concept called jamming, right?

3093
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:23,740
They want to go play with other good musicians.

3094
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:26,080
They don't want to just go, you know, make...

3095
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:30,180
Oh, I need to make a living, so I'm going to do piano lessons with nine and ten-year-olds.

3096
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:33,520
You know, eventually that's all you're going to be able to do.

3097
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,380
You need to jam with people that are as good or better than you are.

3098
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:41,900
So, you know, how is that going to happen if they're not in a better state, you see?

3099
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:46,650
You see, it's...

3100
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:52,380
This is also on a community level, you know.

3101
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,380
All the communities are...

3102
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:57,070
make a better community by, you know, the...

3103
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:01,360
Oops, he dropped.

3104
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,040
Yep, I think he dropped.

3105
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:06,040
Oh, did I still drop?

3106
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:07,000
Yep, there you are.

3107
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:08,100
Okay.

3108
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,240
I just walked over by...

3109
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:12,960
Maybe a lot of metal over here reflected on wireless.

3110
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:17,700
Even on a community level, the way you do it is by having, you know, if there's...

3111
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:27,740
Whatever number of people are in the community, if each one takes responsibility for what they can, then the whole community goes through an improvement.

3112
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:37,820
Yeah, that's a tricky thing to gauge, like how involved to be in a community, like we talked about this last time.

3113
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,880
Hypothetical, hypothetical.

3114
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:41,000
This community is fucked.

3115
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,220
Yeah, with a larger culture.

3116
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:57,780
So, you take a position of living apart and separating yourself from others as much as possible, but you also talk about helping others and, you know, optimizing your relationships with others.

3117
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:02,020
So, it could appear to be contradictory, but they're not necessarily right.

3118
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:06,400
Find that golden mean or what have you, that balance.

3119
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:14,820
And, yeah, I'm faced with a problem of that kind right now, actually, in my community, which is about 5,000 people.

3120
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:23,800
And there's just something going on locally around that, you know, the whole transgender madness.

3121
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:28,360
And there's a particular movement that's trying to...

3122
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:33,320
You probably won't know about it because it's Canadian, but you'll know about the general principles of it.

3123
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:41,320
It's trying to implement ideological agendas in the schools, even the kindergartens, to educate children, you know, into the...

3124
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:42,580
It's a saving the states.

3125
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:44,320
Yeah, fluidity.

3126
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:49,880
Except it's worse in Canada, because Canada's just a care ahead of the curve, so to speak.

3127
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:56,040
Yeah, that was planned more than 50 years ago, by the way, with great munition and detail, how they were going to do it.

3128
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:56,500
So, go ahead.

3129
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:57,600
Yeah, I believe it.

3130
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:01,340
So, and that's something I've researched and written about.

3131
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:06,040
And as far as using the internet as a platform to work through those ideas and talk about people, that's fine.

3132
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:11,800
You know, I don't consider activism, but I just consider exploration as a human predicament.

3133
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:17,120
But now it's actually come to the town that I live in, and I'm becoming aware that people are...

3134
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:20,140
Well, you know, they're struggling with this.

3135
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:23,940
And anyone who questions it is being called a homophobe and a fascist and all that.

3136
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:27,580
It starts getting, you know, personal.

3137
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:34,620
And then I have to make a decision, it feels like I have to make a decision about how involved to get, particularly as I have a newsletter.

3138
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,660
All right, let me stop you for a moment and tell you how I deal with that.

3139
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:45,940
If I'm surrounded by those that are for it, let's just say, you know, there's the apathetic, let's say there's the for and the against, OK?

3140
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:59,120
I let them know very politely, and the way that they can hear it, I have to structure, I have to analyze how I'm going to say this, but this is what I generally say, is that the people that are public about this now, they're being...

3141
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:05,520
information is being gathered about them, and identities are being taken, and you're being put on a database.

3142
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:13,180
OK, now, for the people that are against it and find it to be abominable, I say to them the same thing.

3143
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:17,980
I say the people that are doing this, their identities are being taken, and they're being put in a database.

3144
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,380
I say the same thing to both sides.

3145
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,420
You know why?

3146
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:26,980
Do you get my point?

3147
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:27,680
Yeah.

3148
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:28,980
Yeah.

3149
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:34,060
It's like, the good news is you've got 14 years left, the bad news is you've got 14 years left.

3150
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:35,670
It's the same, you know...

3151
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:38,280
It's the same metaphor.

3152
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,500
Yeah, now, sometimes people say, how do you know that, Greek?

3153
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,960
And I'm like, how can you not not know that?

3154
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:45,480
Right?

3155
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:46,260
You see?

3156
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:47,520
Yeah.

3157
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,380
How can you not not know that?

3158
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:51,420
What do you mean, how do you know they're being put on a list?

3159
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:52,760
Oh, boy.

3160
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:54,600
You know?

3161
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:55,480
Come on.

3162
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:57,720
Yeah.

3163
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:03,640
And there's probably no way of being on that list, you know, collectively.

3164
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:08,060
But being on a local list is a lot more immediately problematic, right?

3165
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:10,100
Especially running a local business and whatnot.

3166
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:14,040
Like, you don't necessarily want to make local enemies, right?

3167
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:18,460
There's the humor that one can perceive.

3168
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:23,860
I tend to stay rather happy about it and just say, you know, that's very entertaining to see.

3169
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:30,440
Multi-colored, hand-in-hand, whatever, you know, tattooed or spiked or whatever.

3170
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,840
Oh, that's interesting.

3171
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:36,820
And nothing more really needs to be said, you know?

3172
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:38,200
I can say it to myself.

3173
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:43,120
And you see all kinds, you know?

3174
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:45,100
And I'm sure it's just as bad up there.

3175
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:47,940
Well, here's the thing, Jason.

3176
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:49,920
It may not have helped you from what I just said.

3177
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,340
I say the same thing to both sides.

3178
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:56,260
But if you think about it for a little while, another thing might emerge.

3179
02:11:57,300 --> 02:12:02,520
In other words, my intention of saying the same thing to both sides, those that are for it, I tell them they're being put on a list.

3180
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:05,480
And those that are against it, I tell them they're being put on a list.

3181
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:09,240
It satisfies them both from however they can hear it.

3182
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:14,000
Obviously, the ones that don't like them like the idea more, right?

3183
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:21,000
That they're being put on a list means like, you know, the right thing will be done in the future, which I don't think is going to be done.

3184
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:23,320
The right thing will be done either then.

3185
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:35,700
But once you take the stance that there is something that's going on that's beyond what you see right now, then you can be more creative on how to deal with them.

3186
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:37,660
In other words, it's a bigger thing.

3187
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:42,940
It's not just they're promoting education of transgender or homosexuality.

3188
02:12:42,940 --> 02:12:45,120
There's something even bigger agenda behind that.

3189
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:48,940
And that's where the creativity of how to deal with it really comes from.

3190
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,640
Again, there's a lot of these patriot types.

3191
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:58,480
Like, show me the law that the government can tax your income.

3192
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:02,400
And if you go to the government, they say, we don't need a law.

3193
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:03,500
Right?

3194
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:05,700
Well, then what law?

3195
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:13,460
Then my question was, what law is the government using that tells them that they don't need a law?

3196
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,340
You see?

3197
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:17,780
And it took me a while, a minute, and I found it.

3198
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:19,340
You see?

3199
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,880
And then I just went and used that.

3200
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,780
And now I don't have to deal with what these patriot assholes deal with.

3201
02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:32,050
So in other words, there's education.

3202
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:42,550
Well, we know from a human side, evidence is, if you go on YouTube, there's a video or YouTube, I think, Bruce, it's called The New Order of Barbarians.

3203
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:43,410
Yes.

3204
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:44,050
Yes.

3205
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:44,850
Dr. Dan.

3206
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:45,290
Fascinating.

3207
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:45,950
Yes.

3208
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:46,450
Dr. Dan.

3209
02:13:46,450 --> 02:13:47,510
He was at a lecture.

3210
02:13:47,810 --> 02:13:50,470
Yeah, 1960, he was at a lecture, and he gives all the notes.

3211
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:53,570
And, you know, about promote the agendas that you see.

3212
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:54,810
They're actually behind schedule.

3213
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:56,990
They're about 15, 20 years behind schedule.

3214
02:13:57,650 --> 02:13:59,490
That's why they seem to be pushing it so hard.

3215
02:14:00,430 --> 02:14:00,730
Yeah.

3216
02:14:02,210 --> 02:14:10,570
So if you start seeing that there's the human socialist side to it, and it's hidden, then the answer, perhaps, to counter it is going to be hidden as well.

3217
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:12,350
You see?

3218
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:16,420
Right.

3219
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:20,920
That's something I have no immediate response to.

3220
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:26,240
And maybe it's something that an immediate response to that, quote, unquote, agenda, because that's what it is.

3221
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:30,300
It's not, you know, strictly a social agenda that's being put on the people.

3222
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:35,100
That might be something that's worth just covering.

3223
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:48,820
You know, it could be something as simple as what MGM, Goldenmeier, the old filmmaker in the 20s, you know, when they brought up psychotherapy, he says, oh, anyone who wants to see a psychiatrist should have their head examined, right?

3224
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:49,840
Right.

3225
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:52,060
Yes.

3226
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,500
Something that's important, something that just kind of turns the brain inside out.

3227
02:14:59,360 --> 02:14:59,900
Hmm.

3228
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:21,600
Well, what has occurred to me with this, and just in terms of a really practical approach, as a writer, journalist, whatever, is that it's reached such a stage that it's possible, not just theoretically, but I think practically possible, to just present the facts around it in an entirely neutral way, and they will be shocking.

3229
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:22,980
Oh, yeah.

3230
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,120
Let us know.

3231
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:25,280
First sides.

3232
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:29,700
So, let us know where the neutral point is, the point of inertia.

3233
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:30,940
Well, where is that, you see?

3234
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:33,080
Is it political?

3235
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:34,000
Is it religious?

3236
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,540
Is it biological?

3237
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:36,520
Is it scientific?

3238
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,340
Is it cultural?

3239
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:38,640
What is it, you see?

3240
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:42,140
Is it all of that, politically, being neutral?

3241
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:45,500
What do you mean exactly by the point of inertia, then, here?

3242
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,080
Inertia is where no movement takes place.

3243
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:54,740
In other words, if you're neutral, and I'm talking about apathy, because the neutrality still admits something is going on.

3244
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:56,820
Apathy negates it, let's say, right?

3245
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:03,280
There's no necessity with apathy, where with neutrality there still is necessity.

3246
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:14,020
I think, for me, the neutral point is that what I really object to is the loss of objectivity.

3247
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:15,160
Well, yeah.

3248
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:18,860
And that's kind of neutral, in a way, even though I feel strongly about it.

3249
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:33,760
It's not specifically referring to transgender, or political correctness, or homosexuality, or any of these buzz topics that people get so upset about.

3250
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,799
It's about the distortion of reality around those topics.

3251
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:43,260
That is the neutral thing.

3252
02:16:44,219 --> 02:16:46,320
What's a fact, and what isn't a fact?

3253
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:47,780
That's the whole point, right?

3254
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:48,620
It's about facts.

3255
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:53,940
They're supposedly objective, and you can only recognize them.

3256
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:56,500
And you can't have feelings about facts.

3257
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:58,860
I mean, you can, but it doesn't change the fact.

3258
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:03,360
Well, here's something that's slightly parallel.

3259
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:08,160
Back in the 80s, they had something called the ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act.

3260
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:15,740
And if you had a building, a small business of X amount of employees, or whatever, you had to build a handicap access.

3261
02:17:15,740 --> 02:17:22,600
And a lot of businesses could not afford a $50,000 for a handicapped bathroom and a ramp, you see.

3262
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:24,840
Yeah, you see.

3263
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:33,840
And even though they never had anyone with a disability coming into the business, some of the businesses were not even open to the public, you see.

3264
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:37,160
And the argument was, well, what if you have an employee?

3265
02:17:38,219 --> 02:17:39,440
You know, then it's equal.

3266
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:41,000
And that kind of fizzled away.

3267
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:42,860
It was a big deal.

3268
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:45,379
I don't know if you remember that, Bruce, in the 80s, the late 80s.

3269
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:45,780
Oh, yeah.

3270
02:17:46,719 --> 02:17:47,719
It was a big deal.

3271
02:17:48,459 --> 02:17:58,520
Now, a lot of people that were selling handicap accessible fixtures, and you were very happy about that, because they got into business.

3272
02:17:59,299 --> 02:18:03,160
So, I don't know, who's getting into business now with all this stuff?

3273
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:08,980
So, that's why I'm suggesting it's more of a spiritual, it's the revived goddess religion.

3274
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:14,760
If I were to do a quick template, and I'll just speak, you know, I haven't put much thought into it.

3275
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:20,500
I always say, well, what do you know about the ancient goddess religion, and the revival of the ancient goddess religion?

3276
02:18:23,059 --> 02:18:29,660
Unfortunately, through history, the only way you countered a religion was not getting rid of the god, but getting rid of its adherents.

3277
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:36,139
But here, in this case, you have more ticks than you have dog, you see, if it's on a social level, right?

3278
02:18:38,219 --> 02:18:40,360
So, yeah, it is an interesting thing.

3279
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:48,660
I think studying the ancient goddess religion, I mean, unfortunately, you know, actually, this is not unfortunate.

3280
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:49,260
I'll just say this.

3281
02:18:49,639 --> 02:18:53,840
You know, if you go to San Francisco, there is a major library by the Federal Reserve Building.

3282
02:18:54,059 --> 02:18:59,580
It's the major library for the, remember we were there in San Francisco?

3283
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:02,580
The Freemasonic Library.

3284
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:05,920
It's a huge library, and I mean, probably millions of books in there.

3285
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:10,700
And it would behoove anyone to go there and just look at the books.

3286
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:14,780
And you know, none of the curators and the people in there know about what's in their shelves.

3287
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:18,379
I know, I'm not saying this facetiously or sarcastically.

3288
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:19,639
They don't know what's there.

3289
02:19:20,299 --> 02:19:32,900
You can go to the San Francisco Freemason Library, and spend a couple of days there, and find books on the subject that I'm discussing right now, the revived goddess religion, and the rituals, and all that other stuff.

3290
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:37,860
And if you walk in, by the way, and ask any of the people, do you have any books on the revived goddess religion, I don't know what you're talking about.

3291
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:40,299
But if they're right there, I mean, you could see them.

3292
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,360
You know what I mean?

3293
02:19:44,860 --> 02:19:45,680
So what do you know?

3294
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:50,640
That's why I was recently speaking to someone again, and what do you know about the goddess religion?

3295
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:50,980
Nothing.

3296
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:51,680
Yeah, thanks.

3297
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:52,880
Most people don't.

3298
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:58,200
And I had, in previous sonic events, I'll say it again.

3299
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:07,000
If I were to distill it down, just like I do the birthdays, dolls, and cannibals, and all that stuff, you know, you're not going to find that in one place.

3300
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:20,980
But if I were to break down the goddess religion, she teaches that the goal of mankind is to create a god-like state for mankind.

3301
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:31,360
And mankind will achieve that by not focusing on the differences of the sexes.

3302
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:36,040
In other words, every human being will be both male and female, or neither.

3303
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:40,340
Sex, sexuality, polarity, that is a problem.

3304
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:57,060
And the way mankind will achieve that is by promoting male with male unions, and the males become infertile, and female with female unions, and the females can retain fertility, and the human race is now procreated without male and female union.

3305
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:00,220
That's the goddess religion in a nutshell.

3306
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:15,180
And I just gave you, you know, when I discussed, I brought, there was a furniture I bought once I was high in leather couches a while back, and there was a old guy with a pretty proud Freemason belt buckle and ring.

3307
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:18,280
I brought this up to him, he nearly, he just wanted to kill me.

3308
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:30,440
He's like, basically, he was in the order Scottish Rite, which is not Freemasonry, for 30 or 40 years before they even gave him access to the revived goddess religion.

3309
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:32,940
He's like, how dare I even speak it in public?

3310
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:37,070
And how do you find it?

3311
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:38,050
Just look in your book.

3312
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:41,450
It's just like when you deal with the people in the legal society.

3313
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:44,230
It's like, well, where'd you get all that information?

3314
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,390
Right here in your own book.

3315
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:47,750
You know?

3316
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:54,770
So, would you say it's more men that are practicing and implementing the goddess religion?

3317
02:21:55,450 --> 02:22:02,250
Well, you know what the interesting, that's a good point, because there's a lot of talk about the goddess in you and all that, and we have a patriarchal society.

3318
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:12,290
No, if you look at it accurately, what's happening is you have the goddess and you have the priesthood, and the priesthood tends to be the liturgy is done by men.

3319
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:18,210
So, in essence, the irony here is you have a goddess religion, and the priesthood happens to be male.

3320
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:19,990
Majority.

3321
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:27,730
That's where they get the patriarchal society, because, I don't know, from reading scripture, I see that the woman is the head economist.

3322
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:31,070
Ficol meaning house, and nomos meaning law.

3323
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,890
She runs a lot.

3324
02:22:31,890 --> 02:22:39,810
There was actually one, Israel had a female queen for a short time in reign, admitted so.

3325
02:22:40,330 --> 02:22:46,550
There was also a female judge, and female prophets in the bible, you see.

3326
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:48,910
And they were held in high regard.

3327
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:57,490
So, I don't see any oppression in scripture, and I see a lot of the stuff that they discuss about castle doctrine, you know, where the man is this and that.

3328
02:22:57,730 --> 02:22:59,930
I don't see that in scripture, you know.

3329
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:01,190
Hmm.

3330
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:02,430
I don't see it.

3331
02:23:02,430 --> 02:23:04,390
It's in the Christian tradition.

3332
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:06,630
The Muslims are the worst.

3333
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:12,610
There's nothing that dictates head clothing and scripture in the Quran.

3334
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:16,970
I believe there's just a place that says, if a woman is married, she should cover her vagina.

3335
02:23:18,030 --> 02:23:19,990
Well, that's really radical, isn't it?

3336
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:23,290
You know?

3337
02:23:24,130 --> 02:23:34,030
And this is one of the things that's most manifest with the trans movement, that it's men displacing women, essentially.

3338
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:35,350
Well, yeah.

3339
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:44,550
Well, you'll take the physically more robust of the group, to control the less physically robust.

3340
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:49,930
Because, basically, it comes down to who can crack whose head, right?

3341
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:52,950
Basically, you know, the caveman mentality, let's say.

3342
02:23:53,470 --> 02:24:00,830
So, if you were to inspire a group of people to change society in an oppressive fashion, you want to inspire the men.

3343
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:06,330
Because they tend to be physically stronger, and happen to be in more control of things that are more destructive.

3344
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:08,250
So, it's more obvious.

3345
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:11,750
Yeah, so...

3346
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:14,470
You know, to catch a thief, you must think like a thief.

3347
02:24:16,210 --> 02:24:17,750
So, not always, but...

3348
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:22,810
And trans activists are quite notoriously violent.

3349
02:24:24,970 --> 02:24:38,070
And I suppose a trans woman, as in a man who's surgically altered to be a woman, or even now, because you don't have to have the surgery, you can just self-identify as a woman, they'd still be physically stronger.

3350
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:42,630
They'd still have the physical strength in their arms and whatnot, I presume.

3351
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:48,010
Yes, I would think so, yeah.

3352
02:24:48,870 --> 02:25:09,010
This is where two ideologies are colliding, it's where there's kind of this opening for creating a cognitive dissonance in those who've been ideologically railroaded, you know, into the latest, whatever, obligatory position, because...

3353
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:10,570
Which we've come in upset.

3354
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:19,950
Well, that is to say, they're the same people who are so mad about feminism, and are all about women's rights, which is still bubbling away with the Me Too movement.

3355
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:34,890
But when you actually start to look at the transgender movement, it's women who are mostly objecting to it, because they're becoming aware that it's actually the same old oppression has taken a new guise now, in the form of transgender.

3356
02:25:34,910 --> 02:25:36,490
No, I kind of do agree.

3357
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:38,230
Because men are defining what it is to be a woman.

3358
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:40,830
Men are now defining what it is to be a woman.

3359
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:46,370
They say, like, Bruce Jenner was a woman of the year, but you can't get more encapsulated than that.

3360
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:50,870
Well, that would be the media's approach to it, wouldn't it?

3361
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:54,730
You know, could it all boil down to extreme stupidity?

3362
02:25:55,470 --> 02:25:56,210
Yep, I agree.

3363
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:59,210
I don't know, we'd have to say insanity.

3364
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:01,050
If you're going to put a...

3365
02:26:01,050 --> 02:26:01,930
Yeah, unsane.

3366
02:26:02,190 --> 02:26:04,090
You're going to have to diagnose it, I think.

3367
02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:11,010
Yeah, unsane, because you think insane, they have a different DMG, whatever the set of rules.

3368
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:12,790
But unsane, in other words, yeah.

3369
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:19,430
But when it's engineered insanity, then you can't really boil it down, no?

3370
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:23,690
Well, you know, it's even more insane.

3371
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:30,430
What's more insane is you need money, let's say, what they call a means of exchange in commerce to buy the makeup.

3372
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:33,010
If you, let's say you're a man, you want to be a woman, you need money.

3373
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:38,630
How are you going to convert all that clothes into female clothes, woman's clothes, and buy all the makeup?

3374
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:40,870
And they don't even know that there's no money.

3375
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:43,330
They don't even know how the money system works.

3376
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:46,110
You know, they don't even know how their own body works.

3377
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:49,390
You know, they don't know anything about anything, and they're doing this.

3378
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:55,890
So, I think it's a spinoff of one of the symptoms of extreme censorship and stupidity.

3379
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:58,710
But its source, of course, is...

3380
02:26:59,130 --> 02:26:59,710
Oh, that rhymes.

3381
02:26:59,770 --> 02:27:02,370
Its source, of course, of course, is the goddess religion.

3382
02:27:03,450 --> 02:27:15,370
Well, I mean, it intensifies the state dependency, because if you're transgender, you become completely dependent on the state for the surgery, for the drugs, for the protection, all the rest of that.

3383
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:24,330
Sure, and the state gets all of that, let's say, quote-unquote financial from your own exemption that was given to you when you were born.

3384
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:26,550
So, again, it goes down to the...

3385
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:29,250
And I assure you, the state is no longer the state.

3386
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:31,830
It's run by the law merchants, which are the attorney class.

3387
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:35,250
When I say attorneys, I mean, there's very, very many types.

3388
02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:37,410
Like when you say engineer, like what kind of engineer?

3389
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:47,610
If they discover that there is no, quote-unquote, personal benefit for their class in doing this, they will withdraw.

3390
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:50,510
They won't offer the surgeries and all this other stuff.

3391
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:53,050
Don't think for a minute that taxes pay for anything, right?

3392
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:55,350
The purpose of taxation...

3393
02:27:55,350 --> 02:27:57,730
I'm not protesting taxation, because they...

3394
02:27:57,730 --> 02:28:00,470
You know, how can you protest anything stupid people fall for?

3395
02:28:00,470 --> 02:28:05,390
But the purpose of taxation is to create engineer's scarcity.

3396
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:11,030
You know, if someone has their full paycheck every week, that equates to a full time every week.

3397
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:16,430
So, if you start whittling away their resources to do exchange, it's the same as taking their time away.

3398
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:19,410
Now they have to spend more time making something that they're going to lose.

3399
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:22,050
It's like having a bucket with a hole in it.

3400
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:26,010
The bigger you make the hole, the more frequent trips you have to make, you see.

3401
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:32,930
It's a society that's engineered to be wasteful, inefficient, and destructive for a very, very long time.

3402
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:36,410
And I just see this as just another aspect of it.

3403
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:38,770
And to suck you out of time.

3404
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:49,440
Yeah, what we actually need is an alien species that are serial rapists to come down and grab all these trans...

3405
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:50,760
Man, never mind.

3406
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:53,040
Yeah.

3407
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:56,000
Yeah, to come...

3408
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,280
In other words, isn't it sound like you need some outside help?

3409
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:02,400
Because if you go here or there, you see, it's the state will back them up on one side.

3410
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:04,400
The people will back them up on the other.

3411
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:05,260
There's no...

3412
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:05,960
There's no...

3413
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:10,060
Yeah, in other words, basically, it's a knife fight.

3414
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,740
And you want to go with another knife.

3415
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:12,800
It's just going to make it worse.

3416
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:16,160
When you have a knife fight, you need someone to show up with a machine gun.

3417
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:17,580
See, that's the peacemaker.

3418
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:18,920
Everyone drops their knives.

3419
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:26,340
But if another person shows up, you have to have ordinance that is so beyond their avail and so beyond their ability that they stop.

3420
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:29,840
And the only way that's going to be done now is with the gods.

3421
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:31,060
Because you can't do it with words.

3422
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,480
You're not going to be able to do it with force.

3423
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:33,160
Why?

3424
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:36,340
Because they even incorporated this into the military, right?

3425
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:39,060
So...

3426
02:29:39,060 --> 02:29:41,740
So, yeah, it's just food, clothing, shelter.

3427
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:44,300
Ignore them if you have to put up with them.

3428
02:29:44,380 --> 02:30:00,880
In other words, if you're a public figure like doing retail or have to work with the public for most of your waking hours for your own, you know, gainful employment or whatever, gainful work, you're going to have to devise a strategy, obviously, right?

3429
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:03,960
And that's important.

3430
02:30:04,060 --> 02:30:18,680
It's actually quite important, actually, to devise a strategy to deal with them if you spend quite a few of your waking hours or you have to deal with the public that is, you know, public at large that is engulfed in this manner.

3431
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:19,820
Mm-hmm.

3432
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:23,880
Because if you're quiet, if you do it the right way, it's very passive.

3433
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:28,920
But once you're known to be against it, they could make your life difficult as well, just because that's what they do.

3434
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:30,740
They're very spiteful as well, you know what I mean?

3435
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:44,520
Yeah, it seems to be a matter of just sending out just enough of a signal that the people who are going to be drawn to it and benefit from, you know, the relief of being able to speak their own minds...

3436
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:48,300
Right, but they have no minds, yeah.

3437
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:50,740
They have nothing in their mind to speak of, you know.

3438
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:59,580
No, I'm talking about the conversations that we're having here, like just we've brought something to the table, right?

3439
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:21,760
So, like everybody has something, however small, and some people have a little bit more, but you only find out what people have if you create a space where they can actually feel safe enough to express it, like you're talking about optimizing other people's performances, that's what I mean.

3440
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:33,140
So, it's just a good message to others that they can actually express themselves, however, you know, however paltry that expression is, at least they don't have to be afraid to express it.

3441
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:49,160
They're not going to be condemned, but that seems to be what would motivate me more, it's not like I plan to try and change the direction of social engineering, even if I didn't believe it was all coming crashing to an end.

3442
02:31:49,780 --> 02:31:58,920
I'm not an idiot in that regard anyway, but I do want to nurture the relations in the community that are worth nurturing.

3443
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:07,980
Right, and I think with objectifying, for example, to do social commentary, it's always the opposite, right?

3444
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:10,720
When they tell you peace, that means war is coming.

3445
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:14,740
When they tell you economic prosperity, it means they're going to rob you.

3446
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:18,660
When they tell you environmental, it means they're going to pollute, you see?

3447
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:27,320
So, what's coming is a balancing and a new convention and a new model,

3448
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:29,660
new way of doing things in the next decade,

3449
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:33,080
and it's going to settle in and there's going to be fruit from it,

3450
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:35,940
order, peace, prosperity to a certain degree,

3451
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:39,660
and people, then it'll be promoted as lasting a thousand years

3452
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,000
and everyone's going to buy into it,

3453
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:44,920
and when that sentiment settles in and everyone's quite happy,

3454
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:47,380
even though there's a lot of real nasty shit still going on,

3455
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,100
that means you've got less than three or four years left,

3456
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:52,860
you know, where it physically starts to manifest.

3457
02:32:53,380 --> 02:32:58,520
So, do you think that the transgender and the post-gender and transhumanism is part of that?

3458
02:32:59,080 --> 02:32:59,340
Yes.

3459
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:14,500
No, it's a setup, just like the tattoos and other things, because one-third of mankind is wiped out by mankind, of men themselves, for social reasons.

3460
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:28,540
What I mean is, do you think that the ideology that's being implemented in this period that you're predicting is going to be congruent with the one that's predominant now, with the transgender?

3461
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:29,600
It's not.

3462
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:35,520
No, no, the transgenders and the homos and all that stuff, and other people will be dealt with before that comes in.

3463
02:33:36,900 --> 02:33:37,360
Okay.

3464
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:43,400
They're going to be dealt with very harshly, in other words, like, you won't be breathing harshly, kind of, you know what I mean?

3465
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:50,680
So then, that would imply that the whole transgender madness is a way to foment polarization...

3466
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:51,060
Yes.

3467
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:54,420
...thoroughly towards these groups that are around us.

3468
02:33:54,800 --> 02:34:09,380
What's coming in the future, the destruction of people who have marked skin and polars, transgender and homo, the destruction of that element of society on a worldwide level is going to be one of the things that's going to be shown as, see, this is what...

3469
02:34:09,380 --> 02:34:12,320
we have to do this in order to get to the next level, and everyone will agree.

3470
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:14,000
Meaning that...

3471
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,840
and that we're talking about a third of the people are going to be destroyed this way.

3472
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:20,300
So, do you want to do the math?

3473
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:22,400
Two, three billion people?

3474
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,220
Two and a half billion?

3475
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:27,180
There's more than a billion people with tattoos, at least.

3476
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:28,220
Yeah.

3477
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:31,500
I can't even see anybody without a tattoo these days.

3478
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:33,560
I was going to say that, too.

3479
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:39,140
And so, is this the reason why tattoos are serious business, or is there a deeper...

3480
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:39,440
Yes.

3481
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:45,360
No, I wrote about this back 14, 15 years ago.

3482
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:52,580
I said, we're going to watch an increase in tattoos, and even to the point where, you know, grandmas will have full-body tattoos.

3483
02:34:52,700 --> 02:35:01,900
And I sent this, you know, two years later, someone came to visit, and we walked around the corner, and we were talking about the email, and there was a 75-year-old with a full-body tattoo.

3484
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:04,420
He looked at me, and he said, this is just crazy.

3485
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:06,420
This is exactly what you wrote about in the email.

3486
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,860
And I said, yeah.

3487
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:10,600
And at the time, it wasn't like it was now.

3488
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:16,640
Obviously, I remember in the 90s, people were still getting tattoos, but not like it is now.

3489
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:22,060
Do you want me to tell you why I got my tattoos?

3490
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:23,280
No.

3491
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,060
It's a pretty interesting story.

3492
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:28,020
There's a spirit behind it, but go ahead.

3493
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:29,500
Yeah, there was a spirit behind it.

3494
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:40,340
It was during this period in my life, I've podcasted a lot about it, and written about it, where I became convinced, partly due to too many psychedelics, but not only that.

3495
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:46,740
I became convinced that Lucifer was trying to incarnate through me, that I was supposed to be an avatar of Lucifer.

3496
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:52,320
And I did all these various things, shaving my head and whatnot.

3497
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:59,680
And I decided to get tattoos in order to brand myself, like this body is property of Lucifer.

3498
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:04,940
So it was meant to be this kind of ritual of surrender, because I saw Lucifer as a benign thing.

3499
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:08,640
Anyway, I saw it as benign.

3500
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:10,460
It wasn't like I was a satanist or anything.

3501
02:36:10,860 --> 02:36:14,980
But most of the people on the planet die by that.

3502
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:16,960
Sort of momentarily.

3503
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:19,660
Yeah, but possession is where you don't have any...

3504
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:27,700
If someone was possessed for a month, for example, and you freed them from that possession, they would not recall anything.

3505
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:29,260
Okay.

3506
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:30,960
It is your oppressor.

3507
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,700
Just the sense.

3508
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:33,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3509
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:35,380
But when you say satanist, this is this...

3510
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:44,280
If you were to fly in a galactic starship and go by the Earth, and if you point that this is where satan's children live, point it to the Earth, that's very accurate.

3511
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:49,500
Because he's the father of this world, meaning man's society.

3512
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,640
This is his world.

3513
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:57,360
I'm not talking about the bees, and the elephants, and the whales, and the ticks, and the bacteria, and the grass, and the trees, and mountains.

3514
02:36:57,460 --> 02:37:00,560
I'm talking about the human society, the cultures.

3515
02:37:00,740 --> 02:37:02,960
All of the cultures are his.

3516
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:07,520
All of the religions, all of the Christian denominations are satanic, 100%.

3517
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:10,620
All of the Hindu, all of the Blues, all of it.

3518
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:20,040
Now, what's in their scripture is not satanic, or might mention Satan, but the culture itself is satanic, for sure.

3519
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:20,820
Adversarial.

3520
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:32,500
You know, and you could do, you know, look at the legal profession, the medical profession, the architects, you know, the engineers, the, you know, every aspect that's, you know...

3521
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:36,380
Yeah, so we're all stamped by that, whether we've got lips or tattoos or not.

3522
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:40,100
Yeah, you're satan's children, basically, on this planet.

3523
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:43,700
You see, that's, for, this was a normal thing, you see.

3524
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:47,780
Sorry to interrupt, but why is it you and not we, Greg?

3525
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,620
Oh, no, because I'm speaking from a third party.

3526
02:37:55,580 --> 02:37:58,000
You know, the Greek, we have the...

3527
02:37:58,820 --> 02:38:05,040
I learned how to do the third party thing from reading scripture, by the way, and other ancient writs.

3528
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:13,100
But the thing is, where you get your law, your manner of law, your morality, you call your father.

3529
02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:22,340
That's why, for example, in the Catholic convention, the priest is called father, because unlike today, back in the day, the church was very overbearing.

3530
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:26,380
You know, they were into your life very much about everything.

3531
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:38,340
So, you have your biological parents, and then you have your spiritual parents, those are the ones that rear the mind and rear your morality and your law, and that is your spiritual father.

3532
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:46,640
So, when you look at all the base root of all culture of mankind, the base root, the father of that is the adversary, right?

3533
02:38:47,740 --> 02:38:50,220
It's very clear and simple.

3534
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:53,400
But when I say that, it's not the Hollywood type.

3535
02:38:53,500 --> 02:39:07,460
And the thing that really, it doesn't rub me the wrong way, but it just makes me want to say, what a pack of morons is the people that cry like Satanists, you know, for the avid anti-Satanists online.

3536
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:12,640
You know, they're like, oh, this Temple of Set, or this other group, or they're Satanists.

3537
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:13,500
No, they're not.

3538
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:15,100
They tell you what they are.

3539
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:19,100
The Temple of Set is reviving the ancient god of Set.

3540
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:19,880
It's not Satan.

3541
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:20,960
Set is not Satan.

3542
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:21,440
Sorry.

3543
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:25,220
He is a dark underworld prince of that particular region.

3544
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:29,000
You know, this other group will revive another one.

3545
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:30,180
That is not Satan.

3546
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:34,540
Those are balls, or, you know, the Christians have revived Molech.

3547
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:39,240
You know, you see the red creature with the child on the lap, right?

3548
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:40,400
Make a wish of prosperity.

3549
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:43,740
Do you think they just burn children just to burn children?

3550
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:50,320
No, the ritual was to sacrifice the children while you made a wish of prosperity.

3551
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:53,620
In other words, you know, for some kind of gain.

3552
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:57,400
Whether it was, whatever, the interest of the individual.

3553
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:01,060
That's why they ask to tell them what you want, you see.

3554
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:08,760
It's a descriptive term, though, like an accuser or an adversary.

3555
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:11,660
Yeah, if you say ugly, he says pretty.

3556
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:14,100
If you say disease, he says healthy.

3557
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,280
If you say black, he says white.

3558
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,360
If you say healthy, he says disease.

3559
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,440
Look at the doctors.

3560
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:22,360
What are they?

3561
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:28,140
The number one, well, the number two killer cause of death is medical malpractice.

3562
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:31,240
And if you look at the number one cause of death, I don't know what it is.

3563
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:32,260
Heart disease or whatever.

3564
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:35,760
That's, again, you know, a spin-off of that.

3565
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,780
So, look at the, you know, all the religions.

3566
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:49,700
You know, I was really upset that I was so true about this a few months ago, when I watched something about the Dalai Lama.

3567
02:40:49,960 --> 02:40:52,140
The history of him and what he said and all that.

3568
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:53,340
And the guy's a total moron.

3569
02:40:53,900 --> 02:40:54,840
He doesn't know anything.

3570
02:40:55,900 --> 02:41:00,840
And how can the leader of a people say that and be so misdirected?

3571
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:04,200
I'm surprised you're upset by that.

3572
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:06,980
I thought it would just confirm your...

3573
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:09,260
No, no, I was upset that it was confirming.

3574
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:12,680
Because, you know, you always want to employ some doubt.

3575
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:17,260
You say, well, maybe it's correct enough to say that this is the way it is, but maybe there'll be an exception.

3576
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:24,280
And you see, and then when you see that there is no exception, maybe, you know, you start saying to yourself, maybe I should be more emphatical about it.

3577
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,800
You know, but...

3578
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:30,920
Well, you know, not in public figures who are widely influential.

3579
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:33,760
I think it's probably fair to say there's no exceptions.

3580
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:34,640
But...

3581
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:35,160
Yeah, of course.

3582
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:37,680
That doesn't mean there are no exceptions anywhere.

3583
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:40,040
There are exceptions, yeah, of course.

3584
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:42,980
Otherwise, there would be no balance.

3585
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:49,560
You know, the largest theoretical mathematical equations, you've seen some of them fill up a blackboard.

3586
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:50,220
There's just...

3587
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:52,600
to solve it, it's just a very small...

3588
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:55,600
The solution is usually a very compact one, isn't it?

3589
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:57,540
So...

3590
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:05,600
Well, I could go on asking questions.

3591
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:10,040
I'm not sure if we should talk more about Satan and the adversary and all that.

3592
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:10,740
What do you think?

3593
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:13,300
No, well, you could, and you could...

3594
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:16,280
If you want to know about Satan and the adversary, look around you.

3595
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:18,080
Look at a cereal box.

3596
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:19,760
Look at what they're doing in religions.

3597
02:42:20,020 --> 02:42:20,640
Look at TV.

3598
02:42:21,220 --> 02:42:21,900
Look at...

3599
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:22,120
Yeah?

3600
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:29,580
Yeah, in a sense, it's just more redundancy, because everything around you is influenced that way.

3601
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:44,200
And I think the point that I must always stress is the Satanism within the Satanism, which is the way Satanism is being portrayed, is Satanic, because when you say that, most people think, oh, it's child sacrifice.

3602
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:53,180
Oh, it's the red creature with scales and a bifurcated tongue and a pointy tail and a pitchfork and the Hollywood thing.

3603
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:56,380
That's the Satanic part about Satanism, is they got even...

3604
02:42:56,380 --> 02:43:03,140
When you discuss Satanism, it's Satanic, again, because it spins people's minds off into something that's not true, again.

3605
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,680
So, yeah.

3606
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:12,760
Yeah, that would be the squirrel page.

3607
02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:15,040
The dummy load.

3608
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:15,900
The pranking.

3609
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:19,720
I do have a question, then.

3610
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:34,960
If Justitia is the deity that the institutions of the world are most worshipping or enthralled to, then how does that square with this being Satan's dominion or what have you?

3611
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:38,120
I guess I can't speak to that.

3612
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:46,680
No, there is none, because when I say it's Satan's dominion, it's, again, it's the least...

3613
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:50,680
He's a well-known entity, right, on the other side.

3614
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:56,900
And we're being told through Scripture that there are other entities that have different purposes.

3615
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:58,940
You know, some rule the nations.

3616
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:05,340
You know, when you look at maps and borders changing, it's not just man squirting ink on paper and making treaties.

3617
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:06,940
There is an entity behind that.

3618
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:15,360
When one country loses a war to another, that war, the entity that lost, has to lose on the spiritual side first.

3619
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:17,400
You know, you have some that are very...

3620
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:20,020
Right, so then you have many, many aspects.

3621
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:28,240
The question and the mystery that I would suggest, that's still here and is a question that I would, is how do they relate to Satan?

3622
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:31,120
How does the goddess religion relate to Satan?

3623
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:35,160
Does it really change anything for me, you see?

3624
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:36,640
Would there be a tool?

3625
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:38,500
Sure.

3626
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:46,500
And how do the principalities, like in the book of Daniel, the prince of Persia is a real tough one, right?

3627
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,720
How does he relate to Satan?

3628
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:49,880
You see, how do they...

3629
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:51,520
I mean, do they all go to the same bar?

3630
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,080
You know, do they all shop at the same grocery store?

3631
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:55,560
I mean, you know, this is a pun, you know.

3632
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,680
I mean, what are they, you know, what are they doing with each other?

3633
02:44:58,680 --> 02:45:07,540
Do they ignore, you know, is Satan up in some tower, and, you know, they have messengers go back and forth, or do they rub elbows, or...

3634
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:10,100
You see, the curious minds want to know, right?

3635
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:12,660
You see?

3636
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:18,360
I mean, if I had access to know that, sure, I wouldn't turn it down, right?

3637
02:45:19,720 --> 02:45:21,880
But are we given that kind of detail?

3638
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:22,240
No.

3639
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:25,120
And do I have a right and license to make that up?

3640
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:25,380
No.

3641
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:32,520
I don't have a right to make up what's going on in that respect, in the dynamics of the relationship, or lack thereof.

3642
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:34,680
I don't have the right to make that up.

3643
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:43,560
Well, there are correlations between the Lucifer archetype and the Goddess archetype.

3644
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,880
There's quite a few, and Venus being the oldest one.

3645
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:54,350
There are ways in which the Satanic archetype can be seen or identified as feminine or female.

3646
02:45:55,990 --> 02:45:56,370
Sure.

3647
02:45:56,890 --> 02:45:59,210
And there's many ways to even say that.

3648
02:45:59,210 --> 02:46:04,650
There was a film that said the first lies Satan procured is that he doesn't exist.

3649
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:11,390
So maybe when they procure a female, it's really a male showing that he's a woman.

3650
02:46:11,610 --> 02:46:14,610
Is it so far-fetched that some men want to be like women?

3651
02:46:14,710 --> 02:46:16,170
We were just talking about that.

3652
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:18,010
And maybe vice versa.

3653
02:46:19,070 --> 02:46:26,970
I mean, I've heard a lot of testimony and read testimony about the New World Order types, the people underground, the occult rituals.

3654
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:33,610
When they do abuses, especially when it's an adult, it's almost mandatory to do the sex change on them.

3655
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:35,990
If it's a man, dress them like a woman to abuse them.

3656
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:38,530
And if it's a woman, dress them like a man to abuse them.

3657
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:39,470
You know, adults, right?

3658
02:46:40,110 --> 02:46:45,250
And that always struck me as being Satanic, meaning do the opposite, you see.

3659
02:46:48,050 --> 02:46:48,850
Inversion principle.

3660
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:52,670
And there's mater and mater, you know, mother, mother matter.

3661
02:46:53,330 --> 02:46:53,650
Right.

3662
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:58,770
That's pretty spot on in the Latin cognate.

3663
02:47:00,690 --> 02:47:09,750
So it's like the hidden matriarchy is the ascension of matter, like the immersion of the principles of spirit and matter.

3664
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:12,920
Yeah.

3665
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:20,640
And still it would be researched, but in scripture, we have a father and the mother is not an anthropomorphic thing.

3666
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:21,320
It's a place.

3667
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:27,280
So that's an interesting thing from any cognitive thing to wrap your mind around.

3668
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:31,620
Because when you think mother and father, you think of something you can relate to.

3669
02:47:32,060 --> 02:47:42,020
But in scripture, it turns out that the only thing we can relate to is the father and the mother is not an anthropomorphic thing, which is very interesting.

3670
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:45,180
So in what sense is the mother a place in scripture?

3671
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:46,220
It's a place, yes.

3672
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:52,380
And that's something that is outside of the realm of the operating system or the program to contemplate.

3673
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:54,020
So it just doesn't make sense.

3674
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:56,160
What word are you referring to?

3675
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:57,920
The New Jerusalem is our mother.

3676
02:47:58,860 --> 02:48:02,160
Yeah, the mothership, in other words, no pun intended.

3677
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:07,900
And that's something that is cognitively very difficult to contemplate.

3678
02:48:08,060 --> 02:48:08,860
And I leave it alone.

3679
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:20,000
I was going to say humanity, the idea of humanity as the bride of Christ, that also makes humanity as a female.

3680
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:22,060
Right.

3681
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:22,640
Uh-huh.

3682
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:27,340
Yep.

3683
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:34,300
That's another thing that's hard to contemplate because humans have both male and female, let's say, right?

3684
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:38,920
So how can we just lump everyone, male and female, into female again?

3685
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:49,260
Again, the goddess teachings of the goddess religion and the blurring of the lines is the corruption of this, these concepts that are very cognitively difficult to handle.

3686
02:48:54,650 --> 02:49:05,990
Well, they're defined clearly in the writ, but it's distorted by the adversary and whatever he uses as a tool.

3687
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:07,310
Right.

3688
02:49:07,610 --> 02:49:19,890
Now, of course, if you go, if you were to do a study on the bride of Christ being or humanity as the bride is a woman, it goes into the same various things that he's the son of God.

3689
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:23,310
The reason he's the son of God is because he comes in full authority.

3690
02:49:23,710 --> 02:49:27,050
So again, the bride of Christ is given in human terms, right?

3691
02:49:27,050 --> 02:49:32,490
Like a son will always trump the authority of an appointed leader, you see?

3692
02:49:33,210 --> 02:49:41,630
And like a prince at 13 years old will trump the authority of a regent who's been with the king for 50 years, who's in his 70s.

3693
02:49:41,810 --> 02:49:43,450
The prince will trump him, you see?

3694
02:49:44,270 --> 02:49:50,490
Now, the bride is a covenant of fidelity, right?

3695
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:52,930
A bride is a bride when she has fidelity.

3696
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:56,930
When there's no fidelity, she goes into the realm of the adulteress, right?

3697
02:49:57,650 --> 02:49:58,070
You see?

3698
02:49:58,150 --> 02:49:59,590
And that metaphor is given as well.

3699
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:06,230
So, these are metaphors on a human perspective, a human cultural perspective.

3700
02:50:06,410 --> 02:50:09,230
And here's the other interesting thing that I've discussed in the past.

3701
02:50:09,710 --> 02:50:23,830
Once you throw away the concept of the inheritance and the position of a son or the fidelity of a woman and all this as a wife and culture, then you, once you abandon those concepts, then you cannot understand scripture at all, you see?

3702
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:28,430
Can you say more about that?

3703
02:50:29,490 --> 02:50:52,370
Well, if the metaphor of the son and the wife is a metaphor that is denoting metaphorically a structure that's held up or upheld in culture, a wife is defined by being a woman who has fidelity to her spouse, and a son is defined by someone who has the most authority regardless of the others.

3704
02:50:52,670 --> 02:51:01,450
Once the concept of the son having authority and the wife having fidelity goes away in a society, that society can no longer comprehend scripture with those terms.

3705
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:04,090
Right, so it's like a negative feedback loop.

3706
02:51:05,030 --> 02:51:12,430
If our culture isn't lawful and observant of scripture, then we're less and less able to understand scripture.

3707
02:51:12,890 --> 02:51:13,410
Of course.

3708
02:51:13,930 --> 02:51:26,590
The mindset is, especially when you're sending something through time, you know, like I said, you can't use various calendrical systems if they change, so you need something that doesn't change, which is the sun and the moon and the stars for time.

3709
02:51:27,350 --> 02:51:45,610
If you have the concept of a son and a wife, you know, that doesn't change, and even though it might change on a large level, I think there are still enough people in the culture to understand what a son really means, or a father means in terms of authority and importance, and what a wife means in terms of authority and importance, again, to understand scripture.

3710
02:51:46,370 --> 02:51:53,320
But as a group, they will lose that ability, which is obvious.

3711
02:51:53,720 --> 02:52:01,700
But, you know, for a while back, people were hammering me on the book of Daniel, there's going to be a great apostasy or falling away, and it's happening.

3712
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:06,860
I said, no, because the human society has not been there to fall away from it.

3713
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:14,500
So that falling away is going to be in rapid succession, that when they do achieve a certain comprehension, which is all still in the future.

3714
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:21,980
So when people read about the great apostasy, the falling away, they say to the church and all that, I'm saying, no, they've never really had it to fall away.

3715
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:23,960
How can you fall away from something you've never had?

3716
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:38,120
So there's something coming in the future which is going to coalesce or form a knowledge that is true about the gods, and then the people will fall away from that, you see.

3717
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:45,240
Because right now, there's not enough knowledge of the gods in order for any of the things to take place in scripture that you're reading about.

3718
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:48,340
Hmm.

3719
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:58,340
I mean, there's still, take, for example, the center of the world near Jerusalem, and it's Israel, like they call it there, the land of Israel, right?

3720
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:01,960
It has nothing to do with social political consciousness, the location on the earth.

3721
02:53:02,520 --> 02:53:03,960
Look at what's going on over there.

3722
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:12,340
Very little of that resembles anything scripturally accurate, other than the establishment of Israel as a de facto nation versus Palestine.

3723
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:21,700
If you read things that were prior to 1920 or 1930, that area is never referred to as Israel, it's always referred to as Palestine.

3724
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:22,520
But guess what?

3725
02:53:22,580 --> 02:53:23,720
Now it's referred to as what?

3726
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:24,220
Israel.

3727
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:28,900
So, other than that, there's very little change.

3728
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:40,820
And of course, there's a lot of prophetic things, undercurrents going on, like I've just discussed the repeat of the book of Judges, a judge is a prime minister, and various things like that, timekeeping.

3729
02:53:42,700 --> 02:53:48,860
So, that's why I keep saying this seven-year period that started in the springtime, watch it very closely.

3730
02:53:49,040 --> 02:54:00,660
A three-and-a-half-year mark from now, or three-year mark from now, you'll have more things in place prophetically than have ever been put in place before.

3731
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:06,160
Have you paid any attention to Jordan Peterson today?

3732
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:07,820
No.

3733
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:08,440
Who is that?

3734
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:13,080
I kind of envy you.

3735
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:15,140
Yeah, innocence there.

3736
02:54:15,220 --> 02:54:19,440
Jordan Peterson is this very culturally influential figure now, suddenly.

3737
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:21,780
It started around spring of this year.

3738
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,920
I mean, it really peaked with his book, Twelve Rules to Live By, or whatever.

3739
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:40,880
But he came to prominence over the transgender issue, because he was a University of Toronto professor who refused to use the transgender pronouns if he was going to be legally obliged to use them, and this caused this huge controversy.

3740
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:55,000
And he went from being this university professor to having a huge YouTube following to, in this year with his book, becoming this massively famous public figure.

3741
02:54:55,180 --> 02:55:02,240
And one of the things he's been doing in the interim, that's why I bring him up, is he's been doing the psychology of the Bible lectures.

3742
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:11,040
So, he's been going through the Old Testament and interpreting it, Jungian psychology and apostasy, and you would love it.

3743
02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:22,380
It would fulfill your prophecy there, in terms of what you've talked about, this growing interest in scripture that's going to be all wrong, I suppose.

3744
02:55:23,360 --> 02:55:26,120
Yeah, you'll be looking in that direction, but it'll be a thought.

3745
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:30,700
It'll be like a jigsaw puzzle where you just open the box.

3746
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:31,360
There's no picture.

3747
02:55:31,360 --> 02:55:34,520
You have some picture on the outside, but nothing on the inside yet.

3748
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:41,320
I would say that's a pretty good description, Peter, from you, at least in terms of his religious endeavor, anyway, the rest of it.

3749
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:52,340
Yeah, I have discussed, thank you for bringing it up, but just to remind me as an update, I have said for many years now there'll be more interest in all things biblical.

3750
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:55,720
None of it will be accurate, but nonetheless the interest will be there.

3751
02:55:56,140 --> 02:56:04,800
There are plans for more biblical movies, and also there's a TV show about, guess the Bible verse, or I don't know, something, a Bible show, right?

3752
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:09,700
And there's another Bible family Christian thing they're putting on major TV.

3753
02:56:10,140 --> 02:56:14,540
None of it is accurate, but people are focusing on that.

3754
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:33,240
If there are more websites and YouTubes about Armageddon and the end of the world than ever, none of it, eventually people are going to get tired of it, and they're going to abandon the religious side of it, and there'll be an emergence of some truth enough for at least enough people to admit it, so then you'll go to the next level.

3755
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:39,580
Just like any legal action, you have to be competent.

3756
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:42,240
They ask you, do you understand the sentence?

3757
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:43,600
Do you understand the charges?

3758
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:45,340
You see, don't lead to that level.

3759
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:51,040
Well, you know, I mentioned that I almost considered, or had considered,

3760
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:55,580
converting to Christianity just in the last few months because of various factors,

3761
02:56:55,580 --> 02:57:01,180
but a big part of it was because of my journey into occultism,

3762
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,860
and emergence from occultism,

3763
02:57:03,020 --> 02:57:09,870
and just finding out how dark and satanic our culture is,

3764
02:57:09,890 --> 02:57:11,430
and how complicit I'd been with it,

3765
02:57:11,450 --> 02:57:14,690
it was a sort of natural tendency to want to find an antidote for that.

3766
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:26,370
But it also coincided with this increased ideological insanity, which is just denying basic biological and other kinds of facts.

3767
02:57:27,410 --> 02:57:41,070
Feeling the destabilization of that, wanting to find some sort of ground, and just recognizing like Christian doctrine and the Christian sensibility is relatively sane.

3768
02:57:41,510 --> 02:57:49,230
So it was almost like it was offering this refuge, like from the madness, you could take refuge in traditional religion.

3769
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:53,030
So I think that's happening on a mass scale now,

3770
02:57:53,030 --> 02:57:54,470
that's Jordan Peterson's appeal,

3771
02:57:54,610 --> 02:57:58,450
because he's confronting the ideological insanity, number one,

3772
02:57:58,550 --> 02:58:04,230
and then he's also addressing the spiritual vacuum at the center of people's lives,

3773
02:58:04,290 --> 02:58:07,630
like all these people are converting to Christianity because of him,

3774
02:58:07,650 --> 02:58:09,450
and he's not even really a Christian,

3775
02:58:09,630 --> 02:58:14,790
and he certainly isn't presenting Christian doctrine in any coherent fashion,

3776
02:58:14,990 --> 02:58:17,310
but people are so hungry and desperate,

3777
02:58:18,190 --> 02:58:21,330
so it takes a little nudge and they will go in that direction.

3778
02:58:22,130 --> 02:58:40,350
One of the things to look for is Bernoulli's principle, or you know in physics it's called F equals P over V, you know when you give an example of that force equals pressure over volume, when you let a balloon out into the room and it starts flying around, as it gets smaller it moves faster.

3779
02:58:41,130 --> 02:58:53,530
You see, if you remember the days of the railroad, right before they were replaced with the other modes of transportation, the railroad cars got really opulent, right at their end.

3780
02:58:54,550 --> 02:58:58,630
You see, the same with cruise ships, they got really super opulent.

3781
02:58:58,650 --> 02:58:59,870
You think cruise ships are opulent?

3782
02:58:59,950 --> 02:59:04,950
Now, no, they're just really large like floating cities, and they're packing people in there efficiently.

3783
02:59:05,130 --> 02:59:11,190
They're not as opulent as they were back in the day, you see, before they were as a major mode, you see.

3784
02:59:11,270 --> 02:59:18,930
One thing to notice is the level of opulence that is strived for right before a system goes under.

3785
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:28,710
So, even if there was a major push, even by the state, for mass conversion to Christianity, I would just laugh at it and say that just means they're finished.

3786
02:59:30,010 --> 02:59:31,090
For sure, you see.

3787
02:59:32,070 --> 02:59:48,390
Most people that don't know or are aware of these dynamics will say, oh, there are more people, I'm not saying you in this category at all, but I'm just stating as a counter aspect to what you mentioned, is that even though more people are converting towards it, for whatever reason, I'm telling you it's because it's coming to an end.

3788
02:59:51,070 --> 02:59:58,630
So, is it going to be a secular regime or whatever you would call it, prophesizing?

3789
02:59:59,130 --> 03:00:03,070
Well, what will happen is they're going to mull through various solutions.

3790
03:00:03,270 --> 03:00:17,410
In other words, you know, when things are comfortable, you know, you have a problem, but when the problem overrides the comfort, then you struggle and you consider the solutions to the problem more seriously, because now you're not in a comfort zone.

3791
03:00:17,410 --> 03:00:37,370
So, when the tensions in this world increase to the point that they're going to see that the systems that are in place, which, by the way, would work fine, but because no one knows what's written in their books, attorneys, judges, and all that, they're going to seek other, they're going to be inspired spiritually, divinely, to go back and look at the way ancient things were done.

3792
03:00:37,970 --> 03:00:48,190
And they're going to grab, for example, the scripture as an adherent, as a law form, and it's going to be applied and misapplied very drastically.

3793
03:00:49,130 --> 03:00:55,210
So, it will be divine on many levels, but it will be applied secularly, yeah.

3794
03:00:55,690 --> 03:01:01,010
But that'll still be with the heavy hand of the adversary, correct?

3795
03:01:01,750 --> 03:01:02,210
Correct.

3796
03:01:03,010 --> 03:01:07,490
And, by the way, people are, you know, those guys possessed by Satan.

3797
03:01:07,590 --> 03:01:16,250
Satan has never possessed anyone, not until this future, this single individual, who'll be the only person he's ever possessed.

3798
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:35,710
Now, I had a discussion before with Sam about Satan possessing Judas Iscariot for doing what he did, you see, but I have to go research how direct that was, because ultimately he did not, you know, he was released from that influence, you know.

3799
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:39,210
And, for example, you have oppression and possession.

3800
03:01:40,010 --> 03:01:47,010
Like, for example, in the book of Eob or Job, he was oppressed by Satan and other demons, right?

3801
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:53,990
Basically, Satan sent various demons to him, because, you know, the various afflictions he had was done by various...

3802
03:01:53,990 --> 03:01:58,130
You know, a general doesn't have to go on the front line and shoot at the enemy.

3803
03:01:58,370 --> 03:01:59,830
He gets the infantry to do it.

3804
03:02:01,530 --> 03:02:05,350
But, again, where was it with the secular aspect?

3805
03:02:06,650 --> 03:02:13,350
It's not until much later that the more spiritual aspect is manifest.

3806
03:02:14,750 --> 03:02:20,310
So, and I have said this before, all of these things are going to be done in secret.

3807
03:02:20,850 --> 03:02:31,810
In other words, the modalities of fashion, trends, the things that people are used to seeing will seamlessly, the current society will seamlessly fold into the next one.

3808
03:02:33,250 --> 03:02:41,810
You know, as I've said before many times, again, Scripture is so prevalent, anyone has access to it, even the piss-poor version.

3809
03:02:41,970 --> 03:02:44,930
If you do it with comprehension, you'll get something out of it.

3810
03:02:45,090 --> 03:02:51,350
And if these things are going to be so blatantly happening, majority of the people who do comprehend it will cry foul.

3811
03:02:51,950 --> 03:03:00,070
So I'm suggesting, if not emphatically, more than suggesting, is that the identity of all these things that are going to be happening are going to be in secret.

3812
03:03:00,610 --> 03:03:03,690
So you might have a young world leader who might be of

3813
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:06,210
quote-unquote Jewish or Judean descent,

3814
03:03:07,070 --> 03:03:09,130
and not unless you're in the inner circles

3815
03:03:09,130 --> 03:03:12,310
you know that he had lost the use of his arm and his eye,

3816
03:03:13,090 --> 03:03:15,870
or not unless you know someone on the inside

3817
03:03:16,410 --> 03:03:19,130
to admit to you that yes, he really is not Judean,

3818
03:03:19,230 --> 03:03:20,710
he's of Assyrian extraction,

3819
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:24,050
because the public figure will be extremely different

3820
03:03:24,050 --> 03:03:26,190
from what is really going on.

3821
03:03:27,890 --> 03:03:35,090
An example would be, if you read in Exodus, when Moses was going to Pharaoh, I'm telling you, that was extremely private.

3822
03:03:35,230 --> 03:03:38,710
The people in the land did not know the interchanges that were going on.

3823
03:03:39,290 --> 03:03:44,310
Moses would go and speak to Pharaoh, and it would be on YouTube 20 minutes later?

3824
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:44,890
No.

3825
03:03:45,930 --> 03:03:50,810
These were all very private exchanges with Pharaoh, for example, and his court.

3826
03:03:51,350 --> 03:03:53,450
People didn't know what was going on.

3827
03:03:53,830 --> 03:03:54,330
At all.

3828
03:03:55,250 --> 03:03:56,230
There's no hint of that.

3829
03:03:57,790 --> 03:03:58,110
You see?

3830
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:18,120
You know, that's why people that believe or have information, okay, you have the information or whatever, but have you structured it in your own mind to see how it will pan out or how it will roll out in the reality that you know, the reality that you live in?

3831
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:24,600
And most people say, no, I just read this, I know this is going to be like this, yeah, but how does that compare to your reality?

3832
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:26,400
You can't see that happening, right?

3833
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:26,840
No way.

3834
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:28,540
Well then, how can it happen?

3835
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:35,320
That's why I'm telling you that the majority of the stuff that you read about in Scripture is totally in secret.

3836
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:41,320
If this society is going to unfold or fold into the next one quite neatly, so be aware.

3837
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:43,580
I think Scripture even gives the warning.

3838
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:46,600
It says even the very elect might be deceived.

3839
03:04:47,320 --> 03:04:48,700
That's why very often...

3840
03:04:48,700 --> 03:04:49,460
If it were possible.

3841
03:04:50,140 --> 03:04:51,200
If it were possible.

3842
03:04:51,340 --> 03:04:57,080
That's why, you know, I tell people if I were to go and bet, everyone that I know will fall for it.

3843
03:04:57,380 --> 03:04:59,840
It will be a sure bet right now as it stands.

3844
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:02,080
That's how strong the delusion will be.

3845
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:06,300
That's how, you know, because let's say you know someone who wants to be lawful, right?

3846
03:05:07,320 --> 03:05:09,920
You know, you heard somebody say, well law hasn't been done away with.

3847
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:13,780
You start, you know, wearing single fiber clothing.

3848
03:05:14,020 --> 03:05:20,820
You change the way you keep time and the days you adhere to and how you eat and you know more about the gods.

3849
03:05:20,900 --> 03:05:23,320
And all of a sudden, the state and everybody rises.

3850
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:24,760
Oh, now we're going to be doing this.

3851
03:05:24,820 --> 03:05:30,300
You're going to be so happy that the society is now saying no more mixed fiber.

3852
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:30,900
You see what I mean?

3853
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:32,320
You're going to fall for it.

3854
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:34,740
You know, how could it be, you know, you see what I mean?

3855
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:35,860
How easy it is to...

3856
03:05:36,500 --> 03:05:37,200
I suppose.

3857
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:40,140
I can't see myself falling for that.

3858
03:05:40,740 --> 03:05:41,220
Well, good.

3859
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:52,080
As in, you know, I can't see myself believing anything that the state does or anything that's happening on that scale as being a delusion or a deception.

3860
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:54,440
But who knows?

3861
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:55,620
Never say never, right?

3862
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:56,380
Right.

3863
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:58,020
That's why you always have to be...

3864
03:05:58,020 --> 03:06:00,140
There's a metaphor about the thief in the night.

3865
03:06:00,940 --> 03:06:02,820
If you know he's coming, guess what?

3866
03:06:03,440 --> 03:06:04,600
You're not going to sleep.

3867
03:06:05,640 --> 03:06:07,700
As comfortably as the rest who don't know.

3868
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,820
It's much worse to know that he's coming and you do fall asleep, right?

3869
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:18,320
So there's an old Buddhist saying, once you're awake and you can't go back to sleep.

3870
03:06:21,430 --> 03:06:24,370
So you have to learn how to sleep all over again, you see?

3871
03:06:25,010 --> 03:06:28,330
In other words, that's a way of saying now you have to find comfort in other ways.

3872
03:06:29,590 --> 03:06:33,430
And while you're looking for those comforts in other ways, you're pretty darn uncomfortable.

3873
03:06:33,810 --> 03:06:37,230
But when you find them, you'll see that that's really part of the reward.

3874
03:06:41,370 --> 03:06:43,610
Okay, we've been on for about three hours or so.

3875
03:06:43,730 --> 03:06:45,490
We're burning the bites pretty good here.

3876
03:06:45,910 --> 03:06:49,030
Yeah, I was just thinking that was a very good night to end on.

3877
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:50,630
Good.

3878
03:06:51,010 --> 03:06:52,250
Appreciate you coming by.

3879
03:06:52,370 --> 03:06:53,310
Bruce, anything else?

3880
03:06:54,130 --> 03:06:55,950
No, just a few things.

3881
03:06:56,050 --> 03:07:02,190
There were questions in the chat, but we're very engulfed in what we're talking about.

3882
03:07:02,350 --> 03:07:03,730
Anything you want to address quickly?

3883
03:07:03,730 --> 03:07:10,690
I was going to, I promised Nicole, you spoke about the seeds before in chat.

3884
03:07:10,870 --> 03:07:11,110
Yes.

3885
03:07:11,630 --> 03:07:16,870
And she was hoping that maybe you could give a little more information on that.

3886
03:07:17,330 --> 03:07:24,670
Simply put, I'm presuming, you know, by the way, Nicole could call in on the regular phone as well.

3887
03:07:24,670 --> 03:07:28,990
Yeah, I have that offer in the channel and anybody is welcome.

3888
03:07:29,830 --> 03:07:37,970
Right, but we're going to, at three hours, we've gone longer, but actually a few years ago, I did a 14-hour stream once.

3889
03:07:38,090 --> 03:07:41,270
That wasn't a stream, it was a recorded thing of 14 hours.

3890
03:07:43,190 --> 03:07:48,050
I got a four terabyte hard drive on this bad boy, so we can go as long as we want.

3891
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:52,930
Okay, but I'm presuming she's not doing it on a commercial level.

3892
03:07:53,390 --> 03:08:02,130
So in that case, I would just get a metal box, like the holiday cookie tins, right?

3893
03:08:02,210 --> 03:08:02,350
Yeah.

3894
03:08:02,990 --> 03:08:09,250
Yeah, those rust, especially if they rust easily, that's, you know, they're not coated with lacquer too much, those are fine.

3895
03:08:09,550 --> 03:08:15,470
Go ahead and put it in a paper, put your seeds in there, in the center, because you want to keep them out of the corners.

3896
03:08:16,810 --> 03:08:22,650
Corners are a place that focuses unusual things when it comes to this kind of, you get mixed results.

3897
03:08:22,750 --> 03:08:32,710
So keep it in the center of the box by using tissue paper or whatever, and put that in a paper bag, and then put that in a metal cabinet, which is like an oven.

3898
03:08:32,970 --> 03:08:39,650
But you're not using, so now you've got various layers of metal and non-metal for at least three days to a week.

3899
03:08:40,190 --> 03:08:49,570
And then when you sprout, you'll notice, if you do a control, ones that were in the box and ones that weren't, the ones that were in the box will sprout and be faster, use less water, be more robust.

3900
03:08:50,270 --> 03:09:10,530
Now, if you really want to go to the next level with that, you can take the south pole of a magnet, as long as you avoid the center, which is the opposite, and just leave the seeds on the south pole a small amount, or a magnetic array, and when I say the magnetic array, the magnet should be spaced far apart, that one doesn't attract or repel the other.

3901
03:09:11,910 --> 03:09:17,950
And when you do that array, put the seeds for at least 20 minutes on the magnet, and that will charge the seed.

3902
03:09:18,390 --> 03:09:19,590
It has to be the south pole.

3903
03:09:20,330 --> 03:09:34,490
Now, the south pole is, if you have a compass, the magnetic, the red part of the compass that goes to the north will point to the south, you see, because the northern part of the, that's the south pole, the compass points to the south magnetic of the earth, right?

3904
03:09:35,330 --> 03:09:41,930
And the reason, the difference between the south pole and the north pole is one is compressive, one is expansive, you want to be on the expansive side.

3905
03:09:42,770 --> 03:10:01,430
There were studies done years ago, this was, there's a guy, there's a tattooed bald-headed freak on YouTube, you can tell him I said this, he doesn't mind, Ken Wheeler, you can look up his stuff on YouTube, he's probably one of the only people in the world, if not the only person in the world, to completely justify and rationalize what a magnetic field is.

3906
03:10:01,970 --> 03:10:15,230
I appreciate him very much because I've been asking the same questions that he's answered for years, and been able to work with magnetism because of the rational approach that I had, but Ken Wheeler does experiments with sprouts, again, on the south pole of the magnet.

3907
03:10:15,350 --> 03:10:26,230
He's not very good at telling you how to do it, even though he shows it to you, you're going to have to use, you're going to have to be very careful about what he says, don't misinterpret it, be a very good listener.

3908
03:10:27,750 --> 03:10:43,850
When he tells you to put the seeds against the south part of the magnet, it's the edge of the magnet, not the center of the south pole, just like for years I've been doing demonstrations about the, you know, the same faces that repel, they actually don't, if you could get them to stick together.

3909
03:10:45,330 --> 03:10:56,710
So, nonetheless, the south pole of the magnet, the magnetic south, which is what the northern compass, the red part of the compass will point to, expose the seeds to that.

3910
03:10:57,370 --> 03:11:03,350
Ken says 20 minutes, I say 12 hours, and you will get a pretty robust manifestation.

3911
03:11:06,520 --> 03:11:15,460
The other thing is, if you're going to use water to water the seeds, you treat the water the same way you would treat drinking water, and I've gone through that before, I don't need to go through it again.

3912
03:11:15,940 --> 03:11:22,420
Keep it in the dark and make sure that the water goes down to at least 4 degrees Celsius or 39 Fahrenheit for a few hours.

3913
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:23,560
Right.

3914
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:27,800
Do you eat sprouted greens yourself?

3915
03:11:28,720 --> 03:11:29,580
Sure, sure.

3916
03:11:29,720 --> 03:11:41,040
The best way to do, by the way, legumes, lentils, any kind of bean or whatever, is to soak it almost to a pre-sprouted condition where the little eye of the bean changes color, right?

3917
03:11:41,860 --> 03:11:52,060
Right, pre-sprouted condition is where it has its most nutrition, because now you've activated all the latent potential energy, you know.

3918
03:11:52,260 --> 03:11:52,800
Good to know.

3919
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:56,380
Yeah, and I think I've gotten into how to cook beans and other things.

3920
03:11:56,620 --> 03:12:06,860
Maybe the next time, the next week, what they call Tuesday night, we'll get into a food discussion just to supplement the prior food discussions, and I'll maybe cover everything from the beginning.

3921
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:07,660
What do you think?

3922
03:12:07,700 --> 03:12:08,120
Very well.

3923
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:08,500
Yes.

3924
03:12:08,860 --> 03:12:09,140
Yes.

3925
03:12:10,320 --> 03:12:18,340
And by the way, anyone keeping time, counting days, we're just about on the Feast of Weeks, what's called Pentecost, coming up here soon.

3926
03:12:18,980 --> 03:12:26,580
It's not, by the way, what the Christians say, 50 days after the Sabbath, that puts you in the middle of spring.

3927
03:12:27,700 --> 03:12:33,060
The Feast of Weeks, or the Pentecost, is not a mid-spring festival, it's a mid-summer festival.

3928
03:12:33,620 --> 03:12:44,940
So, you count seven Sabbaths and 49 plus one day, or 50 days, so that's roughly 100 some odd days since what's called the Week of Unleavened Bread, not the Passover, right?

3929
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:45,620
Right.

3930
03:12:45,620 --> 03:12:48,060
And so, it puts it as a mid-summer feast.

3931
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:54,340
That's why, if you read in Scripture, the offerings that were done during the Feast of Weeks are clearly mid-summer offerings.

3932
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:58,300
Grapes and other things like that, you know, are growing.

3933
03:12:58,620 --> 03:13:05,040
I mean, I have a vineyard, what do you call it, a vineyard, another vineyard, a harbor with grapes.

3934
03:13:05,120 --> 03:13:09,160
I have grapes right now that are ready to eat and various other things.

3935
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:11,200
So, yeah, it's another misnomer.

3936
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:21,680
And also, if the Christ was on earth for 40 plus days, and the Pentecost was just a few days after that, why did, you know, when he ascended, why did he say, wait now, we'll bring to you, come to you later?

3937
03:13:22,320 --> 03:13:24,220
They would have just said a few days later was Pentecost.

3938
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:25,360
It's not like that at all.

3939
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:26,580
It was a big gap of time.

3940
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:28,980
It was mid-summer when Pentecost came.

3941
03:13:29,860 --> 03:13:34,040
So, anyway, I don't even like calling it Pentecost because it's 50 count, literally.

3942
03:13:34,380 --> 03:13:35,620
It's not a 50 count.

3943
03:13:35,720 --> 03:13:37,940
It's a seven Sabbaths and a 50 count.

3944
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:42,080
So, anyway, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

3945
03:13:46,410 --> 03:13:52,630
So, if anyone's counting, it's usually around the longest day of the year, what they call the Feast of Weeks.

3946
03:13:52,730 --> 03:13:54,230
Yeah, and it's coming around now.

3947
03:13:55,450 --> 03:13:59,050
I'm counting, I think it's this week.

3948
03:13:59,410 --> 03:14:03,970
Yeah, we're coming up on about six to five seconds longer.

3949
03:14:04,130 --> 03:14:07,850
So, we're coming very, very close where it's going to balance out or something, yeah.

3950
03:14:07,850 --> 03:14:22,550
So, if anyone has a day count on that, I, sadly enough to say, I lost count a few weeks ago, but if I go back, I know when the Sabbaths were and I know when the Passover was, and I know when the Week of Unleavened Bread ended.

3951
03:14:22,630 --> 03:14:23,950
I could figure that out.

3952
03:14:24,150 --> 03:14:25,330
I think it's right about now.

3953
03:14:25,510 --> 03:14:32,070
So, usually, it's interesting when I've observed it more accurately in the past, it always comes right after the Sabbath.

3954
03:14:32,370 --> 03:14:35,210
So, if it's not today or tomorrow, it's next week.

3955
03:14:35,210 --> 03:14:38,830
Well, we're at the 23rd of the farz, so.

3956
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:45,190
Yes, no, but the count is seven Sabbaths and 50 days, right?

3957
03:14:45,370 --> 03:14:45,550
Right, correct.

3958
03:14:45,670 --> 03:14:47,370
Yeah, so, yeah.

3959
03:14:48,050 --> 03:14:49,270
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in.

3960
03:14:49,310 --> 03:14:53,190
You know, I'm not one to tell people what to do, how to do, or whatever.

3961
03:14:53,350 --> 03:14:58,210
I mean, you know, I don't do pork on my fork and various other things, right?

3962
03:14:58,250 --> 03:14:59,470
But I keep that to myself.

3963
03:15:00,250 --> 03:15:06,970
I don't ever tell anyone to, but don't be a dick and say the law is done away with.

3964
03:15:07,230 --> 03:15:09,170
You know, that's a real asshole perspective.

3965
03:15:09,370 --> 03:15:09,650
It's not.

3966
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:14,270
It's what is it done away with for you is a different thing, you know?

3967
03:15:14,410 --> 03:15:15,350
And that's why I never.

3968
03:15:15,810 --> 03:15:18,270
You'll never hear me say, go read script, you read the Bible.

3969
03:15:18,430 --> 03:15:19,170
You'll never hear me.

3970
03:15:19,270 --> 03:15:21,290
You have to do the law because of...

3971
03:15:22,130 --> 03:15:22,530
Never.

3972
03:15:22,930 --> 03:15:23,190
Right, right.

3973
03:15:23,230 --> 03:15:23,810
It's up to you.

3974
03:15:24,230 --> 03:15:27,350
And what I'm doing is making people aware of another way.

3975
03:15:27,990 --> 03:15:28,690
And that's up to you.

3976
03:15:29,190 --> 03:15:29,950
Yep, yep.

3977
03:15:30,350 --> 03:15:32,230
All right.

3978
03:15:32,230 --> 03:15:33,310
Check that out yourself.

3979
03:15:35,410 --> 03:15:37,110
Don't take our word for anything.

3980
03:15:39,670 --> 03:15:42,390
Last thing I want to do is put someone on a path of futility.

3981
03:15:43,030 --> 03:15:43,750
Right, right.

3982
03:15:43,850 --> 03:15:50,810
Well, I don't say it much, but if you're not chosen to do this, you're not going to be able to do it.

3983
03:15:50,970 --> 03:15:51,210
Sorry.

3984
03:15:52,090 --> 03:15:52,550
I'm not now.

3985
03:15:52,990 --> 03:15:54,290
So as a Greek, are you chosen?

3986
03:15:54,410 --> 03:15:55,530
I said, well, what do you say I am?

3987
03:15:56,710 --> 03:15:57,170
I can't.

3988
03:15:57,230 --> 03:15:58,490
No one can say they're chosen, right?

3989
03:15:58,490 --> 03:15:59,490
Because you really don't know.

3990
03:15:59,870 --> 03:16:03,410
But what we do know is that if you're not chosen to do it, you're not going to be able to.

3991
03:16:03,970 --> 03:16:05,330
It's kind of like one of those open...

3992
03:16:06,170 --> 03:16:08,690
That's where the mysticism comes in, which I avoid.

3993
03:16:14,140 --> 03:16:15,220
Publicly, at least, you know.

3994
03:16:16,720 --> 03:16:17,260
All right.

3995
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:21,000
So in terms of the teeth, yeah, they're just little baby plants.

3996
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:24,040
And we'll get into that more next week.

3997
03:16:24,580 --> 03:16:25,120
Okay, Greg.

3998
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,640
Well, thanks for the call.

3999
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:28,300
Yep.

4000
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:29,060
Yeah.

4001
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:29,540
Thank you.

4002
03:16:29,780 --> 03:16:30,020
Thanks.

4003
03:16:30,820 --> 03:16:31,180
Great.

4004
03:16:31,580 --> 03:16:32,320
All right.

4005
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:32,860
Yes.

4006
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:35,460
Okay.

4007
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:36,780
We'll do it again next week.

4008
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:37,920
We'll be here around the same time.

4009
03:16:38,460 --> 03:16:38,720
Okay.

4010
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:39,060
Thanks.

4011
03:16:39,220 --> 03:16:41,060
You have a good night.

4012
03:16:41,400 --> 03:16:42,100
Both of you.

4013
03:16:42,440 --> 03:16:42,820
Be well.

4014
03:16:43,220 --> 03:16:43,420
All right.

4015
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:43,980
Bye.

4016
03:16:44,420 --> 03:16:45,400
And good night, folks.
