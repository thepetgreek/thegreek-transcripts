1
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,020
Greetings everyone.

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:30,780
And we have Bruce as usual and the Greek as usual and we have a caller and a guest, I guess, to some extent, have you noticed?

3
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,340
And the floor is yours.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,400
Where do you want to take us?

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:35,960
Yeah.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:36,880
Yeah.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,020
You're speaking to me, right?

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:40,760
Yes.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,580
Yeah.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,240
Yeah.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,480
I'd like to speak up where you and I left off maybe a little over a year and a year ago.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,480
On the radio.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:03,500
On AFR where I had called in about the dreams and how your dreams are not your own and your actual thoughts are not your own.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,540
Right.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:13,520
And that's a hard thing, issue for people to think about or even consider.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,260
Yeah.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,220
But you've got to realize people have been, I won't interrupt you much because you've got a lot to say.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:36,020
When you meet people or talk to people, other than being, you know, whatever, living creatures, they are subject to thousands of years of conditioning, not just in their own formative years in their own lives, but thousands of years.

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,180
So I just want to put that up.

21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:48,540
This is what you're witnessing when you hold up what you hear on the sonic events to what other people think, what they think is product of thousands of years of conditioning.

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,840
So I just want to bring that up.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,300
Yes.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,740
Yes.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,720
Yes.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,900
I've talked to a young girl.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,720
She's in her early 30s.

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:11,080
I had spoken to her about dreams and she had also been affected by dreams, thoughts, nightmares, etc.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:21,140
I think as a lot of people have in their life and she got to thinking about it and talked to me and she said, you know, I think you're right.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:32,740
And she was, she came off of work one day and called me and said that someone had said, oh, I had a dream about you and your son.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,160
And she said, no, please don't tell me.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,440
I'd rather not hear that.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,480
And I thought, great, great.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,240
You know, if you can get through to one person, it's a help.

35
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,790
Yeah, that's what I said for a while.

36
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,610
But you get over it real quick and you realize you just go right back to where you were.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,410
You know, you're around people that are unresponsive to the truth.

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,410
Yeah.

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,030
So it is rewarding to help one person.

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,910
I agree.

41
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,790
But then you just go right back to what the hell am I doing here?

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,470
Well, I know, but what are we doing?

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,570
You know, I mean, we say that, but...

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,870
Yeah, taking up time.

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:34,330
Taking up time, but, you know, we're learning these new things at the very end of the experience or the...

46
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,050
Existence, yeah.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,850
Existence.

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,150
We're coming through.

49
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,870
You know, let me just throw something in that might be helpful because you brought up the dreams and all that.

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,870
A couple of things.

51
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,850
One thing is when I studied the ancient writs, it never mentioned anything about dreams being your own.

52
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,270
You know, sourced from your own or having any meaning on their own.

53
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,930
They were always, let's say, documented or recorded and reported as being a message from the other side.

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,550
And, you know, of course, it's not like what they call the dollar bill God.

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,250
There is no God.

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,110
It's the gods and they go all the way from the king to the street sweeper.

57
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:19,250
And on their side, they also have their nut jobs and they're homeless looking people and they're, you know, see?

58
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,130
It's just like human culture in a way.

59
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,170
But not just like it because they're, you know, they're gods.

60
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,490
So I started discounting the cultural aspect of, you know, like the pagans love dream interpretation.

61
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,150
They take it very seriously and they've taken it out of context.

62
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,750
So I started discounting all the dream stuff and I realized what the simplicity is.

63
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:54,410
If we're being plugged with an image and a variation of, let's say, animation experiences while we're sleeping by a spiritual being, then you have to say, well, do I want that?

64
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,150
Or, you know, do I want that in my life or do I not want it in my life?

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,990
So you start going through basic what I call scientific experimentation.

66
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,910
I'd like to not have it, you know, see if I can control it, right?

67
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,290
And then, of course, if they're malevolent, which is the second point I want to bring up.

68
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:20,630
Working with someone right now for a few months who has a child and they got really...

69
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,690
The child was having night terrors or what they call night terrors, really bad dreams and they couldn't remember them.

70
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,470
And the person got a little aggressive.

71
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,110
He started screaming and doing the usual, you know, clearing the space by claiming the space in a way.

72
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,290
But they got worse after a while.

73
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,250
It stopped for a while, then it came back and it got worse.

74
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,550
So what they did, obviously, is they sent a more powerful demon, you know?

75
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,270
So instead of just the scumbag in the Navy, right?

76
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,650
The scumbag is the low guy.

77
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,750
They sent more of a sergeant type.

78
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,770
So what happened there was a reach out to, what do you do next?

79
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,910
They said, well, this is still susceptible.

80
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,250
You know how you see in the cartoons the elephant is afraid of the mouse, right?

81
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:21,650
So not a sense of the demon being afraid, but I know that environmental rhythmic actions like playing instruments or music or leaving a radio on low or a TV set down low in the background.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,430
A TV, preferably not.

83
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,270
Just a radio is enough to distract them.

84
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,530
And that's been going on now for two months and they report back.

85
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,610
He reports back every month that everything's fine.

86
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,450
Wonderful.

87
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,470
Yeah, because the other stuff didn't work.

88
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,690
He got a little too aggressive, also overzealous.

89
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,670
So just to throw that out there, this is, what do you call it, therapy?

90
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,510
When you start realizing what reality is, when you start applying it, it's a form of therapy.

91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:56,750
It is a therapy because you can't let it go if you know it.

92
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,550
That you know that it's true, you have to apply it.

93
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,890
And that's the therapy.

94
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,230
If you're responsible enough to, yeah.

95
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,330
That's the therapy.

96
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,230
Yeah.

97
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,710
So the dream aspect, there's many other things, by the way.

98
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,530
The problem that I've seen with discussing it is clarity and confidence.

99
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,590
Most people still, you know, they might hear like some Greek speak or something and apply it.

100
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:33,430
Then they listen to other stuff and they don't know how to discern the other stuff to see whether it's contradicting or, you know, compatible.

101
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,970
And they try to do that even though it's not compatible and then things fall apart.

102
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,670
The reason why I want to bring this up, I recently got, recently, like three months ago, someone was communicating with me who was studying demonology.

103
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:57,050
But not demonology in a sense like Satanism, but it's a field, it's called demonology where you study the spiritual world and how people are possessed and oppressed and all that.

104
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:11,510
And this person, even though they were studying this for, I'd say, maybe two decades, they still think, they've mixed like the religious mythology, like when you die, you go somewhere and you have another existence.

105
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,410
They still believe that, you know, they don't know.

106
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:28,470
In other words, even though I say they're still being fooled because they think when they see a ghost of someone who's died, it's really the person that died, they still don't know that it was a demon playing a joke on them or a prank on them, right?

107
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:36,669
And they don't think that they can go and communicate this with other people that they're studying because it goes so contrary to what they've been taught, you see.

108
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:45,350
And this person has been involved with, which is very rare, by the way, for someone to be possessed, it's a very rare thing.

109
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,230
But very common is oppression.

110
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,330
Possession is when a spirit takes over the body and the person goes into disanimation.

111
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,070
So let's say someone is possessed by a being for a week.

112
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,490
When they come out of it, they don't remember anything, right?

113
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,710
Oppression is different.

114
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,050
Oppression is still external input and they're just basically oppressing you.

115
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,830
It's like someone, you know, putting itching powder on you and swapping you around constantly.

116
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,550
And that's what most people are experiencing.

117
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,150
And that's why, let me just tie this all together.

118
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,990
Dreaming is a form of spiritual oppression, okay?

119
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,830
It's a form of oppression.

120
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,810
Yes, it is.

121
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:33,190
Even when you think it's a pleasant dream, on the other side, they're laughing their ass off that they got you to believe it.

122
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,270
So, yeah.

123
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,830
And then you can't sleep well, obviously.

124
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,350
Well, you let it in, you let it happen.

125
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,610
Well, if you let it in, you have no choice.

126
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:55,650
But if you relax about it and you don't, you know, no control, what happens then is you...

127
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,330
What is it when you allow yourself to be manipulated?

128
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,530
Gullible, naive?

129
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,230
Gullible, yeah.

130
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,470
You know, I was just going to ask you, Greek.

131
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,530
What about those people...

132
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,410
Did you ever catch yourself where you knew you were asleep but yet you're awake enough to know that you're asleep?

133
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,670
That's possible as well.

134
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,270
Yeah.

135
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,050
But that's the switch.

136
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,270
That's just like a different, like a very relaxed state.

137
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:30,270
Actually, I've been trying to be in that state for the past decades because I don't want to be too awake in this shithole of a society.

138
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,930
But anyway, yeah.

139
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,790
You can control your dreams and yet not have any.

140
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:54,530
And those also that are in your home, children that are in your home, that is going very well.

141
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,450
They have not had any problem or issues since.

142
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,750
As you had stated, they'll try to come in, you know.

143
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,890
You might remember a little snippet that you disregarded and you deal with it when you wake up.

144
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,670
Right.

145
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,710
Because they don't stop.

146
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:24,730
They, at some point, you know, they come back or try to...

147
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,610
Well, they're hypersensitive to our behavior and our thoughts.

148
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,290
But they can't read your mind.

149
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,450
For a while back, I'll just give a little bit of a document.

150
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,710
Let's just give a little sonic on...

151
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,250
I've experimented with this.

152
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,890
I've thought of things and asked for a dream and did not get it.

153
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:53,710
And then I actually try to manifest things by writing them down, you know, like going to the Bahamas or going online and researching that.

154
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,170
And then I would ask for a dream and they would actually give me a dream of that, you see.

155
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,110
So, what I'm saying is they can't do your thoughts but they can do what you manifest.

156
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:12,450
Like, if you pick up a magazine and see a picture of a green ice cream truck, they know that you're doing that.

157
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,790
And they also have a hive mentality.

158
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:35,930
Anywhere in the world one can communicate about anybody else, you know, so if they want to pick on you about your great-grandfather or your grandfather that you knew as a child, the one that wants to give you the dream will put out a call and say, any of you guys know we're around when this guy's grandfather was alive and give me that image so I could plug him with it, right?

159
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,550
So, it's not always what I mean by that.

160
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,830
They can't read your mind and it's not always the same spirit.

161
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,350
And I noticed the flavor of the dream changes.

162
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,930
And after a while I was like, I'm going to stop having these dreams.

163
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,170
And they stop.

164
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,510
And occasionally when they do try to bring on a dream, I'm like, I'm not having it, sorry.

165
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,970
And it goes away.

166
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:55,810
Yeah.

167
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,550
I have control of it because it takes, we want to call it a martial art or a form of discipline, you know.

168
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,930
Yeah, something you have to work at.

169
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,650
Yeah, and it can't be done, it should not be done silently.

170
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,610
It should be manifested either with a pen and paper or verbally, yeah.

171
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,970
Because they don't read your mind.

172
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:26,450
Now, I'm not going to go out on a limb and speak about other things because there are ones that can read your mind and those are not the lower ones that are the typical dream makers.

173
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,610
That is from the very, very high office.

174
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,510
Only the office of the most high can read your mind.

175
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,650
And that's stated in scripture.

176
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,250
He knows what's on the minds and the hearts of man.

177
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,190
Yeah.

178
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,110
Where the other ones don't.

179
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,190
And with that, my interactions on that level, I keep private for several reasons.

180
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,270
Okay.

181
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:58,930
So, for instance, within a family, group, would you say that the emotions play a part in dreams?

182
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:14,310
The emotions, the interactions of, say, a family together or a group together, of course they know what's going on and they can play on that as well.

183
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,390
Oh, yeah.

184
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,150
You mean because they're out, yeah.

185
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,290
In other words, the emotions are part of the communicative display.

186
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,290
Oh, yeah.

187
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:35,990
And they'll weaken some and strengthen others depending on, just like people if they want to keep an argument going or instigate something or just make the whole group depressed or whatever.

188
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,950
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,910
They're just like people.

190
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,190
In other words, when I say just like people, they're not because they're not physical corporeal entities.

191
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,890
What they are is their motherboard, their wiring is just like ours.

192
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,830
But they don't need a body to animate.

193
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,250
Well, we do.

194
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,190
So when we lose the body, we go into disanimation.

195
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:09,330
You know, like someone asked, you know, this is like a Jack Fresco thing, I'm glad he said this, and I used to say it a long time ago, and I'm glad that Jack Fresco brought it up.

196
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,890
When people ask you or anyone what happens after you die, it's like, what were you thinking about 500 years ago?

197
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,730
That's exactly what happens after you die.

198
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:26,410
And there's still a lot of people going out in the world saying, oh, I died and I saw myself on the operating table.

199
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:26,930
No, you didn't.

200
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,330
You didn't die because if you died, you wouldn't be here to tell us.

201
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,130
Yeah.

202
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:48,390
Yeah, I read an article the other day about, oh, when people have trouble after they're possessed, their souls are, the souls are coming back, they're inanimated souls, but that's not true.

203
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,810
The spirits, yeah, yeah.

204
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,390
Yeah, the spirits.

205
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,290
The soul is the breath, yeah.

206
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,250
Well, they can't even get the terminology.

207
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,530
Yeah, they use the wrong words.

208
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,690
They use the word soul.

209
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,390
Yeah, they don't even know.

210
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:06,790
Yeah, I actually spoke to a young Greek woman several months ago and, you know, I was asking her this about the soul and spirit.

211
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,350
Oh, she said, oh, yeah, when you die, you lose your spirit, you know.

212
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,870
Oh, wow.

213
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,550
Yeah, and she should know better.

214
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,270
Well, she's human, right?

215
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,590
Your average surface-dwelling person, they come in all flavors, Russian, Greek, Irish, Italian, German.

216
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,030
You know, they come in all flavors, but they're the, you know, ice cream.

217
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,010
Yeah.

218
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:37,050
I'm sorry to say it that way, but there's been a conspiracy a long time ago to make sure that communication is inaccurate.

219
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:56,670
This was done for, actually in the beginning it was done as a protection mechanism, and then it became a control mechanism, and then it grew as a control mechanism and a protection mechanism, and right now it's so ingrained that, like I said, most people are unrehabilitatable.

220
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,950
They're ready for the scrapyard.

221
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,030
They have to be recycled.

222
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,910
You can't fix them.

223
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,869
And I had, still I have people saying, well, they're people.

224
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,810
How could you say that?

225
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,670
I'm like, well, what kind of an emotional bullshit are you caught up in?

226
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,089
You know, they can't rationalize that.

227
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,069
And on the other hand, I've never discussed the concept of slavery much.

228
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm glad, you know, I posted some Dimitri Calswell of YouTube recently.

229
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,589
He talked about the sovereign state and how you enslave people by creating a state that they sign up to as property.

230
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:37,250
And if you read Scripture, slavery is a legal condition, and it is lawful, but what they're doing, most slaves in the ancient world, if you ask them their status, they tell you I'm a slave or not.

231
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,350
Now most people think they're free, but they're actually enslaved legally.

232
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,370
So whether they know it or not, it doesn't matter.

233
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:52,890
But I'll tell you, lawfully, you can do to a slave, a human being, the same thing you could do to a chair or a refrigerator or a car.

234
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,830
It's not criminal to do that.

235
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,130
Now, it depends.

236
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,910
Now, there are laws regarding that.

237
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,850
There is a level of criminality that can be achieved.

238
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,550
But you can kill a slave as your property or for financial reasons, and it's totally, you know, acceptable, right?

239
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,350
Yes, and it's all in Scripture.

240
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,910
Yeah, it's in Scripture.

241
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:20,070
There are a couple of laws that have fine points about beating them, and, you know, if you beat them and they lose a tooth, you let them go.

242
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,230
If you lose an eye, you let them go, and all these other things, right?

243
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:35,910
So what people don't understand, that's why I brought up police brutality, that is, once you get brutality in a society, whether it's police or whatever, that never diminishes.

244
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,990
It gets worse and worse until the society collapses.

245
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,710
Yes.

246
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,390
So in America, where you see police brutality going up, it's not going to get better.

247
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,110
It's going to get worse and worse until the society collapses.

248
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:54,310
And when I mean collapses, I mean, like, you know, the buildings don't have roofs, and there are very few people around, and there's no power and no water running.

249
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,930
You know, I mean, total collapse.

250
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,070
And no police and everyone.

251
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,630
And no people.

252
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,090
Yeah.

253
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,890
But no people to form a society as you know it.

254
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,950
There's still a few people.

255
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:12,610
But you can go fly over the Amazon or the Congo, and it doesn't look like there are any people down there, but if you go down there, walk around for a few days, you'll run into some people.

256
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,830
Like that, right?

257
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:30,350
So what the, quote-unquote, the state, the corporate state is doing, is lawful, by the way, to a certain degree, because you're a slave, evidenced by birth certificates and registrations and things like that.

258
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,570
And, um, but what's not lawful about it is the people don't know it.

259
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:43,670
But that also adds proof positive that it's satanic, because Satan does the opposite.

260
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,190
If Satan tells you you're free, that means you're a slave.

261
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,510
If Satan says you're a slave, that means you have a possibility of freedom.

262
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,870
It's backwards, you see.

263
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,490
But you can know it.

264
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,450
Oh, yeah.

265
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,630
Yeah, it can be known.

266
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:04,850
But the thing is that people have now become that satanic element now, you see.

267
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,130
Yeah, OK.

268
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,310
The people in general.

269
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:14,750
So, for example, here, if you go out in the street and start saying, well, supposedly, no, you're free, but once you start dealing with the, quote-unquote, authorities on a private level, so you're just a slave.

270
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,150
Yeah.

271
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:29,590
And if you say you're a slave to certain people, they get angry because they only know the slave meaning one thing.

272
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,490
Right.

273
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,050
As in what happened 200 years ago, right?

274
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:41,690
And very often, that's why I don't, I've had requests to do interviews, and I used to do a thing with Ocelli, and I've done some other interviews, and there's no reason to go.

275
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:49,690
Because when you listen to people, not to disparage those people, but they think because they like something, it's right.

276
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,410
Like, very often, I've been in a conversation with someone, and I say, well, I don't agree with that, so?

277
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,570
What does that mean, you don't agree?

278
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,410
It doesn't mean anything.

279
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,470
So, most people still think what they agree with is right, and what they don't agree with is wrong, and it doesn't exist, you see?

280
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:14,110
So, that's why I'm saying there's nothing going on on the Internet, because, you know, where, if you're going to go on the Internet to get information and listen to people talk, let me ask you, where are they from?

281
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,170
They're from planet Earth, for starters, right?

282
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,490
And second of all, where did they get their education?

283
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,870
Where did they get their thoughts from?

284
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,370
They're operating on a very, very low level.

285
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:47,470
So, what happens is, I'm giving that as an example, because no matter what you try to do, even if it's sonic events on the Internet, or go read classical literature, or turn on the TV, or speak to authorities or wealthy people, it's all garbage at this point.

286
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,670
It's accumulated.

287
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,950
It was garbage thousands of years ago also, but now it's just, you know, the landfill.

288
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,750
Have you ever been to a landfill of a small town?

289
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,150
It's not that big, but if you go to a landfill of a huge city, it's huge.

290
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,030
And right now it's all this huge landfill, and it's very, very wasted.

291
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:17,490
So, back to the definition, it seems like we've gone away from dreams and all that, but it's very simple.

292
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:32,410
I think I stated your mind, your spirit, which is the same thing, your consciousness is wholly dependent, unless you have major assistance, which I've never really gone into, which you would call the after-death experience.

293
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,450
People that come back, they haven't really died.

294
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,450
I'll be right back.

295
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,810
Hold on.

296
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,870
Go ahead and take this call.

297
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:38,910
Okay.

298
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,370
Yeah.

299
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,170
Hi, Bruce.

300
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:41,930
Hi.

301
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,530
That was fascinating.

302
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,170
Yeah.

303
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,350
Yeah, no.

304
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,770
Yeah, the dreams...

305
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,870
There we go.

306
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,310
Oh, yeah.

307
00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:07,730
So, when you look at the script, the way we were made right now, this particular, the survivors of Genesis is what you see on the planet right now, except for a very small group that are non-identified.

308
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,110
When I say Genesis, I mean, you know, Noah, right?

309
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,610
And on.

310
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:18,310
We're made in a way that your spirit consciousness is wholly dependent on your physicality.

311
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:25,110
That's why, for example, it feels good to drink or smoke pot or do drugs, because it changes that consciousness, right?

312
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:39,570
The future, after death and resurrection, I believe will be a different relationship, because after the resurrection, you don't need to have a body to be conscious, you see?

313
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,290
You can shed that, and right now it's in paranormal, supernatural.

314
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:52,490
But, see, on the other hand, once you understand this, it's quite an advantage, because it's very narrow.

315
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,190
You don't have a lot of options, right?

316
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,690
So, you know, like the zombies, you know, you kill the brain, you kill the head, you kill the zombie.

317
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,230
You know, like the zombie, remember, they shoot the arm off, so it keeps coming, you have to kill the head, right?

318
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:18,590
So, it's the same with people, you know, there's people that have had their full amputations and they're still gone, but once the head is removed, and the body, you know, from the head being removed, then the spirit goes to disanimation.

319
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:25,170
So, the reason I stated all this, even though it might have some gory detail, is very simple, because it is very simple.

320
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:35,450
So, once you understand that, how you are actually almost prey to the spiritual world at this point.

321
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:45,950
Like, if you ever see all the deer in the forest, not the ones that get used to being fed, you know, I've been in places, camping, where I see the deer come up to the people, because, you know, for generations, people fed them.

322
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:54,990
I'm talking about real prey animals, you know, when you watch like zebras and all that stuff, you know how they all huddle together and a lion comes by, or a fox, or whatever, and they all run, right?

323
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:59,130
Because the only defense is to run, or kick.

324
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:09,070
So, you know, humans are, can be easily predated upon by the spiritual world at this point.

325
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,850
And this is a very simple point.

326
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:22,850
So, all these points that I'm making are very, very important to understand the simplicity and the foundation of your composition, because how can you work on something, right?

327
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:29,230
Both positive and negative, if you don't understand its composition.

328
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:40,050
And by the way, for every, not the people, well, your average people, not those, but there are people listening to this kind of stuff.

329
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:52,910
So, for everyone that listens to what we're really made of, there's, they want to do something positive, there's another three or four that want to do something negative with this information.

330
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,630
That's why I don't talk about a lot of the poignant points, and it wouldn't be prudent.

331
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:21,750
And I've discussed, there's several people, like, there's a guy named Ibrahim Karim, he's from Egypt, he doesn't know a lot, he's very censored, but he knows a lot about biogeometry, like drawing a symbol that can change the environment, you know, we're not talking sigils in evocation.

332
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:46,490
And having a discussion with him a few years ago, he mentioned, for every, there's about one or two laboratories that are experimenting with symbolism, biogeometry, for health reasons, to mitigate electromagnetic stuff, disease, and all that, but there's over 50 labs researching it to weaponize it, in a negative way.

333
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:57,290
Okay, so, yeah, this is the same with, I've met people that were very good at chemistry, full scholarships, even though it's a bullshit, you know, standard.

334
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:05,090
Nine out of ten of them, once they graduate, go into companies that eventually make weapons.

335
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:23,290
You see, so this is, what I'm trying to say here is, whether it's information, concepts, processes, the majority of the consciousness, or the people that are on the planet right now support the negative outcome, or weaponizing, or using it for bad instead of good.

336
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:23,770
You see?

337
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,710
Yes.

338
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,910
And that's in scripture as well.

339
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,390
You think it's a piper plane?

340
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,270
Could be.

341
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,570
Yeah.

342
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,130
I can't, I can't, I can't go in.

343
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,490
Yeah, uh-huh.

344
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,930
Yeah, we were just talking about the weapon idea.

345
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,770
So, I can't go inside.

346
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,570
Well, that's fine.

347
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,330
Yeah.

348
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,030
Now, Next.

349
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:27,400
How much, how much, do you think, or not think, but when a person wants to know something, is it more easily for them to learn it if they have that gumption, or they have that interest in learning something that they didn't really know before?

350
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,960
Well, you also have to bring in cosmic censorship.

351
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,080
If the gods, especially the higher, don't want you to see it, there's nobody that can make you see it.

352
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,440
Even if they put a gun to your head, you still won't see it.

353
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,440
Now, is there, okay.

354
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,180
Cosmic censorship's a bitch.

355
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,040
Yeah.

356
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,760
I mean, a female dog.

357
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah, uh-huh.

358
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,320
Because how can you differentiate that?

359
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,840
I mean, if someone wants to know something for their own good, you're saying that they may never know it.

360
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,480
Right.

361
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,540
Well, for sure not now.

362
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,640
Like, you know what an ah-ha moment is?

363
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,120
Uh-huh.

364
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,620
Before you even finish telling them they get it?

365
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,460
That means they're wide open, and they're not censored on that subject.

366
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,560
Okay.

367
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:23,180
You know, like if you just bring a concept up to someone before you, and when you're halfway telling it they're finishing the sentence for you, it means they got it, and the other side is permissible for them to know.

368
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:30,140
And there's other people that you can tell, and they just shrug their shoulders, and whatever, they're censored.

369
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,860
We're not talking about everything now.

370
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,940
We're talking about the truth.

371
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,380
The truth, yes.

372
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,240
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,640
The truth is it's not open for whether it's appealing or desirable.

374
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:50,320
That's why, again, if you've ever heard me on other sponics, other interviews of other people and stuff, it's all about what they like.

375
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,040
Who cares about what anybody likes?

376
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,960
Yeah, because Sing the truth.

377
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,280
Yeah.

378
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,220
The truth, well, seems to be not that desirable, actually.

379
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,120
Well, also you've got to realize the truth is very, very detrimental to the powers that be.

380
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,560
You can't be a slave if you know the truth.

381
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,980
There's a couple of...

382
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,620
Right, right.

383
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,360
There was an old book where there was...

384
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,660
they had a slave that kept beating him up, and they'd find out, like, well, why are you always being, you know, beaten?

385
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,720
And he says, well, I can't...

386
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,460
I don't make a good slave because when I was young, I traveled a lot, and I learned a lot of things.

387
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,140
So I don't make a good slave.

388
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:40,520
So when you run into, like, higher-ups in your society, Harvard, Princeton graduates, doctors, engineers, and all that, they're good slaves because they never learned a lot of stuff, you see.

389
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,600
You know what I mean?

390
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,740
And you can't graduate from those schools unless you're proved to be a good slave.

391
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,540
There's no way.

392
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,380
So the more knowledge...

393
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,780
When I say slave, I mean...

394
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,220
Okay, let me just put it this way, because most people still don't understand.

395
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,780
How many times have you heard me say, how many people in the world ever heard of the book of Revelation?

396
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,500
Raise your hand.

397
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,560
How many people heard of the Antichrist?

398
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,360
Raise your hand.

399
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,620
Well, if everybody knows about it, aren't they going to cry foul when it starts happening?

400
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,420
Yes.

401
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,160
So what it means is that it's all secret.

402
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,460
Even when it's happening, they won't be able to discern it, you see.

403
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,580
Everything in Scripture is still secret.

404
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,540
When you say Abraham to someone, have you heard, yeah, show me a picture, what do you think?

405
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,260
It's all wrong.

406
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,960
It's all still secret.

407
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,260
Like the character of Abraham, the character, especially, of the Christ, and all that.

408
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,560
All of that is a secret.

409
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,900
Still.

410
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,000
Big, big, big, big secret.

411
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:49,020
Yeah, because when someone today thinks of Abraham, they think of all Christianity, Islam, that's all they think about.

412
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,240
And I understand that.

413
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,060
Yeah, they don't understand his character either.

414
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,560
If you study Scripture, you'll see the man had a character.

415
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,740
And you wouldn't like him if he was a relative.

416
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Let me just put it that way.

417
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,180
But, nonetheless, let's just say, we'll leave it at that.

418
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,500
I've got a lot of notes on biblical characters that one day I'll share, or someone else will share.

419
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,200
And I'll suggest that it'll be quite an eye-opener.

420
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:36,800
So, if all of these things are secret, right, when you read in Scripture, let's go back to what I was saying about being a slave, the leaders or the kings of a people and all that, it's not the politicians and the people you see on TV or in the history books for a long, long time.

421
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,620
Those kings and leaders of people are people behind the scenes that you do not know and you will probably never know.

422
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,460
You see?

423
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:53,700
So, when you read about the king of the north and this and that, that's not talking about some puppet president.

424
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,220
There's no president in ancient writ.

425
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,200
They're corporations.

426
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,160
There's bloodlines that run.

427
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:07,240
So, who runs, who owns Egypt, who owns Israel, who owns the U.S., you do not know.

428
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,240
And you will not know because they're very good at keeping those secrets secret.

429
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,700
So, when you read Scripture about these leaders moving around and things happening then you will not see that.

430
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,060
But you will see the effects of it.

431
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,020
Kind of like the wind.

432
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,160
Yes.

433
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,840
The ether.

434
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,500
Yes.

435
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,840
Yeah.

436
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,640
Right, the ether.

437
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,240
Yeah.

438
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:50,380
So, all of these things are so simple yet one thing that you need to do is tell people if you are a thinker especially if you contemplate the truth if you're a good thinker you will contemplate the truth you're going to have to eventually phase people out.

439
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:01,760
In other words, let it not be important to you to have discussion and conversation with quote unquote friends, family and acquaintances just because they're there.

440
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,200
Right.

441
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:16,560
Just because you have people around you whether it's co-workers, family or friends if they're not open to it and industrious about what you're discussing in other words they want to help and learn more just phase them out when it comes to that subject.

442
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:36,679
So, if you're at work just talk about you do work things you're at home watch TV with them or whatever or whatever they're interested in but don't because what that will do is the energy that you could be using on studying and contemplating and meditating on the truth will get muddied up with the emotional responses internally and externally because they can't understand it.

443
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:46,520
And you can't be so eager to say oh, I want to help people because it's too late.

444
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,980
You can't really help people.

445
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,820
You can't do it.

446
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,280
Well, here's the thing.

447
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,200
You know how they say the will of the gods is more important than the will of man.

448
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,820
The gods already are very clear saying that you're nothing like, let me just like shit in the street.

449
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,320
Yeah.

450
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,140
Of course it is.

451
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:21,540
Not even yeah, we're not talking about shit in the living room floor we're talking about the shit in the street is what the gods think of humanity at this point on a major group and of course they pull out and choose selected people here and there to do certain things.

452
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,080
But this is the level you're like dung.

453
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,080
You know.

454
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,760
Or another if you want to graduate to a higher level you're like grass or in the field.

455
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,120
How many times do people feel sorry because someone put a blade to the grass and cut the grass?

456
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,120
That's how the gods think of you.

457
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,560
And if you know look all this up that I'm saying by the way.

458
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:57,060
So once I'm not saying abuse them or whatever but I'm saying disregard them on the subject matter but you have to regard them on the food, clothing and shelter.

459
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,580
If you see somebody that needs something help them out.

460
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,000
Absolutely.

461
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:01,880
Yeah.

462
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,700
So.

463
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,700
You said that well you've stated this many times that it's all a secret and it will be a secret.

464
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:13,800
Yes.

465
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,440
But later.

466
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,340
Much later.

467
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,620
Yeah.

468
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:28,080
And concerning now I haven't done been able to do much searching on the Parthians but Seleucid Parthian Empire.

469
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah.

470
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,620
Seleucid, yes.

471
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:51,780
But Daniel was taken captive there and you stated that he was a a good example of how to pray how to interact with the Elohim.

472
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,140
Right.

473
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,880
Now, he was called a mad guy.

474
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,340
Right.

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,120
To a certain degree, yeah.

476
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,220
To a certain degree.

477
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah.

478
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:12,960
He was not in other words just like today well well I shouldn't say because it's very mixed there is no there is no just separation Let me just say this.

479
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,780
A hundred years ago this is more clear and more to the point.

480
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,700
A hundred years ago you were not considered educated or a hundred and fifty years ago you were not considered educated unless you knew the scriptures.

481
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,140
Period.

482
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,520
It doesn't matter what country you were in where in the world.

483
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,900
If you didn't know the ancient rites it doesn't matter who you were where you were you were not considered educated.

484
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,780
If you were went to the best universities in the world in any country and you didn't know the ancient rites you were not considered educated.

485
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,680
If you were a farmer that never went to school and knew the ancient rites you were considered educated.

486
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,280
That was the benchmark of how knowledgeable someone was.

487
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,740
Do you see what I mean?

488
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,240
Yeah.

489
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,860
Oh yeah.

490
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,800
Okay.

491
00:37:51,160 --> 00:38:01,640
So when you when you look at someone like Daniel who was privileged to be in the king's court but it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be either.

492
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:01,940
Right?

493
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,720
Because when Yeah.

494
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,020
So but on the other hand he had access.

495
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,760
Right?

496
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,840
It's about access.

497
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,520
And also you know, believe it or not Okay.

498
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,940
All the people Yeah.

499
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,460
He had access to to physical the best of the best stuff.

500
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,600
You know.

501
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,640
Like for example I'll just well, I don't know how to say it.

502
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:22,840
Okay.

503
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,640
Let's say I know someone who had been to some a very, very, very wealthy person's home.

504
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,520
And once they get to when you go now I'm not just you know, you visit for a few days because you're it's also business regarding what business they do.

505
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,740
Let's say I'm not going to mention the business like petrochemical or something like that.

506
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:59,400
But they start showing you all their prized possessions and they taped out like a map a brass tube and they show you this map it's a map that's 500 years old and you look at it and it has days and dates on it and all kinds of directional and charts.

507
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,680
And that would have been worth in today's money several million back then.

508
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:25,580
The reason why was it not only was a map of how to grow the over the world's oceans but it was also a map that gave you when to go when the wind currents would be on your back so it would cut your trip in half or cut it by two thirds.

509
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:36,400
That was worth a lot because if you can cross the Atlantic in a week instead of two and a half weeks you have to carry less food and you get your you see what I mean?

510
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,440
Yeah.

511
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,200
So but if you just go out into the world right now they don't have if you tell them about this they've never even heard of it.

512
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,700
Yeah, but they did that back then.

513
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,920
Yes, they have.

514
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,060
During Solomon's time, etc.

515
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:58,140
the Phoenicians I mean they traveled the oceans to well, the Americans.

516
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,320
There were secrets also that they had that are not made public.

517
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,720
Right?

518
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,800
So when you read the book of Daniel and he was highly learned in many things you're like, well could you learn all the things?

519
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,120
No, because those things have never been made public.

520
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:13,960
Yeah.

521
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,820
See?

522
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,860
But also you should go back to the first part when you suggested about how to pray he was very diligent at it.

523
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,020
He did it very often.

524
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,440
And when you read for example in Scriptures is knock and the door will be opened it doesn't say that really.

525
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,500
It's not written that way.

526
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,040
It's written in an aorist tense.

527
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,980
Aorist is where it means you constantly be knocking.

528
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,320
You know?

529
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,780
It's like Yeah, you don't give up.

530
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,920
You keep pushing.

531
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,540
Yeah, it's a tense that we don't acknowledge.

532
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,780
It's a in grammatical tense called the aorist.

533
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,980
And the aorist means it's constantly going on like breathing or living or Yeah.

534
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,380
Or thinking.

535
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,580
Or thinking about.

536
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,700
Well, for most people that would be completely far.

537
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,660
Oh, okay.

538
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,220
Okay.

539
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,340
Yeah.

540
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:07,000
And, you know in that Well, wasn't there a time where they said that it was pray without speaking?

541
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,900
Sure.

542
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,080
Yes, that's Yeah, that would be the aorist.

543
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,700
But what It's much easier to make a metaphor an analogy now.

544
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:23,020
If you're in front of a computer all day how many tabs and windows can you have open at the same time?

545
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,780
Especially if you have a really large several screens.

546
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:36,240
So, when you get up in the morning first thing you think about the gods and you're in a state of prayer like, you know communicating with them what you would like to do according to their will of course.

547
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,240
Because if you ask things against their will they're not going to help you, right?

548
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,100
Well, of course.

549
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,780
Yeah, so Or they'll give you what you wanted and it won't be good.

550
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,260
Well, then even if you well, yeah, that's another whole other thing show me a prophet that had a good life even Solomon, right?

551
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:53,780
Right.

552
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:04,680
So, if you don't want to be it is a state where it's not yeah they'll use you and spit you out but we don't understand why at this point.

553
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,420
I'm talking even the most high.

554
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,300
But well, we know why but we don't know exactly why they do it that way consistently.

555
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,780
Very rarely does anyone other than Job Eob and a few others do they have a peaceful ending or a peaceful life.

556
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:42,180
but the thing is when you when you start acknowledging when your day starts for example the gods and how you want to walk with them or them to walk with you or guide you when you when you first start thinking with the next thing you do don't change that thought keep it running in the background or the foreground.

557
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,440
You see what I mean?

558
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,220
Always there.

559
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,360
It's always there, yeah.

560
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:56,620
It's not there's the technical aspect that I discussed which is, you know you should be in a clean state if you want to know what that is.

561
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:16,320
You know, washed and no meat no dead animal around and you they know what you well, the most high knows what you need to know what you want they they you know how I said what do you give to someone what do you give what do you give to someone who already has everything?

562
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah.

563
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:26,040
That's all you if they have so the most high already has everything so the only thing that he doesn't have is your attention.

564
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,020
You see?

565
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,740
So that's what I mean it's a technical aspect.

566
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:38,140
I always I was always amazed by the the fact how they use the analogy of father.

567
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:40,660
Right.

568
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,860
And the reason they use those terms is because it's understood in the society that we're in.

569
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,440
Right.

570
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,180
You notice that that's not used in the book of Enoch?

571
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,830
It's always the most high or the most Right.

572
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:57,570
Right.

573
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,150
Yeah.

574
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:05,070
Because the society the development and the discussion of the book of Enoch was already from an insider group.

575
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:05,990
Right.

576
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:06,410
Right.

577
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:12,070
When you start going on a more social group you bring up father, son, mother.

578
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:12,950
Right.

579
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,290
Oh.

580
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:14,830
Interesting.

581
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,490
Yeah, I see.

582
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:17,730
You see?

583
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:27,290
That's why they call the son of God well he's not really the son of God because God doesn't need to have how's the God going to have a son?

584
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:27,670
You know?

585
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,690
I mean, what does that mean?

586
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,110
Well

587
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,530
in a sense

588
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,150
that we discussed

589
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,330
but he is the son of God

590
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,210
to show authority

591
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,210
and I've given the example

592
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,650
if you have a corporation

593
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,270
that you've ran

594
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,170
for 30 years

595
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,310
and 10 years

596
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,010
into the corporation

597
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,950
you have a child

598
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,930
when that boy

599
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,330
or girl

600
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:44,710
becomes

601
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,430
especially I would say

602
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,830
as a boy

603
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,010
becomes a man at 20

604
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,730
when he walks into

605
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,570
the boardroom

606
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,470
even though you

607
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,430
started that company

608
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,130
and you have guys

609
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,710
that have been with you

610
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,790
for 30 years

611
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,150
even though your son

612
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,830
is only 20

613
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,430
your son

614
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,010
at 20

615
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,010
has more authority

616
00:44:59,010 --> 00:44:59,830
than they do

617
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,690
in terms of inheritance.

618
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,890
You don't have to.

619
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:04,510
Right.

620
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,630
Right.

621
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:27,890
Because of the progeny and the primus familius and all that pedifamilius the first you see coming forward and so what the son means is to come in full authority of another not just an agent See, what makes an agent an agent is an agent does not bring himself he just represents what his pledge is to represent you know?

622
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:28,870
So you have

623
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,450
they have agents

624
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,370
angels work

625
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,090
as agents

626
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,270
but the agents

627
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:33,890
don't have

628
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,850
the true authority

629
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,330
outside of their

630
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,410
purpose of being

631
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,610
a representative agent

632
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,650
Now, when you say

633
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,830
someone is a son

634
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,710
they not only

635
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,570
are representative

636
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,870
agent

637
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,710
but they also

638
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,890
have the authority

639
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,230
within themselves

640
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,290
like when an angel

641
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:52,810
like if you

642
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,590
study scripture

643
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,190
several places

644
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,810
it says

645
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:56,750
and Yahweh

646
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,910
sent my own angel

647
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,770
not just an angel

648
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,130
he has his own angel

649
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,850
that he sends

650
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,230
he sends angels

651
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,950
and then he has

652
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,250
his own angel

653
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,930
his angel is like

654
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,690
a body double

655
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,390
like you ever see

656
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,810
like years ago

657
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,830
Saddam Hussein

658
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,770
had a body double

659
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,610
or the president

660
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,550
would have a body double

661
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,310
or the king would have

662
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,570
a body double

663
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,430
So, the Most High

664
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,510
has a body double

665
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,410
a few of them

666
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,250
that are

667
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,090
just like him

668
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,630
in other words

669
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,030
if you

670
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,250
are in their presence

671
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,470
you will be vaporized

672
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,670
if you look at them

673
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,350
you will die

674
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,270
just like the Most High

675
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:27,890
but they are not

676
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:28,570
the Most High

677
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,230
they can only

678
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,010
act within

679
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,830
the authority

680
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,910
that they've been

681
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,050
given as an agent

682
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,350
but when you

683
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,090
give the other

684
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:36,610
person

685
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,510
another person

686
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,510
or another being

687
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,110
full authority

688
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:40,950
and they can

689
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,590
act on that

690
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,170
full authority

691
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,510
as themselves

692
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,130
that is

693
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,830
like a son

694
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,550
you see

695
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,050
that's what

696
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,570
the Christ

697
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:50,870
is

698
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,550
in other words

699
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,930
comes from

700
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:53,390
that family

701
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,010
it's just like

702
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,790
when you see

703
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,450
let's say

704
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,310
you're the monarchy

705
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,390
you have people

706
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,930
coming and

707
00:46:58,930 --> 00:46:59,410
representing

708
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,150
the king

709
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,070
all over the world

710
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,150
but here comes

711
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,750
the king's son

712
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,610
he's called a prince

713
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:05,390
you know

714
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:05,810
you see

715
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:06,790
so as long as

716
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,810
there's no conflict

717
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,910
that prince

718
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,490
his royalty

719
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,350
and he is the

720
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,630
highest form

721
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,650
that can be bestowed

722
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,090
when he's at a

723
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:14,310
you know

724
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,110
wherever presence

725
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:15,530
he gets

726
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,010
you know

727
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,790
and he speaks for

728
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,530
and

729
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,210
yes

730
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,650
and he speaks for

731
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,650
and for himself

732
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,030
you see

733
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,730
because that's

734
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,910
who it is

735
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,830
yeah

736
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,730
because it's

737
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,190
it's actually

738
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,950
the creator

739
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,850
doing it all

740
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,210
sure

741
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,590
but in full authority

742
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,370
just as good

743
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,870
all the way through

744
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:35,670
through

745
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,930
see where you read

746
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:37,470
in Exodus

747
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,650
and in

748
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,510
Genesis

749
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,670
all the presence

750
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:41,830
is when the most high comes

751
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,610
that's not the most high

752
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,410
that's his angel

753
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:44,490
coming

754
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,370
his angel

755
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,090
versus

756
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:47,870
an angel

757
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,050
there's a difference

758
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,430
like

759
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,630
when Moses

760
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,850
was speaking to the angel

761
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,030
that gave off fire

762
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,070
but didn't burn the bush

763
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,750
notice I didn't say

764
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,350
the burning bush

765
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,110
okay

766
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,910
that was not

767
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,490
his angel

768
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:03,550
that was an angel

769
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,610
but when

770
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,770
it says Yahweh

771
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,190
descended upon the mountain

772
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:08,950
and the mountain shook

773
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,590
and smoke came out

774
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,230
that was

775
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,830
Yahweh's angel

776
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,670
his angel

777
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,650
doing that

778
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,010
there's a difference

779
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:15,510
you see

780
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,230
his body double

781
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,790
let's say

782
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,030
his spiritual body double

783
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,190
it's very hard to discern

784
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:23,930
but it's there

785
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:24,930
you can see it

786
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,290
yes

787
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,210
at one point

788
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:26,770
he tells Moses

789
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,470
I am sending you my angel

790
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,210
uh oh

791
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:29,650
wow

792
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,910
not just any angel

793
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,430
but you know

794
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,150
the body double

795
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,850
when I mean body double

796
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,090
I mean spiritual presence

797
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:35,910
full

798
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:36,350
you know

799
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,050
but that

800
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,290
when he says my angel

801
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,670
that angel that he sends

802
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,570
that is just like him

803
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,690
does not act upon

804
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,710
on his own

805
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,410
sense

806
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,750
he only acts on what

807
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,150
he does in agency

808
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,490
where the Christ is different

809
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,050
the Christ

810
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,270
acts

811
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,270
on what the Father does

812
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,350
and on his own

813
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,030
so

814
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,030
anyway

815
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,410
yeah

816
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,710
it's very simple

817
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,350
all these things

818
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,270
are very very simple

819
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:03,950
and uh

820
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:04,450
again

821
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,610
not good for the slaves

822
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,150
to know

823
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,610
this is the

824
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,910
as I mentioned earlier

825
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:10,670
Yah I mean

826
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:11,690
it changes everything

827
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,310
it changes everything

828
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,190
you can be a terrible slave

829
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,150
you can't be a good slave

830
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,170
if you know things

831
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:17,890
and then

832
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,330
you know

833
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,690
the crab

834
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,250
the buckets

835
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:20,850
and the crab

836
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:21,230
what is it

837
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,070
the crab and the bucket

838
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:23,910
all these people

839
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:24,590
that are out on

840
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:24,910
you know

841
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,070
you see in the world

842
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:26,850
and on the internet

843
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,790
if they don't like

844
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,470
what you're saying

845
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,430
see if they got caught

846
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,730
into some ideology

847
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:32,990
or

848
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:33,850
whatever

849
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,490
thought

850
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:34,870
and

851
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,390
they hear what you're saying

852
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,590
they

853
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:37,550
somehow

854
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,910
inherently know

855
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:39,270
it's true

856
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,150
but they don't like it

857
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,110
they fight you on it

858
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:41,370
right

859
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,450
and they bring up

860
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,370
all this crap

861
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,550
to back up

862
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,110
their stuff

863
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:45,410
so

864
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,710
what happens again

865
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,530
is it's best to keep

866
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,930
discussions simple

867
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:50,810
uh

868
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,750
keep them narrow

869
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,390
and not too deep

870
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:53,810
right

871
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,410
on these matters

872
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,930
because they're so simple

873
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,750
what makes them complicated

874
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,510
is the

875
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,970
is the

876
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,350
is the

877
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,770
quantity

878
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,810
of possibilities

879
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,490
and things

880
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,250
but the quality

881
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,730
of the discussion

882
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,490
the quality

883
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,790
of the information

884
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:09,290
is very

885
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,510
very simple

886
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,150
you know

887
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,150
there's hierarchies

888
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,130
there's physical

889
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,210
there's non-physical

890
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,190
then you have to

891
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,090
understand authority

892
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,570
you have to

893
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,390
understand law

894
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,030
and that's it

895
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:18,810
that's pretty much

896
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,890
knowledge of the universe

897
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,530
mhm

898
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:20,870
mhm

899
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,470
and it's all

900
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,530
it's all in scripture

901
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,150
it's all in scripture

902
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,510
and a lot of ancient writs

903
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:26,870
yes

904
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:27,890
but not ancient writs

905
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,350
that are

906
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,130
you know

907
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,570
like you see

908
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,490
like Gnosticism

909
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,370
that would be like

910
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,530
the 9-11 commission

911
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,710
or the Warren commission

912
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,570
right

913
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,470
which is a bullshit

914
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,250
uh thing

915
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,190
even though people

916
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,070
take it seriously

917
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:38,870
you know because

918
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,550
back in those days

919
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,050
for example

920
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,830
Gnosticism

921
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,610
the first century

922
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,350
was flooded

923
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,110
with uh

924
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,090
events that no one

925
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:45,730
can explain

926
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,690
so they had to

927
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,610
make up stuff

928
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,570
uh to explain it

929
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,170
to the masses

930
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,190
and at the same time

931
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,170
prosper from it

932
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:52,790
what people don't

933
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,310
understand

934
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:54,730
the Gnostics

935
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,210
were like Hollywood

936
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,850
is today

937
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,090
they put out

938
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,070
a lot of stuff

939
00:50:59,070 --> 00:50:59,870
for what

940
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,590
why does Hollywood

941
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,470
do what it does

942
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:01,830
for

943
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:03,210
for money

944
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:04,930
and power

945
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:05,570
fame

946
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,910
you know

947
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,570
and

948
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:09,910
um

949
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,210
so

950
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:11,910
yeah

951
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,250
someone mentioned

952
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,810
in chat

953
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,310
about

954
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,030
food

955
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,730
clothing

956
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,330
and shelter

957
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,350
and uh

958
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,490
do you want to

959
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,430
maybe talk about

960
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,210
the human body

961
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:21,810
a little bit

962
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,150
or

963
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,470
yeah

964
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,710
yeah I can do that

965
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,550
um

966
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,210
yeah I had

967
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:26,830
uh

968
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,150
before you start

969
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,350
um

970
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,410
I just wanted to

971
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,030
mention that

972
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,390
uh

973
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,090
uh

974
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:33,430
when

975
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:34,190
when you first

976
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:34,770
started your

977
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,390
conversations

978
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,230
about clothing

979
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,890
and the mixed

980
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:37,290
fibers

981
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:37,910
and all that

982
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,270
I took the liberty

983
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,750
uh some months

984
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,210
later

985
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,270
in going through

986
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:43,850
and uh

987
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,990
to my

988
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:46,490
complete

989
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,130
profoundness

990
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:49,670
of this

991
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:50,950
um

992
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,290
just very little

993
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,310
was of

994
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:53,670
mixed

995
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:55,690
oh good

996
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,030
and I just

997
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,630
I was just

998
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,570
what are the

999
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,090
odds

1000
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,870
you know

1001
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:02,970
well it depends

1002
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,570
on what kind

1003
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:03,950
of work

1004
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:04,410
you do

1005
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:04,790
uh

1006
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,130
you know

1007
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,730
if you had to

1008
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,020
also

1009
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,350
on how

1010
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:07,790
uh

1011
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,110
you know

1012
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:08,570
I mean

1013
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:08,950
um

1014
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,210
it

1015
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,890
it's

1016
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,170
yeah

1017
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,950
it depends on how

1018
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,010
elaborate of a wardrobe

1019
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,010
it depends on if

1020
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:14,670
you're a fashion

1021
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,730
slave

1022
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,450
if you're not a

1023
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,090
fashion slave

1024
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,390
you probably

1025
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,330
have mixed

1026
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,450
yeah

1027
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,430
the ones that I did

1028
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:22,730
have

1029
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,330
you know

1030
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,590
I tossed them

1031
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:24,910
down

1032
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:25,510
and uh

1033
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,670
but yeah

1034
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,050
that was

1035
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,630
just

1036
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,750
stocks are the most

1037
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:30,570
difficult

1038
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,790
and for women

1039
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:32,490
they would be

1040
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,030
pretty much

1041
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,670
all around

1042
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:34,710
difficult

1043
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,570
uh

1044
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,670
even jeans

1045
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,170
these days

1046
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,090
are five percent

1047
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:38,590
lycra

1048
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,410
now they put in

1049
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:39,670
you know

1050
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,330
stuff in there

1051
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:40,630
so

1052
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,170
weird stuff

1053
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:42,790
yeah

1054
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,410
yeah

1055
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:43,990
and that's

1056
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,070
for a reason

1057
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:45,570
uh

1058
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,210
but uh

1059
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:46,530
nonetheless

1060
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,170
uh

1061
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,150
there's nothing

1062
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,730
wrong with

1063
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,470
making your own

1064
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:49,890
clothes

1065
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:50,510
if you want

1066
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,950
to invest

1067
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:51,810
in it

1068
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,170
uh

1069
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:52,970
like anything

1070
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,530
you have to

1071
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,250
buy the tools

1072
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:54,770
yeah

1073
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,090
there's lots of seamstress

1074
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,670
out there

1075
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,590
that love to work

1076
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:58,710
yeah

1077
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,090
and uh

1078
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,190
mercenaries

1079
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:00,830
uh

1080
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,390
is that the proper term

1081
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,410
for cotton

1082
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,030
and everything

1083
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:04,830
yeah

1084
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,250
yeah

1085
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:05,770
yeah

1086
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,410
I really started

1087
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,230
looking into that

1088
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,230
and oh my goodness

1089
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,710
uh

1090
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,590
boy what a fascinating

1091
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,290
subject

1092
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,330
yeah

1093
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:14,830
mercenaries

1094
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:15,310
and the weaving

1095
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,670
yeah

1096
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,310
yeah

1097
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,210
okay

1098
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:17,910
yeah

1099
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:48,010
so

1100
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:48,650
I think

1101
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,310
I think I emailed you

1102
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,630
a couple days

1103
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,450
after it happened

1104
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:53,690
um

1105
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,990
but it looks great

1106
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,230
and um

1107
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,250
uh

1108
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,410
the vacuum

1109
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,150
has been

1110
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:01,670
restored

1111
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,910
on a uh

1112
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,010
person

1113
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,630
who

1114
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,110
um

1115
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,370
is non ambulatory

1116
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,350
and uh

1117
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,110
due to

1118
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:11,650
uh

1119
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,130
pneumonia

1120
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:12,610
issues

1121
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,010
breathing

1122
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:13,630
problems

1123
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,650
and uh

1124
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,570
that's been

1125
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:17,830
done

1126
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:17,930
with

1127
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,930
eating

1128
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,010
longitude

1129
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:22,270
latitudinally

1130
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:23,670
um

1131
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,810
that has been

1132
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:26,250
corrected

1133
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,550
uh

1134
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,310
in the last

1135
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,230
year and a half

1136
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,010
hello

1137
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,070
yep

1138
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,370
let's go here

1139
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,170
sorry about that

1140
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,010
that's fine

1141
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:39,950
that's the piper

1142
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,790
coming around again

1143
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,250
yeah

1144
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,270
sorry about that

1145
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,810
but um

1146
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,870
and uh

1147
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,030
there's a child

1148
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,790
uh

1149
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:52,550
who uh

1150
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,310
um

1151
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,290
they're going on

1152
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,310
their um

1153
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,790
so I want to go back

1154
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:58,370
real quick

1155
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:58,630
Valerie

1156
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,130
if it's alright

1157
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,350
the person who

1158
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,310
was not ambulatory

1159
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,870
and all that

1160
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,310
I think

1161
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:03,950
the process

1162
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:05,110
if I recall

1163
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,930
will keep it as anonymous

1164
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,690
as possible

1165
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,410
was basically

1166
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:09,650
uh

1167
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,370
applying

1168
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:10,930
uh

1169
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:11,470
compression

1170
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:12,090
to the entire

1171
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,210
limbs on the body

1172
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:13,630
was that

1173
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,170
was that it

1174
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:14,690
if I remember

1175
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,430
yes

1176
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,050
and I

1177
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,710
I get

1178
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,610
I should have

1179
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,570
explained that

1180
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,130
I just

1181
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:19,390
that's fine

1182
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,690
I think I'm just

1183
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,570
assuming that

1184
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,670
everyone has

1185
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,430
listened to

1186
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,950
everything that you

1187
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,270
have stated on that

1188
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:26,610
so

1189
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,830
that's my mistake

1190
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,270
yeah

1191
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:28,890
oh that's fine

1192
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:29,790
I apologize

1193
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,270
so basically

1194
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,930
uh

1195
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,110
manipulating the vacuum

1196
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,510
by understanding the

1197
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,350
let's say

1198
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,370
for lack of a better

1199
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:36,630
word

1200
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,570
basic physics

1201
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,310
you compress

1202
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:39,790
uh

1203
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:40,570
something that's

1204
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:40,950
soft

1205
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:41,810
and increases the

1206
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,230
pressure

1207
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,390
so the

1208
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,470
so that it adjusts

1209
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,710
to if it needs a vacuum

1210
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,950
to start to create more vacuum

1211
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,250
and then when you

1212
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,110
release the pressure

1213
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,290
you have extra vacuum

1214
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,030
because it had

1215
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,010
adjusted to that

1216
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,410
you see

1217
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,190
so you're

1218
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,550
pulling

1219
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:53,950
yeah

1220
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:54,670
it's

1221
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:55,790
anybody can play around

1222
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:55,930
with

1223
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:56,970
the weights were

1224
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,650
applied to

1225
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,410
his arms and legs

1226
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,070
and um

1227
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:01,890
with padding

1228
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,330
let's say

1229
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,010
yes

1230
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:03,650
yes

1231
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,590
yes

1232
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,870
and um

1233
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,330
that went

1234
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:07,970
very smoothly

1235
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:08,950
I did that

1236
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,890
for a few days

1237
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,230
um

1238
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:11,990
and

1239
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,710
no problems

1240
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,110
since

1241
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:15,990
uh

1242
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,170
I

1243
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:16,690
I think

1244
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,210
that the

1245
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,050
um

1246
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,690
I don't want to

1247
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:20,150
use the word

1248
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,590
diet

1249
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:21,990
sorry

1250
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,870
intake food

1251
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,110
intake food

1252
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:25,370
um

1253
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,710
this person

1254
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,610
has to have

1255
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,530
um

1256
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,370
everything chewed

1257
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:29,770
for him

1258
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,450
which would be

1259
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,230
pureed food

1260
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:32,650
um

1261
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,170
uh

1262
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:34,670
because of

1263
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,710
digestion issues

1264
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,370

1265
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,170
elimination

1266
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,970
has improved

1267
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:40,490
uh

1268
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,730

100 percent

1270
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,410
um

1271
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,190

00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,000
um

there are people

1283
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,060
that have

1284
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,140
visited him

uh

1288
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,740
medical technicians

1289
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,660

1290
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,400

yeah

1294
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,200
and didn't

1295
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:18,780
they were

1296
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,780
didn't know what to say

1297
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,520
they

1298
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
they never know what to say

1299
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,560
they can just repeat

1300
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,120
what they've been

1301
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,740
yeah

1302
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,920
they can just only repeat

1303
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,820
what's in their training

1304
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,440
like the

1305
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,380
like the circus bear

1306
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,720
yeah

1307
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,400
yeah

1308
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,000
they didn't know what to say

1309
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,300
and

1310
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,060
yeah

1311
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,640
you know

1312
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,900
the circus bear looks really smart

1313
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,080
to the audience

1314
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,740
but if you put him in

1315
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,560
with the other bears

1316
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,120
in the forest

1317
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,040
he's a real dummy

1318
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,080
yeah

1319
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,400
you know

1320
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,040
right

1321
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,500
you ever see the circus animals

1322
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,400
like oh look how

1323
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,280
look at this animal

1324
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,360
you put that animal

1325
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,520
in it's natural state

1326
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,440
all the other animals are like

1327
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,240
what's wrong with him

1328
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,300
what an idiot

1329
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,820
yeah

1330
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:52,760
so

1331
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:53,780
yeah

1332
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,260
and um

1333
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,020
uh

1334
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,020
I have used the

1335
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,440
um

1336
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,460
restored the vacuum

1337
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,080
on myself

1338
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,400
well

1339
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,980
my spouse did it for me

1340
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,120
and I've done it for him

1341
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,560
um

1342
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,080
and

1343
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,320
uh

1344
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,760
I've actually done it on

1345
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,660
uh

1346
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,050
it's been done on a child

1347
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:17,730
um

1348
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,150
a child now

1349
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,410
is going into his

1350
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,070
fourth year

1351
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,150
and um

1352
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,110
he's been eating

1353
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,110
latitudinally

1354
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:29,850
um

1355
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:30,590
seasonally

1356
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,870
seasonally

1357
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,310
yes

1358
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,670
seasonally

1359
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,370
and um

1360
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,830
he's doing very well

1361
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:37,710
yes

1362
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:38,470
you'd be like mid

1363
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,430
we were talking about

1364
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,170
mid hemisphere

1365
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,750
not near the equator

1366
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,170
and you're not in a cold place

1367
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,210
you're not in a hot place

1368
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,010
you're kind of across

1369
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:45,970
the middle latitude

1370
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,570
like middle

1371
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:48,390
middle united

1372
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,710
US

1373
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,730
middle Europe

1374
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,550
or middle China

1375
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,190
so you still have a lot of variety

1376
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,410
if you go across latitude

1377
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,130
right

1378
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:54,670
where you are

1379
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,250
you can

1380
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,110
you can go

1381
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,050
I suggest people get

1382
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:58,490
uh

1383
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,610
yes I'll stay at a globe

1384
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,130
and uh

1385
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,430
find out where you're on the globe

1386
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:03,490
and just spin the globe

1387
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,810
clockwise or counterclockwise

1388
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,230
and everywhere your finger lands

1389
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,810
along that

1390
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,810
line

1391
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:08,370
uh

1392
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,450
look up different recipes

1393
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,310
from those countries

1394
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,570
and that's how you get your variety

1395
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,430
yeah

1396
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:13,910
yeah

1397
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,750
um

1398
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,530
he had

1399
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:16,610
the little one

1400
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,730
had taken a

1401
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,870
um

1402
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,430
uh

1403
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,930
transatlantic flight

1404
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:22,610
uh

1405
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,390
that was in

1406
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,430
uh

1407
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:26,570
oh

1408
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,610
year and a half ago

1409
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,470
and was

1410
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:31,790
uh

1411
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,990
the only time that

1412
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,650
this person

1413
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,490
had been ill

1414
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,030
was after that flight

1415
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,890
right

1416
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,710
and um

1417
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,130
the parents asked if

1418
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,770
I would take care of him

1419
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,470
I said sure

1420
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,470
and um

1421
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,130
he had a fever of about

1422
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,050
a hundred and three

1423
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,010
so I got that down

1424
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,070
uh

1425
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:57,950
put the vacuum

1426
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,230
restored the vacuum

1427
00:59:59,230 --> 00:59:59,770
through

1428
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:00,890
um

1429
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,430
weights on his little

1430
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,510
legs and arms

1431
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,490
and um

1432
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,230
it just took

1433
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,470
maybe a day

1434
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:09,470
and he was fine

1435
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,970
because I

1436
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,110
I

1437
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,150
I

1438
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,790
discerned that it was

1439
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:15,470
probably

1440
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,950
um

1441
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,190
possibly the

1442
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,450
airplane flight itself

1443
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,730
for sure

1444
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:23,170
possible

1445
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,090
uh

1446
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,470
and what

1447
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,050
and the eating

1448
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,610
uh

1449
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,790
it could have been a

1450
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:30,930
pathogen that

1451
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,510
the

1452
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,750
the child acquired

1453
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,670
that it replicated

1454
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,570
yes

1455
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,370
yeah

1456
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,590
by the way these pathogens

1457
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,730
that they tell you

1458
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,670
that's why there's so much

1459
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,750
into injecting

1460
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,290
vaccines and things

1461
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:41,810
into people

1462
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,910
because they know for sure

1463
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:43,790
they'll get it into your

1464
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:44,710
system that way

1465
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:45,650
uh

1466
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,290
which is not

1467
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,090
you know by the way

1468
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,230
there's never been a study

1469
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:49,290
uh

1470
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,330
people say are you for

1471
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,450
vaccines or against them

1472
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,070
I was like neither

1473
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,930
it's the dumbest thing

1474
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:54,270
I've ever

1475
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,570
heard you know

1476
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,230
when you hear about

1477
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:58,710
pathology

1478
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:59,030
and

1479
01:00:59,650 --> 01:00:59,870
uh

1480
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,370
all of these things about

1481
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,070
um

1482
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:02,790
what is the

1483
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,990
the other field regarding

1484
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,670
the disease

1485
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,630
uh

1486
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,770
it's so ridiculous

1487
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,350
uh

1488
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,050
they don't even know

1489
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,090
how the body works

1490
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,090
how could you trust them

1491
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,230
on therapies

1492
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:11,690
and

1493
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:12,530
and uh

1494
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,430
remedies and things

1495
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,470
they don't know anything

1496
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:15,470
uh

1497
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,470
again why would you tell

1498
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,210
slaves you know

1499
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,970
I mean they're just

1500
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:18,830
you know like a chair

1501
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,230
do you care if a chair

1502
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,550
gets vaccinated or not

1503
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:21,750
sure

1504
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,390
shoot it up

1505
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,890
big deal

1506
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,350
but my point here

1507
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:24,950
is very

1508
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:25,710
simple

1509
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,450
is um

1510
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,150
the

1511
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,930
the person's

1512
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:30,790
susceptibility

1513
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,090
to reproduce the

1514
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:32,710
pathogen

1515
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,130
is

1516
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,210
when they get the

1517
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:35,670
pathogen

1518
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,050
you see

1519
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,150
that's why how many times

1520
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,750
have you heard

1521
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,110
uh

1522
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:40,630
various plagues

1523
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:40,950
and

1524
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,410
diseases that have gone

1525
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,090
through society

1526
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,050
and certain people didn't

1527
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:44,890
come down with it

1528
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:46,690
and

1529
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:46,990
uh

1530
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:47,590
it's not that they were

1531
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:48,290
immune to it

1532
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,350
their body did not

1533
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,010
reproduce the pathogen

1534
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:52,670
it's very simple

1535
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,470
and

1536
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:53,990
by the way

1537
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,570
you've heard me say

1538
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,410
there is no such thing

1539
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,390
as an immune system

1540
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,750
right

1541
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,370
yeah

1542
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,350
that's a fiction

1543
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,370
medical fiction

1544
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,190
you have

1545
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:01,290
circulatory

1546
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:01,690
nervous

1547
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:02,830
and you have

1548
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:03,430
eliminative

1549
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,470
and nutritive

1550
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,770
and you know

1551
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,690
skin, lungs

1552
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,550
and stomach

1553
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:07,930
are all

1554
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:08,530
nutritive

1555
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,650
right

1556
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,710
so

1557
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,490
you have

1558
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,010
so

1559
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,090
so

1560
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,590
the essence of

1561
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:15,710
understanding

1562
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,250
these things

1563
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,910
when someone

1564
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:17,950
for example

1565
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,490
has a high temperature

1566
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,550
what's going on

1567
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:20,910
you know

1568
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,890
in

1569
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:24,050
near the equator

1570
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:25,970
a fever

1571
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,010
is a cold fever

1572
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:28,390
uh

1573
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,790
north and south

1574
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:30,590
of the equator

1575
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,490
uh

1576
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:32,510
as you go further away

1577
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,210
from the equator

1578
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,530
the fever is always

1579
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:35,310
a hot fever

1580
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,450
and that's another

1581
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:37,890
discussion

1582
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,010
I never brought this up

1583
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,150
and I probably won't

1584
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:41,530
um

1585
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,010
uh

1586
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,630
for either ever

1587
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,430
or a long time

1588
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:45,970
because it

1589
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,730
requires discussing

1590
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,570
you know

1591
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,330
doing sonics

1592
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:49,990
on just how

1593
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,270
you know

1594
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,130
how the body works

1595
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,350
how biological organisms

1596
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:52,870
work

1597
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,150
but

1598
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,070
nonetheless

1599
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,430
uh

1600
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,710
what happens

1601
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,230
with a fever

1602
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:57,890
is the temperature

1603
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:58,570
goes up

1604
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,490
and uh

1605
01:02:59,490 --> 01:02:59,990
that's

1606
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,290
that is the symptom

1607
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,470
uh

1608
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:04,270
of losing vacuum

1609
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,050
so you already

1610
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:05,850
started losing

1611
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,590
your vacuum

1612
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,730
before the fever

1613
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:08,430
came on

1614
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,090
you see what I mean

1615
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:10,510
yeah

1616
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:10,950
yeah

1617
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,930
and I'm just going to

1618
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:12,730
throw that as a hint

1619
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,510
because then it gets

1620
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,170
I have to get into

1621
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:14,750
a discussion

1622
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,930
on what a fever is

1623
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,330
and why

1624
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,890
you have hot fevers

1625
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:19,190
in most places

1626
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,970
and cold fevers

1627
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:20,810
near the equator

1628
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:21,390
and certain

1629
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,170
venomous bites

1630
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,370
create a cold fever

1631
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,830
uh

1632
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:25,510
make a

1633
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,550
long story

1634
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,690
short here

1635
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,130
uh

1636
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,710
for sure

1637
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,190
and I'll just

1638
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,550
stop on this

1639
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:31,710
is that

1640
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,150
most of the things

1641
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,210
that people consider

1642
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,330
other than replication

1643
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,330
of a pathogen

1644
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,410
um

1645
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,470
to be an illness

1646
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,570
or a state

1647
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,010
of

1648
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,410
bad health

1649
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,190
is

1650
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,470
because the vacuum

1651
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,610
has been lost

1652
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,870
you see

1653
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:46,850
it's not that

1654
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,030
restoring the vacuum

1655
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,090
makes the fever

1656
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:49,550
go away

1657
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:50,170
it's that

1658
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,350
when the vacuum

1659
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,030
is restored

1660
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,690
there is no reason

1661
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,270
for a fever

1662
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,470
there's no symptom

1663
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,790
for it anymore

1664
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,330
you see

1665
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,510
um

1666
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,310
it's just like

1667
01:03:59,310 --> 01:03:59,830
for example

1668
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:01,150
the common cold

1669
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,010
in western civilization

1670
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,690
when winter

1671
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,290
comes on

1672
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,510
it has nothing to do

1673
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,330
with any pathogens

1674
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,210
it has to do with

1675
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,790
their diet

1676
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,570
yeah

1677
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,450
because

1678
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:11,610
they should have

1679
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,330
started changing

1680
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:12,910
their diet

1681
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,170
weeks before the cold

1682
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:14,790
come on

1683
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:15,930
and once the cold

1684
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,610
came on

1685
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,210
uh

1686
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,650
they're still eating

1687
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,430
the same

1688
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,370
food

1689
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:20,870
that they

1690
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,470
you know

1691
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,970
that makes their body

1692
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,430
uh

1693
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,930
adjusted to a warmer climate

1694
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,330
so

1695
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,030
you see

1696
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:27,570
so

1697
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:28,930
so

1698
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:29,790
all these things

1699
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:30,750
the colds

1700
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,130
fevers

1701
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:32,210
the certain illnesses

1702
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,890
are symptoms

1703
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:34,870
way down the line

1704
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,550
from the vacuum

1705
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,770
being lost

1706
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:37,950
uh

1707
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,250
and restoring

1708
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:39,890
the vacuum

1709
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,230
makes these things

1710
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,990
uh

1711
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:43,350
mitigate

1712
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:44,610
but

1713
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:44,910
you know

1714
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,570
here's the thing

1715
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:47,610
when you try to

1716
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,390
restore the vacuum

1717
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,050
you're not really

1718
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,190
restoring the vacuum

1719
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:50,870
you're creating

1720
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:51,510
a condition

1721
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,350
for the body

1722
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,870
to restore the vacuum

1723
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,230
and sometimes

1724
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:55,910
if the body

1725
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:56,870
is too far gone

1726
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,630
or too weak

1727
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,050
um

1728
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,310
no matter what you do

1729
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,150
it will not

1730
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,410
uh

1731
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,330
go

1732
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,130
back on

1733
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:04,470
it's like

1734
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,390
priming a pump

1735
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:06,730
or

1736
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,590
you know

1737
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:07,930
when you

1738
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,590
have to prime

1739
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:09,750
put a little bit

1740
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,110
of suction

1741
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,090
so it can start working

1742
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:11,650
if the pump

1743
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,710
is damaged

1744
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,170
you can prime it

1745
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:14,730
all you want

1746
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:15,810
it'll run a little bit

1747
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,690
and it'll go back

1748
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:17,870
it'll lose suction

1749
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:18,890
and it won't work

1750
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,210
so

1751
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:20,730
uh

1752
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:21,870
but that doesn't mean

1753
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,090
you have to be in a

1754
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,150
position to say

1755
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,470
well

1756
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,570
we've done everything

1757
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:25,990
we can

1758
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,470
it won't work

1759
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,550
you still keep it going

1760
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:27,970
because

1761
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,990
the body's so resilient

1762
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,350
and

1763
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:31,670
another thing I want to say

1764
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:32,930
is the modern medicine

1765
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:33,970
and actually

1766
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:34,610
modern medicine

1767
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:34,930
I mean

1768
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,470
if you go back

1769
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,670
even a few thousand years

1770
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,150
is a testament

1771
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,330
to the robustness

1772
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,370
of the human body

1773
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:41,730
because

1774
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,570
they don't even know

1775
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:43,210
what they're doing

1776
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:43,870
even today

1777
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,330
at all

1778
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:44,930
they cannot

1779
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:46,650
simplify

1780
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,650
the most foundation

1781
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,790
basic principles

1782
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,830
of anything biological

1783
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,250
and all they do

1784
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:51,790
is abuse

1785
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,110
the majority of what they do

1786
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:53,710
is abuse

1787
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,230
the biological

1788
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,070
whether it's a vet

1789
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,130
or a regular doctor

1790
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,390
and people

1791
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,470
still survive it

1792
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:00,410
and it shows you

1793
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,110
how resilient

1794
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:01,830
and how

1795
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:02,630
robust

1796
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:03,810
the human body is

1797
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:04,710
yeah

1798
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,350
so

1799
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,230
once you understand

1800
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,930
the subtleties

1801
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,910
and have a good foundation

1802
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:09,810
on what's going on

1803
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,250
in any biological organism

1804
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,250
whether it's a plant

1805
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,410
a bug

1806
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,390
a small animal

1807
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:16,030
a large animal

1808
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:16,570
or a human

1809
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,370
it

1810
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,050
because we know

1811
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,030
the living creatures

1812
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:20,970
are very robust

1813
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,130
and very resilient

1814
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,350
the slightest push

1815
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,210
gets it going

1816
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:25,670
just like a stick shift

1817
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:26,910
that won't start

1818
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:27,930
you give it a little push

1819
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,790
and as soon as the gear

1820
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,530
turns the

1821
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,410
crankshaft

1822
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,970
at least 120 degrees

1823
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:33,350
it fires up

1824
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,030
so

1825
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:36,650
yeah

1826
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:37,510
this is all

1827
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:37,910
because

1828
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:38,390
of

1829
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,150
the adversary

1830
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:41,190
this is the

1831
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,230
quote unquote

1832
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,410
satanic society

1833
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:44,130
on this planet

1834
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,630
it has been for a long time

1835
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,710
and

1836
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,470
it's very simple to understand

1837
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,430
when I say satanic

1838
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,410
it's just the opposite

1839
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,270
if something is simple

1840
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,290
they say it's complex

1841
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,750
if something is complex

1842
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,790
they say it's simple

1843
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,770
if something is black

1844
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:58,610
they call it white

1845
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,010
something is bad

1846
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:00,810
they call it good

1847
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:01,390
if it's good

1848
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,150
they call it bad

1849
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,510
it's just

1850
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,710
the opposite

1851
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,950
of

1852
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,610
the

1853
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:06,490
opposition

1854
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,490
adversarial

1855
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,330
yeah

1856
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,130
okay

1857
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,510
so

1858
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,110
in terms of the body

1859
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,410
when you say

1860
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,350
restoring the vacuum

1861
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,370
it's basically just

1862
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,410
putting the squeeze

1863
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,350
on things, right?

1864
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:56,870
and pressure I would pretty much say yeah yeah yeah okay cool alright so yeah and from your experiences from what you've heard on Greek speak I'd say you're pretty much on your own just like anyone yeah whether it's a family member a friend or a passer-by the chances of anyone you know it's a very interesting thing right?

1865
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:05,770
yeah you can't really talk to anyone about it they're not interested really or they just look at you like really?

1866
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,230
what are you talking about?

1867
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,590
right

1868
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:09,810
I agree

1869
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,470
pretty much impossible

1870
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:14,850
to speak to anyone about it

1871
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:17,910
that sounds like a

1872
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:18,770
general electric

1873
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:20,330
yeah

1874
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,630
that's a general electric

1875
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:23,250
turbine

1876
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,370
you know the

1877
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,510
Rolls-Royce turbines

1878
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,210
they have a much

1879
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:26,830
lower

1880
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,870
they have like

1881
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,670
a double hum

1882
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,090
that was

1883
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:31,590
a general electric

1884
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,350
turbine

1885
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,510
had that high

1886
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,970
Rolls-Royce

1887
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:35,290
on the end there

1888
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:35,710
yeah

1889
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,310
yeah

1890
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,170
that's on the tail

1891
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:39,210
that's what they call

1892
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:39,649
the dopper

1893
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:39,870
I don't know about

1894
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,050
the Rolls-Royce

1895
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,450
engines

1896
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,229
they have like

1897
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:43,870
a dual hum

1898
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,590
on the front

1899
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,069
but

1900
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,210
anyway

1901
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:49,569
are you all

1902
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:50,490
listening to airplanes

1903
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:50,770
or

1904
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:51,970
yeah

1905
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,330
I once did a

1906
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,270
I had a discussion

1907
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:54,890
with some people

1908
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:55,410
on an airplane

1909
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:55,850
a jet

1910
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,050
that once you get it

1911
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:57,330
going

1912
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,109
the more

1913
01:08:58,109 --> 01:08:59,170
the faster you want to go

1914
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,330
the less fuel you need

1915
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,069
and it's silent

1916
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,310
and they said

1917
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,270
no we can't use that

1918
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,170
design because the jet

1919
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,170
has to make noise

1920
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,510
oh I see

1921
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,189
it's just like

1922
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:09,029
when I do

1923
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,430
certain car

1924
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:11,250
modifications

1925
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,149
they tell the

1926
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:12,689
people

1927
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:13,370
the higher ups

1928
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:13,590
they go

1929
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,990
no the car

1930
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,490
has to have

1931
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:14,950
pollution

1932
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,550
you know

1933
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,870
when you make

1934
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,310
the pollution

1935
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:17,790
go away

1936
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,010
you know

1937
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:18,390
they tell you

1938
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,090
no it has to have

1939
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:19,450
pollution

1940
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:19,850
so

1941
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,090
yeah

1942
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,029
or it's not working

1943
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:21,510
correctly

1944
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:21,930
right

1945
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:22,270
yeah

1946
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:22,750
and people

1947
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,149
ask them

1948
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:23,390
you know

1949
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:23,750
recently

1950
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,170
are you guys

1951
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:24,510
familiar

1952
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,109
there was a

1953
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:25,710
publicity

1954
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:27,470
it was a

1955
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,130
Rockefeller

1956
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:28,550
or some

1957
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,210
banking guy

1958
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:29,890
said that

1959
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:30,970
you need

1960
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:31,609
sick people

1961
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:32,130
it's good for

1962
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:32,490
business

1963
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:32,930
do you guys

1964
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,370
remember that

1965
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,870
it was an article

1966
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:34,710
a couple of weeks

1967
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,050
or maybe

1968
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:35,770
a few months

1969
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,149
ago

1970
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:37,750
no

1971
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,229
it was a

1972
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,430
bank

1973
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,510
advice me

1974
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:40,970
yeah

1975
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,609
talking about

1976
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:42,290
funding

1977
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,270
medical research

1978
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:43,930
like we have

1979
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,069
you have to

1980
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:44,569
remember you

1981
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:45,130
need sick

1982
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:45,529
people

1983
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:45,930
otherwise

1984
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:46,310
it's bad

1985
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,130
for business

1986
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:49,490
that means

1987
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,250
their glass is

1988
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:50,890
overflowing

1989
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:51,370
that means

1990
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,109
that all of

1991
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:52,470
what they're

1992
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,990
doing is

1993
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:53,550
to make you

1994
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:53,910
sick

1995
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:54,890
and the

1996
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,450
glass is

1997
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,150
full to the

1998
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:56,530
top

1999
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:56,810
and it

2000
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,490
overflows

2001
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,090
you see

2002
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:59,070
yeah

2003
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,370
if you go

2004
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:00,630
to an

2005
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,070
emergency

2006
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:01,470
room or

2007
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:01,810
hospital

2008
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,470
they're

2009
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,910
completely

2010
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:03,590
ridiculous

2011
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,290
what they do

2012
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:04,630
there

2013
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:06,410
unless you're

2014
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,050
walking in with

2015
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:07,410
your guts

2016
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,090
hanging out

2017
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:08,470
or you have

2018
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,010
a gunshot

2019
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:09,430
wound

2020
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,410
even then

2021
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:11,170
they treat

2022
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:11,810
you like the

2023
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:12,150
critical

2024
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:12,550
they treat

2025
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:13,270
immediately

2026
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,410
but 99.99%

2027
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,050
of the stuff

2028
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:16,330
that people

2029
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:16,650
go in the

2030
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:17,030
emergency

2031
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:17,470
room

2032
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,330
if it

2033
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:19,770
was done

2034
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,090
the way

2035
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:20,410
we've

2036
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:20,890
discussed

2037
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:21,690
it

2038
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,270
would be

2039
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:22,870
just fine

2040
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,770
you know

2041
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,850
actually if people

2042
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:26,750
just knew about it

2043
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:26,950
from

2044
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:28,850
let's just go back

2045
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:29,210
to what we said

2046
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,550
earlier

2047
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,470
you can't discuss

2048
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,130
this with

2049
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,990
people

2050
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,170
so when I say

2051
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,230
humanity is

2052
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,210
unrehabilitatable

2053
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:35,950
you can't fix

2054
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:36,190
them

2055
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:37,530
it's not

2056
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,750
something that

2057
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,590
you have to

2058
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,090
consider

2059
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,630
whether it's

2060
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:41,290
believable or

2061
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:41,470
not

2062
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:41,870
it's something

2063
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,310
that you

2064
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,890
can directly

2065
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,490
observe

2066
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,010
that people

2067
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:45,670
don't want

2068
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:45,830
it

2069
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,670
they can't

2070
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,290
but you know

2071
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:47,650
on the other

2072
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,010
hand

2073
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,310
the only

2074
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:49,910
the only

2075
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,830
slack I cut

2076
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,510
people or

2077
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:51,990
humanity

2078
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,650
the only

2079
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:53,190
slack I

2080
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:53,670
give them

2081
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,990
is the

2082
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,510
cosmic

2083
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:56,090
censorship

2084
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,890
in other

2085
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,270
words it's

2086
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,850
beyond

2087
01:10:58,850 --> 01:10:59,870
but if

2088
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,810
people were

2089
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,150
are the

2090
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:02,590
way they

2091
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:02,970
are in

2092
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:03,230
their own

2093
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:03,630
volition

2094
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,330
oh no

2095
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,190
they need to

2096
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:05,830
drop all the

2097
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:06,290
nukes right

2098
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:06,770
now

2099
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,130
yeah

2100
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,330
they're very

2101
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:09,750
evil

2102
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,570
shitty

2103
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:12,570
creatures

2104
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,170
just like

2105
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,310
Lord of the

2106
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:15,530
Rings

2107
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:16,270
where the bad

2108
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:16,810
guy lives on

2109
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,290
this planet

2110
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:17,990
just nuke the

2111
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,530
whole thing

2112
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,930
but because

2113
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,230
I know for

2114
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:21,670
sure

2115
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,250
that they

2116
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:23,870
are subject

2117
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:24,510
to cosmic

2118
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,030
censorship

2119
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,230
and just

2120
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:26,790
getting rid

2121
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,210
of them

2122
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,070
you know

2123
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,550
like you

2124
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,670
would

2125
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,330
clean out

2126
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,410
a house

2127
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:30,970
of roaches

2128
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:31,890
or vermin

2129
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,890
isn't going

2130
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,270
to help

2131
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,690
it doesn't

2132
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,130
mean anything

2133
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,090
because they're

2134
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:35,810
not doing it

2135
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,310
on their own

2136
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,670
they don't

2137
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:37,450
really know

2138
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:37,870
and they

2139
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:38,990
can't

2140
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:39,410
you see

2141
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:39,830
that's the

2142
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,570
only slack

2143
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,030
that I cut

2144
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,490
humanity

2145
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,770
but if you

2146
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,570
were in a

2147
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:43,970
let's say

2148
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:44,510
flying through

2149
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,090
the universe

2150
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:45,590
and you said

2151
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:46,110
these people

2152
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,510
are not

2153
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,750
subject to

2154
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,590
cosmic

2155
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,070
censorship

2156
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,810
and they are

2157
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,190
this way

2158
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:50,830
oh that planet

2159
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:51,450
needs to go

2160
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:51,890
you need to

2161
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:52,490
scrape it

2162
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,070
you see

2163
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,710
because that's

2164
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,330
pure evil

2165
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:56,150
you see what I

2166
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:56,370
mean

2167
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,270
but because

2168
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,310
they're not

2169
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,050
the majority

2170
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:01,710
of the people

2171
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:02,450
are evil

2172
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,430
and downright

2173
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:04,370
bad

2174
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,570
but the

2175
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,210
minority

2176
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,950
that is not

2177
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:08,690
downright evil

2178
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,230
and bad

2179
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:10,010
that is subject

2180
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,610
to cosmic

2181
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,230
censorship

2182
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,670
they still

2183
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,530
act just like

2184
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,390
the evil ones

2185
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:14,630
right

2186
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,330
but how can you

2187
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,210
discern if

2188
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,750
someone is

2189
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,550
downright evil

2190
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,570
and

2191
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,070
manifesting an

2192
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,750
evil spirit

2193
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,390
versus being

2194
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,010
cosmically

2195
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:25,450
censored

2196
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,550
you can't

2197
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,490
that's why you have

2198
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,270
to cut humanity

2199
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:28,890
slack

2200
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,730
you know the

2201
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:31,830
interesting part

2202
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:32,270
is when you

2203
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,930
read about

2204
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:34,590
the

2205
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,330
a lot of the

2206
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,170
dictators that

2207
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,630
would do

2208
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,110
like

2209
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:38,770
they would go

2210
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,610
and destroy

2211
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,450
large segments

2212
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:40,810
of their

2213
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:41,550
population

2214
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,890
these were not

2215
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,090
they didn't just do it

2216
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:44,670
because they were

2217
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,670
brutal and crazy

2218
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:48,150
they did it

2219
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:48,770
because they saw

2220
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,230
the people

2221
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:49,710
as being

2222
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:50,890
unrehabilitatable

2223
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,410
and it had to be done

2224
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,710
to at least

2225
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,390
leave something

2226
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,070
good just like

2227
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:55,610
the way you

2228
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,110
you know you

2229
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,090
pull out weeds

2230
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,890
to have a good

2231
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,210
lawn

2232
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:00,890
what they didn't

2233
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:01,370
understand

2234
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,390
is the cosmic

2235
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,990
censorship

2236
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:05,210
and because

2237
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:05,890
there's cosmic

2238
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,290
censorship

2239
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,310
and you can't tell

2240
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,010
who's who's who

2241
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:08,710
you have to leave

2242
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:09,290
the whole bunch

2243
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:09,670
alone

2244
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:11,130
and you have to

2245
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:11,710
let the gods

2246
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:12,330
do it

2247
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,030
you see what I mean?

2248
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:14,770
I see

2249
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,110
but in other words

2250
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:18,930
what I'm saying is

2251
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,010
there's some bad

2252
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:20,810
shit coming on

2253
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,370
this world

2254
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:21,990
and

2255
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:23,670
even when it

2256
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,410
starts to come

2257
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,090
when it comes

2258
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:25,850
the people are not

2259
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:26,550
going to view it

2260
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,570
as being bad

2261
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,870
because it's going

2262
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,610
to be part of the

2263
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:30,910
setup

2264
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,570
but you know

2265
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,110
yeah

2266
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,230
the spouse and I

2267
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:36,010
have talked about

2268
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:36,350
that

2269
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:39,730
how good

2270
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,750
it's going to be

2271
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,170
and then how

2272
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,590
terrible and

2273
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,510
horrible it's

2274
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,030
going to be

2275
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,050
the worst it's

2276
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:46,910
ever been in

2277
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,270
since the beginning

2278
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,550
in human history

2279
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,330
and

2280
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:52,270
it's hard

2281
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,130
it's hard to

2282
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,010
fathom

2283
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,290
how bad

2284
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:55,810
I mean

2285
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:56,830
how much worse

2286
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:57,470
can it get

2287
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,030
worldwide

2288
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:58,950
all at once

2289
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:00,830
right

2290
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:01,350
but remember

2291
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,030
just like the

2292
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:02,290
flood

2293
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:02,970
it comes in a

2294
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,370
wave

2295
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,110
you know

2296
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,190
I know

2297
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:06,450
I know

2298
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,410
I know

2299
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:18,270
I know

2300

I know

2306
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:33,870
I know

2307
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:34,010
I know

2308
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,170
I know

2309
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:48,810
I know

2310

I know

2311
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,730
I know

2312
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,250
I know

2313
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:05,350
I know

2314
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,450
I know

2315
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:05,550
I know

2316
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:05,650
I know

2317
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:33,050
I know

2318
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,890
I know

2319
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,390
I know

2320
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:35,490
I know

2321
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,110
I know

2322
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:49,010
I know

2323
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,470
I know

2324
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,430
I know

2325
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,570
I know

2326
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:16,170
I know

2327
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,390
I know

2328
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:31,490
I know

2329
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:31,950
I know

2330
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:32,230
I know

2331
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:33,930
I know

2332
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:34,030
I know

2333
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:34,130
I know

2334
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:34,230
I know

2335
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:34,430
I know

2336
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:34,530
I know

2337
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:36,170
I know

2338
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,330
I know

2339
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,130
I know

2340
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:04,430
I know

2341
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,850
I know

2342
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:12,070
I know

2343
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:24,270
I know

2344
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:24,750
I know

2345
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,410
I know

2346
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:33,910
I know

2347
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:34,150
I know

2348
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:34,250
I know

2349
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:34,390
I know

2350
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,490
I know

2351
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:38,270
I know

2352
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,030
I know

2353
01:17:56,090 --> 01:18:05,700
I know

2354
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:09,340
And that's in scripture, that's in scripture as well.

2355
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,960
Well, it's in scripture by example.

2356
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,380
Here and there, yeah.

2357
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:19,280
By example by the Christ, because the Christ symbolizes the end times, by the way.

2358
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,920
And this is another discussion.

2359
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:33,080
You know, I have a couple of clipboards with discussions I was going to do on the radio at AFR and with Seth and with Sam and all this stuff, and I just put a big X through all this stuff.

2360
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,160
And a lot of it was, like, I'm not going to discuss this stuff in public.

2361
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:44,400
And actually, I have to get paid for it, because I have to sit down and to do this right, I'm going to have to do references and really buckle down and do a professional presentation.

2362
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,880
But one of the topics is what the Christ symbolizes here on earth.

2363
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:57,060
Because he didn't have to really do what he did and come to earth and do what he did, but he did because it's symbolic of a certain time period.

2364
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:07,260
See, because if you lived, and this is all I'm going to say about it, if you lived in the first century, just like today, I mentioned I did a survey a while back asking people, do you think we're in the end times?

2365
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:15,340
And 99 out of 100 said yes, or 90 out of 100 people said yes, we're in the end times, but no one can explain how and why in any detail.

2366
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,520
If you ask those questions back in the first century, are we in the end times, 99 out of 100 people say yes, we are.

2367
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,820
But they couldn't give any detail.

2368
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:32,440
So, just like you might have heard me say before, any time in history, if you preach doom and gloom, people will listen because they like that.

2369
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,900
You know, it sounds about right.

2370
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:35,140
But is it right?

2371
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,600
And the answer is no.

2372
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:44,080
Just like it wasn't right for the first century, and it's not right the way they're doing it now.

2373
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,360
You know how they give dates next year when we have five years left?

2374
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:49,840
They can't tell you why and how in detail.

2375
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:54,180
And the details of all of this stuff is in the life of the Christ.

2376
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:58,900
He keeps talking about Terran building, destroying things and building things up.

2377
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,300
This is also brought up in Jeremiah.

2378
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,120
It's very important.

2379
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,400
Well, I'm going to take something here for a moment.

2380
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,160
I'll be right back.

2381
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,440
Give me about one minute.

2382
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:06,720
Okay?

2383
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,440
Okay.

2384
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,680
You guys talk amongst yourselves.

2385
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,160
Alrighty.

2386
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,660
You know, it seems like a big giant time loop.

2387
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,640
Sometimes it does, like a circle or something.

2388
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:21,660
Yeah.

2389
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:22,920
Yeah, I don't know.

2390
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,700
That's very interesting.

2391
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,360
You know, speaking, he brought up Revelation earlier.

2392
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,860
Well, I guess that's a secret.

2393
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:42,050
But it seems like it's past, present, and future type of a book.

2394
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,550
And if it was his first book, I guess that makes sense.

2395
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,270
Right.

2396
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:54,290
But that is a difficult book to comprehend.

2397
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:55,230
Right.

2398
01:20:55,230 --> 01:21:00,690
And I think he's correct that maybe no one does.

2399
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,300
Just the observation alone in my daily walk.

2400
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:18,200
I just heard that Revelation something in your daily walk.

2401
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:25,540
Well, it gives you the instructions in the first verse or two, in Replica of Revelation, how to comprehend that.

2402
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,240
And they're simple.

2403
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,720
And they do, when you read Scripture, it means what it says, and it says what it means.

2404
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,280
It's for the servants, not for believers, right?

2405
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,500
If it was the believers, it would say that.

2406
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:45,400
And belief has to do with having information before something manifests.

2407
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,700
That's all belief is.

2408
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,360
There's no other.

2409
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:54,980
That's why all the world religions, the small and the major in my words, are garbage.

2410
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,620
Because they ask you, what do you believe in?

2411
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,520
And it's garbage.

2412
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,460
Ask any religious person.

2413
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,280
Doesn't matter what it is.

2414
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,540
That was like 30,000 different religions in the world.

2415
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,520
Seven billion potential religions, right?

2416
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,380
Because everyone makes shit up all the time.

2417
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,240
And it's all garbage because they base it on belief.

2418
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,700
And you can ask them belief of what?

2419
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,660
And they can't answer.

2420
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,820
And what they do answer is Mickey Mouse.

2421
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,800
Without a doubt.

2422
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:27,520
And so it has nothing to do with belief, because belief is information of the future.

2423
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,420
So if you believe in something and it doesn't happen, guess what?

2424
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,860
That was not a good belief.

2425
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,540
But if you believe in something and it does manifest, guess what?

2426
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,400
That was a good belief.

2427
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:39,760
You see?

2428
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,460
So it's very temporal belief.

2429
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,280
It has nothing to do with what...

2430
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:51,680
But then again, the last thing you want to do is have the idiots on this planet give them incompatible...

2431
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:56,780
You see, people are a project...

2432
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:57,780
Or a project.

2433
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,020
Yeah, I could call it a project.

2434
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:03,960
Or the product of thousands of years of malevolent spirits guiding them.

2435
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,340
And they do so willingly and unwillingly, unknown.

2436
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,760
But they still don't question it.

2437
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,340
So you could say unwilling.

2438
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,340
Not unwilling, but just unknown.

2439
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:20,460
And the truth with people is incompatible at this point.

2440
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,780
Because it's incompatible.

2441
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,540
Number one.

2442
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:37,140
Number two, they're devoid of the ability, because of cosmic censorship, and the cultural and social pressures that they have to learn the truth.

2443
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:37,440
Right?

2444
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:37,540
Okay.

2445
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:59,460
And those very, very few that the truth can be compatible with them, and they have transcended the social, cultural, familial pressure, and can deal with the truth, it doesn't mean you can still deal with the book of Revelation, because the instructions in Revelation are, it's for the servants.

2446
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:00,600
Yes.

2447
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,740
So, does the servant sit around on the couch all day?

2448
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:05,140
Or does he do things?

2449
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,280
A servant is a service function.

2450
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:08,800
A doer.

2451
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:09,280
Yes.

2452
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,140
He's a doer.

2453
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:10,620
Right.

2454
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,200
Exactly.

2455
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,740
So, just that one thing for the servants.

2456
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:21,380
Now, to find a servant, you could write an essay on what a servant is and what a servant isn't.

2457
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:29,220
And now, you start to really narrow it down to see who can comprehend the book of Revelation.

2458
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,580
And there's nothing better than hiding a secret in plain sight.

2459
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,060
And the primer is held within.

2460
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,140
The code...

2461
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:48,500
In other words, years ago, if anyone knows about the American military, the Marines, they get all the hand-me-downs from the Navy and the Army.

2462
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:54,780
So, they develop technologies, weapons, communication devices for the Army and the Navy.

2463
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,960
And if it's too complicated or it's not popular, they just...

2464
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,980
old stuff, they hand it down to the Marines.

2465
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:08,360
So, they developed years ago an Army communication signal where it would scramble the signal and also send the...

2466
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,200
and unscramble and then scramble the signal in real time.

2467
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,600
So, whoever got it didn't know which was scrambled and which wasn't.

2468
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,180
And they had a code that would also change in real time.

2469
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,520
So, when it all got together, they'd have to piece it together very quick, chop, chop, chop, to get the signal.

2470
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,220
You see what I mean?

2471
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:33,140
Because the Army before, it was too complicated for them, but it was almost impossible to crack.

2472
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:43,220
Because sometimes it sent the clear signal and the enemy, let's say, would get it and think that it was coded and they would try to mix it up again, but it was the real thing.

2473
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:48,940
And then the next second it would be coded and they wouldn't know which way it was up, right?

2474
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:49,940
Right.

2475
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,540
So, it was a great system.

2476
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,420
It used fuzzy logic and all that.

2477
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:57,220
And the Army was like, oh, we're not used to it, man.

2478
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,660
It's either all coded or all non-coded.

2479
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,540
So, they said, okay, let's give this system to the Marines.

2480
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,920
Because, you know, it's a left-handed gun and the Marines were like, this is great.

2481
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
This is great.

2482
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,860
This is the best thing.

2483
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:16,180
We know for sure that when we send something across this, no one will figure it out.

2484
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,820
Because they can't tell if we're coding it or not.

2485
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,180
You see what I mean?

2486
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,560
So, here's the point on this.

2487
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:35,520
You can read scripture all you want, but if you don't wrap your mind around the book of Revelation, you're never going to see what's going on.

2488
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:36,940
That's a fact.

2489
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:41,640
That's why no one can explain the book of Revelation publicly.

2490
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:47,520
You get it?

2491
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:54,160
Because Revelation is clear sometimes and other times it's in code.

2492
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,320
Right?

2493
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:00,240
In other words, most people think when they read something that they think they understand, that's clear.

2494
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,900
And then something that's not understood, they think it's code.

2495
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,780
I'm telling you, it could be reverse.

2496
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,240
Some of the things that you think are clear is really the code.

2497
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,120
It's scrambled.

2498
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:15,080
And things that seem coded are clear.

2499
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,700
And it switches back and forth.

2500
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,700
But how do you discern that?

2501
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,000
By example.

2502
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,500
Remember?

2503
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:29,500
Remember the scripture says, you know, I'm going to repeat myself in the book of Isaiah, and I'm going to give you examples.

2504
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:29,800
Right?

2505
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:30,780
Right.

2506
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:31,220
Yeah.

2507
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,420
If Revelation is the...

2508
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,680
And I should have never gone...

2509
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,480
I'm the only person I think that's ever gone on in history saying that the book of Revelation is the first book of the Bible.

2510
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:41,640
Now, what does that mean?

2511
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,360
It's the blueprint.

2512
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,440
And Genesis is when you start putting the shovel to the ground.

2513
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:48,640
Okay.

2514
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,320
So, Revelation is past, present, and future.

2515
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:54,880
Altogether.

2516
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:55,860
Yes.

2517
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,500
It's really, all of it is the future.

2518
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,620
But it's in the time outside of what we consider any event that we know.

2519
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,640
Other events that we don't know.

2520
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:11,300
Because the writing of the book itself, where that information compiled, was an event unto itself.

2521
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,320
You see?

2522
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:23,400
So, then when you go through the scripture, you're going to figure out there is not only a numeric order to the books, right?

2523
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:29,940
But you're also going to see that there is a concentration of, you know, when most...

2524
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:40,380
You know, you have most of scripture with Moses, and then most of scripture around the time of King David, and then little bits here and there, and then a little bit of what they call the New Testament, right?

2525
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:42,720
Or a lot of it, allegedly.

2526
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,200
Right?

2527
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,920
And now we have nothing for 2,000 years.

2528
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:47,420
Right?

2529
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,420
Almost.

2530
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,000
1,900 years.

2531
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:50,320
Nothing.

2532
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:52,260
Right?

2533
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,460
Do you see the patterns?

2534
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,280
You know, there's nothing written for the first 2,000 some odd years.

2535
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,740
Actually, it depends on which man you're talking about.

2536
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:02,400
Right.

2537
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,460
The first man or Adam.

2538
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:18,060
But either way, once you start to look at these patterns, the actual symbology, in other words, when and how scripture was inspired for man to record it, is part of the code.

2539
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,740
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

2540
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:24,530
But you have to live it.

2541
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:33,170
And here's the thing, I think everybody needs to do what they do, but we're so closed right now that even if you did nothing, that's why very often I tell them, do nothing.

2542
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:34,790
Just wait it out.

2543
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,470
Food, clothing, and shelter.

2544
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:37,390
Yeah.

2545
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,890
You know, let's talk slave talk.

2546
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:44,130
Pay your bills, brush your teeth, go to sleep, work, repeat the cycle.

2547
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:44,790
Doesn't matter.

2548
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:53,130
And because here, in the end time, there are going to be people that are going to have a calling to do certain things.

2549
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:58,090
You know, knowledge-based, not physical, because you'll be squashed like a bug.

2550
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,410
And that's evident.

2551
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:05,550
We're not talking about lying to the people like all the ministers and preachers and rabbis and imams are doing.

2552
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:08,810
We're talking about, you know, real calling.

2553
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:11,790
Now, how do you know if you have a real calling?

2554
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:28,970
Because if you, your life is to do nothing, just support yourself and your family and just brush your teeth, watch TV, sleep, wash, you know, defecate, whatever you, the most basic biological stuff, and you are led in a way to do extraordinary things.

2555
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,290
That is not you doing it.

2556
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:35,390
You're one of those that has the calling, or being called, chosen and called.

2557
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:36,770
You see what I mean?

2558
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:45,450
Forget about, you know, there's no school of the prophets or let's go groom these people to go out in the world and tell people the truth.

2559
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,730
That's a bunch of shit, if you ask me.

2560
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:55,190
That's all platonic garbage that you see, you know, the adversary doing that, putting it in your mind.

2561
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:58,390
But if you lead a life where you are knowledge-based,

2562
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,610
and you know you have integrity and you know the truth,

2563
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:06,130
and your goal in life is to do nothing other than exist as lawfully as possible and study,

2564
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:11,630
and you find yourself being endowed with support,

2565
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,370
and whether it's financial, you know, physical support,

2566
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:22,610
you know, where not just, you know, people coming to help with your personal stuff,

2567
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:26,470
but to move a certain thing on without a message, without asking,

2568
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,930
that is the gods doing that.

2569
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,810
And this is the time period for that.

2570
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:35,430
So, that's why I always suggest, do nothing.

2571
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,490
And if you find yourself in extraordinary positions, that's the gods doing it.

2572
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,450
It's the gods doing it regardless.

2573
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:49,050
Like, if you see wealthy people, I've been in the presence of some of the wealthiest people around, on the planet, and they're idiots.

2574
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,150
I'm telling you.

2575
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:57,730
They're very savvy in certain aspects, and you can see that they were there because the gods put them there.

2576
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,250
Right?

2577
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:09,230
But what I would suggest is that if your goal in life is to do nothing, and you're put in extraordinary places, then you might be one of those that are not only called but chosen.

2578
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:12,030
So.

2579
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,150
Yeah.

2580
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:14,750
Well, this is an interesting...

2581
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:15,690
What does this all mean?

2582
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:26,990
You do it for your personal satisfaction, your personal, private, spiritual growth, which means absolutely nothing when you compare it to what you're going to have later anyway.

2583
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:39,070
Because right now, in order for you to learn and perceive, you're either going to have a direct download, you know, from the other side, or you're going to have to study, or hear it from someone else, and then study.

2584
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:40,010
Right?

2585
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:44,290
So, all that stuff is still minimal.

2586
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:50,410
And also, no matter how much you try to learn or whatever right now, you know how much of it has been censored out?

2587
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,170
I'm not talking about cosmic censorship now.

2588
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:58,370
How much of the truth has been hidden, from a, let's say, academic, for lack of a better term, point of view?

2589
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:02,690
You know, like, how many times have you heard, the burning of the Library of Alexandria?

2590
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,650
They keep saying that.

2591
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,490
The burning of the Library of Alexandria.

2592
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:09,310
But they never talk about the Library of Alexandria, because it wasn't burned.

2593
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,030
It was burned.

2594
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:11,310
The building was burned.

2595
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:15,030
And anything that was made a copy of was burned.

2596
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,550
You know what I mean?

2597
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:17,790
There are many copies.

2598
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:22,910
Remember years ago, going to the library, and there was more than one copy of a book?

2599
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:29,550
Well, you leave the copies, and a certain amount of copies, and whatever, and you burn the thing, and you tell people it's done.

2600
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,230
But it's not.

2601
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,090
All that stuff still exists.

2602
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,110
The majority of it.

2603
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:33,730
Yeah.

2604
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,910
But you don't have access to it.

2605
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,050
I don't have access to it.

2606
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,590
Bruce doesn't have access to it.

2607
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,830
Yeah.

2608
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:44,950
So, but later on, you won't need that to get knowledge.

2609
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,490
I mean, after the Resurrection.

2610
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,650
You see what I mean?

2611
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:48,270
Yeah.

2612
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,490
You'll be able to do direct download if you inquire.

2613
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:51,450
Yeah.

2614
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:54,010
So right now, again, so that's why I keep saying, why bother?

2615
01:33:54,890 --> 01:34:07,390
The real juicy stuff right now, all you're going to get right now in this life, or for anyone, doesn't matter who it is, unless you have internal access to this stuff on the physical realm, is a direct download from the gods.

2616
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:08,290
Right?

2617
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,910
Where, you know, that's where people ask people, where do ideas come from?

2618
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:11,310
I don't know.

2619
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:13,250
I was just doing this, and I got the idea.

2620
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,050
But remember, they have to do something.

2621
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:18,050
No one's ever invented anything sitting around all day.

2622
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,730
They're working on stuff, and an accident happens, right?

2623
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:22,070
That's the new invention.

2624
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,390
Or they're working on something that's a failure.

2625
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:27,990
Someone else is like, this can be a great thing if we used it like this.

2626
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:30,110
Like, you know, the Post-its, remember?

2627
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,610
Sure.

2628
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:31,070
Mm-hmm.

2629
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:36,030
Designed of super glue, and it didn't stick, you know, see, it didn't stick to anything.

2630
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,650
And the secretary says, this stuff is great.

2631
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,870
Can you give me more of them?

2632
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:40,810
And if you look at the...

2633
01:34:40,810 --> 01:35:00,490
I just happened to glance at a little bit of study on Trevor, and he was mentioning how the study of the ether came about by an accident of a guy stepping on a pipe and watching over a lake and how it changed.

2634
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:05,050
Well, that was more on the weather.

2635
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,990
The ether was before that.

2636
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:08,590
Okay.

2637
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:10,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2638
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,890
Well, Wilhelm Reich was biological forces.

2639
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:14,030
Oh, that's neat.

2640
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:14,410
Yes.

2641
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:28,210
Yeah, well, they were building at his HQ up in Maine and the construction site, some pipes went into a puddle, and he would notice a shimmer in the atmosphere every time he did it.

2642
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:28,590
Yeah.

2643
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:29,130
Yeah.

2644
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:32,370
Well, right now, that's been evolved.

2645
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:34,450
Weather work has been evolved.

2646
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:39,250
Like, imagine what telephones and TVs looked like back in the 50s.

2647
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:39,950
Mm-hmm.

2648
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:40,270
Right.

2649
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:43,890
And what telephones and TVs are like now.

2650
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:45,650
Right?

2651
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:46,390
Wow.

2652
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:55,490
Now, if you go on the Internet, all these weather devices, cloudbusters and Trevor's stuff, that's 30-, 40-year-old TVs and phones, cell phones or whatever.

2653
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:59,270
Right now, what exists is like a modern TV.

2654
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:03,350
We've evolved it to the point where it's unrecognizable as such.

2655
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,280
Like everything else.

2656
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:08,660
Yeah.

2657
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,520
So, and I was one of the last people to work with Trevor before he passed.

2658
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:19,300
The last time I spoke to Trevor, his wife said, well, he's in a hospice right now, and that was it, you know.

2659
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:19,880
Wow.

2660
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,960
So, that was years ago.

2661
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:40,060
But I remember we were sending, I have a box of his personal notes and things that he sent me, and I sent, I would build certain experimental things and send them to him back and forth in the mail, and he, well, the last time, one of the few last times we spoke was, I don't understand how it works, but it does work, he said.

2662
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,020
So, I knew I was on the right track.

2663
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:46,360
So, that's what I mean about, right now it's, it's not on the internet.

2664
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:51,180
It's evolved to the point, all I do, basically, regarding weather stuff is tell people the principle.

2665
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:55,940
Take a piece of metal and wrap it in non-metallic material, put a mirror on the back.

2666
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:56,680
Yeah.

2667
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,320
You know, for starters.

2668
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:09,200
That's, and even the water guns now are evolved to the point where they're over a hundred times more efficient than what Wilhelm Reich was doing.

2669
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:13,160
Right now we can do anywhere on the planet.

2670
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,600
Not just locally.

2671
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,260
From one location.

2672
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,460
So.

2673
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,080
I don't understand.

2674
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:21,840
And that's, truth in it, yeah.

2675
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:22,420
Yeah.

2676
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:25,300
We can do weather, it doesn't matter where you are.

2677
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,880
Because it's the ether, right?

2678
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:27,660
Right.

2679
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:28,620
Right.

2680
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:29,520
Princeton, it's everywhere.

2681
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,020
You can do weather on the moon.

2682
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,160
So.

2683
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:41,340
And by the way, if anyone wants to discuss that, if you have a pretty good telescope and you're at a high altitude, just pick a crater on the moon.

2684
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,080
You don't have to name them.

2685
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,500
You could look up, you know, whatever you like.

2686
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,580
And start observing it.

2687
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:47,400
Right?

2688
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,000
You film it or whatever, right?

2689
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:50,640
You can even have a four-inch telescope.

2690
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,660
I have an eight-inch Dobsonian, which is pretty good, with a two-inch thickness fastener, so it's very stable.

2691
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:19,300
But, if you study any of the craters night after night, well, actually the moon changes every day, but if you study, if you start learning the features on the craters, and sometimes you look at the feature, let's say the rim of a crater, and you can't get it in physics, or you don't see it, but minutes later you do, guess why?

2692
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:22,880
Because that's a cloud over the crater.

2693
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,160
Asteric cloud.

2694
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,400
Like, imagine, so let me give you another example.

2695
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:36,880
If you were on the moon with a telescope looking in the direction of space, you would insist on things, no matter how high.

2696
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,580
The tallest buildings wouldn't really show up.

2697
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:48,220
You would have to take a photograph of it, and then put it on a big screen, and start magnifying and looking at it very carefully.

2698
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,440
And it would be a blur.

2699
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,460
Manhattan, you wouldn't see any of the streets, right?

2700
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,540
Because of what's called reflectivity.

2701
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,060
Mm-hmm.

2702
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:01,500
Have you ever been on an airplane and looked down at, like, a big parking lot, all the cars look the same?

2703
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:07,120
How can they all look the same when there are, like, silver cars, blue cars, red cars, white cars?

2704
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:14,840
Well, when you get to a certain distance and the sunlight is so intense, they all have the same reflectivity, and you can't tell what color anything is anymore.

2705
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:15,760
Mm-hmm.

2706
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,380
So now let's put this in reverse.

2707
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:26,800
If we're on Earth looking at the moon, you really can't see what's going on until you really study it, and then you're going to see there is tremendous activity there.

2708
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:32,840
I mean, it looks like Tokyo, if you really want to get into it, or New York City looks primitive.

2709
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:38,680
Anyway, if you want to get more information, there's a guy that has integrity.

2710
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:39,540
He doesn't...

2711
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,820
He's pretty censored, but he does...

2712
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:44,100
It's called Bruce Stiesow.

2713
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:55,060
And there's another guy called Alien Hunter, I think, and he puts up just photos that NASA had from the lunar orbiter in the 60s before they started transferring everything digitally.

2714
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,360
Okay.

2715
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,720
And you could look at them, and you see, like, streets.

2716
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,640
You ever see, like, go to Google Maps, put in Manhattan, streets treat you from the top.

2717
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,480
Satellite view, you see a grid pattern, right?

2718
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,420
New buildings, you know?

2719
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:07,540
So...

2720
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,620
So, I mean, the moon is a very active place.

2721
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,760
It has an atmosphere and all that.

2722
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,580
So, what does this have to do with the heat?

2723
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,480
That's a really loud cicada.

2724
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:17,500
That is.

2725
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:29,740
So, my point here is when I talk about the ether, it's as common as cities and other things are that we consider.

2726
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:46,860
You know, applesauce, chocolate pudding, biscuits, poppy seed muffins, anything you see, an elephant, a house, a bird or a plane, anything you see and can acknowledge, the ether is in all of that.

2727
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,200
It's everywhere, right?

2728
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:55,160
So, the commonality that you see here on earth, you can somewhat...

2729
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:05,120
I'm not going to put my foot down and say the moon is inhabited and all that, but you will see man-made structures or made structures on the moon that just look like any...

2730
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,180
whatever.

2731
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:07,440
You know?

2732
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:16,620
But what's interesting is if the earth was no longer inhabited after a few dozen years, it would...

2733
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:20,960
looking down at a city, the overgrowth would start taking over, right?

2734
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,980
Or if you lived near a desert, the streets would be full of...

2735
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,440
about a foot full of sand.

2736
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,100
You wouldn't see the asphalt anymore.

2737
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:29,640
You see?

2738
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:35,200
Even now, if everybody left in Manhattan, within about 30 or 40 years, you wouldn't see the streets anymore.

2739
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,660
It would be full of sand and dirt and dust.

2740
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:38,880
You know?

2741
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:55,600
So, if you imagine what you're looking at when you're looking at other planets and you start to see the level of development on the moon, it really hits you across the head like something...

2742
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,260
you know.

2743
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,140
But anyway.

2744
01:41:59,040 --> 01:41:59,340
Yeah.

2745
01:41:59,460 --> 01:41:59,800
Yeah.

2746
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,580
You know how you say you've been lied to and you know things told you?

2747
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,960
Do you really want to know more?

2748
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,240
Because, you know how I say, who are you going to tell it to?

2749
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,240
And like Sam used to always say, it doesn't matter.

2750
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,520
But after a point, it does, because you'll realize you're on your own.

2751
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,300
So that brought up the thing on the moon, because yes, you can do weather on the moon.

2752
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:25,680
But don't do it when it's like a full moon, because that's like doing stuff on high noon and you're competing with the sun.

2753
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:30,120
So, that's a whole other discussion.

2754
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,620
I think weather work and...

2755
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,800
you know, we discussed the body and dreams.

2756
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,380
I think going into...

2757
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,420
developing these subjects publicly is for the next society, not for this one.

2758
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:46,060
Still very interesting.

2759
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:47,180
It is.

2760
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:47,600
Yeah.

2761
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,080
Especially if you could decrease suffering.

2762
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,780
I don't like using...

2763
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,600
You know, we like to in common use to help someone, but who cares?

2764
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,620
No one...

2765
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:59,480
You know, people like to say that because it makes them feel good to help someone.

2766
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:10,040
But the reality is if you really are on a higher level, operating on a higher level, at this point in human existence, you do it to decrease their suffering.

2767
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:10,780
You get it?

2768
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:11,580
Yeah.

2769
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:12,900
Because you really can't help anyone.

2770
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:17,820
Yeah.

2771
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,880
I can see that.

2772
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:24,700
It's to decrease suffering.

2773
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:31,860
Because even the healthiest, most affluent person is still experiencing some level of suffering if they are learning the truth.

2774
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:32,840
Sure.

2775
01:43:36,290 --> 01:44:00,750
And it's interesting to not ponder, and just to bring this up again, the level of people that has been adopted by the human race, across the board, any religion, any country, any race or whatever, should not be pondered much because once you understand how much it is cosmic censorship and how much of it is their inherent evil, we will not know until later.

2776
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:01,970
Only the gods know that.

2777
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:02,930
Right?

2778
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:09,510
Because the gods do have earmarked certain people for destruction, even though they won't be resurrected.

2779
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:17,690
The gods, you know, it does consider certain races, family lines, nationalities to be downright evil.

2780
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,650
But we don't...

2781
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:24,310
I mean, other than what scripture, you know, tells us explicitly, we don't know.

2782
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,210
And that should be kept in mind.

2783
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:34,050
Because if there's this wiping out large swaths of their population, that's the error that they had.

2784
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:36,830
Because they were trying to do the job of the gods.

2785
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:42,110
The gods will start wiping out very large swaths of humanity for that reason.

2786
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:45,910
I don't think any human is capable of doing it for that reason.

2787
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:50,890
We just don't know who's censored and who's not.

2788
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:51,710
You know what I mean?

2789
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:53,250
So...

2790
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:59,550
I can tell you that the majority of the people on the planet are just downright no good and evil.

2791
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,110
And what I'm saying, I'm saying from a biblical point of view, not from what they think.

2792
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,090
You know?

2793
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:08,370
Yeah.

2794
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:10,070
They have no idea.

2795
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:13,810
Because if you boil it down, also, they're just property.

2796
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:19,930
Most people on the planet, except for a few thousand people, are viewed as property.

2797
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:25,190
Like a chair, or a shoe, or a sock, or a lawn that needs to be mowed.

2798
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,200
So, don't buy into the bullshit.

2799
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:34,000
That's how they're viewed, by the leadership.

2800
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,720
I'm not talking about the politicians, either.

2801
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:39,150
Yeah.

2802
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:53,100
And I don't think scripture exhausts one's inability or rubs the reader in a way that they have to find out who is who.

2803
01:45:54,100 --> 01:46:03,080
That's why very often you'll see a very general, you know, when it says, the king of the north, why scripture couldn't give you his exact name and physical description?

2804
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,340
Of course it could.

2805
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,860
The reason why it just says the leader of the north is because it's a secret.

2806
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,080
And it's meant to be that way.

2807
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:14,800
Yeah.

2808
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:21,080
Yet there's hundreds of thousands of YouTubes just on that.

2809
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,540
And none of it's true.

2810
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:23,940
It's stupid.

2811
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:25,420
None of it's true.

2812
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,480
Oh, you mean, oh, the people attempting...

2813
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,960
Yeah, people attempting that.

2814
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:30,620
Oh, yeah.

2815
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:34,580
Explaining this, explaining that, the total confusion.

2816
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,040
The people that know don't go on YouTube.

2817
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,060
Right.

2818
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,920
True, I'll tell you that for sure.

2819
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:42,720
No, yes.

2820
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,160
Uh-huh, scripture, yeah.

2821
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:44,600
Yeah.

2822
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:52,820
But, you know, people watch those things as in going to temples, church, etc.

2823
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,320
And they think they know.

2824
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,400
And they're positive.

2825
01:46:58,020 --> 01:46:58,960
That's the answer.

2826
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,820
Well, here's the other aspect of it.

2827
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:13,120
You know, I remember I said that if you pass through the planet and you pointed at the earth and said, this is the planet that's inhabited by the sons and daughters of the adversary, Satan, that would be very accurate.

2828
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:13,740
Right?

2829
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,780
Meaning, sons and daughters doesn't mean that's your spiritual father.

2830
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:17,720
Spiritual, yeah.

2831
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:18,040
Yeah.

2832
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:22,400
Because when you say your father, you have the biological one and then you have the spiritual one.

2833
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:30,900
And that's why in a lot of religious sense they call priests father because that's where you get your law and your right and wrong and your spiritual father, right?

2834
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,700
The spiritual father of humanity is the adversary, the Satan.

2835
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:41,360
So, that's why the most deplorable thing you still have people out there saying you're branding someone as a Satanist.

2836
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,840
They're not.

2837
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,980
They're all Satanists on this planet.

2838
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:47,540
So if they're all Satanists, who are you going to point a finger to, you see?

2839
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:51,120
If everything is all black, well, you know, point to the black.

2840
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,340
If everything is all hot, point to the hot.

2841
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:53,700
You can't.

2842
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,440
You need a contrast.

2843
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,080
And the contrast is not public.

2844
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:02,240
It's all, it's pretty much all, it's like a monopoly.

2845
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,760
There's a satanic monopoly on this planet.

2846
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:05,880
Adversarial, right?

2847
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:17,400
But, keeping that in mind, right, if one were to encounter that being known as the chief adversary, do you know what he would be saying to you?

2848
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,060
Everything that comes out of his mouth would be scripture, against you.

2849
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,240
It's not like the way Hollywood, you know, remember?

2850
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

2851
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,280
The power of Christ compels you, like the exorcist.

2852
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:30,280
That's all a bunch of crap.

2853
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:40,200
And by the way, when these Catholics, you know, engage in these demonic exorcisms, those are demons that follow them around, specifically, anyway.

2854
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,240
Those are minor demons.

2855
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:44,680
That's not Satan, by the way, the chief adversary.

2856
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:47,380
Those are minor, you know.

2857
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:55,200
But anyway, the point here is this, there is a monopoly on this insanity.

2858
01:48:56,180 --> 01:49:02,500
That's why, again, you know, how much of it is censorship, and how much of them are inherent in this, dedicated.

2859
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:05,780
Because, let me just clarify one point about inherent.

2860
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:09,120
You know, the bloodline, the familiar thing.

2861
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:14,020
Going back a long time, there are people on this planet who have dedicated themselves to evil.

2862
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:19,680
And you wouldn't know if your grandparents, or great, great, great, great, great, you know, parents were part of that group.

2863
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,320
You know what I mean?

2864
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:27,540
That's why it's good to renounce ancestry, doing the opposite of what the Asians do, which is worship them.

2865
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,100
You know?

2866
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:34,340
Like, for example, I renounce anyone that came before me in my private space to the gods.

2867
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:40,460
I'm like, I don't want anything to do with the people that came before me, if I can spiritually, because I don't know anything about them.

2868
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:41,040
Yeah.

2869
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:49,220
And at this point, I don't want to know anything about them, and don't attach what I want to do, what will I want to perform here, with their stuff.

2870
01:49:50,300 --> 01:50:00,260
So, what I'm saying is that there are people that have dedicated themselves to dark forces, that still, their progeny, in other words, their generation still exists.

2871
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:04,380
The people that still exist don't know that, but the gods do.

2872
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,080
The gods see that, you see.

2873
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:13,060
That's what I mean by the inherent evil that exists in the world.

2874
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:32,560
So, but the interesting thing is, um, uh, well, I don't know, there's a lot, actually, I don't know what to say first here, but there's a lot of interesting aspects to it, and like you said earlier, on the YouTubes and all this stuff, none of this stuff is out in the public, in accuracy.

2875
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:46,820
There are those that have tried, look what, in the mid-1800s, they tried real hard, they got the rupture, the rapture, when it didn't come, you know, the end of the world didn't come, you know, they got people who sell their stuff, and all that, so it created the rapture, or rupture, or whatever.

2876
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:56,960
And then, uh, in the mid-50s in America, you had the Armstrongism, uh, the evangelists, you know, uh, all that, a bunch of crock of stuff, and then you had the Ernest L.

2877
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:58,520
Martin's crock of crap again.

2878
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:09,560
They all, they all did a little bit of work that brought stuff to the surface, but as a whole, you need to discount them and put them aside when you understand this was all a secret.

2879
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:10,440
Yeah.

2880
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:27,080
And also, you can go back even hundreds of years, forget about the Catholic Church and all that other stuff, but all these guys I mentioned in the 20th century, they did it for the money also, and to make, they, like, um, the evangelists and all the other guys that came after them, they have some books that have some notable things in them.

2881
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:42,420
What you'll see is that they still use the J-E-S-U-S, and they use the G-O-D, fervently, and they use the Christian term, okay, and I've confronted some of them, and I've said this many times, and the reason why they do that is because they want to make a living doing that.

2882
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,560
That's how much faith they have.

2883
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:56,780
In other words, they, I've had some of them, I say this again, they say, well, Greek, if we tell people that you can't keep time with the Pope's work schedule, no one's going to want to buy our books or listen to us.

2884
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,260
So that's how much faith they have.

2885
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,040
And they, and they know that.

2886
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,100
Oh, yeah.

2887
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:02,940
They know.

2888
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:09,600
Yeah, I've run into people that were around me, Armstrong, since the 50s and 60s, worked for them, and Ernest L.

2889
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:18,720
Martin and all those guys, and I brought up the points about the Pope's work schedule and using the names, and they're like, oh, yeah, no, no, we can't do that because that'll divide us.

2890
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,160
Oh, boy.

2891
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,700
And we won't buy our books.

2892
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:26,120
And, you know, we get $4,000 a month from this and that.

2893
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:45,040
I'm like, oh, man, you guys are a bunch of, you know, they talk about good Christians and real Christians, and they're like, oh, by the way, that's, if you see the J-E-S-U-S and the Christian come out of anything, it's, you're going to be, now you're sifting for corn and poop.

2894
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,220
That's a pile, a big pile of poop.

2895
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:57,340
All the Ernest Martin stuff and the, and the, the stuff that came out of the Worldwide Church of God and other stuff, that's a huge pile of poop.

2896
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,140
You need to go through there and find some corn if you want to.

2897
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:01,820
It's all poop.

2898
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,980
And these people are, I'll pass.

2899
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:04,720
I'll pass.

2900
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:05,540
Oh, yeah.

2901
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,980
It doesn't mean you, you know, if you put a clothespin on your nose, you can go through it.

2902
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:14,580
Fortunately, there are a lot of other people that have gone through it that you can pull out the good stuff.

2903
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:15,960
Sure.

2904
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:17,080
You know.

2905
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:35,160
But all of these people are always looking to support themselves based on the status quo, which was Christianity and Asclepius, you know, the J-E-S-U-S character, and all the versions that they have, and they focus on the writings of Paul.

2906
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,820
How many, you know, you don't even have the New Testament.

2907
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:48,560
I've even said many times to people, go online, do a cursory observe, search, how many verses have been added and taken away from the New Testament?

2908
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:49,940
There's plenty of websites on that now.

2909
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,580
There weren't, there wasn't nothing on there ten years ago.

2910
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:53,360
Yeah.

2911
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:54,460
Now there is.

2912
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:00,100
And they, and that way they tell you this verse was added and they'll give you the reasons how and why.

2913
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:02,240
So...

2914
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:02,640
Yeah.

2915
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,560
So even if you have a K-J-V New Testament, that's poop.

2916
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:09,320
You're going to have to go in there and look at the corn.

2917
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:10,260
Find the corn.

2918
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,080
I'm telling you, it's really that bad.

2919
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:13,980
You don't have the New Testament.

2920
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:16,400
You don't have anything like that.

2921
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:30,500
You have versions of it that are so far removed from the contextual information that if you said it does not exist in an integral form that's very accurate to say that.

2922
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:31,820
It has no integrity.

2923
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:37,380
But you're going to have to, for example, Sabrinthi's saying that the New Testament is poop and you shouldn't read it.

2924
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,640
No, I'm saying it is poop, but you should read it.

2925
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:52,840
You're going to have to go through there and really pick out, you're going to have to do your research, find out, you know, what the Catholic Church put in, what the, uh, uh, what the academics put in, what they took out.

2926
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:55,400
But I'll tell you this for sure.

2927
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,800
This is for sure.

2928
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:57,280
The New Testament is poop.

2929
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:04,940
And I don't say guarantee, but I will guarantee you and assure you, I usually say assure because only the gods can guarantee, but let's say as close to a guarantee as possible.

2930
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:14,060
If you don't have a full comprehension of Mosaic Law, you will be wrapped around the axle and you will never understand the integrity of the New Testament.

2931
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:18,940
And you will not be able to see the mistakes in the New Testament.

2932
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:32,600
There are huge mistakes that are contrary to, uh, so if I were to tell you the New Testament and the testimony of the Christ does not exist in an integral form, that is absolutely accurate.

2933
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:37,520
Is there a body of work known as the New Testament that needs to be gone through and researched?

2934
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:38,140
Absolutely.

2935
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:38,820
Yes.

2936
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:39,760
For sure.

2937
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:40,720
It needs to be looked at.

2938
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,680
And that was beyond graduate level.

2939
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:46,400
Yeah.

2940
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:48,880
And it's getting a little late for that, right?

2941
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:50,200
Oh, yeah.

2942
01:55:50,220 --> 01:56:00,720
It's getting late, but it will be done because it's promised that it will be, it will be, uh, exposed to the world and then, but it will be very late, won't be now, won't be for another decade or so.

2943
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:01,120
Uh-huh.

2944
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:01,980
Yeah.

2945
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,840
Yeah, well, you know, take Paul for instance.

2946
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:14,600
Um, you know, people that, yeah, there are people who have built, oh, how many denominations just on a few things that he had to say.

2947
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:15,800
Yeah, all of them.

2948
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:16,460
Yeah.

2949
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:17,920
Or it wasn't even true.

2950
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:25,960
I mean, he's a woman hater, uh, women, women can't do this, women can't do that.

2951
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:29,660
Um, et cetera.

2952
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,540
But it's all out of context.

2953
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:33,860
Yeah, he, he didn't, actually.

2954
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,200
He doesn't hate women.

2955
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:41,880
No, no, you, you also told the whole thing of, of, of Wilbur's writings as prospect anyway.

2956
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:42,600
Yeah.

2957
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,360
Yeah.

2958
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,960
You know, because he's not an apostle.

2959
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:50,500
So, you might be of a different, because he was, he never met the Christ.

2960
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:53,280
Yeah, and who was he speaking to also?

2961
01:56:54,340 --> 01:57:05,360
Yeah, there's a lot of problems with it, but, here's the thing, if you, and also if you understand, uh, um, the writings of Paul, I've gone through them, and I said, ooh, this is beyond graduate level also.

2962
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:10,480
This is here, this is the stumbling block that Isaiah spoke about to many.

2963
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:11,600
Yeah.

2964
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:22,500
if you, like for example, if you go to, uh, third, fourth graders, uh, and give them a university theoretical calculus book, what are they going to get out of it?

2965
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,600
Nothing.

2966
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:31,440
They're going to recognize in the equation the numbers, because they know from one, if you know zero to nine you can make all the numbers, right?

2967
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:36,260
That's all, and outside of that, there may be an equals sign and a parenthesis, they know nothing.

2968
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:48,540
So, what they, what the powers that be did for thousands of, of millennia, at least, uh, is they put the writings of Paul, where they knew you wouldn't understand it, because before that they would only put it in a foreign language, like Latin.

2969
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:49,840
Right?

2970
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:57,900
So, now they said, no, let's keep confounding them, let's give them the language they understand, we'll put Paul in front of them, which they will totally screw them up.

2971
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,240
And that's perfect.

2972
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:11,140
That's exactly what, what you, if you're flying by the planet, uh, and said, these are, you know, these are the adversaries' children here, you, you want to confuse a bunch of idiots, give them the writings of Paul.

2973
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:21,040
Because Paul, uh, just to make a long story short, he was an ex-parishion, he was in the high political in the priesthood, right?

2974
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:30,960
And he was well-studied, he had the best education money can buy, that's brought up, because not only did he have the best education money can buy, he had the best political status money can buy, right?

2975
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:33,900
Because, he says, I had bought my citizenship, right?

2976
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,940
So he had the best stuff that money can buy.

2977
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:36,560
Yeah.

2978
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,480
But ultimately, even today, if you have the best education money can buy, is that a real education, or is it still part of the bullshit?

2979
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,520
Part of it.

2980
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:55,880
But what people don't understand is that, uh, back then, in the Judean culture, even though he was not a Judean, it was the Benjamite, Benjamite, yeah.

2981
01:58:56,180 --> 01:59:02,280
Yeah, uh, he, uh, he still had to be prolific in the law, he still had to know the law.

2982
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:03,860
You see?

2983
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:12,800
So he knew that, uh, but the political sense, and also his mission, was very, very disturbing, because he went to people that didn't know the law.

2984
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,180
Right.

2985
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:14,460
Right.

2986
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,840
So he had to tell them that don't, basically, this is the message of Paul in a nutshell.

2987
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:25,920
All that pagan shit that you're told, you die, you go to heaven, or hell, or past lives, and future lives, is all bullshit.

2988
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:27,040
Um,

2989
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:27,640
you, you,

2990
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,680
you could rest assure

2991
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,400
that the truth has been

2992
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:30,860
exposed,

2993
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,040
because the Christ came,

2994
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:32,880
he died,

2995
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:33,660
and was resurrected,

2996
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,700
so now we know exactly

2997
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:35,820
what is meant by the

2998
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:36,280
resurrection,

2999
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,980
because we've had

3000
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:39,180
physical proof of it,

3001
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,420
and, uh,

3002
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,040
if you don't know

3003
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:41,920
what I'm talking about,

3004
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,020
which you probably don't,

3005
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:43,880
because you know nothing

3006
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,060
other than that pagan

3007
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:45,440
bullshit,

3008
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:46,380
you're going to have to

3009
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:47,600
eventually study the law.

3010
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:55,080
But when you study the law, you have to keep in mind that you're going to die anyway, and what happens after you die is what the Christ showed us.

3011
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,180
And that is all the writing of Paul in a nutshell.

3012
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:58,280
Yeah.

3013
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:03,600
And also, basically, by the way, uh, the law, you know why the law brings death?

3014
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:04,980
You know, he says that?

3015
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:09,780
If you're in a pagan culture, and you insist on biblical law, what are they going to do to you?

3016
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:10,720
They'll kill you.

3017
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,440
Right.

3018
02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:12,960
Yeah.

3019
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:14,900
Yep.

3020
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,620
And that's reading out of it.

3021
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:31,440
And also, when he spoke to the pagans or the non-Judeans about the law, they didn't like it, because they didn't know Mosaic law, they knew the Paradishim, what's called the Halakha law, which was the law that, uh, next to the law that prevented you from breaking the law, right?

3022
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:33,340
Like, you know what Halakha is?

3023
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,000
It's a hedge.

3024
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:37,660
So, let's say the Mosaic law says don't eat pork.

3025
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:49,320
Well, the Halakha would be, well then, let's not, let's prohibit pigs from being in the country, because if there are no pigs in the country, then people can't break the law, you know, transgress by eating pork.

3026
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:49,940
Yeah.

3027
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:51,960
But they, see, because that makes it very hard.

3028
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:59,340
So, for example, if the law, the Mosaic law says be in by sundown, the Halakha says you have to be in two hours by sundown.

3029
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:01,660
Right?

3030
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:09,220
And so what happens is they force the people and enforce the two hours before sundown, but those that know the law, they don't do it.

3031
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:17,420
They just come in at sundown, but see, so that's why I said you force the law on the people, it's like a heavy burden, but to you, you don't rest a finger.

3032
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:23,580
He's not talking about the Mosaic, he's talking about the laws that they put the people Put on the people to control them.

3033
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:35,940
To control them, to prevent them from breaking the law, from transgressing the law, by making other laws that surround the law, so if you at least follow those, there's no way you're going to fall into transgression.

3034
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:40,240
So, you know, a very simple one is the pork example.

3035
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:41,920
You know, don't eat pork.

3036
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:52,320
You know, you might want to have pigs on the farm because they serve a purpose as scavengers and for the soup, compost, and all that.

3037
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:57,620
But, you know, if there's starvation, if there's hunger, you might slaughter and eat it for its meat.

3038
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:00,080
But, you know, I'd rather eat grass.

3039
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:07,620
So if they decide no pigs in the country, then even if there's starvation, they still can't, you know, transgress that, you see.

3040
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:14,280
So, it's much harder to do the, it's harder on the people to do the halakha, which is the hedge.

3041
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,120
I'm sure.

3042
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:16,480
But Christ knew that.

3043
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:35,220
That's why he says ask for a hedge of protection around you, meaning like if you know what the law of the gods is, then develop in your mind systems that go beyond that so that you don't approach the borderline.

3044
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:35,880
You know what I mean?

3045
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:36,520
Yeah.

3046
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:48,960
You know, there's a lot of, but basically I broke down Paul in a nutshell, which will never be understood if you call yourself Christian, by the way.

3047
02:02:50,240 --> 02:03:00,300
And if you're Christian, you will never comprehend the Bible, I'll tell you that for sure, because what happens there is that you you will be censored.

3048
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:09,840
If you're censored enough to be limited and not renounce those religions, whether it's Islam, Judaism, or Christianity, because Judaism, by the way, is Babylonian, you know.

3049
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:10,700
Sure, sure.

3050
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:15,160
It's not a religion as much as it is a tradition that's become a religion.

3051
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:31,640
So, I don't know, what I do, well, I mean, in other words, the reason why I say I don't know is like, what angle do you take on describing and explaining what people are engaging in with their religion, their education, and their beliefs?

3052
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:32,880
I mean, there's so many angles.

3053
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,840
It's just, yeah, it's overwhelming.

3054
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,940
It's overwhelming, it's screwed up.

3055
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:37,340
Yeah.

3056
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:46,180
But the thing that isn't overwhelming and screwed up is that when the gods make it right, it's going to be right, where man can't do it right now.

3057
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:59,800
And the very simple thing is the, is, um, this is still the least, from a legal point of view, the least of the earth and its inhabitants is to the adversary.

3058
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:01,220
Right?

3059
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:23,280
So, when that lease runs up and it's time for his eviction or his containment, then that time, so these are things that are beyond human power and beyond, again, to bring it up again for the third time, this is the mistake that these dictators made through the ages, thinking that if they eliminate a group of the population or a certain group of people, they're going to fix things.

3060
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,920
That doesn't work, right, from a human perspective.

3061
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:28,440
Only the gods can do that properly.

3062
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:30,840
Yeah.

3063
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,580
Yeah.

3064
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:37,540
To say those things shouldn't be done is foolish from a, from a cosmic, divine censorship.

3065
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:38,060
Why?

3066
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,200
Not because I believe so or my liking or liking, because the gods say so.

3067
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:47,880
Um, speaking of the adversary, when did he get his lease?

3068
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:49,740
When was he given his lease?

3069
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:51,140
That's...

3070
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:56,460
Sometime around, sometime around, um, well, that's an interesting thing because there's options.

3071
02:04:56,940 --> 02:05:03,260
It would have either been in the sixth day or the eighth day, so it would have been 6,000 years ago or 8,000 years ago.

3072
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,960
It's not that clear, but I would say, I would presume 8,000 years ago.

3073
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:11,260
Yeah.

3074
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:13,800
But not with a different intention.

3075
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:22,160
It's kind of like you get a lease to a place to live in and now you're going to run a, and then later on, you, not only do you live there, but you run a business out of it.

3076
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:23,860
Right?

3077
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:29,140
It's like someone gets an apartment just to live and then they run a home business out of it and it changes.

3078
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:31,500
Mm-hmm.

3079
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:32,080
Yeah.

3080
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:32,960
Yeah.

3081
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:39,700
Because right now, it's, uh, you know, it's to the point where, you know, actually, go ahead.

3082
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:40,820
You were going to say something?

3083
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:41,000
No.

3084
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:48,020
He had a responsibility, um, um, I think that was from Ezekiel of...

3085
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:48,300
Right.

3086
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,380
Certain things, precious things.

3087
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:49,560
Yeah.

3088
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,400
Yeah.

3089
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:55,020
And he was pulled from that position from a cosmic level.

3090
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:56,420
He was pulled from that to do this.

3091
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:59,920
But also, keep in mind the time already ended.

3092
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:04,700
You know, I've mentioned before, you're in the credits right now, so one thing about the lease is it could have ended already.

3093
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:05,600
Mm-hmm.

3094
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,860
You know, and you have the grace period now to get out.

3095
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:17,400
So, just from, from an informationalist point of view, I would suggest that his lease already ended roughly 20 years ago.

3096
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:20,120
And this is just the grace period.

3097
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,640
I would, I would suggest from a legal point of view, cosmic legal, legality, that it ended.

3098
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:26,200
Yeah.

3099
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:27,880
Yeah.

3100
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:33,720
Because, you know, even when your lease ends, they give you, it's like, you know, when you're late on the rent, what do they give you?

3101
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:36,600
Five, ten days some places, seven days, three days, depends.

3102
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:40,800
Yeah, so the grace period to, yeah, I think it already ended 20 years ago.

3103
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:51,180
These things are, you know, things that need to be, inquiry needs to be done on and, uh, they need to be rationalized.

3104
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:57,320
It can't be, well, the worst thing anybody can say is, well, this guy said this, and I like him, so I'm going to go with that.

3105
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,880
Or the worst thing is, I want to know what your take on this, what do you mean, my take?

3106
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:04,680
What is this, like Hollywood, take one, take two?

3107
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,820
What do you mean, my take?

3108
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:06,740
Yeah.

3109
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:10,240
You know, or what your opinion is, you know, who cares?

3110
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:16,600
Those things are, in the future, will be dealt with in great severity regarding matters of importance.

3111
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:17,540
Mm-hmm.

3112
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,480
In a negative way or any severity.

3113
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:25,770
That's sort of the adversary stuff.

3114
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:41,990
Again, if, if the state of mankind has been this way for thousands of years, so, you know, if you look at, give you an example, the state that has been preserved, this, this fucked up state, to use the medical term there, Mm-hmm.

3115
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:55,190
uh, for thousands of years of mankind, now, the, the contrast here is, if you look, go to look at a stone inscription that's five or six thousand years old, no matter how deep they carved it, it's going to look pretty freakin' worn out.

3116
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:56,650
Mm-hmm.

3117
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:58,090
From weathering and whatever.

3118
02:07:58,650 --> 02:08:01,290
Unless it's buried deep underground under heavy protection.

3119
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:13,750
But I'm telling you that the, the, uh, the, the screwed up stuff that mankind has been involved in is just as sharp as the day that it was chiseled into, you know, into him.

3120
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:15,030
Yeah.

3121
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:16,150
Over time.

3122
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:18,230
It has not worn away.

3123
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:19,470
It's gotten worse, actually.

3124
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:21,670
But how do you notice?

3125
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:25,590
You know, if you're brought up in a certain culture, what you consider is right is right.

3126
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:26,910
It doesn't mean that it's right.

3127
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:30,030
It's just that because you were raised believing it's right.

3128
02:08:30,090 --> 02:08:30,290
Yeah.

3129
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:30,930
Tradition.

3130
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:31,850
Yeah.

3131
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:32,370
And culture.

3132
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:33,430
Yeah.

3133
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:34,630
Tradition and culture.

3134
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:35,750
Yeah.

3135
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:37,630
Yeah.

3136
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:44,390
So, again, when I say why bother and do nothing, it's because of that, tradition and culture.

3137
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:45,150
Yeah.

3138
02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:55,850
I mean, you know, I think, well, you can look at your life and think, not your life, but, wow, what a waste, you know?

3139
02:08:55,950 --> 02:08:56,930
I didn't know all of that.

3140
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:58,050
No one told me that.

3141
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:00,890
Well, it's a waste because you're tired.

3142
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:02,230
Yeah.

3143
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:08,770
Because, you know, you get sick, you're subject to injury, you're subject to aging.

3144
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:11,090
That's why it seems like a waste.

3145
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:23,110
If you came into this world, grew up, lived a physical, in physical perfection, and then you were taken out, I don't think you would say it was a waste because the purpose would be more clear.

3146
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:33,810
But because there's so much suffering in the meantime where you're subject to a vulnerability, you might say it's a waste because, in other words, it's, oh, yeah, I've worked all these years and I got nothing.

3147
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:34,510
Right?

3148
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:35,450
What a waste of time.

3149
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:42,490
I mean, you could put what a waste of time if you tagged that on the end of many phrases, thousands or millions of things to say about it.

3150
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:49,190
Yeah, but you would prefer that you had known more truth when you were younger.

3151
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:51,170
That might have helped you out a little bit.

3152
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:52,670
But it wasn't meant to be, I guess.

3153
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:55,990
Right, because then you would have the potential to explode.

3154
02:09:56,270 --> 02:10:00,290
You may not live as long as you did.

3155
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:01,690
Okay, I see.

3156
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:08,910
Yeah, and also you would be upsetting the wagon too much because, remember, this is the adversary's children, the planet.

3157
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:10,250
Wow.

3158
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:12,170
On a grand scale.

3159
02:10:12,650 --> 02:10:18,050
So, again, why bother and do nothing other than your basic, basic stuff?

3160
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:21,410
You know, you know, you sit down on the toilet, wipe your butt.

3161
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:25,090
You know, if you're training, you know, young children, you know, wipe your butt.

3162
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:29,450
And if it's a, you know, a male, wipe your butt.

3163
02:10:29,470 --> 02:10:32,090
But a female always, you know, you've got to wipe from front to back.

3164
02:10:32,190 --> 02:10:36,070
You know, there's still important things, you know, for children.

3165
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:38,590
Proper instruction.

3166
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:40,010
And all this other stuff.

3167
02:10:40,290 --> 02:10:40,790
And that's it.

3168
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:41,450
That's all.

3169
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:43,070
Just wipe from front to back for your girl.

3170
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:44,070
And boy, just wipe it.

3171
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:45,570
Don't get any on your finger.

3172
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:50,830
I mean, you get nasty, but this is a nasty business and it's a stinky business being here on this planet.

3173
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:51,690
Yeah.

3174
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:52,570
And that's it.

3175
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:56,710
Pretty much, you know, eat, sleep, keep the law if you can.

3176
02:10:56,970 --> 02:11:12,230
Because, remember, the worst thing for the powers, the people and the spiritual leaders of this world is for anyone to discuss that the law has not been done away with and the laws of the gods still exist.

3177
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:13,410
The gods, you know.

3178
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:15,970
And the Most High still exist.

3179
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:21,750
That is their chief enemy ideology, let's say.

3180
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:31,770
That is the worst thing that could ever take hold in this modern society or even older societies is that the law of the Most High is still valid.

3181
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:39,690
That is the chief enemy from a spiritual and physical and social and cultural sense.

3182
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:40,510
Yeah.

3183
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:40,790
Right?

3184
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:46,290
You know, but he does say in scripture he doesn't change.

3185
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:48,290
No, he doesn't.

3186
02:11:48,390 --> 02:11:52,150
That's why the ridiculousness of religion...

3187
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:52,390
Yeah.

3188
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:56,470
And by the way, you know how the Christians say the law has been done away with.

3189
02:11:56,950 --> 02:12:00,670
You know, when people tell you that and they actually believe it, just walk away.

3190
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:01,470
You can't...

3191
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:03,050
That's a...

3192
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:04,110
You can't deal...

3193
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:07,330
In other words, that's somebody that's just like, you know, alright, whatever.

3194
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:09,310
You know, just stand there and hold this.

3195
02:12:09,690 --> 02:12:10,530
You can't do anything.

3196
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:13,190
There's nothing there with someone like that.

3197
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:13,850
Right.

3198
02:12:13,950 --> 02:12:22,550
But if someone doubts that, well then, of course, obviously, they have to take out the big eraser that's for erasing everything, you know what I mean?

3199
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:24,650
And a clean slate.

3200
02:12:24,930 --> 02:12:26,310
You can't mix the two.

3201
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:26,990
No.

3202
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:34,410
The other hand, the other thing about that is, you know, on one hand, you know, what's that goddess with the many hands?

3203
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:34,730
Right?

3204
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:35,690
The Shiva or whatever?

3205
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:40,790
One hand is Christian, the other one is Islam, the other one is Hinduism, the other one...

3206
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:41,770
They all...

3207
02:12:41,770 --> 02:12:47,170
All of these religions, at one point, adhere to something that they say is done away with.

3208
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:48,910
Even in the most conservative sense.

3209
02:12:48,930 --> 02:12:49,390
You know that?

3210
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:53,690
Yeah, they seem to have some similar connections.

3211
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:54,450
They all have...

3212
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:55,090
they all do.

3213
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:56,050
Yeah.

3214
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:57,910
Yeah.

3215
02:12:58,670 --> 02:12:59,310
It's a...

3216
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:02,130
It's very bizarre in that sense.

3217
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:03,330
Yeah.

3218
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:05,710
That's why I'm telling you, there's not much...

3219
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:07,850
Yeah, there's not much to do.

3220
02:13:07,950 --> 02:13:12,850
That's why, when I joke around often about getting off this planet on a spaceship and leaving, it doesn't matter.

3221
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:14,270
Just get away from here.

3222
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:17,890
You ever see in the movies when the bomb's gonna blow and it's like, well, let's go.

3223
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:18,710
It's like, where are we going?

3224
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:19,290
It doesn't matter.

3225
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:19,870
The bomb's...

3226
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:23,770
That's where I stay, you know, because this is not...

3227
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:25,790
And it's a beautiful planet, obviously.

3228
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:28,410
You know, if you have a telescope, you can...

3229
02:13:28,410 --> 02:13:33,030
We don't know what's underneath the clouds of Uranus or Jupiter, whatever.

3230
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:34,550
It might be beautiful there, too.

3231
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:35,410
You know.

3232
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:39,130
But all I could see is that the Earth is the most beautiful that we could see.

3233
02:13:39,690 --> 02:13:40,930
And it's shameful.

3234
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:42,630
And the people are shameless.

3235
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:44,170
Yeah.

3236
02:13:44,230 --> 02:13:45,490
They can't even contrast.

3237
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:48,150
That's why I'm saying, it's...

3238
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:51,350
Only the gods can fix it and only the gods could have fixed it.

3239
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:58,210
Just like someone posted in chat earlier, talk more about the natives, how they lost their territory because their gods support.

3240
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:00,690
Yeah, well, the battle had to happen with the gods first.

3241
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:02,410
You know.

3242
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:03,410
So you start it all.

3243
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:04,030
It's very simple.

3244
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:05,450
Knowing...

3245
02:14:05,450 --> 02:14:11,130
Having the notion is more important than the details because the details can be fun.

3246
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:14,750
You can make a movie or make a comic that kills three hours.

3247
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:16,050
I did a lot of that with Sam.

3248
02:14:16,070 --> 02:14:19,370
He'd bring up a question and we'd beat it, you know, for three hours.

3249
02:14:19,470 --> 02:14:19,950
And so what?

3250
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:20,570
It doesn't...

3251
02:14:20,570 --> 02:14:22,590
I mean, it might help someone, but no, no big deal.

3252
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:33,090
Like, for example, telling someone for something very simple, or saying very simple that the Native Americans lost their support from their gods, that's why they lost their land.

3253
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:33,810
Talk about that.

3254
02:14:33,890 --> 02:14:34,610
Yes, that's right.

3255
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,270
Why talk about that?

3256
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:37,230
Now you got the idea.

3257
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:40,110
Just like telling someone the law was never done away with.

3258
02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:41,370
That's it.

3259
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:42,630
You get it or not.

3260
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:45,930
It's up to you to go now and study what the law is.

3261
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:46,510
You see?

3262
02:14:47,090 --> 02:14:49,010
Just a very simple notion.

3263
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:53,430
Like, every biblical character is still a secret and not known publicly.

3264
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:56,690
Well, you don't need to go in and spell it out.

3265
02:14:56,770 --> 02:15:00,430
Just, okay, now that you know that, now you have a foundation to work on.

3266
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:01,870
You see?

3267
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:12,850
But the problem there, again, that's why I say why bother and do nothing, is let's say, go back to the Native Americans lost the support of their gods thus losing the territory.

3268
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:13,290
Okay?

3269
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:15,390
Go to the library and look that up.

3270
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:16,050
What are you going to get?

3271
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:17,090
Nothing.

3272
02:15:17,810 --> 02:15:18,610
Not much.

3273
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:20,970
And on the internet, eeeh, maybe a little bit.

3274
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:22,450
So how are you going to research that?

3275
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:28,190
You're going to give, you're going to give up time with your family and whatever you're doing, even sleeping, to go research that?

3276
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:28,410
What?

3277
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,550
Go ahead.

3278
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:30,330
Go travel.

3279
02:15:30,450 --> 02:15:31,270
Go talk to the elders.

3280
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:33,350
When you go, we can't talk about that.

3281
02:15:33,610 --> 02:15:35,070
Yeah, they're not going to say anything.

3282
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:35,910
No, they know.

3283
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:37,470
Yeah, so why bother?

3284
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:38,530
Oh sure, yeah.

3285
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:44,990
So what, you know, the point here is where do you want to dedicate your time?

3286
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:47,270
You know, what can the Greeks talk about?

3287
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:48,330
What can we talk about?

3288
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:49,570
Anything and everything.

3289
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:52,390
And even if you don't know a subject, let's go look at it together.

3290
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:53,770
What's wrong with that?

3291
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:54,090
Nothing.

3292
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:56,690
But the problem is we have no access to it.

3293
02:15:57,010 --> 02:15:57,530
Very little.

3294
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:07,550
And, and, couple that with the people around you, either people you know or don't know, don't have your best interest in mind.

3295
02:16:07,730 --> 02:16:08,710
They say they do.

3296
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:10,150
Right?

3297
02:16:10,490 --> 02:16:14,150
Because they want to co-exist, whether it's family, friends, or whatever.

3298
02:16:14,830 --> 02:16:17,550
They say they do, but ultimately they don't.

3299
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:19,210
Because, you know why they don't?

3300
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:21,310
Not because they don't want to have your best interest in mind.

3301
02:16:21,370 --> 02:16:24,590
They don't know how to do, how to, how to do that.

3302
02:16:24,790 --> 02:16:25,990
What the right thing is to do.

3303
02:16:26,230 --> 02:16:26,330
Yeah.

3304
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:27,450
They don't have the tools.

3305
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:29,490
They don't have the tools.

3306
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:29,710
Right.

3307
02:16:29,790 --> 02:16:30,870
Like, what's that?

3308
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:31,750
Yeah.

3309
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:33,030
They don't have the tools.

3310
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:33,889
Yep.

3311
02:16:34,809 --> 02:16:36,530
Like, you know, love is bullshit.

3312
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:37,910
Fresco talks about that.

3313
02:16:38,010 --> 02:16:39,250
I've never listened to that.

3314
02:16:39,389 --> 02:16:41,330
I saw the YouTube ones, love is bullshit.

3315
02:16:41,469 --> 02:16:41,969
I was like, great.

3316
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:46,850
I don't need, I didn't go listen to it, but I, I got to know exactly what that means.

3317
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:48,850
Because they don't know what that means.

3318
02:16:48,969 --> 02:16:50,410
You know, no one knows how to love.

3319
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:52,709
No, you know, very few people know what it means.

3320
02:16:53,490 --> 02:16:53,670
Yeah.

3321
02:16:54,350 --> 02:16:56,370
So, they're always just so good.

3322
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:56,930
Why bother?

3323
02:16:57,049 --> 02:16:57,469
Do nothing.

3324
02:16:58,309 --> 02:17:09,530
You're at a time right now where, if your lot in life is to just take care of the most basic stuff, and that's it, and basically do nothing outside of that, and why bother?

3325
02:17:09,889 --> 02:17:18,309
And, you find yourself in extraordinary positions, and extraordinary knowledge, you are not only called, but you are chosen.

3326
02:17:18,889 --> 02:17:20,250
And that is really interesting.

3327
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:21,549
Yeah.

3328
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,370
That's just me.

3329
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:27,910
So, yep.

3330
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:31,410
And that's, I think, a pretty good motto.

3331
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:32,590
Why bother and do nothing.

3332
02:17:33,990 --> 02:17:35,629
That's been your motto for a while.

3333
02:17:36,049 --> 02:17:36,469
It has.

3334
02:17:36,530 --> 02:17:36,730
Yeah.

3335
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:40,889
I used to say that because I've told her to the public for a year or two.

3336
02:17:41,469 --> 02:17:44,570
Or, I think, I've started this with Duke.

3337
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:48,570
Yeah, don't get involved in any of these organizations.

3338
02:17:48,969 --> 02:17:51,930
That's why I kept bringing up Gustave Le Bon later.

3339
02:17:52,170 --> 02:17:59,430
You know, after a while, you know, I was like, I don't think people are getting this, so let me bring up Gustave Le Bon.

3340
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:01,230
At least they have something to lean on.

3341
02:18:02,070 --> 02:18:05,350
If they want to get a little bit more of what's going on, you know.

3342
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:13,230
And, you know, even though, you know, if I keep saying, forget about these groups, you know, if you want to destroy something, organize it.

3343
02:18:13,730 --> 02:18:16,990
It's not because organizing something destroys it.

3344
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:18,290
It's actually quite the opposite.

3345
02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:22,469
But on this planet, in this society, in this culture, yes.

3346
02:18:23,330 --> 02:18:23,790
Why?

3347
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:25,750
Go read Gustave Le Bon.

3348
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:36,450
But even if you read Le Bon in his work, he says there are good things that come out of it, but he doesn't understand them because there must be divine inspiration.

3349
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:39,490
There are forces that are beyond what we comprehend.

3350
02:18:39,629 --> 02:18:42,629
You know, he states that, you know, that do that, so.

3351
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:46,469
So, there are many things to lean on.

3352
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:55,450
Jack Fresco I brought up recently, I was asked to look at some city planning stuff, and I looked at it, and I said, let me go look on the YouTube and see what's on city planning.

3353
02:18:55,590 --> 02:19:10,110
And Jack Fresco comes up, and I found out that his whole notion was stupid because he doesn't know about the gods, but his perspective of looking at stuff and how fucked up culture is, is correct.

3354
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:14,809
You see, so I brought him in the fold as much as possible to what I was listening.

3355
02:19:15,629 --> 02:19:25,570
But he doesn't know about the bears, but it's best that he didn't because if he did, he might have adopted why bother and do nothing and we wouldn't have found out about him.

3356
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:27,549
Yeah, very true.

3357
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:28,590
Very true.

3358
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:50,710
So, either way, it's fine, but again, like we mentioned earlier, like you were mentioning about discussing how when things are going to get much worse, they're going to appear to be better and how do you fathom the change and well, the only way to do that is to ask that the gods give you discernment, right?

3359
02:19:51,230 --> 02:20:00,270
Just like with dreams, like imagine, do you know how many people are being tortured, literally, when I mean tortured, I mean mentally tortured by dreams, right?

3360
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:00,370
Yeah.

3361
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:12,170
They go to the psych, they get medical help, psychological help, none of it helps because they can't discern it, what's really going on and that's the whole thing, it's called diagnosis.

3362
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:23,490
They're terrible, you know, the diagnosis that the professionals do, you know, they say we have professionals diagnosed, it's almost the same as anyone can do on the street.

3363
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:25,050
Someone at a bus stop, what's wrong with me?

3364
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:25,790
And they'll tell you.

3365
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:27,930
They're not very good at that.

3366
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:35,290
So, if you, let me just use the P word, which is pray for discernment, right?

3367
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:37,250
Would be the first step.

3368
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:38,050
Sure.

3369
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:45,770
Because telling someone about what to do doesn't help them when the situation changes a little bit.

3370
02:20:46,390 --> 02:21:03,670
So, but if you show discernment or give them the tools, right, then if the situation changes, like I always use the food and the law as a metaphor, you know, like if you read the Koran, it has one verse, which doesn't really have much to do about food.

3371
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:08,770
It says, do not eat the flesh of a swine or an animal that has died, meaning of unknown causes.

3372
02:21:09,950 --> 02:21:14,430
Well, that means, well, if someone reads the Koran, they'll say, well, I guess we can eat a camel then.

3373
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:17,030
You know, these people have no discernment, right?

3374
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:20,270
They do eat camel, you know, they do eat all kinds of stuff.

3375
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:24,170
But the Scripture gives you discernment and example.

3376
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:28,270
It says, four legs, it has to chew the cud and clove and hoof.

3377
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:32,650
And it says, a pig has a clove and hoof, but he doesn't chew the cud, right?

3378
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:33,390
No good.

3379
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:35,510
And a rabbit chews the cud, but he has a paw.

3380
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:35,830
No good.

3381
02:21:35,890 --> 02:21:39,950
So, not only does it give you how to discern, but it also gives an example.

3382
02:21:41,470 --> 02:21:41,650
Right.

3383
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:43,450
So, right.

3384
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:49,370
So, in this case, pray for the discernment, and guess what?

3385
02:21:49,370 --> 02:21:51,830
The example, how are you going to get the example?

3386
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:54,670
You're going to start singing it around you.

3387
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:58,430
Friends, family, news, walk out in the street.

3388
02:21:58,890 --> 02:21:59,670
You get it?

3389
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:00,730
Yeah.

3390
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:06,390
It won't just be black ink on white paper or pixels on the rectangle anymore.

3391
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:14,470
You're going to, what's going to make it difficult as the times have come is, as you gain discernment, it's not going to, it's going to be in living color.

3392
02:22:14,690 --> 02:22:15,670
You know, it's going to be, It'll be live.

3393
02:22:16,090 --> 02:22:17,110
It'll be live, yeah.

3394
02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:19,110
You see what I mean?

3395
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:20,050
Yeah.

3396
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:23,210
So, yep.

3397
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:25,630
I mean, I don't know.

3398
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:41,650
There's this, there's so much that can be done, and I'll say that the, what they call the web, the internet, is a great tool for that, and no matter what tools exist, ultimately, who's the end user?

3399
02:22:41,890 --> 02:22:53,830
Surface dwelling earth inhabitant that's inherently evil or cosmically censored, so you're looking for the .0001%, you're looking for a few thousand people out of 7 billion, right?

3400
02:22:54,610 --> 02:22:55,910
So, why bother?

3401
02:22:56,470 --> 02:22:57,470
You can't find them.

3402
02:22:57,530 --> 02:22:59,550
They have to be brought cosmically.

3403
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:00,750
You get it?

3404
02:23:01,450 --> 02:23:11,610
So, if that helps anyone that is learning the truth, don't even bother with the people around you, and I don't mean around you, I mean like around like anywhere on the planet.

3405
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:14,470
They have to ultimately be brought to you.

3406
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:16,810
You guys have to be brought cosmically.

3407
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:24,310
In other words, the odds for the lotto or the lottery are in the billions, it's the same thing.

3408
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:33,870
In this case, it would be the millions, because one in a million is roughly 7,000 people, and that's roughly the number of people on the planet.

3409
02:23:35,270 --> 02:23:38,990
And it's provable, it's, you know, by just learning it.

3410
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:43,290
So, if you understand what's being said on these phonics, guess what?

3411
02:23:44,230 --> 02:23:45,110
You're on your own.

3412
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:56,370
You're not And, you know, is it possible that people don't want to be around you because of this?

3413
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:57,750
Yeah, if you open your mouth, you can.

3414
02:23:58,170 --> 02:23:58,690
Yeah.

3415
02:23:59,010 --> 02:24:02,650
Yeah, and there are some people that care before you open your mouth.

3416
02:24:03,010 --> 02:24:03,410
Yeah.

3417
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:07,390
I've noticed that, yeah.

3418
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:08,030
Yeah.

3419
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:12,810
That's interesting.

3420
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:25,990
And also, part of discernment is when you run into people, they won't be able to really pigeonhole you.

3421
02:24:27,670 --> 02:24:28,270
You know?

3422
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:29,630
So they don't talk to you.

3423
02:24:30,090 --> 02:24:30,670
No, they don't talk.

3424
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:31,610
Some people will be afraid.

3425
02:24:31,710 --> 02:24:35,010
Some people will be strangely attracted to you, but don't know why.

3426
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:38,150
Or they do know why, and it will be super superficial.

3427
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:40,930
But they know there's more beyond that.

3428
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:49,590
Did I ever give you the story about I had two cars that I needed suspension work done on, right?

3429
02:24:50,390 --> 02:24:56,470
And we're talking about like, you know, steering and suspension, very specific stuff, not just regular mechanical work.

3430
02:24:56,650 --> 02:25:02,070
I didn't want to do it myself, so I took it to the suspension shop.

3431
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:09,970
There's a specialist, you know, they not only do suspension, they do other stuff, but, you know, like struts and alignments and chassis work, you know?

3432
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:18,190
So, I go in there and the guy says, well, it's like 700 bucks, but I'm going to do it for 300.

3433
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:19,850
I'm like, wow, thank you.

3434
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:21,570
I asked him, you know, what would give me a better price.

3435
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:24,110
He says, well, I'll bring you another car, and I want to do the same thing.

3436
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:26,730
Okay, yeah, well, we'll do that one for 200.

3437
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:31,490
They kept going down and down and down, and I was like, he's charging me like half or a third.

3438
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:40,870
And then, like, I brought him another car and I said, hey, I really appreciate you guys have the best reputation in town and you're giving me like a killer deal.

3439
02:25:41,690 --> 02:25:43,670
I said to him, do you know what kind of work I do?

3440
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:46,110
And he says, well, you're a preacher, aren't you?

3441
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:47,530
Ah.

3442
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:50,030
And I never mentioned anything.

3443
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:51,710
Oh, wow.

3444
02:25:51,770 --> 02:25:56,070
The only conversations I've ever had was about the car.

3445
02:25:56,670 --> 02:25:56,950
Yeah.

3446
02:25:57,890 --> 02:25:58,710
Never about it.

3447
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:00,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3448
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:04,230
I know the cars are in a trust, so, you know, you look it up, it's just a trust.

3449
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:06,250
There's no name on it on the registrations.

3450
02:26:07,410 --> 02:26:07,590
Yeah.

3451
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:08,930
So, it's a trust.

3452
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:09,530
It's not, right?

3453
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:11,710
So, I'm like, well, what made you think that?

3454
02:26:11,790 --> 02:26:13,890
And he says, I don't know, I just thought that, you know.

3455
02:26:14,070 --> 02:26:16,130
I said, holy shit.

3456
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:17,830
So, this guy sees me as a preacher.

3457
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:22,910
Another guy, I was, uh, you're going to another supplier and if there was, did you know what I do?

3458
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:24,250
He says, yeah, you're a professor, aren't you?

3459
02:26:25,210 --> 02:26:26,190
So, what makes you think that?

3460
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:28,150
He says, I don't know, I just, you know.

3461
02:26:28,730 --> 02:26:29,010
Right?

3462
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:30,410
So, anyway.

3463
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:35,450
So, I've had, in other words, as I keep going on, uh, uh, I run into circles.

3464
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:41,530
It's, you know, like a service industry or whatever and just basic stuff and everyone thinks I'm doing something else.

3465
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:50,590
An engineer, uh, one guy thought, you know, I worked for an intelligence agency, another guy thought I was a preacher, another guy thought I was a doctor, right?

3466
02:26:51,070 --> 02:26:51,370
Yeah.

3467
02:26:51,830 --> 02:26:59,030
Another guy thought I was an artist and, you know, and we're not talking about Greek speak now, we're just talking about service industry.

3468
02:26:59,370 --> 02:27:02,870
Hi, you know, fill this out, I need this done, see you, bye, I'll see you later.

3469
02:27:04,330 --> 02:27:04,650
Right?

3470
02:27:05,430 --> 02:27:06,330
What made you sound?

3471
02:27:07,410 --> 02:27:09,770
Yeah, I was like, whoa, that's really odd.

3472
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,410
Uh-huh.

3473
02:27:11,090 --> 02:27:11,470
You know?

3474
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:16,070
The one, the funniest one I had to bring up first was the guy that thought I was a preacher, you know?

3475
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:16,670
Yeah.

3476
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:20,070
I mean, you guys have heard me, you know, there's nothing preachy about what I'm saying.

3477
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:20,690
Right.

3478
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:28,690
So, and I, again, when I ask some questions, you guys say, I don't know, man, I really don't know, I just thought that.

3479
02:27:29,470 --> 02:27:32,770
So, in other words, what are they, through their eyes, how do they see you?

3480
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:41,510
And, here you go, when things get thick, if you know the truth, um, the spiritual influence that most people have, because it's external input, right?

3481
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:44,050
They're going to be really turned off.

3482
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:45,030
Yeah.

3483
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:46,850
Yeah.

3484
02:27:47,450 --> 02:27:50,270
You know, that's why 13 was an unlucky number, right?

3485
02:27:51,090 --> 02:27:59,350
Because when you had 12, the 12 and the 1, if they were approaching a town from a distance, how many people are coming to town?

3486
02:27:59,710 --> 02:28:00,970
13, right?

3487
02:28:01,010 --> 02:28:02,250
You had the 12 and the 1.

3488
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:08,050
So, every time these 13 people rolled around places like Judea and whatever, the whole hell broke loose.

3489
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:12,290
It was bad luck when this group of 13 showed up.

3490
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:12,890
Anyway.

3491
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:13,790
Yeah.

3492
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:22,740
How many times have you read in what they call the Old Testament the gods are coming to town and how many people were happy about that?

3493
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:24,840
Never.

3494
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:25,120
Never.

3495
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:25,780
Right.

3496
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:28,660
Yeah.

3497
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:29,900
what's going on now?

3498
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,780
Total bullshit.

3499
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:32,760
Right?

3500
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,380
For thousands of years.

3501
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:35,500
All of them.

3502
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:36,400
Yeah.

3503
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,120
It's all crap.

3504
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:38,240
So, why bother?

3505
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:39,720
Sure.

3506
02:28:57,340 --> 02:28:58,400
Sorry, now I'm back inside.

3507
02:28:58,540 --> 02:28:59,260
I was outside.

3508
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:03,280
I didn't have planes and cicadas, but if there's any...

3509
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:03,800
Sorry about that.

3510
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,020
No.

3511
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:05,900
No, that's all right.

3512
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:07,400
It's not your fault.

3513
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:10,400
If there's not anything else, we'll just...

3514
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:12,320
We've been on for quite a few hours, I think.

3515
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:13,740
Two and a half plus.

3516
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,120
Okay.

3517
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:22,800
But there's so much to do, but, you know, you have to realize it's been my motto, yes, why bother?

3518
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:28,680
Again, it takes a lot of work to do it right.

3519
02:29:30,780 --> 02:29:32,240
Sam puts my feet to the fire.

3520
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:33,860
He says, you never do what you guys say you're doing.

3521
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:35,260
You were going to do this and that.

3522
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:37,340
You know, kind of like a baby, you know?

3523
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,540
Where's the podcast?

3524
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:40,980
Where's this?

3525
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:41,760
I said, you know what?

3526
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:52,880
I have desires and I do want to do this kind of stuff and I like sharing and I like developing, but I'm not stupid.

3527
02:29:54,060 --> 02:30:02,390
You know, the response is so minimal and I'm not going to work for free because it is a lot of work in a professional way.

3528
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:03,560
Sure.

3529
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:04,920
Right?

3530
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:09,700
And, again, if I'm going to work and I'm going to walk my walk and talk my talk, do nothing.

3531
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:16,420
And if you find yourself being put in a position where you have to, you're going to get the help and all that.

3532
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:29,260
That's not on your own and you're not falling for some adversarial trap of, you know, what human, what I call, what's called human frailty or what they call ego, which is not accurate, but...

3533
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:29,500
Yeah.

3534
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:41,500
Yeah, and it's not like, you know, it's the first century A.D. where at least you'll do something that'll help, you know, what, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 generations of people.

3535
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,820
No, actually, less than that.

3536
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:45,860
20 generations.

3537
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:48,680
You're right at the point right now.

3538
02:30:49,340 --> 02:31:01,500
So, so I don't see anything in emails or chat, so I'm just going to say, do you want to call it, Bruce?

3539
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:02,560
Sure.

3540
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:05,560
It was a good conversation.

3541
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:06,620
It really was.

3542
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:08,400
Appreciate it.

3543
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,020
Yes.

3544
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:10,920
Thank you for coming on.

3545
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:13,480
Yeah, thank you all.

3546
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:14,340
Thank you.

3547
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:19,420
And I'm glad you found out that this stuff works and keeps working.

3548
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:20,480
Right.

3549
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:21,900
Yeah.

3550
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:24,480
Yeah, good to keep working on it.

3551
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:26,940
Cool.

3552
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:27,780
All right, so...

3553
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:28,660
Appreciate it.

3554
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:30,700
Yeah, appreciate you coming on.

3555
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:35,880
It's always best to have a conversation instead of a monologue very often.

3556
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:44,000
I think, Bruce, I think it's been, we'll try to keep these things going on what they call Tuesday, which is not every week, by the way, on the folks' work schedule.

3557
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:45,100
Right.

3558
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:51,480
But, you know, we're coming up on the sixth moon in about a week or so.

3559
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:51,900
Mm-hmm.

3560
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:53,580
Less, you know.

3561
02:31:55,020 --> 02:32:01,720
But I've once gotten a suggestion regarding sonic events.

3562
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:13,160
You know, try to give a couple hours notice on a topic to talk about, and if there is no one coming on or no topic, there's no reason to come on here and do stuff other than a loose conversation.

3563
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:17,480
So...

3564
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:21,840
Okay, so you would like topics suggested in chat.

3565
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:43,240
Oh, yeah, otherwise I'm not going to I'm not going to stop digging into my clipboards and notes and start developing new stuff because no one's really other than yourself and a few others doing stuff, you know, like, you know, whether it's the human body or the gods or technology or timekeeping, there's not much there's not much being developed.

3566
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:46,100
I mean, I don't it's like a government job.

3567
02:32:46,220 --> 02:32:53,560
You ever see the government employees on the street when they working, they have nine guys standing around, one guy digging, you know?

3568
02:32:53,700 --> 02:32:54,480
Yeah, yeah.

3569
02:32:54,760 --> 02:33:08,220
Not going to this is not I have humans in too low regard to go out beyond, but when I give out enough information where someone like yourself and others says, well, this stuff works and it's great I don't know.

3570
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:12,600
Believe it or not, even with that, it's best to keep it simple, but you still got your hands full, right?

3571
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:15,300
You know, I mean, there's so much that can be done.

3572
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:18,360
Here, I'll give you one more thing before we go regarding timekeeping.

3573
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,280
You know, most people still can't get the basics and most people do it on team to care, but here that's focused on that.

3574
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:35,520
If you really want to do well, not really want to do if you one way that you could start studying time if anyone there might be someone nut job out there who's as crazy as I am.

3575
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,600
When solar, it has two clocks.

3576
02:33:40,180 --> 02:33:45,420
You know, like the cheap analog clocks or you can even use a digital, but an analog clock is fine.

3577
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:47,260
You can get them really cheap these days.

3578
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:53,780
They're fairly accurate within two or three minutes per month, so they're for all intents and purposes for this, it's fine.

3579
02:33:54,720 --> 02:34:02,880
So you have the clock on the wall and then you have another clock that you have access to and every day that there's solar noon, you adjust that to 12 o'clock exactly.

3580
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:11,500
So sometimes, you know, in the summer, obviously, it's going to be going back and in the winter it's going to be going forward, right?

3581
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:20,500
So, you know, let's say it's 12.55 on the regular clock and it's solar noon on the clock that you always adjust, you put that exactly at noon.

3582
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:22,240
Right?

3583
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:23,780
Why do we do that?

3584
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:26,300
Why do you want to do a time study?

3585
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:32,800
And then you start seeing how the drift starts to happen through the seasons, but that's not even why you do that.

3586
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:33,700
Why...

3587
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:35,600
Should I answer that or just let it...

3588
02:34:36,660 --> 02:34:47,420
Actually, let me just say that this is not a put-down, but from what I've seen in various chats or emails, I don't think the audience has the aptitude to answer this, but I'm going to answer.

3589
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:48,520
Okay.

3590
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:49,800
Why do you do that?

3591
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:53,460
Why do you adjust one and do the other?

3592
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,380
Because then you learn...

3593
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:57,520
This part I'm not going to answer because it takes too long.

3594
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:06,300
The reason why you adjust the clocks like that and you see how much they're off is not to see how much the clocks are off, but to determine how long nighttime is.

3595
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:09,620
And I'm going to leave it at that.

3596
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,260
And then right away I might hit you like I know what he just said.

3597
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:20,020
I know what nighttime is in terms of hours.

3598
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:24,220
I know what that means, but I don't know what he means by the two clocks and all that.

3599
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:28,320
Have you two put it together what I mean by that?

3600
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:28,940
Have you got it?

3601
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:31,020
It's a name for the Equinox.

3602
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:33,660
No, it has nothing to do with the Equinox.

3603
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:34,160
Oh, OK.

3604
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,080
I thought for sure it would have went there.

3605
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:39,780
It has to do with how long the nighttime really is.

3606
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:40,740
Hmm.

3607
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:42,780
OK.

3608
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:43,660
And why?

3609
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:44,520
Because...

3610
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:45,760
OK, so I'm going to...

3611
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,060
Do you see how...

3612
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:47,200
Yeah.

3613
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:51,980
I'm so discouraged about talking about new stuff because in background I understand.

3614
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:54,360
you have to give so much discussion in background.

3615
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:59,160
Bringing up a topic is like, you know, pulling a plug on a bathtub.

3616
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:01,060
It's all this water and then it's gone.

3617
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:05,820
You look at it and you're like, oh, this water's going to take forever to drain and you turn around and it's gone.

3618
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,100
It's like, how did that happen, right?

3619
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:09,860
So it's not good to do that.

3620
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:10,960
You know, I think that's...

3621
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:11,280
I should learn.

3622
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:17,880
But, in other words, we can do ten four-hour sonic events on time and just barely start scratching the surface.

3623
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:19,980
Right?

3624
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:25,700
We can do ten four-hour sonic events just on eating and food and barely be scratching the surface.

3625
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:39,540
In other words, I had a discussion with someone about a year ago that wanted me to do an interview and we ended up spending three hours on the cell phone with a manager or someone and he says, man, Greek, you know, you're bursting at the seams.

3626
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:43,300
He's like, you've got so much, you're just exploding.

3627
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,100
I'm like, yeah, I know, it sucks.

3628
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:47,100
Right?

3629
02:36:47,920 --> 02:37:04,420
So, just to finish this sonic event off, do you see that I think it's better to, you know, have a topic of discussion else that allows me to gauge and see if it develops into anything.

3630
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:07,800
If there, let's say there's nothing I'm not, just want to do a sonic.

3631
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:18,100
Like, we don't have someone like yourself calling in or some pretty good, and I think people got a way of, you know, pretty good stuff in chat of an answer.

3632
02:37:18,220 --> 02:37:25,300
Like, if you bring up, this is not to be disparaging, actually, I want to encourage more if possible.

3633
02:37:26,180 --> 02:37:30,680
Can you please discuss how the Indian lost their support of their gods and lost their territory?

3634
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:33,340
That is the answer in the question.

3635
02:37:33,460 --> 02:37:35,780
No, I'm not going to discuss more of that because it doesn't help anyone.

3636
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:37,500
Right?

3637
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:38,780
It's not going to help the Indians.

3638
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:41,120
And you're all going to lose the land.

3639
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:45,500
So, think those things through on how they are really, are they really useful.

3640
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:47,260
You know?

3641
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:50,140
How useful is it?

3642
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:52,840
And I think, think about it for a moment.

3643
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:59,720
You know, there's subjects we like, and then there's subjects that we like that are not useful, and there's subjects that we like that are useful.

3644
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:01,580
So, how useful is it?

3645
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:04,240
Now, again, it might sound a little personal.

3646
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:08,420
Like, for example, other people, if you bring up, I'm not going to mention any names.

3647
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:09,700
I'm usually nice because I mention a name.

3648
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:15,260
But you guys might know who it is if I've spoken to a lot before.

3649
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:20,680
You might know a certain subject, but you don't have a personal interest in it.

3650
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:23,780
And even though I might, but I let it go.

3651
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:24,020
Right?

3652
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:32,300
Regarding time, there are very few people that, mostly anyone who understands or comprehends Greek speak knows the notion of time now.

3653
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:34,520
But very few people have an interest in it.

3654
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:35,440
Right?

3655
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:40,740
So, if I'm around someone who doesn't have an interest in a subject, let's say the human body, I won't discuss it.

3656
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:41,660
Right?

3657
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:44,960
Or if someone doesn't have an interest in time, I won't discuss it.

3658
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:45,720
Right?

3659
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:49,140
Just be aware that it's much better that way.

3660
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:56,720
So if I, if there's no topic or anything and I come on and start talking about this, like, hell if I know who's interested, why am I talking, why am I speaking?

3661
02:38:58,300 --> 02:38:58,560
You know?

3662
02:38:59,160 --> 02:38:59,540
Sure.

3663
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:05,640
So, there's a tremendous amount, you know, after a while, you, it's like yin and yang.

3664
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:09,040
When you get so much stuff going on, you want to do nothing.

3665
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:18,960
You kind of explode or implode or you know, the thing, the circuit overload and you're just like, I'll just let it, you know, when a circuit breaker goes, you just let it cool down.

3666
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:24,520
You don't hit it right away, you know, because the reason why it broke the circuit is because it overheated.

3667
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,820
It's a very simple mechanical thing.

3668
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:27,140
Right?

3669
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:39,870
So, in a sense that the interest, I think the discussion or the sonics should be based on the interest that's inputted from the chat or email.

3670
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:51,790
I mean, otherwise, I'd come on and say, Bruce, we're going to talk about time and do four hours of real heavy technical methodology of lawful timekeeping for my satisfaction.

3671
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:52,890
I don't need to do that.

3672
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:54,350
I'm already, I already know it.

3673
02:39:54,650 --> 02:39:55,470
I'm already satisfied.

3674
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:57,910
Why do I, you know, need to come on a sonic and do it?

3675
02:39:58,730 --> 02:40:00,190
Say how smart I am or something?

3676
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:01,670
No reason.

3677
02:40:02,690 --> 02:40:17,490
So, the only reason to do these sonics is, again, having someone like, have you noticed about some testimonians having another being discuss their experiences with the stuff or, you know, whatever.

3678
02:40:17,730 --> 02:40:23,770
But, I appreciate what you do, Bruce, but there's no reason to do a sonic unless there's input, impetus of some kind.

3679
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:24,470
Correct.

3680
02:40:24,710 --> 02:40:27,510
Because, you don't need to come out and discuss what I've discovered.

3681
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:28,490
That's personal.

3682
02:40:28,890 --> 02:40:33,210
Like I said, the, the, the knowledge is its own reward.

3683
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:34,830
You know?

3684
02:40:35,270 --> 02:40:39,670
Just like the, the, was it Fresco?

3685
02:40:40,010 --> 02:40:41,330
I said, well, you're so smart.

3686
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:42,370
How come you don't have any money?

3687
02:40:42,370 --> 02:40:43,470
He said, well, you have a lot of money.

3688
02:40:43,530 --> 02:40:44,410
How come you're not smart?

3689
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:45,570
Right?

3690
02:40:45,650 --> 02:40:47,690
So, which one would you rather have, depending, right?

3691
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:48,390
Kind of thing.

3692
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:49,510
Mm-hmm.

3693
02:40:50,170 --> 02:40:57,890
Either way, if there's no interest, if I don't see an interest, by the way, it's just a, this is the first time I've been so bold about it, in chat or emails, there's no sonic.

3694
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:04,230
So, just coming on and discussing what I'm interested in is not correct.

3695
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:05,210
It's not right, I think.

3696
02:41:05,830 --> 02:41:06,150
Publicly.

3697
02:41:06,430 --> 02:41:08,590
Do it privately amongst the group.

3698
02:41:08,750 --> 02:41:16,930
Again, if you have an interest, let's say, in miniature trains or astronomy or whatever, you just, even privately, you call your aunt and uncle or brothers, they don't care.

3699
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:22,390
You want to find, personally, someone who is interested also, again, privately or public.

3700
02:41:22,450 --> 02:41:23,070
It doesn't matter.

3701
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:24,870
There needs to be an interest.

3702
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:30,480
So, and it should be useful.

3703
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:42,220
But, again, just to recap, when there are people that want to bring up in chat or emails topics that the question answers, they've already all encompassed.

3704
02:41:42,260 --> 02:41:44,920
You know, they just want more detail, but it's not something that's very useful.

3705
02:41:46,420 --> 02:41:48,360
Um, that shows a lot.

3706
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:55,800
That shows that they actually got it because, like, in their suggestion of something to speak about, they gave the whole thing from start to finish, from soup to nuts.

3707
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:59,620
So, that means they really got it, you know, which is great.

3708
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:07,660
You know, I've had many emails, could you please continue talking about how dreams are external input and caused by gods or demons or spirits?

3709
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:10,140
And I'm like, no, because you got it.

3710
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:13,760
There's no more, there's nothing else to talk about, right?

3711
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:14,160
Yeah.

3712
02:42:14,780 --> 02:42:18,640
But, if you structure the request like that, it means you do understand that.

3713
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:25,060
And now, it's not a matter of discussing that, it's discussing specific aspects of it.

3714
02:42:25,220 --> 02:42:27,640
You know, from a technical point of view, do you want more dreams?

3715
02:42:27,740 --> 02:42:28,760
Do you want less dreams?

3716
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:30,100
You know?

3717
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:32,880
Do you, are, you know, do you see what I mean?

3718
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:34,680
Right.

3719
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:35,840
Mm-hmm.

3720
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:40,980
So, it has to be, and how helpful is it?

3721
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:42,260
So, anyway.

3722
02:42:43,220 --> 02:42:43,400
Yeah.

3723
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:44,460
Yeah.

3724
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:46,400
So, again, thanks.

3725
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:47,560
Thank you.

3726
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:49,120
Thanks for coming very, very much.

3727
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:49,700
Yep.

3728
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:52,860
And, thank you both.

3729
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,140
we'll see you next week.

3730
02:42:54,220 --> 02:42:54,640
Thanks, Bruce.

3731
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:55,420
Thank you.

3732
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:56,540
You have a good night now.

3733
02:42:56,540 --> 02:42:56,860
Thank you.

3734
02:42:57,820 --> 02:42:58,460
You too.

3735
02:42:58,520 --> 02:42:59,300
Thank you, Bruce.

3736
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:00,440
Yes, you're welcome.

3737
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:01,160
And thank you.
