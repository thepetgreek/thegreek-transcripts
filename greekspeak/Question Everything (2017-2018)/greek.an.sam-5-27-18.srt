1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
More than a lifetime to study or pursue so there's no reason to really pursue

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,160
this these sonic events that much especially because there's no support

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,820
for it I mean I say no I mean you know even when you go outside and someone

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,160
asks you is it windy you're like no the wind is still moving at like two miles

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,340
per hour you know right right so there's no support so I'm just kind of like

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,940
gonna figure out what else how to spend the rest of my days on this fucked up

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,640
planet or fucked up world and in the meantime you know whenever the

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:41,640
opportunity arouses arises come around and put out something that's fine you

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,760
know I think so yeah and that's pretty much the whole thing in a nutshell but

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,700
the thing is the lack of discernment is just incredible incredible meaning it's

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,000
not credible anymore because but but it is let me let me let me give you a

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,480
preface because it's the information age right so you're supposed to have a lot

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,120
of information but on the other hand when you were in the industrial age were

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,940
you in the industrial age no you're either a factory worker or you're bought

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,400
their crap right right when you were in the space age did you go to space no not

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,420
a bit all this bullshit stuff on TV right right so now you're in the

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,920
information age are you getting information yeah no it's all bullshit

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,360
you're still people are just uh I did an interview recently which may not get

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,140
aired because I kind of laid into the host in a way that they're not used to

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,980
politely and this is how do you want to finish off so get knuckle-dragger cream

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,520
you know because you drag your knuckles on the ground the whole life so you're

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,400
gonna need some cream right and the latest thing I usually say is why bother

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,800
you know whenever you do something just think why bother why should I do that

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,500
yeah exactly so but on a on a on the on a realistic side you know where people

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
can use stuff you know maybe we'll continue I just gave you some Greek

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,699
thoughts there yeah it looks right on the board Sam's back oh good Sam if you

27
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:15,380
want to pull them on in hmm he should just hit the green button and be right

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,800
on yep that would do her like that yeah hello again hey so maybe I'll recap for

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Sam I don't think you got that did you Sam what I was saying I was all yeah

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,760
there's no desire for Greek speak so I'm but every so often we'll do these

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,480
there might be desire but there's no support there's a reason to do it but

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,040
the point is the lack of discernment and the is incredible meaning there's no

33
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,060
credibility you know like when you're in the industrial age you did you how

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,140
did the people participate in that while they're either slave like factory workers

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,680
or they bought the shitty products that they put out when you're in the space

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,800
age did you go to space no where do you see some bullshit agency stuff

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Hollywood production your garbage I told you on the moon now you're in the

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:14,040
information age yeah right but you're all dumber than ever and dumb because

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,080
you lack the discernment it's kind of like if you don't know how to put a

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,620
bucket in water or fill a container it doesn't matter how much abundance of

41
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,100
fluid there is it's not going to happen so yeah the reason I wanted to do the

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,920
sonic event was how did I called it on the Skype how to think in 3d remember I

43
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,500
didn't put it down to Bruce but I did for you right so what I mean by 3d is the

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,760
three dimensions you know and it's not I don't mean like length width and height

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,080
I mean you have the audible you know linguistic communication which most

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,500
people fail miserably at communicating then you have the written and then you

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,440
have the visual illustrate illustrative which goes in between language because

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,100
you know how letters can be pictographic but you know if you show

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,020
something in just pictures anyone can get it like the universal symbols versus

50
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,540
a language if you can't read it you can't read it so that you got the verbal

51
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,920
you know the audio and then you know which could also be performance visual

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,480
kinesthetic the actual literal written and then you have the just pictures

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,640
showing stuff right like what I like about instructions now is when you open

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,760
them up I didn't bother reading I just look at the pictures right immediately

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,920
and the reason why you go for the pictures is because if it's important

56
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,700
they're going to make an illustration and if there's an illustration it means

57
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,900
that it's important and that's also a trap I call it image training you know

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,840
they train people with images both good and bad so you know a good image for

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,060
example would be if you're traveling anywhere in the world and you go to an

60
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,640
intersection and you see a red octagon with white writing even if you the

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,220
language is foreign to you there's a 99.9 if not a hundred percent chance

62
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:15,220
that is a what stop sign right so you have various things like that so no the

63
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,420
jagged line looks like a lightning bolt you know whatever is written if it's in

64
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,260
yellow and black and whatever is written underneath it means caution is probably

65
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,720
electrical shock warning right but they've pulled a lot over you know like

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,200
for example seals and bat if you could go and look up laws and code seals and

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,120
badges have no more effect right is since the 50s this is in the codes all

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,660
over the world but and but they still show that you know like here's your

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,180
badge you officer let me see your badge right who cares or a seal a court seal

70
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,520
where it doesn't mean anything they still ask for it doesn't have a court

71
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,440
seal so what I was done away with you see so as many aspects to that so I

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,600
wanted to talk about the 3d in that way it's like basically a talk about

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,860
communication how there is none so you guys hip to that any but anything you

74
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,260
guys on your minds you want to bring up no I'm good with what you're gonna go

75
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,680
with yes yes but I'm just wondering if it's more of if it's about touching on

76
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,540
three disparate concepts within thinking or if it's a methodology for

77
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,520
how to think of the most equal right both and you the only way you could do it is

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,600
by example like when a child like Jack Fresco says when you're teaching

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,140
children and they come with you as something and it's not as correct as you

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,560
know it's not like you what you had shown don't say it's just wrong it's

81
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,700
wrong and it doesn't tell anyone anything but if you tell them if you give them if

82
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,000
they ask you for what's quote-unquote grading or feedback if you evaluate it

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,460
based on a whole holy what they did correct and what they did incorrect now

84
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,590
you're telling them more you see but you know again in in these desperate times

85
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,430
usually that's why I say I talk at people I don't have no desire to have

86
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,610
conversations with anyone and what I'm always thinking is yeah I give people a

87
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,010
chance you know scripture says you know it's better to listen than to speak but

88
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,670
taking that you got to keep scripture in context when it you know in scripture

89
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,890
tells you it's better to listen and speak and be short on words that's not

90
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,190
talking about you dumbass pagans all over the world it's talking about people

91
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,430
that within a culture that is trying to be lawful right I always have to keep

92
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,450
that in context right mm-hmm so basically when I have discussions with

93
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,090
people I was like what the what could this person possibly say that makes any

94
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,210
sense and I'm gonna predict nothing and I'm not being pessimistic pessimistic or

95
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,870
optimistic I'm just saying and guess what I'm usually correct like you know

96
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,150
recently I've been I talked to a couple of hosts that do all that ridiculous

97
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,310
alternative media and I'm like you know these people should have their

98
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,290
microphones taken away but that's alright because it's the Internet

99
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,270
anybody can go on you know look at Craigslist right you know it's just so in

100
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,730
other words when you go look at I don't want to mention you know names like

101
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,730
Bocelli effect or Freeman TV or anything like that but you know that's

102
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:24,250
like going to Craigslist you know every you know or Alex Jones or Pete Cento all

103
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,350
the crap out there AFR or whatever all that crap is just somebody getting a

104
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,809
microphone having internet access that's why I always ask people you have

105
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,809
internet access because believe it or not some people do and don't I mean do

106
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,650
have the ability to and don't care about it anymore and that's actually a fairly

107
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,550
evolved being if you can proceed with your life without it you know what I

108
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,650
mean I mean involved meaning you've unfolded and passed it you know but

109
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,910
basically what's going on people have the misgiving well I should say this way

110
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,610
people have been led down this primrose path if you're old enough if you well

111
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,390
19th century they say that a lot means you're being fooled basically again just

112
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,670
to recap what did you get out of the industrial age nothing what did you get

113
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,770
out of the space age nothing maybe velcro bullshit right what did you get

114
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,870
out of the information age nothing you're not getting anything but this is

115
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,530
what you are getting this is why communication is important I'm going to

116
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,150
ease into the subject overall and we'll get into I'll give some scriptural

117
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,010
examples because the best way to do it is by example you know if you go take

118
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,910
tennis lessons you can do descriptions all you want but once you go out on the

119
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,990
court partner up and then try to implement that description then you're

120
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,670
getting you know now you're getting a handle on really what it is right we're

121
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:57,450
talking about but if you go back to the aspect of communication and being in the

122
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,130
information age and getting ready for what's coming let me just pose it this

123
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,050
way as a preface how many people have access to the Bible even someone going

124
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,430
to get his dick sucked at a hotel has a Gideon Bible right oops sorry that was

125
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,970
not family our talk is it anyway oh you're good all right they have access

126
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,970
to the Gideon Bible which is still you know King James and all that all right

127
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,670
so you bring up the Antichrist on major TV or movie every yes people in the

128
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,190
audience anywhere you go in the world really to raise their hand if they heard

129
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,650
of this Antichrist figure and most people will raise their hand right now if

130
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,330
most people ask who can give me some details about it very few people raise

131
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,730
their hands but whether everyone does or not is irrelevant the information is

132
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,590
available to everyone right mm-hmm okay so if you can sit down and literally

133
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:54,010
read and with comprehension what's in let's say regarding the entity let's say

134
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,970
the Antichrist or end times that means that there'll be enough people crying

135
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,450
foul when these things start to happen because most people think what they're

136
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,230
reading is quite obvious you get it so why would the gods hide this in plain

137
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,310
sight and have a whole bunch of people in the end when these things are

138
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,290
happening cry foul and kind of upset the plan a little bit because what you're

139
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,230
reading is not what you think you're reading and I'm not talking about some

140
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,770
stupid astro theology and this means this like purple means red and an

141
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,770
elephant is really a car type stupid shit that you hear out in the world right

142
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,810
I'm talking about getting real and this is where the thinking is really really

143
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,950
lacking now why is it why am I coming up because and saying it this this right

144
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,550
now is because when not now in the next few years and now really but in next few

145
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,990
years you're going to be entering into a realm oh yes where the mixture of two

146
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,470
realms the earthly realm that you're familiar with what's called laws of

147
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:00,590
nature animals plants air earth people societies cultures with more of an

148
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,070
overt effect of the gods meaning minor imps and demons under the under the

149
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,310
plan of the Most High affecting what's going on there's an old saying that you

150
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,550
know the way you one of the ways men gods deal with men is by making men mad

151
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:27,410
crazy ok so when you start seeing let's say some notions that you pick up in

152
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,570
scripture about what's coming you have to remember that there are entities

153
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,450
behind that that are going to make that happen right and pushing and provoking

154
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,890
nature but also the one of the purposes let's just dive into scripture for a

155
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,090
moment ok this is just to give an example because let's give the more

156
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,550
juicy stuff up front for example you know they have the Cecil B DeMille movie

157
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,690
a piece of shit movie with Charlton Heston and the Ten Commandments right

158
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,390
well when people read the Bible they say oh this is the part when the Red Sea was

159
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,250
parted and I saw that in the movies and they read it like as if it's just

160
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,850
cruising down the road eating a bowl of cereal you know I've seen people put

161
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,230
makeup on while they're driving or eating while they're driving a car let's say

162
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,970
conveying in a motorized wagon right engine-driven wagon they do all kinds of

163
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,590
shit that's how they read this stuff and by the way when someone says I read the

164
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,570
Bible they're lying and because I've told you before and everyone ever listen

165
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,610
anyone that picks up the Bible starts where Genesis they try to read a few

166
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,990
verses and they don't understand what's going on so they start skipping through

167
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,790
and they eventually when I say they're lying I mean that's 99% of the people

168
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,710
99.99999999 now they skip through the Genesis and they try flipping through

169
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,330
the book and they don't understand they're like oh shit I had there's no

170
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,830
way I'm gonna understand anything in here comprehend it even though I could

171
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,550
read the words so I'll just tell people I read it because the chances that

172
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,370
someone else understands it is very slim I see these jerk offs I assume all the

173
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,070
time and I hear of them oh I'm an atheist yeah I grew up in Catholic Church

174
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,590
I've read the Bible and I know the Bible and I'm that's why I'm an atheist and the guy says yeah

175
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,810
I read the Bible too.

176
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,090
Yeah, I know what you mean.

177
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,210
No, you didn't you see this is just stupidity that you see

178
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,530
So don't fall for that

179
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:23,930
No, there's very there's only a handful of people that have ever read the scriptures with comprehension that I've ever lived

180
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,690
forget about running into anyone that has

181
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,010
You see and then you have those that are on the brink of actually doing some

182
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,970
Revelatory work and bringing it publicly and they never do because there's no monetization

183
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,690
When I used to speak to people that worked with Ernest L Martin, I said well

184
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,790
Why are you using the Pope's work schedule and the term Christian and the crucifixion even though?

185
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,750
Oh, well, what you say?

186
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:58,650
Oh because you see well, you're saying Greek that divides people and We don't want to divide people and and no one will buy our materials.

187
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,590
Oh And that was like, oh, I'm out of here You know, I'm out of here.

188
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,430
Take your Ernest L Martin crap and go, you know, so You know, I mean and you see this all the time.

189
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:28,190
So now After that, I realized that there are a lot of good work has been done, but they're basically undigested pieces of corn in poop So then it was like do I feel like holding my nose and eating fecal matter, you know Sifting through fecal matter to get corn or do I need to do the work on my own?

190
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:38,130
Efficiently, well, unfortunately, it's a combination of both but lately I've just been doing it mostly on my own based on things that I've been used to finding out.

191
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,050
So back to the Piece of shit moving to call the Ten Commandments people read the scriptures.

192
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:52,910
Let's say when they get to Exodus 15 and They think they know what they're reading and when you read Exodus 15, I'm not going to read it You could read it on your own.

193
00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:13,610
However, even the piece of shit King James Does tell you That they fell to the bottom Like a stone they fell to the bottom like lead now if they're already walking on the bottom of the Sea of Reeds How could they fall to the bottom when they're already on the bottom?

194
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,090
You know what?

195
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,310
I mean?

196
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,310
Right doesn't make any sense

197
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,690
You know, so little things like that

198
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:28,890
Very importantly there are scenes that are discussed but then the scene is never really discussed

199
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:37,330
Based on common how common the scene might be in everyday life or just something very unusual and

200
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,390
The actual sentiment behind it like I'm not going to quote anything here

201
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,590
But just to recall when Moses had spoken to the angel behind the bush that didn't burn remember

202
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,850
There's no burning bush, right?

203
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,010
It was an angel that gave off fire and his fire did not consume consume the bush, right?

204
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,190
There's no burning bush because if that angel was not there the bush would not be burning, right?

205
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:13,730
But anyway when he comes down after a while with Joshua and to see his wife Sam do you recall what happens an angel is sent an angel of Yahweh to kill Moses right and they're battling right?

206
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,710
Do you remember that one?

207
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:30,590
Yeah Yeah, well why it was why isn't that depicted or discussed and doesn't support his wife circumcised I Think their child or there's a circumcision that happens and she throws a foreskin at Moses and the angel.

208
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:30,970
Do you remember?

209
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,230
Yeah so Why are these things overlooked?

210
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:54,810
Do you know how many when you bring up the scene of Having a discussion and given orders by an angel whose fire does not consume the bush and after it's like boom all of a sudden They have to skip to Pharaoh Why why is that detail left out?

211
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,070
Because they're not reading the scriptures.

212
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,770
They're looking at the movie You see here's another point.

213
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:13,150
I don't need to get over the there's no crucifixion right because you guys are familiar with the verses that Pontius Pilate washes his hands and Returns the Christ back to the Judean authorities, right?

214
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,990
And there's a little bit of a controversy about that, but they do successively achieve a mosaic execution, right?

215
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:32,430
Mm-hmm, right Right, so I don't need to go into that and that's where the image training is That's why I keep saying why do they put this guy nailed to a cross wearing a long-haired freak wearing a diaper on a crucifix?

216
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,190
showed to you, which is a sclepius and Someone recently was talking about.

217
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,290
Oh, that's Mithra It's like no.

218
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:58,350
Well, no Mithra is different if you look up a sclepius, so there's actually another one I can't remember his name starts with an N It's an Egyptian Greek God of health and if you could look up the busts it looks just exactly like the JES Character that they show everyone today.

219
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,570
That's why when you ever hear in Christian circles, they always say God bless you

220
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,710
They use that term a lot

221
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,590
That is not a biblical term that is at all actually we don't even find that in Scripture those words put together

222
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,630
Elohim bless you or anything like that

223
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,750
My correct, you know if meditate on that you'll see that comes from the turn that from the cult of a sclepius

224
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,630
Because they're into health and all that and the gods, you know, so

225
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,790
Very very interesting so

226
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,850
Yeah, I popped a wiki into the chat about a sclepius

227
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,190
Okay, and there's another one starts with an N.

228
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:56,290
It was a there are actually several other minor ones that sprung up They kept springing up until the third or fourth century AD Constantly these health just like today when you're on the stupid rectangle aren't there is health gurus always popping up They're obsessed with it.

229
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,950
Okay, and and you ask them how the body works and they can't All right.

230
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,430
Let's go to another one.

231
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:21,710
For example You know when the Christ I don't like discussing New Testament stuff because just way out of league It's like discussing PhD nuclear physics or something as a metaphor in public It's just not a subject you discuss in public, but let's let's jump in there for a moment I believe it's in the book of Matthew.

232
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:33,350
It's recounted in Mark and other places as well When the Christ goes on a field trip and he's being followed And trolled by the Pharisees all the way up now.

233
00:20:33,370 --> 00:21:06,390
Most people think it's Jerusalem because it says the Pharisees from Jerusalem He's all the way up like north of Galilee In like Caesarea area like up to where the old Naphtali and Dan Tribes would have been you know, like the northern part of Israel and The he's apparently revealed this is the first time he Affirms who he is to Shimon Shimon bar Jonah, which is Simon Peter, right?

234
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,690
He's made son of Jonah, right?

235
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:19,090
He says who do you say I am and he says you are the Christ is well No, man could have ever seen is you know gotten that information unless it was given to him, you know external input wink-wink, right?

236
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:31,950
and Then he says that on this rock Now we don't you know, we don't know most people think it's Peter, but it doesn't just on this rock Okay, what rock?

237
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:46,410
Why would he bring up a rock because the Ecclesia the church is the Ecclesia just means those that are called out Just a group of people is Where I will build My Ecclesia and the gates of hell will not prevail against it, right?

238
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,470
And that sounds really like romantic or it sounds like in a religious from religious

239
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,550
Religiosity point of view it sounds like a strong affirmation of good versus bad, you know

240
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:05,010
Oh like, you know, like Darth Vader won't prevail with a Death Star, you know kind of stuff like that

241
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,450
This is how people take it

242
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,590
But if you actually look that they had traveled up to the northern parts of Israel

243
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,190
right

244
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,790
Because prior to that there's discussion with the Pharisees which came from Jerusalem not in Jerusalem

245
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:27,150
But if you understand that that location that were the setting that they were in there is an actual pagan temple

246
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,110
Called the gates of hell.

247
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:38,170
It was to Zeus and to Bacchus and They had a little Theater in there as well, and it was carved in rock very impressive.

248
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,170
Are you guys familiar with this?

249
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:57,930
I'm not Why don't you either one of you Google in gates of hell or gate of hell temple, northern Israel And it's right by it's like What would be the old area of Dan or it would be?

250
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,350
Like north of Galilee what you called?

251
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,810
Copernicum Caesarea, that's where they were by the way.

252
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:38,010
They did at least a one day's journey boat journey But you put in okay, I got it Temple called the gate of hell, and it's to Bacchus and no it was to pan and to Zeus I believe It was it was a Greek slash Roman inspired Canaanites it was it was like modern Christian is everything mixed in right it was like Christmas Easter everything thrown in it's carved in the rock It's quite impressive.

253
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,190
There's some buildings and platforms up up against there.

254
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,510
I'm going off of memory Do you guys are you finding anything on the rectangle about that?

255
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,010
Yeah?

256
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:58,450
I got it right now I've got a couple of it a little bit of wiki And some reading material Right that was impressive looking piece of work though.

257
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,310
Holy smokes

258
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:07,010
Yes, that was like when Scientology first came out or the asked remember in the 70s and 80s a lot of people were talking about

259
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,170
Yes

260
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,330
Well it came out before that

261
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:16,370
but it was popular well during the time of the Christ this cult of Zeus and the cult of pan and the cult of

262
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,630
Bacchus and the cult of

263
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,390
Diana and the cult there was a major major

264
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,190
How many times you ever heard me through the years the first century especially the time of Christ in Israel?

265
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:32,190
There was a major resurgence of spirituality like just fads everywhere like look at how much the clothing changed between

266
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:38,210
The entire 19th century not very much, but look at how it changed between the 50s 60s 70s and 80s

267
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,950
You see what I mean like rapid change rapid fashion trends major trends

268
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,030
Okay, that was what was going on during the first century

269
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,790
During that time and they were north enough

270
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:55,530
and if you look at way if you were to peg that on a map the gate of hell or the gates of hell of

271
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,350
Hades really hadios

272
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,450
The pilon to an adios, I think it was what it was called in Greek

273
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,650
You would and if you read it in Greek by the way when you see pilon de adios, oh, that's a city

274
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,270
That's a place.

275
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,090
That's not a metaphor.

276
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,790
That's that's the beauty of being able to use the other languages, but

277
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,410
When you go and look at that area that is in the northern part of Israel

278
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,090
I would say it's north of the Sea of Galilee

279
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:27,270
Maybe half a day's walk from the sea northern coast of Sea of Galilee right up in the area of Dan

280
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,090
the ancient part

281
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,130
not too far from

282
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,010
Yeah, I believe also if you study in the text in the text

283
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,890
Then that the Christ is in the area of Sidon and Tyre also

284
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,810
Which would have been a date more than a day's walk?

285
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:54,470
If you go to Matthew I think it's like Matthew 14 or 18 or something like that in the middle of the book of Matthew that's recounted in other places He's up in the Lebanon.

286
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:10,850
This is when he meets the Canaanite woman, I believe also You see okay, so basically I don't okay I had to give a little more detail when when you hear something like yeah, you're you're the one I'm gonna build my group on Groupons, and I hear the place that discounts tickets and stuff.

287
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,030
No

288
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,150
The mob basically he's telling me when I create this mob

289
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,870
The this temple this religion will not prevail against it, you know what I mean

290
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:29,430
But it did it did prevail at the time see so that was one of the things that must have confused his followers

291
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:36,550
Because he said it would they wouldn't prevail but they but how many people read the gates of hell like oh that sounds like poetic and

292
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:43,430
An inflamed poetic metaphor there, you know, like oh the evil, you know, cuz gates of hell doesn't sound good or evil sounds evil

293
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,130
Okay, that's just like saying the evil will not prevail against it

294
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,750
Do you see what I'm do you see what I'm talking about thinking in 3d, right?

295
00:26:51,930 --> 00:27:01,170
So would you read when you read scripture you see gates of hell is it like just you know Good and evil or some poetic use of metaphor or could there actually be a place called the gates of hell?

296
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,490
And if we actually look at the setting the chances are that he was standing in front of that area.

297
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:12,370
It's like 99 Percent that he was because it already says he was right in that area, right?

298
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,750
Mm-hmm.

299
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:34,400
So this is what I mean about thinking in 3d and that you don't allow yourself to be a slave to image training Yeah, because when you see something with her example, it says in the gates of hell will Not will not prevail against it.

300
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,560
You think that is Wow.

301
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,480
What a beautiful, you know rhetoric, you know or metaphor, you know

302
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,420
Words being used it makes me feel a certain way, but you don't stop and think and say well

303
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,900
Maybe that's because the gates of hell is an actual physical real thing

304
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,800
You see

305
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:01,080
Just like when you read in Exodus 15, well, you know, they sank to the bottom like a stone they sank to the bottom like lead

306
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,180
Well, duh, if they're already walking on the bottom and the waters fell on top of them

307
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,940
Why would that be an issue and why would it also be an issue that it was when the Sun came out that they made?

308
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:28,090
pursuit right Now what you see It's a good way of detecting things too because like in our own society white is black black is white and They would do the same thing in the book.

309
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:36,350
Yeah Yes, but don't fall for the flowery terms Like if I said to you we're gonna do this right and the gates of hell will not prevail against it You're like wow Greek.

310
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:56,670
Yeah, it sounds good Right heavy image Yeah, but you do did you did I didn't tell you the gates of hell was it was actually a real place yeah, yeah Well place based on a religion right of Zeus and Pan and Bacchus and No, Mithra yet in that.

311
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,610
Hmm.

312
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,310
Is it is it overt why this particular place was significant?

313
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,790
Yes, because it was the it was like the Esther Scientology of the 70s.

314
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:16,550
I remember in the 1970s In the 80s every other person I met that seemed well-educated pulled me over to the site Have you ever heard of Dianetics L.

315
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,010
Ron Hubbard?

316
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,790
I'm like no, but after a while.

317
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,770
I was like, yes You know, you're like the fifth person this month.

318
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,370
That's talking to me about they even had TV commercials on Dianetics Do you remember that Bruce?

319
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,270
No, no, nobody.

320
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,390
I remember the Scientology Increase it's called Dianetics was this book?

321
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:41,250
Yeah And then there was Yeah, there's Dianetics late at night in the 70s and 80s Dianetics get L.

322
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,670
Ron Hubbard's book You know, okay, it was way of getting it in your face.

323
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:49,130
You know, this was a promoted a heavily promoted thing going on at the time

324
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,250
But this was a time of great change which took you know a full generation to take place

325
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,990
Whenever you have these ages that go in two thousand year chunks, that's another thing

326
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:10,790
There's this this there's the actual timekeeping aspect of a thousand years and there's the actual cultural traditional aspect of

327
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,430
2,000 years and there's the generational change the small generation

328
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:22,170
Which is the physical one and then the great generations which could be 70 or 220 years old as we see with the Patriarchs

329
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,050
And then there's these major changes that happen, you know, but the law doesn't change it's just that

330
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,030
The you know

331
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,330
the the culture or what's allowed to to

332
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,530
to happen changes

333
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,530
The law just sits there what I mean by the law is like, you know, what's right and wrong, right?

334
00:30:44,570 --> 00:31:13,730
That just sits there unknown Here's another example, you know, you ever noticed throughout Scripture the thing to do is to walk on water the Christ walked on water They walked on water crossing the Jordan they walked on water In Exodus, oh But here comes who's the greatest prophet according to the Christ John the Baptist Right, and what does he do now?

335
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,770
You're no longer walking on water now You're being dunked and submersing under the water.

336
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:23,110
You notice big change Big change how come nobody's talking about that?

337
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,370
Hmm what's the change that took place?

338
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,970
Throughout scripture.

339
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:48,320
It's the prominent thing when it comes to water is to walk on it Like it's like as if it's land and now all of a sudden the greatest prophet that comes according to Christ He puts you underwater hmm There's a whole bunch of stuff to discuss about that.

340
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,600
I'm still working on put it doing a presentation on that I haven't thought about that in years.

341
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,380
I started thinking about it a few weeks ago

342
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,280
So and this very significant

343
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,500
Scriptural references to that

344
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,720
but nonetheless

345
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,280
If you look at we gave a couple of scriptural examples here, there's a lot of examples that I've given recently

346
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,140
Regarding other aspects which are actually more important to the body

347
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,280
Like if you don't know how the body works, it does scripture doesn't matter

348
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,360
You're not gonna have an angel walking into the room and tell in reading it to you like a bedtime story

349
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,180
So if you're in a total physical wreck forget about scripture, you're probably not you know what I mean

350
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,240
You're probably gonna have to wait for the resurrection, right?

351
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:55,400
So I Give a lot of references where I bring up if anyone wants to bring up Go to the rectangle and put in cross-section of the intestines Epithelial cell or the lumina which is the general thing if you look at a close-up nothing get goes through that right at all You can see it's totally closed off the same with the alveoli and the lungs and all that, right?

352
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,380
It's completely sealed.

353
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,900
There's no absorption

354
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,140
It's all induction

355
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,060
right, so

356
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:15,390
So on one side you're being told absorption absorption absorption, but do you does anyone ever stop and think and say well

357
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:22,330
Where what are they discussing the intestines, you know, it's very easy for me to access what the intestines look like

358
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,950
Let me go look at that

359
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,870
And when they look at that how many people raise their hand and say shit man, nothing goes through that

360
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,010
That's totally that's like a steel belted radial tire.

361
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:50,110
Nothing goes through that How many people have done that That you've heard of none Right, you know why because it's the information age just like During the space age you say how many of y'all suckers have gone up into space?

362
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,030
How many of you how many people raise their hand?

363
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:09,940
none So it's the same metaphor as being dunked underwater as far as information Yeah, you could then you start doing like what I was explaining to someone recently It might have even been Sam recently as well.

364
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:26,960
But this I was a little stronger with this other Individual I was basically saying just go to Scripture and start putting together, you know when the term comes up and find out statistically where how it's being used So when you talk about the water What and what other ways is water, you know?

365
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,719
Like in during Noah's time, you know, what was on the water and everyone else and everything else went where?

366
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:46,239
underneath the water Right, and there are references to Noah's time right, there are references to Don't don't be concerned about harm to the body.

367
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,679
It's the harm to the spirit Right, right you come out of water, right the the water is a neuter thing.

368
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:15,520
It's a neutral thing You know in in Genesis it There's creation and then there's the remodeling but there's no mention There's mention of light being created and being good There's other things but there's no mention of water being made is there or there's no mention of the water being good or bad Is there in Genesis right at all?

369
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:25,640
So when when you see walking on top and going under now you go under it as a rite of passage now It's not the water that's important.

370
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,800
It's the motion and who and what is going over or under

371
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,820
right

372
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,620
Because it's not mentioned as being any aspect that's relevant to itself

373
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,320
like the light is being you know was made and it was good, which is

374
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,160
a

375
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,840
Another discussion, which I want to

376
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,500
Bring the future perhaps in private discuss light a little bit more because you know

377
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,760
If you don't have a physical body

378
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,920
You can't see light the way we do the gods don't see light like we do

379
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Because they don't have a physical eye everything that you see and call light is because you have that wet juicy round eyeball

380
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,500
Unless you have a wet juicy round eyeball in your head

381
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,440
That's functioning as according to as we know eyeball should function.

382
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:22,000
You don't see light the way we discuss light So it's a completely different thing from that respect Now I'm not saying that the gods can't put themselves to have a round juicy eyeball that works or an angel But it's not what I'm talking about.

383
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,840
Of course, they can do that.

384
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,860
But this is not the light that we discuss

385
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,520
so

386
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,780
very other aspects

387
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,160
You know keep coming up in communication

388
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:41,430
Or lack thereof, I think the best way to I think we haven't been on very long

389
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,030
but I think I

390
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,290
The the metaphors I gave regarding the lack of communication and the lack of perception

391
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:55,490
Using scriptural references, especially to this crowd is I think it hits you between the between the eyes pretty good, right?

392
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,870
I Mean, I think food for thought for a lot of people.

393
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,930
I mean, there's also the aspect of

394
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:10,270
when you say that these are things that perhaps people are not considering as far as the obvious nature of of

395
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,430
how certain things in the biblical text are

396
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:19,470
Brought up and people prefer to allegorize or use them as poetic metaphor

397
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,510
There are a million things that could be considered at any one given

398
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,510
particular

399
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,250
Point in time

400
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:34,050
So the fact that people aren't able to pick up on what these things actually mean even just from an observational or common-sense

401
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,430
Perspective that has as much to do with how their perception is being steered as anything

402
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,410
It's not necessarily that somebody's a moron or that they're stupid

403
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:47,130
But if their perceptions being pushed in someone somewhere else, there's no hope for them in a certain way

404
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,530
Well, they're in a moronic state and they're in a stupid state

405
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,850
Yeah, it's very hard to really say someone is

406
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:01,030
Definitely a moron or stupid, you know, you might they might be in that state long enough that you no longer want to be around

407
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,710
that person

408
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,210
You get it

409
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,750
like

410
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,490
I'll just I'll say that I haven't said this before probably I'll say it once I've been around people

411
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,670
That I thought were in a moronic and stupid state and later on I see the

412
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:20,090
Wikipedia pages on them and I see them on high government position and high positions in industry.

413
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:45,510
I Know that doesn't mean much because we all know how things work, but you see what I mean So that doesn't mean that It doesn't mean other anything other than an observation also being moronic Dubbing someone as moronic or stupid in that state Is it possible to be in a moronic and stupid state from your young adolescence to the day you die?

414
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:53,890
I don't know of course So but that still doesn't make that person moronic and stupid at the resurrection does it?

415
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:05,650
You know, so well actually yes Some cases they are going to be making some very bad decisions based on lack of inquiry and lack of knowledge But still it is a condition.

416
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:13,890
It is not them but yeah, what what I see happening that Again, I you know in the end.

417
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,430
What did you get out of the industrial age or your forefathers?

418
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,770
What did you get out of the space age or your forefathers?

419
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,450
What are you getting out of the information age?

420
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:30,700
right So and then again, you're trained at your based on your culture You know does it bother you go to a society of headhunters?

421
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,720
You ask one of them one if they invite you over

422
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,120
Does it bother you they have five shrunken heads, and he says yes, it does as a matter of fact my brother has 20

423
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,940
It's their product of their culture look at what's going on here

424
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,920
In this it is firmly in place you know

425
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,600
Yeah, but that's not

426
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,820
What I'd like to discuss this thing on the topic is the 3d how to think in 3d

427
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,840
which is the literal you know the the symbology of the alpha of the the language that you are versed in or fluent in and

428
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Then you have the the vocal part.

429
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,720
You know radio music.

430
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,740
I think a lot of people are affected by songs and lyrics and

431
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,220
Just verbal communication, and then you have the pictography or the imagery the iconography

432
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,100
All right, and those three, that's what I mean how to think in 3d, and you always you have to go

433
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,960
you know three-way on that like

434
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,280
You bring up the intestines or you know we turn on the in the middle part linguistically is saying

435
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,360
Oh this buy this because it absorbs better

436
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:40,180
You need to detox to absorb you know better right clean yourself out the list other so you absorb better

437
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,860
okay, then you have the pictography where you go look at the

438
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:52,400
Anatomical drawing a detailed anatomical drawing and you see there's no physical way anything can physically be absorbed and then you actually go

439
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,960
To anything in and you know what they write in the medical anatomy books about the intestines absorbing

440
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,720
They give you a list of all the various

441
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,640
Cell names and areas of the intestine that they've identified

442
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:14,720
You know using whatever language, and then they say therefore the intestines must absorb in the anatomy

443
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,740
But you look at what they're showing you that it must be absorbing and it's physically impossible that anything goes through there as a matter of fact

444
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:32,060
many older cultures absolutely rely on no absorption on these organs in order for them to use the

445
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,840
These organs as water carrying and liquid carrying vessels they actually rely on their lack of porosity

446
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,780
you see

447
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,820
To be water carrying vessels some cultures.

448
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,980
You know like you know soccer balls and football those things originally made from organs, right they use Water gliders and things water bladders.

449
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,180
Yes.

450
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,600
Thank you.

451
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,960
Okay, so they actually rely on those things to not be

452
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,620
You see permeable

453
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,180
So you have the three aspects the middle aspect is absorption you hear that all the time

454
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,020
Then the primary written would be the anatomical books

455
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,400
They they list the description of the of the features of the organ

456
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,120
But and then they tell you because of all these features it must absorb

457
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,720
All right, and then you go to the pictorial and you see that it's physically impossible

458
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,740
All right, and the same thing with with

459
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,840
By the way has anyone?

460
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm not good You do it on your own time does anyone within let's see earshot have an unabridged King James Bible or an unabridged Bible, you know what?

461
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:55,940
I mean by unabridged It's it's like a larger book and it has the full introduction in it before it gets to the book I think I do and I think it's in a box stored away somewhere good But if has anyone right?

462
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:04,280
this is a rhetorical question read the introduction to the King James Bible or any Bible you have the introduction and Usually some abridged versions have them.

463
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:15,860
That's why they call it a bridge by the way The reason why you're reading it the way you're reading it, right and I years ago I told someone I said go read the interest Oh, yeah, I have it right here.

464
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,240
It's about eight pages long You know the the introduction to the King James Bible how they kick why you know, why it's called King James, but the premise.

465
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:43,840
Yeah And after you read that do you still want to read that no, there's no way yeah, they're telling you what they're doing Even the Somewhere used to be on their website the scriptures the guys that publish out of South Africa they even At some points made exceptions.

466
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,680
Yeah, we're trying to be as close as possible

467
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,500
But for you know printing and my whatever they say monetary, but you know for reasons we have to retain this particular format

468
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,140
You know, it's which is King James, you know

469
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,800
so

470
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,460
They have a slightly different

471
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,060
Arrangement they've pretty much put most of the books in the right order except for Daniel

472
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,680
but nonetheless

473
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,980
the discussing the 3d

474
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Aspect is going to make some people spend more energy on

475
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,900
How they interact with themselves and others and yes, you do interact with yourself

476
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,980
But he'd give you an example because you have a conscious.

477
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:29,380
I'm presuming most people have a conscious a conscious You're in this physical container this physical body.

478
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,200
It's very lonely.

479
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:48,580
I was actually The metaphor was done about this recently, it's very very lonely To be in the body that you are because you know, let's show around people who are telepathic and even then it's not a full-on stream Even with the gods, it's not a full-on stream Right.

480
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:58,120
I mean there are individuals that I'm sure have had a full-on scream aka the Christ right Imagine being born with full knowledge, you know when it was time, right?

481
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,480
So

482
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,500
But to go to the point where we consider ourselves

483
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,780
It's extremely lonely like people who cannot let's say people who are functionally literate and sound like they're educated

484
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,540
But who cannot communicate well are very lonely people

485
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,360
All right

486
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:20,700
One of the things about having a best mate or best friend or a wife or a husband or something is being able you don't

487
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,360
Say share your soul with them, you know and being you know, even then if you don't communicate, well, you're still gonna feel alone

488
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:33,020
And they'll bury his ideas off, you know, yes and communicate just the hardcore communication

489
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,620
Now which means just you know, my thought to your mind and your thoughts to my mind

490
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,140
right

491
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,640
so

492
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,560
The human body the way we're made with the self-contained consciousness is a very lonely place

493
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,600
Very very lonely to be in

494
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:58,590
So once we know we get used to it being alone within ourselves in our minds, right and

495
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,140
The spirit, you know being in the container is you know, and unless it's expressed

496
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,780
You're you're pretty much you remains with you

497
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:15,060
The lack of communication I think goes hand in hand with the lack of perception and vice versa and discernment

498
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,700
right

499
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,460
So but here's the thing again

500
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,540
No matter how much talk of industry there is back in the day

501
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,120
all you saw was the skies being polluted this nasty smell in the air a

502
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,360
Lot of cheap goods being available and a lot of people bitching and whining about they don't like their work

503
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,520
So what'd you get out of it?

504
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,700
Then there's all this space-age talk from when did you say the space-age started Bruce for sure in the early 60s?

505
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,320
Yeah, the 70s.

506
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,700
Yeah, right in the 50s.

507
00:46:44,760 --> 00:47:11,160
They're already hitting everybody with it They were preparing all the Russians and Sputnik and all that Then yeah, then you had the introduction yeah a few little test runs There's a YouTube video of a woman in 1960 or 61 Riyadh burning up entering into the atmosphere from a Russian cosmonaut She's a woman and a guy a bunch of guys ham operators in Italy recorded it She's talking about that.

508
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,720
She's been yeah, so the So But what did you get out of the space program?

509
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,140
Nothing?

510
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,780
We got Velcro Yeah, you know nothing basically.

511
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:31,780
Yeah, what are you getting out of the information is what I'm saying nothing Many times I've said the Internet or all this communication stuff is a beta test, right?

512
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:55,540
It's a mic test until later on so it's part of one of the devices things are going to be used to unite mankind You know with audio and video But you know here's an example like recently I was looking at a few things and this popped up at me about internet privacy and Like recently a couple got upset about Amazon Alexa because it recorded and send a conversation, right?

513
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:14,800
I saw that on the home page And you know, it's really stupid like if you somewhat doesn't invent a guy speak to does design work well, but he says I got this Alexa says some stupid-ass nigga technology and And and I said if you sent me one of those things I'd Wouldn't even open it will go right to the curve.

514
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,400
Anybody watch the boondocks, by the way No, no, that's Alex McGruder.

515
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,340
Yeah.

516
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,860
Anyway, that's where I got it from but the the nigga technology, but

517
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:32,980
Just means if you can't connect the printer to it, but now anything goes by printer because of Wi-Fi, but here's the interesting point

518
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,800
If you look at all these privacy and anti privacy statements

519
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:46,340
What these companies say is your privacy is very important to us now most people they're not they're telling you the truth

520
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,220
Most people take it in a sympathetic point of view that you know, oh that means they're not going to invade it

521
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,220
No when these companies tell you they're your privacy is very important to us

522
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:04,000
That's because they're harvesting it and monetizing it and the more private it is the more monetization they get you see

523
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,480
They're actually telling you the truth

524
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,560
But most people don't take it that way

525
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,320
Most people say oh, they said my my privacy is important to them.

526
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,360
It means they're protecting it.

527
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:47,180
No, they never said they're protecting Right Get it Yeah Yeah, if you ask a thief right before he breaks Into your house, he'll tell you your door locks are very important to me of course Right, right Yeah, like a rapist, you know, your ass is real important to me, right Anyway, you see my point.

528
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,500
Yeah in front of you.

529
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,240
I was like, oh man

530
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,760
Now I think giving examples of discernment on that is important as well, but I would suggest that

531
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,160
If you take one aspect of it alone, it could be of overbearing aspect like for example

532
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:15,300
I've like the crucifix the whole, you know guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper the long-haired guy know that

533
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,740
Okay, I've spoken to people that has studied scripture all their lives and when I brought that up, they're like, huh?

534
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,680
What what?

535
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:31,200
And I'm like, yeah, go let's go over it again You see because for them that image overpowered their ability to discern what was happening What was written?

536
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,120
I Mean doesn't it say that the Christ would lived and died according to what?

537
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,500
the laws of Moses Isn't there a verse that says that or am I imagining it?

538
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,080
but anyway

539
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,160
So there's another that's a direct

540
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,340
Right

541
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,880
So the idea is that between the pictorial the linguistic and the

542
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,040
The oral things should harmonize in a way that if they don't

543
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,080
Check well cross-referencing all three

544
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,620
Now when all three are easily in concordant, you know across the board you you got some good information

545
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,400
validation verification

546
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:23,700
but when it's not concordant like when they show you the guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper and then you read scripture and

547
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,220
then you

548
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,560
See what people are talking about

549
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:33,320
Well, the image and what people are talking about is very strong seems concrete when you read the text

550
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,920
That's also very concrete, but it somehow has taken the backseat

551
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,420
Just like that an example with that would be the gates of hell should not prevail

552
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,740
Prevail against it because when you're giving a good versus bad scenario and you say well

553
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,400
The gates of hell will not prevail against it.

554
00:51:52,540 --> 00:52:07,980
That sounds like some really well chosen words for some rhetoric right or rhetorical statement something that go should you know be something that will imply a Sympathetic response to don't be afraid of the evil, right?

555
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,360
You see so you so how much do you?

556
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,080
You know, it's just it's just like people so what version what do you read Greek was it?

557
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:23,500
I read all of them I got to know all of them You got to know all of it, sorry You know, I mean how many times have we brought up?

558
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,600
Well, what do we read?

559
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,860
Will you read which one do we which interlinear which version which by all of it?

560
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,200
Why?

561
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:38,880
Let's say you only know the interlinear or the Hebrew and the Greek How are you gonna have a conversation with someone who is genuinely willing to expand their reference?

562
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,400
That only knows the King James as a reference.

563
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,220
How are you gonna have a conversation?

564
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:56,550
Very difficult, and if you just know the King James you cannot discuss Anything with someone who knows the interlinear or all the mistakes were made in the versions, right?

565
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:12,630
So yeah, unfortunately you have to do all of it The scam is is large because it's an adversarial See most people think evil is this coming in destroying?

566
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,570
Yeah, that that's to me.

567
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,330
That's not more.

568
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,650
That's not evil I was trying to tell someone in an interview saying all Greeks gonna talk about the failure.

569
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:33,390
I'm like no Talking about the cleanup You know when you see the destruction that you read about in Scripture that is not the failure That is the cleanup point because it if it had not failed it would need to be cleaned up.

570
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,390
You see what I mean?

571
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:35,930
right

572
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:43,230
The failure of what the failure of morality the failure of law the failure of good

573
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,530
the failure of you know good intent and

574
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,150
Then the cleanup crew comes in because your people are given chances

575
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:58,730
To you know restore that quote-unquote sin which means missing the mark or failure

576
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,710
And if not, then you have the overt cleanup crew

577
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,090
So

578
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,290
so the aspect about the 3d the combination of all three is

579
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,710
heard someone say he's trying to make a

580
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:18,810
Saying like what the public knows is not true, and what is true the public does not know

581
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:27,520
Right so what is truth the public does not know and what the public thinks is true is not true at all

582
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,040
Now that's a really good thing to lean on

583
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,060
I think I've given here's another one where I use the 3d

584
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,840
Communication perception when I go into the shops into commerce

585
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,020
You know I need a particularly knuckle-dragging lotion for someone right and I go to the health food store

586
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,080
And I say what do you have knuckle-dragging lotion?

587
00:54:49,220 --> 00:55:09,530
She goes yes, so well He's got four five six ten of them series which one is the best because this is the one that everybody buys and immediately I say well, that's the one that I don't want And she goes why I said well having you met what you call everybody your average customer How the hell would they you see what I mean?

588
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:15,350
So that's a really good thing to lean on Very often you see in marketing and Bruce in America.

589
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:21,070
You'll see this is our mother this sold you know 10 million sold Wow You're right.

590
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,970
That's why you get right to

591
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,910
No, that's why you should never buy one

592
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:34,310
No not on that merit alone, but be cautious not I mean outward you know fatalistic rejection

593
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,250
right

594
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,210
so

595
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,870
But yeah be considerate of that

596
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,470
So why am I why did I call for to do a stream on this now is because you're coming up on a time

597
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,550
Here, especially the midpoint which would be the 2021

598
00:55:53,570 --> 00:56:00,750
Time period is summer where there is going to be more of an overt spiritual like this shit shouldn't be happening

599
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,310
You know what I mean?

600
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,670
Okay, it's bad shit.

601
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:17,650
That's gonna be normal like you know animal attacks natural disasters Diseases wars people acting unusually those things always seem to be around but through their frequency is going to be in an odd way Well you in other words.

602
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,070
Can you perceive?

603
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:26,490
The answer is yes of course you're asking can you perceive like when bad things happen or strange events

604
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:32,650
But can you excuse me can you perceive that they're so strange as it excuse me and so out of the norm

605
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:41,350
That it's it's if you had the right glasses you can actually see an entity coming and forming it to be so I mean overtly

606
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:47,230
You know there's an entity behind everything, but it's going to come to a more overt point

607
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:54,230
Where the reason why it'll be like that is so you're willing to accept what comes after that when the you know after the?

608
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,010
2025 period comes around

609
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,650
so be cautious of how these things are described and

610
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:08,370
The way they're going to be talked about and the way they're going to be shown is going to be different what it was written about it

611
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:18,990
The paranormal you know which is that's an interesting term right yeah, that's what I'm talking about

612
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,210
You know so oh

613
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,190
Other examples are

614
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:38,170
Anything you see in film or television or university school all that that is an example of that the vagueness

615
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,550
That's taken as as writ

616
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,390
How many times you seen on TV authority say that this guy blah blah blah okay?

617
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:46,730
Well hold on hold on or?

618
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:51,770
You know Korea said hold on how the hell can Korea talk?

619
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,670
What are you talking about?

620
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,410
Can I meet mr..

621
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:55,350
Korea you know?

622
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,950
What authorities what are you talking about?

623
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:07,810
That's already been going on for a very long time and everyone has settled into it When you hear stuff like that?

624
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,590
Oh, that's like tons of shit is B.

625
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,730
That's pure propaganda How many times you heard says the Russia said that the president Putin whatever will be doing this okay?

626
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:35,140
Ho ho hold on hold on that's pure propaganda See a court document the state of Illinois state of Massachusetts United States a fictional versus a you know plain Defendant pure fix that's attorneys getting or we can't do that.

627
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,020
It's completely illegal.

628
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:36,400
Also.

629
00:58:36,760 --> 00:59:04,630
That's called a fictional plaintiff And that's happening up by the millions every day easily easily yes Can't fictional plaintiff is illegal and unlawful go look it up It's passing through so in other words Yeah, the mop-up is the only thing that could fix it Which is an oxymoron because if it has to be mopped up, or you know completely demolished.

630
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:23,950
It's not fixing it right well The miners talk about that either fix it or blow it up That's what they say the miners right, and I'm not joking you know once Yeah, like if they have a crowbar In a crowbar which dynamite they put it you know if they know the next demolition charge is gonna go off They just pile the stuff there, so it'll just turn to dust anyway.

631
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,710
You know they don't have to haul it off, right?

632
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:33,690
Yeah, yeah So should I keep going I don't have anything else really in mind.

633
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:34,970
It was just to bring up the

634
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,210
Unless you guys have any questions or any questions in chat

635
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:43,310
I'm outside right now just came inside to make myself a little more Java having a smoke

636
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:44,510
but

637
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,670
regarding the the combination of the literal description

638
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,830
explanation literal works Ritz

639
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:57,170
Versus what people are saying and you hear and versus pictures illustrations diagrams

640
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:05,010
You know like like a blueprint is a combination of both, but but both written and pictorial

641
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,730
But primarily pictorial right a blueprint

642
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,130
Yeah

643
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:10,850
Yeah

644
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:22,400
So to discern all of that now the other thing you're going to hear especially talking to some hosts recently is the level of

645
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,480
Subjectivity is just so ridiculous like I was recently on with Chuck, and he got so subjective

646
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,600
This is not I mean, I like Chuck.

647
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,700
He's done a lot of good work me But so many times I wanted to say all right, so you don't like that so do you like ice cream?

648
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,380
You know do you like TV?

649
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,800
You know it's like wow man.

650
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,240
You know the subject and anywhere you go.

651
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:51,200
I've actually seen various professionals recently medical and Totally subjective again.

652
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,140
Well.

653
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't really like this.

654
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,500
I think I'm gonna just prescribe that I'm like whoa whoa whoa What do you mean?

655
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
You don't like it?

656
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,440
And people just sit there, okay?

657
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:13,600
like whoa This subject subjectivity is just it's just rotten to the core you know opinions the Opinions are like assholes.

658
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,640
They say but only assholes go on opinions alone You know the Supreme Court.

659
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,800
What do they give?

660
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,460
What are the judges give they do they talk about verdicts in law?

661
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,960
No, no opinions opinions.

662
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:25,420
Yeah

663
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:34,880
So yeah, that is a very strong fate a chronic disease terminal disease is opinion

664
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,760
very very bad from any point of view I

665
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:45,540
Want to get all the people that are based off on opinions put them on a boat put a big hole in the boat and

666
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,080
Then ask them what their opinion is

667
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,640
Well, it's like this psychological stench has been on us so long

668
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,200
It's it's you're almost acclimated to it

669
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,920
Quite well the headhunters great, so

670
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,360
We got nothing left left to it to do except for just express it in different ways

671
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,480
The subjectivity would be a fine example I

672
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,900
Know it's been a while.

673
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,040
Oh go ahead good

674
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,600
No, I say you said subjectivity, but you might want to be subjective with certain things like scripture

675
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,660
Come into it with a subjective notion that you can't take anything that's being said there for granted

676
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,660
You're gonna literally have to bring up everything

677
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:37,100
So that's a subjective point of view by looking at everything in there

678
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:43,080
I think I gave a couple of examples or one strong one tonight with the gates very very fine example.

679
01:02:43,280 --> 01:03:09,050
Yes Yes, I Gotta personally say I glossed right over that one Mm-hmm You took it as a literal sympathy literal visual clue You know It's kind of like the pep talk in Star Wars before they go to fight the Darth Vader, right?

680
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:27,850
Right, that's how you tell the coach at the basketball game or right, right, you know It's made you feel good inside, but you did and then you kept going Okay, great, right it provided just a smidge of curiosity Yeah, what are the gates of hell no not enough to act on it.

681
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,090
No, not enough.

682
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:48,350
No, but now Well, how much you know that's again people ask what are you really all of it Everything that's out there But obviously when you discern something as being garbage and validate it and verify it to be such Do you dwell on it more than something that has a greater value?

683
01:03:48,630 --> 01:04:05,830
No, just but you still have to be familiar with it You got to give it equal representation in search in a qualitative form and in the Time you you spend on it should be Reflect the quality right exactly or quality more quality more quantity.

684
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,510
It's a friend look less lower quality

685
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:12,530
I

686
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:18,770
Still have discussions frequently not much about the historicity of Genesis, you know

687
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:24,470
The scriptures is very his even, you know, there's a lot of historicity, you know

688
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:29,630
In other words the stuff in the beginning of the book takes precedent in time before the stuff at the end of the book

689
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,490
You know when you when you look at what's been ensued about who has penned

690
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,430
Chronicles Joshua Kings and all that which all happened

691
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,030
Over a thousand years after or five hundred years.

692
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:57,410
Let's you know thousand to five hundred years later really five hundred years later done by the courts of Samuel and Eli mostly Samuel Had put all that together because you can when you read the book of Joshua and study it you could see that's done in narrator It's it's second.

693
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:59,230
It's you know second person.

694
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,830
Yeah second person.

695
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,930
Yeah, and

696
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,390
And their quotes in there as well

697
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,610
Like for example

698
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,130
one of the time

699
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:16,770
Timely quotes and there's a basher the book of upright when that was that was penned around the time when these were compiled

700
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:19,210
But even they have historicity

701
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:28,190
Right, so how can you have man-created male and female and their job is to in Genesis the sixth day

702
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:31,810
Their their task is

703
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,570
They're out on the they're out on the earth

704
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,290
is to

705
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:39,870
Multiply and be fruitful multiply right like they say in the Old English

706
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,090
Then there's the Sabbath and

707
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,770
Then there's another after the Sabbath after the Sabbath.

708
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:55,930
They're in the garden now, which is not on the earth Let's say or not the earth at large And they're not created Adam is not created.

709
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:02,350
He's formed By himself and his job is not to be fruitful and multiply his job is to what?

710
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,750
Prune the lawn.

711
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:13,950
Yeah I was gonna always ask you I remember you talking on that before and But there's no other mention of them whatsoever.

712
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,630
And so would they be like to control a controlled study versus

713
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,150
us

714
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:21,730
Yes

715
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:26,470
The control and also maybe they in Scripture you'll after a while

716
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:31,530
One of the things you make note to self is the lower the less character

717
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,070
You're considered to be like the more evil the less mention you get

718
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:44,610
Right hmm like you'll see in Genesis when the generations you'll see all these sons is that they were wicked, you know, they're not mentioned

719
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:46,430
real

720
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:51,810
So the less the gods like you the less they mention you in the writ

721
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:58,090
But you know overall you have to understand also and this is I've looked at it from my

722
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,810
systemic point of view

723
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:06,210
But the way the scriptures are compiled there that yes, they do communicate history law prophecy all this other stuff

724
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:12,750
but they themselves each word in each space between the word and the and the layout of all the words is is

725
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:13,690
input

726
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:20,710
In other words, it's a program it's all the bytes and bits to to put into the right hardware or the right

727
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,670
You know configuration or something to animate

728
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,490
You see right, right

729
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:26,570
Yeah

730
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:32,290
In other words the words are aligned and everything is set up the way it is because it has more use than just being writ

731
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,630
So

732
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:42,690
But the historicity of things when you when you look at the historicity of Scripture

733
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,830
Even what you call the New Testament in the very end it falls apart

734
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:56,350
The very so do you look do you feel that there there is you know, how you always said that there's always a primer for the

735
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:56,670
code

736
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,270
Mm-hmm.

737
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,370
Do you feel that there's a primer for that?

738
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:02,430
Yes what you just meant?

739
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,590
Yeah that I will not discuss publicly But I'll give hints for it.

740
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:05,910
Okay.

741
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:23,689
All right, it's in the it's in this it's in the Psalms and it's in my goodness All right And now when I say it's in the Psalms That's that should light like you said Oh my goodness, because you know how many things are in the Psalms that are just deftly profound that everyone seems to ignore Not everyone.

742
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:27,189
Well, yeah, I kind of took it a different way.

743
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:29,890
I was like, well how ironic you know

744
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:35,910
Yeah, it's also in Exodus because Exodus was the only time that we had

745
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,710
that much

746
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:39,810
Interference from the gods

747
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:43,689
angels gods, you know minor angels cherub

748
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:45,750
interacting with

749
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:51,790
People we're talking about a time of 40 years consistently on a daily

750
01:08:52,810 --> 01:09:00,430
You won't find any other time other than what was going on in the the earlier part of Genesis that

751
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,890
The angels

752
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:06,729
Major and minor were dealing with mankind on a daily basis for 40 years.

753
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,370
Are you with me on that Sam?

754
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:14,109
Yeah from your recall Yeah, so there was a time in history that 40 years where?

755
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:19,590
the gods were interacting with millions of people and their leaders and

756
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:25,370
To the point where they got used to it and there were they did and they were still negligent

757
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:26,510
right

758
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:27,930
so

759
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,189
Right

760
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,010
Yeah

761
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,590
But the reason why I say the primer is in Exodus is because at that time

762
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:41,189
There's at least three or four maybe seven instances I should say

763
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:44,029
But I know three or four off the top of my head

764
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:48,069
I could tell you where Moses was directly given orders to do something

765
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:53,950
Because Yahweh was sending his angel to show him something or to train someone else

766
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,550
Are you with me on that Sam or you remember that?

767
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,910
Yeah.

768
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:57,710
Yeah, Bruce.

769
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:58,690
Yep.

770
01:09:59,050 --> 01:09:59,910
Very direct.

771
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,130
He's like listen Moses Okay.

772
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:01,890
All right.

773
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:15,050
You got a chill because I'm sending you my My head angel he's gonna show you ABC and D or you got to gather these 70 elders or you got to bring me this guy and I'm gonna show him how to build this and You see Mm-hmm.

774
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,090
So with that heavy interaction

775
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:24,470
The mode the modus operandi of of things being done a very very very specific way

776
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,190
Yes, not just how they are, you know replicas in heaven, but they were done very specifically, you know

777
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,930
Just like when you send code over the wire, you know, it has to be very specific

778
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,650
Right, and then it's in the Psalms

779
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:41,710
And now in the Psalms mostly the Davidic Psalms where David the psalmist in this case

780
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,030
was prophesying

781
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:49,090
Certain aspects of artifacts that were in

782
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:52,250
Construction during the time of Exodus, right?

783
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,870
And that's your primer

784
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,800
and and the other aspect is

785
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,670
the the

786
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,190
Software engineer would be the Christ

787
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:10,050
Right, so you have to also the the primer is in what the Christ had said also

788
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:17,590
All right, but without the Psalms and without what Moses had done the just reading the Christ

789
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:19,570
You won't get it because even after his resurrection

790
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:24,770
He was walking with some of his disciples and apostles and they said if you want to know about

791
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,490
Who I am you have to know what Moses?

792
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:34,750
The Psalms and the prophets not you got to form this new religion with Santa Claus

793
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,770
right or biblical scholar

794
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,430
Bullshit they've been putting in front of you for 2,000 years

795
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:48,470
Now the the concept here's another thing about the 3d thinking

796
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:53,130
You know, there was at least several periods in the Old Testament

797
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:58,210
say thousand-year swaths of time where nothing was going on and people were just

798
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,050
stupid like between let's say Adam and the flood and

799
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:07,370
After the flood to the Exodus, we're looking at almost 2,000 years a

800
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,190
Little bit under 2,000 years

801
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,750
Basically nothing going on except for Abraham and right

802
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,330
Marie, okay

803
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:21,390
So is it so or you know thousand-year swaths of so is it so inconceivable to say that?

804
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,790
From the first century till now nothing is going on

805
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:31,590
Is it so inconceivable to show that as another example of a large swath of just you know

806
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,670
Stupid human stupidity being employed as the norm

807
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:42,570
No, very reasonable to say that

808
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:47,770
Hmm

809
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:54,650
Past 2,000 years have been a waste of time for humanity, but not for the gods because obviously

810
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,790
You have to go through this time

811
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,550
All you need I think of the last sonic event

812
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:08,530
I said all you need to keep these idiots going is fire and genitalia and both things require rubbing, right?

813
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,490
sometimes right You see my point.

814
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:11,890
It's right.

815
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:17,650
I mean, yes, I do break it down from heuristics, you know, if you take away genitalia That's it.

816
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,230
And if you take away fire, that's it, right?

817
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:24,610
Yeah, imagine no ability to make fire Now, what are you gonna make metals?

818
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,670
You're gonna make plastics.

819
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,590
You're gonna make computers.

820
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,410
You're gonna make food.

821
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:55,710
No You're gonna have agriculture Nope That you know, the Greeks were spot-on with Prometheus one of the Titans taking fire right giving it to man, yeah so He was a Titan but nonetheless Comparative I would say this is like comparative Communication ability, you know, you know how they well, here's another aspect to it.

822
01:13:55,730 --> 01:14:09,870
I believe Half of what you see and none of what you hear or was something like along those lines so hmm All right, so we're at a point now.

823
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:38,490
We're Not we were at a point well things are gonna start to get kind of bizarre But Greek they've always been bizarre Yes But bizarre from a paranormal point of view that people do not recognize because when you say paranormal again People's minds go to what they've been shown through, you know are the arts, you know film Superstition and scripture has nothing to do with that, right?

824
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:56,370
I'm talking from a scriptural point of view and also couple that with the notion how many people have access to what's called the scriptural narrative and to identify the end times and If so many people can actually identify it when it happens, how many wouldn't they call foul?

825
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,370
Right, right

826
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:07,950
But they're not because they don't comprehend it now to say that it's incomprehensible is slapping the face of the gods

827
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:16,690
Because that's telling them that the God state they want to communicate with us and their and their communication is futile because we can't understand it

828
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,290
so you have scumbag preachers and ministers and

829
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,890
You know quote-unquote religious type says no one can understand it.

830
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:41,350
They're basically saying I don't really need it because I got your Attention and you're supporting me, you know so Well, that's pretty much in the crux.

831
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:42,570
You can go into more detail.

832
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:52,650
I I didn't take write any notes I do have notes on this subject somewhere Like about image training on how that's been used on people.

833
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:58,070
There's nothing wrong with using images communications You know very often.

834
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:07,210
I test I don't test the gods and how I'm being protected But I test the consciousness of men when I see these vets and they bring up.

835
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,810
I'll bring up deliberately side

836
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:16,250
What do you call it when you come from the side laterally or tangentially bring up the flag and then

837
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:23,490
Deliberately disrespect it and say that it's just a cloth like any other I could use it to wash my car or polish my shoes

838
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:23,810
right

839
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:29,590
And they freeze when I say that because they don't know whether because they've been trained like a dog

840
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:35,030
To bite when Nate when that you know disrespecting the flag, right, right

841
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,370
You know what?

842
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:42,150
I mean, but yeah, that's a that's a foot now when you look at national flags the way they're being used

843
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:46,870
Those are the origin of those were they were Admiral, you know Fort and

844
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,870
maritime

845
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:54,190
Communication devices even you know, there's actually the flag Corps in the Navy or whatever

846
01:16:54,190 --> 01:17:01,950
Using the right term when two ships were passing they would raise and lower different types of flags and banners to communicate right colors

847
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,270
Geometric patterns.

848
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:04,210
Mm-hmm, right.

849
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:27,790
They don't do that anymore I think there was I had a book on that a while when I was they put on their cars ago Yes, so it's just to communicate and now it's turned into this religious relic like a rabbit's foot and you know Like the rabbits, but if it's so lucky the rabbit had four Right what happened to him he had four of them what happened to him, right?

850
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,310
And so anyway

851
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:34,630
The image training aspect can be good, you know, obviously

852
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,130
Image training is when you recognize the alphabet

853
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:43,950
But the bad thing about it is that's all you need people feel that's all they need to achieve

854
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:48,690
To sound off words to go into the audible, you know the but they don't

855
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:55,170
Comprehend what words mean the hence the etymological references that I've been bringing up for over a decade

856
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,230
Which I'm glad to see there's a little bit more trending of that going on

857
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:05,050
I go around sometimes and see what's going on on the internet and I see them

858
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:13,870
Them whoever them is the great unwashed reaching towards etymology where but you know in the past that was

859
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,950
Foreign it was not a thought

860
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:18,250
so I would suggest that

861
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:21,490
Even now

862
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:30,090
You know a small attempt to see what things really mean is it's a little too late, you know too little too late as they say

863
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:36,430
But the recognition of images going back to that is basically what the alphabet is, right?

864
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:43,320
So or when you're doing electronics, you know, what is a resistor?

865
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,620
What is a capacitor right?

866
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:56,120
The ground is a little squiggly line, right Capacitor is a long line and a shorter line Parallel to it, you know, I lose everybody you guys still there.

867
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:14,800
No, no, it's just listening Yeah, so here's the other thing, you know This is from an eschatological or let's say from a scriptural point of view Is there any anybody pick up on anything that's going to be coming prophetically where imagery or iconography is going to be used?

868
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:27,350
Or is it going to be you know, totally cognitive mental, you know You know, in other words, I'm asking that as a rhetorical question to focus on that.

869
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:43,850
In other words You read in Scripture During the time of Kings was a Jeroboam or someone else he set up they set up golden calves again Remember was it Kings or Chronicles the bad kings of Israel?

870
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,010
They got into making golden calves, right?

871
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:56,830
Yeah It states that they actually made golden calves to worship Okay, so, you know right there it's showing you.

872
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,910
Well, yeah, you know if you were there, guess what?

873
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:02,290
You would see a golden calf, you know an iconography.

874
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:10,730
We'll just you know, cast gold Are we are we looking out for anything specific in the near future or you know all the way to the end?

875
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:16,550
You know think about that or is it going to be more spiritual and basically, you know, very general

876
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:21,230
Impression made on mankind through aspects, you know of the earth and the sky

877
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:25,110
You know, these are things to you know, discern and try to pull out

878
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:30,930
Because right now as it is the language is changing radically from computer talk

879
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:32,410
All right

880
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,550
the advent of computers

881
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,450
Is changing the language

882
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:43,530
So what is there to watch up and here's the thing people are so moronic for all these years

883
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:48,070
They still haven't realized that they're being ruled by the goddess religion when it comes to law

884
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,910
They're still asking for justice this that and the other they don't know what it means.

885
01:20:53,010 --> 01:21:14,950
They think it's good hmm All right, I just went in front of the chat there's eight people Wow, that's like twice as many as I would think would comprehend what we're saying and I see We got seven hell.

886
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:21,130
Okay Seven yeah, and we got seven on the stream at the moment and it's fine.

887
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:33,570
Yeah Okay, that's again twice as many as I think could comprehend what we're talking about but this mobbery, uh-huh Was Vandy's in there?

888
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:56,250
hmm So basically Does it sound like you there's a lot there's a lot of work to do Yeah In anything that you're doing it, you know, it's gonna require some time, you know years ago It took an hour to make supper now anything more than 15 minutes is considered a grind and a chore right for most people But then again, what does anyone ever?

889
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:08,970
as a regiment or routine Ever had to go to the what they call the gym to work out with weights or machines Do you remember the first first time you went or the first few times you went to the gym?

890
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:18,350
And then you recall Yeah, if you recall going there frequently after a year, how did it feel very different what you did after?

891
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:31,990
Performing at the gym for a year You know was nothing compared to the first day I mean the first day that you were overcome by you know, what you did it was nothing a year later.

892
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,750
I should say Right.

893
01:22:33,870 --> 01:23:03,270
It's no big deal Right, right So It's like a muscle the more you exercise it the stronger it gets and the your ability goes up So, how do you go through stuff really rapidly, you know is is the key and that's just a muscle, you know and discernment Yes, there are technical ways to read faster You can I don't know speed reading.

894
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:14,610
I don't I haven't found any system that I could recommend But think about it if you have to go through everything like I suggest again with the Bible versions Isn't it good to be able to read fast?

895
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:37,570
See, but then again the purpose of this sonic event was not about speed reading or memory or getting stronger Anything was just to be aware that the manipulations that are still taking place by various minor and major pundits On what's called the internet in a net?

896
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:51,590
the subjectivity they're still being ruled by really poor iconography and imagery and still being ruled by the urban myths and urban legends and street talk You know even in finance.

897
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,550
There's something called a street price, you know the market price, right?

898
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:15,550
and Also when you start checking up on what's been memorialized in texts and reference documents You'll find that there's a disparity between the three now very rarely is there Harmony between what is being shown in pictography?

899
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:19,310
Let's say what is being talked about and what's in the reference documents?

900
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:37,270
Now I'm just saying that because that's what I've discovered in any field So so is everybody with me on this?

901
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:38,750
Yes, yes.

902
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:51,850
Oh, yes A whole lot of things to think about that's for sure Yeah certain things That are finite, but yet are arduous like scripture scripture is very finite.

903
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:55,990
You can you know you can Take all the information put it on a hard drive.

904
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,850
You can hold it in your hand or hold a book, right?

905
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:04,750
But when you go through it, it seems like it's infinite because the way it's structured, you know, there's a lot to go through and

906
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,470
You have to you can't

907
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,750
It's

908
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:13,250
Like a mathematical equation which mathematics is just a communication

909
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,650
You can't overlook a variable or a function or an operation

910
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:22,150
Otherwise, you'll fall flat on your face when it comes to figuring out what's on the other side of the equal sign, right?

911
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:43,210
Right, and you can't get what the other side of the equal sign if you miss a function a number or an operation So yeah, you're starting over One thing I brought up in chat in the book of numbers There's the mention of the book of wars of Yahweh.

912
01:25:43,730 --> 01:26:07,960
I dropped it in chat in a few weeks ago Yes, I do remember By the way, this is fair game to anyone and whatever when when they tell me They've read a book and I'm like, yes, so, you know, and so as I just finished the book of Genesis, yeah, so You know, well, I just read Revelation.

913
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:18,600
Yeah, so And the way I do that is by saying well, I'll pull out something that I know they missed which is most of it You know, that's why someone recently put I just read the book of Numbers.

914
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:25,120
I was like, yeah So well, did you remember the part where it said and isn't it written in the book of the wars of Yahweh?

915
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,400
How many people are discussing?

916
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,260
Where is the book of the wars of Yahweh?

917
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:34,880
It's mentioned in the book of Numbers none I mean, there's a couple of things on the rectangle, right?

918
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:44,430
It's missing Yeah, I don't know how much can be said about a missing book.

919
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:48,010
No, that's right But how come not much is being said about it being missing?

920
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,040
Well, that wasn't query.

921
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,020
It's actually to take the thing seriously

922
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,240
Yeah

923
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,160
Yeah, exactly

924
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:06,600
very often I brought up the analogy of the you know after Moses spoke to the

925
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:14,540
Fiery angel behind the bush that didn't burn he comes down and is you know, and there's a really potentially tragic and fatal scene and

926
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,640
And you know bloody, you know, I think his wife says this is your bloody, you know, whatever self

927
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,380
And no one talks about that

928
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,980
You know, it's like wow, you know, here's this God

929
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,240
The chief God wants him to do stuff and then tries to kill him.

930
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:49,120
Don't believe me go read it But somehow it's overlooked and somehow it's not discussed why why would a God task someone and Suggest protection.

931
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,400
I think more than suggest.

932
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:59,680
He said he would and then Try to kill him on The spot or not on the spot, but you know later on what's going on here?

933
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:18,370
Yeah, there's just more one book There's about 40 or 50 books that are mentioned in Scripture that are missing And when I say 40 or 50 books that are missing It's when you I believe say maybe you might want to help me on this.

934
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:27,750
Is it Chronicles or Kings whenever a King is mentioned or a battle or some change Doesn't it state isn't it written in the annals of the book?

935
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:33,330
You know the wars of this King or the books of this King or the Chronicles of this, right?

936
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:34,890
You're familiar with that.

937
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:36,190
Where are those books?

938
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,760
Well, are they missing as in missing destroyed?

939
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,900
You know, or are they missing?

940
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:55,640
You know from the surface right surface dwelling earth inhabitants don't have them and what's the reason for writing something in a book?

941
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:01,140
Now there's many reasons, but the main reason is for posterity so others can see it who have not been there

942
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:10,100
Right, so, you know you can

943
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:18,820
But also those books are being used against people like recently I got into the habit of watching late-night TV the Star Trek

944
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,540
Right just it's this perfect escape

945
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:27,380
I mean, you know, you don't want to take drugs to escape because it could be painful if your mind is clear, you know

946
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:32,460
So you just put on something that you grew up with makes you feel like, you know, you're watching some theater

947
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,140
And there was an advertisement recently some psychic woman is coming to town

948
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,300
To tell people about their dead loved ones, right?

949
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,720
And do you know how that trick works?

950
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,260
Have you heard there used to be a TV show based on this by the way?

951
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:55,820
This guy used to sit there in the audience and People would raise their hand and pick them and tell them that you had someone that died and they're okay And they want me to tell you this and this is that and they'd be very specific.

952
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,280
Do you know how they pull that off?

953
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:03,110
I've seen some people just ask, you know generic questions.

954
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:07,670
No Yes, there was the answer wireless headsets, wasn't it?

955
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:17,330
Nope, very specific before you go and sit in the audience They have you do a sign in in a guest book and then once everyone's assembled They also take your picture.

956
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,330
They have a video camera

957
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:23,570
No one on stage the people that are on stage are behind, you know in a green room type such setting

958
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:28,870
So now they get everybody to sign in and they know what you look like and they have the audience wait

959
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:31,790
They entertain for about an hour and during that hour

960
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:37,650
They start looking up everybody who signed in and they see if there are any recent deaths on public records and who they were

961
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:43,890
So the the guy on stage the psychic only picks the people that he's familiar with

962
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:49,490
So a lot of you know, he'll skip around and he'll only pick the ones that he knows

963
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:52,290
He's got the scoop on with the wireless headset also

964
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,190
to get information

965
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:55,570
that would make

966
01:30:55,570 --> 01:31:02,430
But if you go to a small one of these groups and you refuse to sign the book no matter you no matter how much

967
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:09,200
If no one is raising your hand and you're the only one they will not call on you because you didn't sign the guestbook

968
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:15,660
So be careful when you go to sign guestbooks not now and you know now it's different now they could lift off

969
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,400
Information off your phone.

970
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,820
There's technology you can buy

971
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:25,360
It's very very expensive that you could lift off, you know information off of people's devices without them knowing it at all

972
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,900
I'm not talking about logging on to a Wi-Fi at a cafe either

973
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,060
right

974
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,360
So

975
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,740
That's how they do it using a book

976
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,860
Guestbook very simple

977
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,920
See how books are being used

978
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:51,630
So

979
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:59,150
Yeah, the 3d thought which is you know, what is spoken what is illustrated and what is written literally within the language that you

980
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:02,730
subscribe to or fluent in or recognize

981
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:09,290
Now, you know, here's someone who understands how to read the Roman letters from a through Z the Roman alphabet, you know

982
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,190
Well French Portuguese Spanish

983
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:12,830
English

984
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:15,350
German is written in the in those right?

985
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:23,270
I mean, there's some German characters looks like a Greek V B, you know, but you can read let's say you're just educated in English.

986
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:26,030
You could read the Italian newspaper You could read the Spanish newspaper.

987
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,510
You could read the Portuguese newspaper, right?

988
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:52,410
But you do comprehend it know because the way the letters are strung together are different Think about it right Same letters as in English, but the one when the letters are strung together differently now all of a sudden it falls apart It shows you how subtle the What can be communicated with the written word is right?

989
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,440
Images are much more powerful, you know the badge

990
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:04,340
No, if you're trained that a badge, you know, one of those metallic shiny things on a uniform or someone presents

991
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:08,760
No matter what culture even if you you grew up in a village

992
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,620
And then travel the world no matter where you went if someone presented that you were already trained

993
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:23,520
To what that means right or a stop sign being a red octagon or a red circle at an intersection

994
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:26,020
You've already been trained

995
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,900
You see

996
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:32,670
so the level of training at this point has

997
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:35,190
several layers of

998
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,410
degradation from cosmic centership

999
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,770
deliberate social engineering

1000
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,630
deliberate dumbing up

1001
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:48,210
When you combine all that it's one hell of a cocktail when you look at

1002
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,850
Information age you got to be joking

1003
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,450
You've got to be

1004
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:54,050
kidding

1005
01:33:55,090 --> 01:34:02,030
You're getting as much out of the information age as the people did out of the space age and the people did out of the

1006
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:05,050
Industrial age, what do you get out of the industrial age?

1007
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:13,550
Let's see Do you guys remember the Superfund cleanup Bruce maybe here in America where they they made so there was lots of them toxic Yep, there were lots of them.

1008
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:38,310
They're still going on Utah Yeah, where they would do toxic dumping which is really nothing toxic But what happens is when you do certain processes in industry where you refine certain compounds and elements So much that they become toxic and then they're dumped in that state without being neutralized or encapsulated.

1009
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:45,650
Yeah So I think they changed it to brownfields later on Perhaps.

1010
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:48,570
Yeah, I've never heard of Mm-hmm.

1011
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:57,690
So it was a big deal in the 70s I think with car with the EPA came around the 70s and they started trying to figure out how they're gonna scam everyone out of That but okay.

1012
01:34:57,690 --> 01:35:01,770
So what'd you get out of industry is you know, what's synonymous with industry?

1013
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:12,890
And I mean this clearly is industrial pollution planned obsolescence right a caste system You know what?

1014
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:23,430
I mean like middle-class that's you know Yeah, it'll say we don't have you have a caste system in the Western world You ever heard of middle-class upper-class right rich and it's right in your face, you know, it's slavery.

1015
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,110
Yeah

1016
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:31,370
It's worse than slavery now because at least the slaves knew knew that they were under bond

1017
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:36,210
You know, you know if you're watching the old movies, especially Romeo, I'm a bonded

1018
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,810
I'm a bondsman me or bonded men mean them

1019
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:43,870
You know, I have a contract that I have to be as man slave for seven years like in Scripture

1020
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:50,110
Yeah, after that I have a chance to you know, break away or be bought or sold or redeem myself

1021
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:55,550
But these people now these slaves now they're spirit, you know, they have no idea

1022
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,390
They're too patriotic to realize their slave.

1023
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:10,430
They're too diseased You know you just wave a flag and create an enemy and Tell them that they should bow down to this goddess religion called justice.

1024
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,190
Just keep asking for justice.

1025
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:19,230
You'll be fine There's no chance There's no chance at all Is it the old metaphor snowballs chance in hell that these people are ever going to get out of it on their own?

1026
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:44,350
That's why in Scripture if this is not interrupted it stated that there'll be no life Left it doesn't say man's life me all life So They're already Past the level of you know insane or unsane or whatever Already past that point long time ago So you so again, what'd you get out of the industrial, you know?

1027
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:51,170
What do you the same stuff the okay the effects on the ecology of the industrial aspect and the space?

1028
01:36:51,890 --> 01:37:07,360
Age and all that is the same effect you're getting With the information age, you know, but it's a different level of toxicity more of an auric or spiritual stench, right?

1029
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:18,030
Which I remember when you were doing a little chat about space in the smell of space Yes smells like burned flesh.

1030
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:35,710
It's like burnt flesh Yes, that's that's interesting because the gods were doing a sacrifice and if you read in the Let's say numbers Deuteronomy especially a lot of times in Deuteronomy That smell was a savory sweet savory odor.

1031
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:36,890
They enjoyed it.

1032
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:45,110
Mm-hmm Well, they didn't and there was other astronauts that even said that there was like a smell of Was it brandy or something like that?

1033
01:37:45,110 --> 01:38:12,090
It was sweet Like metal and in a sweet metal kind of smell Yeah, very interesting From a former AT&T, you know, you say I Spoke to an AT&T engineer most people that when you say AT&T engineer, they don't associate it with space But you know 90% if not more than that of the domestic Let's say American satellites were put up and maintained by guess who right?

1034
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:38,110
Yeah You told me that it was very strong ozone and very foul smell and the reason I met him Let's say over 25 years ago, he's in his 90s at the time because he was into antique clock restoration and One day someone said go pick up this old grandfather clock from the 1700s and bring it over to you know Such-and-such so I show up to the house and guys on the phone.

1035
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:40,970
He says it's just right there Help yourself.

1036
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:46,670
So he was on the phone for like 45 minutes and I'm waiting there and he comes down and he's like I told you you just help yourself.

1037
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:48,490
I'm like, well, where the hell is the grandfather clock?

1038
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:52,450
And he says we see those five Five gallon buckets.

1039
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:56,890
It's in there and I'm like really These buckets here are the clock.

1040
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:58,350
He's like, yeah, I was like, okay.

1041
01:38:58,630 --> 01:38:59,070
Gotcha.

1042
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:14,110
You just that's all you have to say Wow There's a little subjective personal experience And then this old man had a lot of time on his hands and I was willing to listen, you know about that specific stuff What was going on up there?

1043
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:17,150
another guy I

1044
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:18,930
Did a project here in the southwest

1045
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:26,050
Retired he said my father this guy was already old and he says my dad's here and his dad worked with the OSS

1046
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:28,870
He had some interesting stories to tell also

1047
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,070
So

1048
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:40,270
Okay, so there you go information age is crap and if you don't believe it you're not paying attention

1049
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,050
But here's the interesting thing

1050
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:47,070
The

1051
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:52,870
Understanding it from a prophetic point of view at any time by the way is efficient, right?

1052
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,370
You know the time that you're living in

1053
01:39:56,470 --> 01:40:02,690
Give you know example that I always give is let's say you're in Europe in World War two and you have some evangelistic

1054
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:10,410
Whatever idiot telling you well, this is the book of Revelation the apocalypse happening right now and you're in Europe with all the bombs falling

1055
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:14,710
You know, let's say in a city or something it sounds very convincing doesn't it

1056
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:18,990
But if you really know scripture, you know, it's not time yet

1057
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,050
For sure, you see no matter what is happening, right?

1058
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:30,070
So from a small prophetic point of view what you will see is I think I've been

1059
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:34,190
You know with all the quote-unquote Jew bashing that's been going on

1060
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:37,270
I don't like to talk much about Israel unless it's necessary to

1061
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:42,630
Because the public at large, you know is too moronic to objectify what I'm trying to say

1062
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:50,290
But this is the time right now by the way that just started and I again with Ocelli when I was doing Ocelli in the Greek

1063
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:52,270
In 2015, I said 2018 this spring.

1064
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:56,110
No, it's always like oh, no, I think it's 2017 I'm like, what are you basing it on?

1065
01:40:56,150 --> 01:41:00,270
He got quiet because he's you know, just like normal humans, you know

1066
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:05,290
Doesn't know what's going on and you know has been livening up a bit over there

1067
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:11,330
You know, yeah, and you can't and you can't be yeah, you can't be accurate without accurate information

1068
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:15,670
So your opinion has to come through this is not that what I'm suggesting here

1069
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:22,450
about the importance of 2018 in the spring is what I'm also been suggesting through the years is

1070
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:27,910
Spring is planting summer is growth fall is harvest winter slow down time, right?

1071
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:33,950
Back to Israel what's going to be happening in the 2018-2019?

1072
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,410
You know spring summer fall

1073
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,450
2019 spring summer fall

1074
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:40,790
2020 spring summer fall

1075
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:43,860
2021 spring summer is

1076
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:51,130
Israel being played to the point where its very existence might be threatened

1077
01:41:52,090 --> 01:42:00,370
Right, and you know how I was saying earlier be aware of supernatural paranormal and all that and they're being a very strong

1078
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,290
supernatural assistance

1079
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:09,310
But also keep that to preserve it but also keep that coinciding with a consecutive

1080
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:14,070
format of judges repeating as prime ministers

1081
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:22,890
After this prime minister and possibly after the next one is going to be the position of Samson is a good position

1082
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:23,490
There's a good

1083
01:42:24,230 --> 01:42:24,790
strong

1084
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:32,170
Indications that I see in terms of the overall timing that the next prime minister will be more in the position of Samson and during

1085
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:33,330
the time of Samson

1086
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,630
Israel was subjugated

1087
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:39,390
to the Philistines and the only way

1088
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:46,390
Modern Israel could be subjugated to the modern Palestinians is not by the Palestinians, but by world

1089
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:50,570
Opinion world sentiment against it you see

1090
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:55,510
And of course local squirmishes, you know, what's odd about that?

1091
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:56,450
Is that?

1092
01:42:57,150 --> 01:43:00,770
Right now Israel doesn't listen to any of them anybody out there

1093
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:05,870
No, so that's is that in itself is going to be a turnaround

1094
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:08,410
But you but here's the thing

1095
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,910
Let me just put it this way and I'm gonna try to be as neutral and neuter and objective as possible

1096
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:17,470
You were in Israel in that place in that this time right now you wouldn't either

1097
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:23,450
I think I gave an example if you speak to people in Israel that are interacting with their neighbors

1098
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:27,270
especially the Palestinians the thing that's usually being said is

1099
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:31,770
When you do you live next to the Palestinians in Israeli speaking, let's say

1100
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:39,010
If you try to remain neutral they try you give an inch they want to take a mile or a yard

1101
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:42,450
Right if you interact with them, they always try to take advantage

1102
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:47,010
But the moment you try to defend yourself, they cry foul that you're killing them

1103
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:48,370
Right, right

1104
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:52,650
Right, and this has been going on for a very long time

1105
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:59,190
So this harshness that you see right now is a reciprocal harshness

1106
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:02,030
Not because Israel should be doing it or the palace.

1107
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:03,770
It's just the way it is again.

1108
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:11,010
Go back to the Star Trek analogy you have the humans you have the Klingons and the Romulans, right?

1109
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,290
Like the Klingons to them.

1110
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:16,910
It's the most horrible thing is to die of old age.

1111
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:18,170
They have to die in battle

1112
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,030
That's their culture

1113
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:24,630
Right, right the way you punish a Klingon is by putting him in an old age home

1114
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:32,110
You see he has to die in battle and as they get older they want to go into battle and die in battle

1115
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:33,370
So they're remembered honorably

1116
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:38,150
Now take that and transfer it over whether it's the headhunter mentality or whatever

1117
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:43,570
To the mentality that they have in that part of the world, which is very ignorant on both sides

1118
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:47,770
I mean you want to take the ignorance of what quote-unquote in Israeli?

1119
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:57,130
They don't even know anything in their own book All right, what I mean, you know, let's say, you know the scriptures very little it's not anything Put it this way.

1120
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:07,310
I've never met even a rabbi that knows the scriptures Even though they open the book of Isaiah every week and Read out of it, you know, it's part of their kadasha.

1121
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:09,650
Whatever prayer morning prayer after a prayer, right?

1122
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:21,850
Yeah, they don't know the book in its entirety very few and the ones that do usually There probably have been rabbis that knew the scriptures, but they cease to exist as rabbis They got out of it.

1123
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:23,910
Unless they just so evil

1124
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:29,670
They decide to go back in and you know, you know because it's their rather prosper because the more scripture

1125
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:35,150
You know the more manipulative you can be to these to these congregations because you know seem invulnerable

1126
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:41,070
Same with the Christians or any religion if you actually say the similarities are just

1127
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:42,790
exact

1128
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,250
Preacher rabbi same thing

1129
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:47,170
because the more

1130
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:53,070
You know scripture you become so advanced in thought form that it seems like anybody with any question

1131
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:54,750
That comes to you can answer it.

1132
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:55,750
You're almost invincible

1133
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:58,290
mentally, right

1134
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:03,890
So they they tend to gain a lot of power that way but for the wrong reason

1135
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:08,650
So we're talking about a very bad condition there

1136
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:13,590
It's basically going to be focused around Israel for the next three and a half years or four years

1137
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:17,710
I'd say three years three to four years, you know center it around that time

1138
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,950
but by around the time of

1139
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:24,810
2025 there will be no doubt in anyone's mind that there's a Middle East Union and a new you know

1140
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:29,810
New kid on the block new world power functioning out of there and things are looking very optimistic

1141
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:31,750
you see

1142
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:35,490
So how is how is the entire mindset of the planet going to change?

1143
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:55,890
Well, we'll see That's why they think a few sonic events ago or two sonic events ago I went through a very simple routine of looking up all the biblical cities Corresponding verses and yes, is that inclusive of conquests of David and Kings that is the future map of Israel, right?

1144
01:46:56,050 --> 01:47:12,370
very grim If you present that as the next let's say three to seven years Very it makes a lot, you know There's a lot of it's a Chris some grim nature and stuff out of there because how are they going to be, you know?

1145
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:15,090
Okay without getting into specifics.

1146
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:16,990
Let's just do one big chunk

1147
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:18,910
Lebanon is finished

1148
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:22,150
right pretty much and

1149
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:27,110
a third of Jordan is finished, you know, or a third of Jordan will be a

1150
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:32,570
Quarter of Jordan will be under Israel and Lebanon is done forget about Lebanon

1151
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:35,490
this will cease to exist as it does unless

1152
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:38,130
It is completely under

1153
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:44,750
Occupation, but they have a puppet government you see and they're still it still does exist as we know modern Lebanon, you know

1154
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:50,110
But that needs to be viewed very carefully

1155
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:57,630
As well, it is possible like, you know what the Korea's for example, those are all puppet governments, right since the 19th century

1156
01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:03,490
Don't think for a minute that Korea has had a Korean government since the 19th century

1157
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:08,710
I mean, well, that sounds weird, you know, well, Germany Germany has not had a

1158
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:14,850
Domestically run really, you know an autonomous government since the 1930s

1159
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,230
Modern Germany don't think for a minute.

1160
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:20,310
I don't know if you guys have ever communicated with anyone in Germany.

1161
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:22,390
They Bring up politics.

1162
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:28,910
They don't want to discuss it because like we haven't had a government 75 years Like what do you call Angela Merkel and all that going on?

1163
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:30,630
That's not that's total abomination

1164
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:38,110
Have you guys ever spoken anybody from Germany or anything like that not as of late I used to work with a lady but

1165
01:48:39,190 --> 01:48:40,210
She's gone back

1166
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:46,770
Yeah, so there's that capacity that reason I brought that up because that capacity is a strong potential as well

1167
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,870
So

1168
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:56,990
But Lebanon, you know for I think Sam and I've just tried to discuss it on several sonic or one sonic event a while back

1169
01:48:58,150 --> 01:49:02,670
Well, if you're gonna get a broad brushstroke and run it across Lebanon that's Canaanite

1170
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:06,690
Generally, you're like who are the Canaanites right?

1171
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:07,530
Who are the Phoenicians?

1172
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:21,410
Well, if you were just if you had to bury that axe real quick and just you know Move on to another subject yet yet one of those big 4-inch sass brushes, you know And you dip it in some red paint and you just brush right across Lebanon and write Canaanites on it.

1173
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:28,270
You see That would be fairly accurate from a generalistic point of view Are you with me on that Sam?

1174
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:29,290
Mm-hmm.

1175
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:29,790
Yeah.

1176
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:30,770
Yeah, it works.

1177
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:37,150
Yeah, it works, but it's not that simple but for you know General purposes.

1178
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:55,670
Yeah So the Canaanites are done for So, I don't know we're talking about I don't know What what how what form of bizarre net a bizarro world do you want to get into and this is it from now on I've said this a decade ago get ready for bizarro world, right?

1179
01:49:57,270 --> 01:50:10,610
So but it's gonna seem normal But here's the other interesting thing and because the thing is about you know, how do you discern these things?

1180
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:13,470
I've noticed I read it some people.

1181
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:20,710
I haven't seen in a while recently about a week ago and They're pretty they can rationalize.

1182
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:23,230
I mean more than more than most humans, you know

1183
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:27,190
so they're in like the five three to five percent ability to rationalize and

1184
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:35,790
They're you know wondering the end times came up in all disasters and all I said don't know remind you guys

1185
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:43,930
All this doom and gloom this like, you know terminal doom and gloom, you know with the asteroids and the solar event and the massive

1186
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:48,570
Oh, that is like the last week or last month or two

1187
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:50,710
You know what I mean

1188
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:56,830
It's not like you're gonna get hit by an asteroid and you got four years

1189
01:50:57,810 --> 01:50:58,830
You know what I mean

1190
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:00,670
so

1191
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:07,710
Yeah, it's and for sure the shit isn't gonna hit the fan, you know to a point where not only the shit

1192
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:10,770
It's the fan but the whole fan and the motor and the blades break off

1193
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:14,470
That doesn't happen till like the last few weeks or months

1194
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:19,410
Let's say I'm gonna give myself a little more room and I could tell you why really most the worst of it comes in one

1195
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:20,650
Day, right?

1196
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:23,450
How many times have you heard of the day of the Lord and right?

1197
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:29,550
It's one day and that day that fateful day and this day and this day over and over and over, right?

1198
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:35,550
Most of it the the major destruction comes in one day less than a 24-hour period

1199
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:37,730
but for sure

1200
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:41,910
the last three and a half years will be quote-unquote from a

1201
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:46,670
Kafka esque and a Nietzsche esque and

1202
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:50,070
Dante esque hell on earth

1203
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:55,920
The last three and a half years for sure you see what I mean

1204
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:58,700
hmm, and

1205
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:01,660
That's still a good decade away plus

1206
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:08,930
So there's no need to live in any kind of like oh shit, you know shit's gonna hit the fan.

1207
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:09,230
No

1208
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:13,530
It won't but here's the other thing about that last three and a half years

1209
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:21,350
No matter how bad things are for those that know those that don't know where things are gonna still think things are getting better

1210
01:52:22,130 --> 01:52:23,270
They're on the upswing

1211
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:30,430
It's only gonna be bad for those that know what what's going on and by that time

1212
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:36,590
I think that's going to be whittled down to a small secretive group or a small select group that is, you know

1213
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:39,710
Extracted from an immune from that, you know

1214
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,390
But still conscious of it

1215
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:48,150
So in other words the doom and gloom stuff is really a side on I don't talk about that much and I don't think about

1216
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:55,310
It much because it's very little and it's going to happen very hard very fast at a very compressed time at the very very tail

1217
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:58,690
end the interest in my purpose of speaking is

1218
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,270
you've got a

1219
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,850
Turnaround in the current society

1220
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:10,910
Which is the modality from the industrial age of space age information age that there's still a big question mark over

1221
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:12,910
everyone's head or what's coming and

1222
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:19,010
My point is what's coming is these massive changes political geopolitical

1223
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:24,630
economic military changes in the Middle East that the world will follow and fall into as

1224
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:31,250
Being the next the start of a golden age on this planet and all of that is going to be a lie

1225
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:34,310
But it's not going to be a propagandized lie.

1226
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:55,230
It's going to try to be actuated It will be physical evidence of it coming together like world peace for a little while, you know prosperity so on and so forth and all that is going to be starting around 2025, so my point of speaking and Rationale publicly in a private is how the hell do you take a society in the current state of mind?

1227
01:53:55,450 --> 01:54:05,450
which is you know industrial, you know, you could say it's also a product of the Victorian Age, but with the With all the quote-unquote modernists and moral changes.

1228
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:07,670
I think Victorian stuff has gone out the window.

1229
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,450
Would you say so?

1230
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:11,130
I

1231
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:19,250
Still hear different remnants of it people wanting to decorate like that or some such well certain etiquette

1232
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:26,310
Forms of education etiquette like if you go to a high-end restaurant what cuisine they're still using Victorian

1233
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:31,350
Standards, right, you know the place settings and and the way things are done

1234
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:35,930
but I think that's falling apart because for three years in a row Nobu or Noba and

1235
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:40,630
Bunch of snotty ass 20 year olds are voted as the best restaurant in the world up in the

1236
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:41,550
Whatever.

1237
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:42,410
I'm like shit, man.

1238
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:47,630
I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't even do takeout and they're voting it, you know, so anyway I'm there.

1239
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:50,150
I wouldn't even do take out from that's the best restaurant in the world.

1240
01:54:50,250 --> 01:55:08,710
So I mean already gone to pot there But I think they tour so you still industrial age and you're still and you're still Space age bullshit and you're still Information age that mindset which is still leaves nothing but a dark, you know, those black light light bulbs, right?

1241
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:11,990
No question mark what the hell's happening next every year.

1242
01:55:12,090 --> 01:55:15,250
These idiots are still crying At least they're not crying the end of the world.

1243
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:16,950
They were doing that more a few years ago

1244
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:22,950
But how is the mentality going to change to a perfect society that they're all going to fall into I mean everyone

1245
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:28,510
And including everyone I'm speaking to and listening to me now you are going to fall for the big deception

1246
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:30,330
You know

1247
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:32,770
so

1248
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:37,030
You know, I mean, that's that's how strong it's going to be

1249
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:43,740
So, how does it transition that is one hell of a you know punch to the head?

1250
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:44,100
You know what?

1251
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:44,340
I mean?

1252
01:55:44,960 --> 01:56:11,170
Yeah where you are now to everyone believing How wonderful it is and again you have to remember I'm gonna repeat myself many times again Everyone has access to this information and if enough people get handle on comprehending it They're gonna cry foul, but it doesn't state that they are It states that certain people will not go along with it and they'll be sought out and killed, right?

1253
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:27,530
But I'm telling you all these things are going to be in secret Even I would suggest that even the rise of the Antichrist will be difficult to identify him specifically even after the mouth The malformations that he suffers to be possessed by Satan, right?

1254
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:42,850
He loses the use of an arm and an eye Even then he will probably appear normal and if you were to suggest that maybe this guy had lost his eye and his arm and They'd be like holy shit.

1255
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:43,690
That's a secret.

1256
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:44,530
How did you know?

1257
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:55,310
you see Because remember he's an Antichrist the Christ his identity was completely secret Completely secret.

1258
01:56:55,610 --> 01:57:03,870
He you didn't know who he was unless he wanted you to know who he was and it was either momentarily or whatever You see what I mean?

1259
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:11,750
So what are the chances of this Antichrist also being secret in plain sight?

1260
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:17,990
I'd say like, you know a hundred to one, you know, what say you?

1261
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:34,410
Wow Where's the hint on that How many times do you have you heard those that claim to be of Judean and or not?

1262
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:52,930
or the synagogue of Satan We think that's referring to See his identity he is of us Syrian descent But is he going to be introduced as as young as Syrian or is he going to be introduced as a young Judean?

1263
01:57:53,730 --> 01:58:03,190
Think about it That's food for thought.

1264
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:08,410
I Mean it does say those so it's also plural.

1265
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:10,970
It's not just one person.

1266
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:13,810
Yeah He doesn't roll alone.

1267
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:15,750
He's got a crew You were eat.

1268
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:19,370
I don't know how deep he rolls, but we know he's got a false prophet or two, right?

1269
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:24,510
hmm a council Could it be possible?

1270
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:30,130
He's rolling with 12 or 13 Yes, it's very strong possibility, right?

1271
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:56,790
Now we can't take a scientific approach to scripture no, we can't do that no no no way You know scientific meaning, you know using good methodology Analyzing the information coming up with theories and conclusions that are according to the information.

1272
01:58:56,950 --> 01:59:01,070
We can't do that That's not allowed you see because it's just based on faith and that alone, right?

1273
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:20,570
you know, I'm being facetious but So, hmm, there you go Yeah, I May have to drop out just for sleep reasons Okay, I can do the same.

1274
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:23,550
It's about a Quarter to seven here.

1275
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:26,590
I'm having coffee and I'm I think I'm gonna make some ganache cake.

1276
01:59:26,870 --> 01:59:37,610
So While you're sleeping, I'll be making a delicious dessert Anything else No, I think I'm good boy.

1277
01:59:37,730 --> 01:59:46,030
That was uh, that's quite the amount of info And yeah, I know again, it's just one that's gonna be something to think over.

1278
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:46,690
Yeah.

1279
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:47,510
Hmm.

1280
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:48,590
Oh

1281
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:51,070
And this is just stuff I had I was just bouncing around in the head

1282
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:54,950
I said I should just do a stream to get it off out of the head and talk about it

1283
01:59:54,950 --> 01:59:57,710
I'm planning on formulating this I have some notes

1284
01:59:57,710 --> 02:00:03,090
I have a clipboard with about seven or eight pages of notes on what I've discussed today, which I haven't referred to at all

1285
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:05,690
But I just wanted to put it out

1286
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:12,830
Yeah, I want to I just wanted to put it out to see what kind of reaction this gets because I think

1287
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:17,910
Putting together, you know a more formula how Sam used to call in with questions.

1288
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:18,670
Remember that Sam?

1289
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:31,350
Whatever and bring up maybe a list of a dozen items and just going down them based on this track this type of traction You know like we had yeah, I think we're gay.

1290
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:32,290
We're not spinning wheels.

1291
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:33,650
We're not in the mud, right?

1292
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:40,870
Right now with this thought look at what's been shown look at what's discussed look at what's written What do we discard?

1293
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:42,170
Can it be harmonized?

1294
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:55,910
You know the three aspects Well, you know what people discuss how it's being shown in illustration and what's being referenced what can be harmonized how it should be harmonized Believe it or not.

1295
02:00:55,970 --> 02:01:00,790
Most of the notes have nothing to do with scripture only a few items I mentioned the gates of hell.

1296
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:06,610
I have a few things pinned in there from numbers in Genesis also, which I didn't bring up but

1297
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:12,650
Each because each one of those really deserves a two-hour discussion on its own

1298
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:17,250
But most of the stuff that I've written down has nothing to do with scripture from that set

1299
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,890
But it has to do with the human body health

1300
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:26,650
Financial stuff and other things which I think would be interesting to get into in detail show you how things work

1301
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:32,430
I'm gonna certainly leave that at your leave and it does sound like a wealth of information

1302
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:35,350
It is and believe it or not

1303
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:38,910
I'm being lazy because most of these things that I've jotted down here are

1304
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:43,050
things that I have brought up and asked her about in the past few months and

1305
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:46,670
in private conversations, so it's it's

1306
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:50,870
Nothing new, but I think it's new on this on this venue.

1307
02:01:51,210 --> 02:02:03,150
So Okay All right Yes, both you both you Sam and and yourself Okay, guys, take care.

1308
02:02:03,370 --> 02:02:07,890
Thanks you you also good night now Bye bang later
