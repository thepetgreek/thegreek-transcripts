1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,180
Acute generalism, right.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:15,000
So hold on, I'm going to put in another so I can get this to fit if you guys need another power supply.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,780
This headset, I'm about to go very mobile here.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,780
Get it to work.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,880
I'll try another one.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,360
You guys still there?

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,320
We're good.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:39,920
So, I wouldn't say, yeah, I wouldn't say that any of this stuff, you know the other thing with Fresco, you want to make the world a better place.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,100
Big no-no, that's like a capital don't.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,600
You can think it, but don't say it.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,420
Right.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,320
But at least he didn't suffer too badly from that.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,340
It was, you know, so, but it was obvious that his idea would not be successful.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,660
What a powerful event you put on last night there.

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,200
That was very tastefully done.

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,880
Oh, really?

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,380
Okay.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,480
With Ocelli?

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,500
You did pack a lot of information in that little bit of time and it was amazing that you got that much in there.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah, you packed a lot in there.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, good.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,400
Yeah.

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,460
Did you hear it, Sam?

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,860
Some made it very well.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I'll listen later.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,380
Yeah, the new motto is, why bother?

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,480
You know, Ocelli, I don't know.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,220
At the end it says, what's your closing comment?

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,920
Why bother?

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,040
Why bother?

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,640
Why bother?

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,120
If you're hungry, turn this off and get something to eat, you know?

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,740
Right.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,700
If you're tired, go to sleep.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,220
If you need, you know, go get some socks.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
The rest of it doesn't matter.

38
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,660
I mean, just pray for a quick and painless death.

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,340
I mean, once you're here, there's nothing else to really accomplish because you're going to die anyway.

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,020
Right.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,480
So...

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes, your cynicism is commendable.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:17,440
Yes, and it's a planet full of, you know, reprehensible morons and that's it, you know?

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,080
And the rest of it, you can write it or read it anyhow you want.

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,960
You can make an action drama out of it, you know, like we're shipwrecked, right?

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,280
Or, you know, your spaceship has crashed and you can't get off.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,500
Or you can make it a comedy, like Idiocracy, right?

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,120
Or you can make it like, what is it, Children of the City was that really dark city or something like that?

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,900
Dark European movies.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,680
Right.

51
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,240
You could take that twist on it.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,300
You could take Walt Disney's twist on it.

53
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,140
With, you know, Fantasia, whatever.

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,300
Or, you know, there's all these twists, but none of it matters.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,580
None of it is going to make any impact.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,640
You know what it really is?

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,400
It's who can and who will and who won't represent the intent of the gods.

58
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,760
Right?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,480
So...

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,640
So how have you been keeping yourself there, Greek?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,320
Oh, I'm just keeping to myself as usual.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,140
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,640
Just doing okay.

64
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:27,800
Yeah.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,940
Again, I mean, what can you do?

66
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,800
You're surrounded, right?

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,140
Right.

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,500
Well, it's like you brought up last night.

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,980
Who are you going to talk to?

70
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,280
You know, if you go back to the headhunters, you know.

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,900
Uh-huh.

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,660
Yeah.

74
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,020
Well, you can't talk with them.

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
You can talk at them.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,820
Right.

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,260
That's about it.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,300
And that could be challenging.

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,820
I mean, there's a lot of room for self-development with these kind of things.

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,660
You don't necessarily need to go looking for an audience or a compatriot in these endeavors.

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,160
Pursuing your own enlightenment is very edifying also.

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,460
Sure.

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,560
It's its own reward.

84
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,040
It always has been.

85
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,740
That's why you have secrets and secret groups and secret societies.

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,720
Right?

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,900
I mean, if something is so great, why don't you go tell everyone, right?

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,780
No.

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,460
When it gets really, really good, you stop telling people, you know.

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,660
It's like hidden treasure.

91
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
You find an old treasure map.

92
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,280
You're not going to go put the location on the public notice section of the newspaper.

93
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,230
True.

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,970
But the garbage, it doesn't matter.

95
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,930
The garbage everyone puts out on the street, right?

96
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,410
Right.

97
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:10,410
So, after a while, you start looking at what the desires and the actions don't match.

98
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,470
You know, people say what they want and what they would prefer, but their actions don't show that.

99
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,670
Their actions show that they want the worst crap, that they want stupidity.

100
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,890
They want, you know, through action.

101
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,550
Right?

102
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,650
Right.

103
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,700
Oh, well.

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
What with them?

105
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,980
Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,880
They're going to get it pretty good.

107
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,340
You'll see.

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,620
If you do.

109
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,440
I do remember the last time that I spoke with the topic.

110
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,080
The focus was less about scripture and more about examining certain sociological realities.

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,340
I think I put before the scenario to examine, and we talked about that a bit.

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,420
So, as much as scripture is always something to keep at the forefront of one's thoughts.

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:15,640
Lately, I found that contemplating certain social and political dimensions can also be interesting, and that requires some philosophical contention also.

114
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm finding that you can't really just pull verses out of scriptures to easily explain everything.

115
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:37,980
Certain efforts that have been made by philosophers, whether it's Socrates or whether it's somebody more recent like Piaget, even if they have an incorrect meta-narrative that differs from scripture, there are still inroads to certain insights that are useful there.

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,860
Let me just throw something in for the listener also, whoever's listening.

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,320
Most ancient writs are there not to give you the rote, but to give you the exception to the rote, to show you the anomalies.

118
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,920
Anyone can study, whether philosophically or scientifically, which is really the same.

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,900
Philosophy is just metaphysics, the stuff that's difficult to measure, but yet can be contemplated.

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,120
Like emotion, like love, and anger, how can you measure that?

121
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:18,260
But if you look at, for example, the plants, it's very easy to determine that the dandelion plant is ruled by the planet Mars.

122
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,280
Pretty simple.

123
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,940
If you understand the cycles of Mars, you'll see that it matches the cycles of the dandelion plant precisely.

124
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,140
So all of these things that seem out of the norm are not.

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,640
The scripture and the ancient writs are there to show you what is out of the norm.

126
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:53,770
So when you look at political events and all that, those things are roughly set to the gods.

127
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,410
To them it's set, but to us it's not.

128
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,070
Like you were asking earlier, what about North and South Korea, so what about it?

129
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,470
If you don't know the history, then it's a mystery, right?

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,690
I think there's some wind blowing in the background.

131
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,410
Yeah, there is.

132
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,450
I'm going to move out of this breezeway.

133
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,510
I'm outside.

134
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,250
The other thing is, if you know history is bullshit because it looks too neatly packaged.

135
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,090
They say, well, this country invaded this one, this one won, and then this happened, and that's all bullshit.

136
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:42,740
Whenever you see that really neatly black and white stuff, there are no winners or losers in this realm, I should say.

137
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,340
We're all losers.

138
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,540
Oh yeah, if you're here, you're a loser.

139
00:08:47,780 --> 00:09:01,800
I think I might have even said it on a sonic, in the future when others are born, either if you survive this or are resurrected, if there is any memory, there will be a gas that anyone had lived during this time, at anyone who had lived at this time, I should say.

140
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,760
That's very simple to rationalize.

141
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,660
Let me just put that in a little clearer perspective.

142
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:20,440
In the future, Satan will not be ruling man's society, and if you actually bring up that you had lived when Satan had ruled society, that would be the ghastly reaction.

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,400
You see?

144
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,400
Right?

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
That's in a nutshell, right?

146
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,740
Simple.

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,680
Except that he comes back later.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,820
But anyway.

149
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,300
But not in the same capacity.

150
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Well, he's given the same capacity, but the people do not become suzerain to him that way.

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,480
See, suzerain is just basically when you're controlled by someone else, but they give you enough that you think you're still free, right?

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,100
Like a colony that can pretty much do whatever they want, but they're still a colony.

153
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,820
Right.

154
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Look, everyone is suzerain to the bankers right now.

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
Which are not even bankers.

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,760
So anyway.

157
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,140
Philosophy and politics.

158
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah, so I mean, I hear an echo.

159
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,860
Yeah, Bruce, do you hear that?

160
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,040
I hear myself coming right back to me as clear and as loud as I'm speaking.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,580
I don't know.

162
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,700
It comes and goes.

163
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Yeah.

164
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,300
So based in connection with what I was saying before, I feel like we kind of have two roads that we can take for the stream topic-wise in general.

165
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:46,640
We can stick to the mostly biblical slash political and miscellaneous questions about the natural world, as we usually do.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
Or we can sort of go the route of analyzing some more thought experiments and philosophical musings.

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,120
I'll let the Greeks decide.

168
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,540
Okay.

169
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,000
Do both.

170
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,820
Because the gods don't view our natural world as being natural.

171
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,640
They view it as their art.

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,040
You know what I mean?

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,100
It's their creation.

174
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,020
Just like if you made a pot, you're a potter, or you're a carpenter and you made a chair.

175
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,260
You wouldn't view that as natural.

176
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,680
If you're a painter, you wouldn't view the painting as natural.

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,460
You know what I mean?

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,560
Do you get that sense of more than once removed from what's going on?

179
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:26,880
Yeah.

180
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,340
Yeah.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,000
It makes sense.

182
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,320
They don't view it, yeah, what we call phenomena.

183
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,660
Like one thing I said with Ocelli last night, he was talking about science.

184
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,040
I was trying to say, well, art and science, they're very different.

185
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:50,680
Meaning, the scientist relies on his methodology to be repeatable, and the artist relies on his methodology to not be repeatable.

186
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,920
You know how many Mona Lisas are out there, right?

187
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,720
How many Rembrandts, right?

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,060
You see?

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:06,040
I mean, of course, there's a copy that you see in the museum, but essentially, when you show someone the Mona Lisa, it's not a repeatable.

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,080
And if it is repeatable, it is just a copy of a single event.

191
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,100
If a scientist says, well, this is one event, you know, it's a phenomenon, it can't be repeated, it's not considered scientific, right?

192
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,700
It's considered art.

193
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,520
Or pseudoscience.

194
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,700
And we're told in scripture, yeah, and we're told in scripture that all things repeat, right?

195
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,460
So scripture is scientific in that way.

196
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,560
But it's artistic in the sense that it's not exactly the same every time.

197
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,060
And here's the other thing, you know, there's many other ancient rites to discuss, if one wants to go down that path.

198
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,580
The reason I focus on scripture is because it's first class information.

199
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,360
It's got the most detail regarding science, time, history, right?

200
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,540
Yeah, the only reason I focus on it is because I haven't read the others yet.

201
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,860
And I don't know if I will, given that the scripture is quite vast.

202
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,580
Yeah, you won't be impressed, to put it that way.

203
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,920
You read the Koran, you're like, okay, I'm going from Syria to Syria, and there's nothing coherent here.

204
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,940
Of course, because it was written by a guy who self-professed, no, it wasn't written.

205
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:25,940
It was about a guy who self-professed, illiterate, uneducated, and his thoughts were written 150 years after he died.

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,120
So, of course, there's no, you know what I mean, nothing coherent there.

207
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,540
But you will find that the people that did write the Koran were very well-versed in the scripture.

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,340
So, you know, the biblical scripture, the Mosaic scriptures, and prophets.

209
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,780
And the only people that were well-versed back in those days, in an adamant fashion, were rabbis.

210
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,060
So, just put together what I said, now you know who wrote the Koran.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,880
But, you know, the ones for hire, you know what I mean.

212
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,760
And they didn't survive.

213
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,180
Just like years ago, they said, go dig for this treasure, and we'll split it 50-50.

214
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,520
Once they dig it out, guess what happens to those guys.

215
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,740
Thank you for your service.

216
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,980
Thank you for your service, dead men don't talk.

217
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,900
Dead men don't need it.

218
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:43,540
I mean, this is, you know, but believe it or not, if you look at the descendants of the modern Islam, even in scripture there were people that were conned back then.

219
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,860
Think about it for a minute.

220
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,580
They've been conned from the beginning.

221
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,640
Think about it.

222
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,640
Do I need to cite that?

223
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,500
No.

224
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,100
Right?

225
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
Well, they've been conned by the gods.

226
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,260
Yeah, conned by the gods and other men.

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Tricked.

228
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,020
There's treachery against them and all this.

229
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,180
And they go with it.

230
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,700
So.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:28,940
And then, of course, when you talk about that part of the world, there is a very distinct part, you know, people call it the Middle East or Arabs and all that.

232
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,800
That's really limited.

233
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,620
Because the northern part of what we call the Middle East is very different from the southern part, which is like Saudi Arabia and all that.

234
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,840
And then the eastern part, which would be like Iran.

235
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,940
Right?

236
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,800
You know, like Iranians or Persians are not Arabic.

237
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,020
It's fighting words.

238
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,800
It's like calling an Austrian a German.

239
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,460
Or calling someone from Spain a Mexican.

240
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,640
They take offense to it.

241
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,920
Right?

242
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,240
It's funny.

243
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,560
Yeah, no, it's not.

244
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,380
This is the cult.

245
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:13,680
Like I was saying earlier, you put a Laotian, a Vietnamese, a Chinese, a Japanese and a Vietnamese in a room, guess who they're all going to be talking bad about?

246
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Koreans.

247
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,160
All of them.

248
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm not making this up.

249
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,300
Yeah, racism, bigotry, hate, all that stuff.

250
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,100
Yeah, it exists in the world, no matter how much they try to cover it up.

251
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,150
Well, let's go with some of the philosophical stuff.

252
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,270
I don't know how much we can do.

253
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,810
I think you'll probably make it so that it's both.

254
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,890
But I'll just focus on that because I think there's a lot to cover there.

255
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,550
So it's all very well to casually discuss how to perceive the condition of the world and our place in it.

256
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:02,110
But I found that most of the significant things have to be examined and addressed at the level of the details.

257
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,609
So you can't solely generalize or allegorize your way through an explanation or a solution.

258
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:14,650
Which is why I think some of our conversations see me bringing up certain questions over and over again in a rephrased manner.

259
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:21,730
And now I'm finally starting to create the thought experiment around them because it allows us to look at it a bit more meticulously.

260
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:35,190
But part of this sort of understanding or this mental exercise is to know that even though we know man society will crumble and placing stock in that is sort of worthless.

261
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,970
It doesn't mean that we shouldn't consider what the underlying axiomatic elements of human existence are.

262
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:50,670
Because I'm looking at that more and more and I'm like, oh, there are certain patterns in the spiritual that determine how things work on this side.

263
00:17:52,230 --> 00:18:00,490
And that's been done, I think, for quite some time anyway by sociologists and psychologists and mythologists like Carl Jung and Eric Neumann and so on.

264
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:11,270
So for the sake of examining something like that, at times I find that one has to suspend the conclusion of the meta-narrative of humanity as explained in scripture.

265
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,290
So as to not be unnecessarily myopic.

266
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,870
Because sometimes I'll say stuff and you'll be like, oh, that doesn't matter because everybody's going to die anyway or something like that.

267
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,650
It's like we know that, OK, but we can keep that in the back of our heads.

268
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,750
But I think the thrust of this discourse is to gain an understanding of certain things like social being.

269
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,530
You're right, but let's backtrack.

270
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,710
You said axiomatic.

271
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,470
What axiom?

272
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,890
That's supposed to be things that are stationary or self-evident or maxim.

273
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,730
Most people don't know anything about anything.

274
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,450
What they profess to think they know about it is false.

275
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,910
So you have to establish the axiom first, which is in the paradox realm or the unknown realm.

276
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,310
In other words, the obvious is still unknown, so we don't really even need philosophy at this point.

277
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,510
How obvious is it that people don't know how the body works?

278
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,470
That's pretty obvious they don't know, once you do find out.

279
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,110
How obvious is it that they don't know history?

280
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,070
How obvious is it that they don't know what gravity is?

281
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,630
How obvious is it that they don't know what words mean?

282
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:21,070
So in order to establish an axiomatic principle, which means that these are things that are self-evident, what I see as being self-evident is stupidity.

283
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,130
Okay.

284
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,710
Sure.

285
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,190
But let me just say about that, you pointed to specific fields.

286
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,550
So yes, within those fields, there's a lot of ignorance that makes it hard to have a discussion.

287
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,050
What I'm talking about is the observable social reality.

288
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,490
So you can see how friendships work, you can see how families work, you can see how society works.

289
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,890
That's why I keep putting Jack Fresco stuff up.

290
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,690
Have you watched any of it?

291
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,910
Do you want me to give you an analogy or repeat it?

292
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,630
I did watch the video.

293
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,870
It's about headhunters.

294
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,470
It's a culture.

295
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,330
If you go to a headhunter and ask him, are you upset?

296
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,810
Does it bother you that you have five shrunken heads?

297
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,610
And he says, yes, as a matter of fact, it does.

298
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,630
My brother has 20.

299
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,170
Is there anything wrong with him?

300
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,730
No.

301
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,290
That's the culture you grew up in.

302
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,170
Does it bother you that you're doing a birthday cake?

303
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,130
No, it doesn't bother me.

304
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,890
Does it bother you that you're part of this religion?

305
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,850
Of course not.

306
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,950
What are you talking about?

307
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,250
Does it bother you?

308
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,210
No, that's fine.

309
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,830
I get that.

310
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,650
That's your culture.

311
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,470
Let's go back to the biblical stuff.

312
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:46,850
Does the scripture need to get into detail about why Joshua and others had to go in and kill all of the Canaanites or Philistines or whatever at any point?

313
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,270
Most people that don't know, they're like, oh, what a horrible God.

314
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,870
It can't be the same God as the New Testament.

315
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,050
Because, by the way, the New Testament is not full of love and all this stuff either.

316
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,450
I don't know where they get that.

317
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,290
Do you stand with me on that, or do you want to bring up a point that the New Testament is about love and friendly and all this stuff?

318
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,730
It's not.

319
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,370
At all.

320
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,970
But they think it's a different God.

321
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,810
Going back to the Israelites being commanded to destroy those cultures.

322
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,570
By the way, some of those cultures were not destroyed by the Israelites.

323
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,870
They were destroyed by the angelic beings.

324
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:28,670
If you read in Judges, they're female prophetesses, they're singing, look at all these evil people that the angels killed.

325
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,070
Didn't you see the angels killed them?

326
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,950
Remember those scriptures?

327
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:40,910
Anyway, to a modern, you're going to have to say, oh, the modern is going to see that and say, oh, that's terrible, it's a different God.

328
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,650
It's a God of wrath and bad God, kill all the society.

329
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,890
They don't know.

330
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,750
They don't know what was going on.

331
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,340
You see what I mean?

332
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,340
Now I understand that, and there's nothing objectionable.

333
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Whether it's the flood or that, at any point, why do you take a car to the scrapyard to be compacted into a half a cubic meter brick of metal?

334
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,460
Because it's unrehabilitatable.

335
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,120
You can't fix it, you throw it away.

336
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,300
This was not a throwaway society, by the way.

337
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,980
If you can't fix it, in any society, it has to be discarded.

338
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,900
They were unfixable.

339
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
You see what I mean?

340
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,420
And it doesn't give the details directly, like, let's say I would, in a sonic, what those cultures were doing.

341
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,660
You see?

342
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,020
No, that's been talked about before.

343
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,060
That's all very fine.

344
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
It's understandable.

345
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:52,800
But back to the axiomatic element, I'm just talking about certain things being observable, and anybody can figure them out if you give them a little thought.

346
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,140
And they are there because they govern how society works, regardless of where you are on the planet.

347
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,520
Like a family relationship is still a family relationship, at a certain level, even if you, you know, abuse your children.

348
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,680
There are certain things that can be understood there.

349
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,940
That's there for strictly biological reasons.

350
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,700
If you read scripture, your real family is not your real family anyway.

351
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,480
Your spiritual family is not your biological, I should say.

352
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,140
No, I'm not talking about biological.

353
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:33,320
That's going to be, love, family, all that stuff is going to be redefined in the future, or defined in the future.

354
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Okay, so let's progress with some of these thought experiments things.

355
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,680
I thought we'd start with something along the lines of looking at social being and hierarchies.

356
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,700
I think it's observable that one of the most fundamental questions for human beings is how to act in the world.

357
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:03,020
That is to say, how to be oriented morally, psychologically, culturally, and socially, all of which sort of links back to the idea that your law comes from your God.

358
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,380
But if we put...

359
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,360
That's part of the operating system.

360
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,920
You really don't have any choice from that.

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,440
Right.

362
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:32,540
But if we were to zone in a bit on the social phenomena at play here and what the implications are, we see that human beings fundamentally view the world through a narrative lens, not a scientific one which claims that all life is just physical matter, or a religious or cultural one, since those have to be bred into you by the environment.

363
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,560
The first-person viewpoint is a narrative one because human beings,

364
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,860
regardless of how atheistic some of them may say that they are,

365
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,700
are observably trying to gain an understanding of their place in the world

366
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,540
and how to craft the ideal society, how to act in relation to other people,

367
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,580
how to pursue goals and what the ideal way is to maintain ourselves across time,

368
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,400
as far as livelihood, health, family, that sort of thing.

369
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:05,480
So it's not just about each person surviving today and doing what they want, but you have to survive and live comfortably tomorrow, next week, next year and the next 50 years.

370
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,120
And your descendants have to do the same and everyone else in society as well.

371
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,000
Otherwise you don't have anything that's tenable in the long term.

372
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,740
Well, hold on, I'll stop you right there.

373
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:24,320
You can plan all you want, but if the gods decide to strike you down the moment you go out to pick up the paper and think everything is normal, that will happen, so you have to understand that aspect as well.

374
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,600
Yes, that is so.

375
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Utter and complete rapid destruction can come upon a group, whether it's familial, community, national or worldwide in an instant, unbeknownst to them, with very short warning, direct warning.

376
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,180
In other words, they've been ignoring the long term warnings.

377
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:54,480
Yes, I should have prefaced by saying, if you put the gods aside just for a second, because we're looking at the social phenomenon, we're not looking at the metanarrative.

378
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
Hold on, let me go get a set of tweezers.

379
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,740
Mental, mental tweezing.

380
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,980
So I will preface everything I say from now on.

381
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,060
Mental tweezing, yes.

382
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:22,520
You know what I'm saying, it's like the old philosophical argument, the cafe setting, all the philosophers are in the corner wondering what the lady across the room is going to order, and I suggest we go ask her what she's going to order, and they all get upset because now they can't do their craft.

383
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Yes, that is understood.

384
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,940
This is not on what you're saying, this is just where it's gone.

385
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:51,920
I think that philosophy is much better spent in the metaphysical realm, discussing the things that there are no measurements for at the moment, and how they could be discussed, they could be rationalized in a simple way where anyone can access the information.

386
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,260
I think we are going, I think we are trying to do that, or at least I'm trying to do that.

387
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,420
Of course it gets hard if we keep diverting into what the gods said, No, no, no, the gods didn't say, the gods do.

388
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,360
You know, I mean, yeah, it's what they do.

389
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,660
The thing is, you know, fortunately the gods do what they say, unlike men, so.

390
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,920
But go ahead.

391
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:34,280
So the question of how to, and I'm not saying that we're doing this, some of this stuff is just theoretical, the question of how to create a societal system that allows for the stuff that I just mentioned, like, for you to be able to iterate, so to speak, over a period of time, that's a question of social being.

392
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,100
And, you know, I'm not ignoring scripture completely, I'd like to see how that question is answered based on what scripture says.

393
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,540
So I'm going to come back to that, I just have to set up this stuff, and then we'll get back to the scripture.

394
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,000
No, no, go ahead.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,840
But I'm guessing that if you want to be primary about it, then yes, you do have to look to the gods, because they run society.

396
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
By proxy.

397
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Yes, I want to see what the Most High has to say about social being, because that's still something.

398
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,980
Maybe you'll get a chance to ask one of his angels later.

399
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,500
Sure.

400
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,060
I don't mean later tonight, but, you know, whatever.

401
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,820
So, to touch on the subject of...

402
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,780
By the way, let me just interject one more thing.

403
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:30,640
Of all the mischief, madness, and mayhem and evil you see in the world, later on it will be discovered that this was the most efficient way to accomplish the progression of the species, for lack of a better term.

404
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:47,600
So, in other words, we're probably amongst yourself or others, anyone having this type of conversation, or this subject matter, is going to want to strike through the reality of all the inefficiencies that we've been experiencing.

405
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,860
And I'm telling you, those inefficiencies are there for a reason, and I've discussed them before.

406
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,200
Which one of them is time?

407
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:10,060
How do you keep a society pretty much in a quiet enough state for them to hang around for 6,000 plus years, without being too knowledgeable, and also without being too unknowledgeable, where they make fatal mistakes all the time.

408
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,420
Basically, all they need to do is know how to rub two sticks together and make fire, know how to rub their genitalia together to make more babies.

409
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:33,580
Other than those two things, fire and making babies, that's basically the critical knowledge that a society needs to retain to maintain itself in a state of stupor for 6,000 years for curing.

410
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,120
You know what I mean?

411
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,420
Did that ruin their philosophy?

412
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,260
No, I'm just joking.

413
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Rubbing genitalia and making fire.

414
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,860
I'll let you do that.

415
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,840
Think about it.

416
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,320
I've thought about this stuff before.

417
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,080
If you lose the ability to make fire, and lose the ability to rub your genitals, you have to start all over.

418
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,540
That's all, folks.

419
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,020
Right, because there's no fire.

420
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,600
Think about it.

421
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,760
No fire, forget it.

422
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,460
You won't even have agriculture without fire.

423
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,720
Why?

424
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,160
How are you going to do agriculture without fire?

425
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,380
I don't know.

426
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,260
Your implements.

427
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,860
You're going to cut wood with wood?

428
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,300
That doesn't work.

429
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,400
You need bronze, copper, metal.

430
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:34,200
Even the obsidian blades you get from volcanic glass to make knives and flint stones and all that stuff.

431
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,760
Guess how that was formed.

432
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,980
Anyway, go ahead.

433
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,760
Okay, so hierarchies.

434
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,780
We talked about that, I think, a bit before, but maybe this time I can finesse the topic a little bit more.

435
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,380
And this is kind of where I hope to get away from the allegories and more hands-on with observable reality.

436
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:06,440
So the last time we spoke, I offered up a sociological thought experiment about contrasting dominance hierarchies against competent structures and seeing which one is a bit more viable in the leadership model.

437
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:28,360
I postulated that most forms of power comes in two forms, the vertically imposed, the dominance hierarchy, which leverages the hard power of violence and money to enforce obedience, and then the laterally shared, which is sort of like a competence arrangement which strives for equilibrium among its members through voluntary agreements and meritocracy and can be iterated across time.

438
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:42,500
But I thought about things a little bit more and I admit that I might not fully understand the exact dynamics of the lateral stuff, and we talked about that as far as how things work in the world of the Elohim with the horizontal structures.

439
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:54,140
There might not be such a thing strictly, as I've said, because even in democracies, you eventually end up with a leader or whoever is the most charismatic or whatever.

440
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,680
So I'm just sort of entertaining that.

441
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,500
I'm going to interrupt you for a moment.

442
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,580
Put all the social-political subdivisions aside and consider how it would be done in what's called an anarchy.

443
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,740
Anarchy is castle doctrine.

444
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,040
Every man is the king of his castle.

445
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:24,920
Anarchy now has been, because of the modern Marxist and Engel movements of political templates, when you say anarchy, it's a bad thing.

446
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,640
Anarchy just means you don't have a king.

447
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,540
You don't have a president.

448
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,180
You don't have a centralized figure.

449
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,860
It's decentralized.

450
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,480
You see, for example, during the judges period in Scripture, that was an anarchy.

451
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,480
You didn't bother the judges.

452
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,060
You didn't look to the judges for what to do unless you were at war or you had a problem.

453
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,660
So how would an anarchy station all of those aspects of society?

454
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,960
See, that's something that the modern culture of headhunters can't contemplate.

455
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,160
It's too scary to give people the responsibility that they have to do the right thing.

456
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,760
If you don't do the right thing in anarchy, you will fall into chaos within a matter of days.

457
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,980
You know, like in anarchistic society, there's very little crime.

458
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,140
There's nothing to get away with.

459
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
What are you going to get away from yourself?

460
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,080
In every other type of society, it's what can I get away with?

461
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:33,420
And also to throw another thing in, is whenever you have a government that promotes people's involvement through secrecy, you're going to end up with a government that has nothing but secrecy working against you.

462
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,220
Like if you've ever studied history on King's Court, it's actually been dramatized in some film.

463
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:53,140
When a vote was going to be made, you told the people, you know, they would say this one and the people would shout or that one and the people would shout and the louder shout would be the vote.

464
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:04,180
Or they would say everyone on the left for this, everyone on the right for that and the crowd kind of intermixing and getting their positions so that you can see where the crowd is larger.

465
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,900
That was not done in secret.

466
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,620
That's not the type of voting that's being done now in secret.

467
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:21,120
So when they tell you you have a right to a secret, well then if the government gains its popularity through secrecy, well it's going to be operating in secret itself against you.

468
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,440
How many government secrets were there in scripture?

469
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,850
None.

470
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,940
How many government secrets in an anarchistic society?

471
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,600
None.

472
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,760
Some of the benevolent monarchies, how many secrets do they have?

473
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,679
None.

474
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,719
You get it?

475
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,940
So right now we're looking at the big picture.

476
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
Hopefully this is not diverting you, right?

477
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,179
No.

478
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,480
So there's your axiom.

479
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,840
Or what axiom?

480
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,580
Or what axiom?

481
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:14,880
In other words, once you start changing a detail like that, the entire landscape becomes so different it's like the rainforest versus the North or South Pole.

482
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,140
Very radical difference in the landscape now.

483
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:40,580
So in other words, again let's go back, if you had the overt open society where everyone was responsible and there were no secrets, very different distribution of power and consideration of how power is going to be distributed versus one that is in secrecy with secret societies and intelligence agencies and secret this and secret that.

484
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,480
Very different distribution of power.

485
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:52,740
One is done through treachery, lies and deceit and the other one is done very slowly and carefully and overtly and benevolently.

486
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Because you cannot, in an anarchism and benevolence within the society it won't last.

487
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,820
And when I say it won't last, I mean it won't last physically.

488
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,520
People will die and everything will be destroyed very quickly.

489
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:24,340
But the other one where you have secrets and deceit, secret societies, intelligence this and credit based economy, everything you have today, it can operate in the most maximum debauchery.

490
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,120
It can kick off and still keep going, you see.

491
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,680
There's no limit to how evil the society that is run like the societies you see on the planet today can be.

492
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,920
There's no limit to their evil.

493
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,420
Oh wait, now we're sounding like scripture again.

494
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,820
No, I was not trying to analyze the political system per se like democracy versus this or that.

495
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
Would you say that anarchy is lateral?

496
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,020
Yes, it has to be.

497
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:15,080
It has to be because you're not secretly casting a vote or empowering by limited decision for another to be a ruler.

498
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,540
Are you familiar with castle doctrine?

499
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,120
The owner, let's say, or the proprietor of a property.

500
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,880
Castle doctrine, a simple way to do it would be like the captain on a ship.

501
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,820
You know, he can marry people, he can have someone executed, right?

502
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,420
He's pretty much a sovereign within his range.

503
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,940
And he's only a sovereign not because he says so, it's because everyone around him says so.

504
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,610
You get it?

505
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,430
A king can claim he's a king all he wants.

506
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,310
He'll get his ass kicked in the next five minutes.

507
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:05,510
A king, socially, is if everyone around him acknowledges as such and is familiar with how royalty is treated.

508
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
Otherwise it doesn't matter.

509
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,230
Let's say you had King Edward go down to the headhunters.

510
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,930
They'd skin his ass just as fast as anybody else, wouldn't they?

511
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,510
It wouldn't matter.

512
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,590
A king could be skinned and his head shrunk just as fast.

513
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,430
They don't care.

514
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,120
Yes, it's interesting.

515
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:37,520
But, there is something to be said for the vertical hierarchy.

516
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,780
It does seem that this template of authority is the way of dealing with social being.

517
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,360
I mean, we see it in man society

518
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,540
at the level of the family

519
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,760
with the father at the top

520
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
directing his wife and children

521
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,840
generally or historically,

522
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,640
at the level of the corporate

523
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,300
with the CEO standing in contrast

524
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,360
to the fast food worker,

525
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,940
and at the level of the army

526
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,160
with the rigid chain of command

527
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,280
and so on, and even in broader

528
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,160
society with leaders at the top

529
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,960
and the masses at the bottom,

530
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,300
even though what you just outlined

531
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,340
is a bit different, obviously.

532
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,460
But we also see it in the animal kingdom from chimps to birds with one set of alpha males at the top and a decreasing progression of power from there.

533
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:29,220
So, there seems to be something about that hierarchy that is a primary aspect of humanity, social being, and it plays out when the top is there for a season.

534
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,180
Like the monkey or the ape or the dog or whatever that's up top is only when they're in their prime.

535
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,820
That's why, for example, they have term limits, right?

536
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,740
Yes.

537
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:52,100
So, they're only alpha animals when they're in their prime and then it's pretty obvious they either concede their position to another or they're taken out very quickly.

538
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,840
Yes, but to be replaced with the exact same structure.

539
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,640
Right, it doesn't have longevity though.

540
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,600
It doesn't have longevity with the individual, but the position is there.

541
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,880
The position is something that you can't un-graft, take out of the social order.

542
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:17,360
Right, and I mean, I think, like you see it in other configurations also, when you walk into a classroom, the chairs are set up to face the front.

543
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,880
You aren't expected to move them.

544
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,940
There's one teacher at the front of the class who faces the opposite direction so that everybody's looking at him.

545
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,400
There's no mutual expectations.

546
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,600
So, all things equal, no one goes into a classroom and starts moving chairs around because they want to face the window.

547
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:41,280
Those are things that are part of most people's procedural knowledge and they become a part of our expectations of society.

548
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:53,920
Yes, but that's industrial, institutional enterprise education, which is way down the line, hundreds of years if not a few decades down the line after you have the secret element put in.

549
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,900
Hospitals, prisons, and schools are all the same?

550
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes.

551
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,240
So, there you go.

552
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,780
But we're talking about a social order that is separate of industrialization or not.

553
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,340
I mean, even if you're talking to yourself.

554
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,160
But it can't.

555
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,580
It can't.

556
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,460
The modern day, the way of the modern, everything is enterprise and industry now.

557
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,500
Masses.

558
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,700
No, but come on, if you're talking to a crowd, they're all going to face you if you're going to have a public meeting.

559
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,480
Oh, I see what you're saying.

560
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm talking about the archetypical order.

561
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm not talking about how So, you're just saying in a setting where one communicates to a group.

562
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,180
Yes.

563
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:50,300
There's a hierarchy that's established as far as where the focal point is and everybody that's under that that has to turn to that to listen because those are the mutual expectations.

564
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,180
Right.

565
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:58,680
And while they're listening, they're wondering when they're going to shut up so they could get up and tell everybody what they want anyway.

566
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,420
You know, be that as it may.

567
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,700
The order is still the order.

568
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,880
So, people don't act erratically or unpredictably because we share a map of cultural expectations that are built into our perception.

569
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,140
Unless you put enough fluoride and chlorine in the water, then they'll act predictably.

570
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,820
Even with that.

571
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:26,900
Anyway, so, what I want to know is this idea of the Elohim where vertical hierarchies are evidently being implemented in their social organization anyway.

572
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:45,180
You've expanded a bit on the existence of the horizontal structures but my response to that I think before was that we need to make a distinction where the vertical hierarchies end and the horizontal ones begin because the lowest grunt in the kingdom of the Elohim isn't looking at the most high as being laterally distant but rather vertically reachable.

573
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,100
This is maybe…

574
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:09,220
If you look at how hierarchies function in practicality not in theory what you find is that at the top of the hierarchy is something that essentially no longer is a part of the hierarchy perhaps not literally but practically, yes.

575
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,160
You see this with renditions of the all-seeing eye on top of the pyramid.

576
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,560
At the top of the pyramid is something that is not ontologically part of the structure.

577
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:40,960
You also see it with monolithic governments and corporations where the grunts at the bottom for the most part they follow the rules but the higher up you go the more constraints and oversight lessens until you get to the top where the CEO doesn't pay any taxes embezzles all the funds pays himself huge bonuses sleeps with the secretaries and does insider trading.

578
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:55,840
So as a consequence of the dimensions doesn't that appear to be where the lateral aspect kicks in hypothetically?

579
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:08,540
Well, there's many things you brought up there like for example the all-seeing eye you've heard of the seven eyes it's a creature that he sends out I'm not looking for that I can't find it.

580
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,300
Or the eyes that he has

581
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
on the world

582
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
those are creatures

583
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:20,600
I sent them a month ago

584
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,480
I set them aside

585
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,320
they're easy to get

586
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,880
and that is a being in itself

587
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,560
that representation of the eye

588
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,400
on top of the pyramid

589
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,640
is a being within man's society

590
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,020
yeah, so of course

591
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,960
we'd be on top

592
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,880
and not paying any taxes

593
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,660
is totally fine

594
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,080
I'll give you a quick example

595
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,720
there's somebody

596
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,960
I don't and I don't intend

597
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,160
on paying taxes ever

598
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:50,840
because I'm not qualified

599
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,940
I'll tell you why

600
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,360
recently I saw some correspondence

601
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,180
with someone who has been doing

602
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,500
the Title 12 Section 411

603
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,240
demand for lawful money

604
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,060
and he was just wondering

605
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,200
if he was just going under the radar

606
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,960
or they were just leaving him alone

607
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,260
so he calls up the IRS

608
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,100
and he says

609
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,880
I'd like to schedule an audit

610
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,600
and they're like why

611
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,200
and I'm like well

612
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,100
I've been doing all my finances

613
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,000
and I need an additional endorsement

614
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,600
with Title 12 Section 411

615
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,760
demand for lawful money

616
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,960
the IRS says no

617
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,240
we're not going to audit you

618
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,220
no we're not

619
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,420
you get it

620
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,860
you know how people are threatened

621
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,320
with IRS audits all the time

622
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,420
oh my god they're going to use it

623
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:36,920
so what

624
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,940
if you're endorsing private credit

625
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,040
you're subject to it right

626
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,020
in other words

627
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,540
if you have blood all over the floor

628
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,100
contacting the IRS

629
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,680
and saying I want to be audited

630
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,600
by you guys

631
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,480
and they're like no

632
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,840
we don't want to audit you

633
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,940
do you see what I mean about taxes

634
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,940
where's your axiom there

635
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,200
I mean that's a psych thing

636
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,880
no it's not

637
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,860
and also by the way

638
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,020
this works in every country

639
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,020
I think I've discussed this before

640
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,660
reciprocity

641
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,080
all of your building codes

642
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,920
are reciprocated

643
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,680
by a worldwide governing body

644
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,800
so years ago each country

645
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,880
had its own building codes

646
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,760
now they've made it more

647
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,720
quote unquote universal

648
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,160
if you find a law

649
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,020
let's say you're in Scotland

650
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,020
or England or Spain

651
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,040
and you want to use an American law

652
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,460
well you could actually push

653
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,140
the issue of reciprocity

654
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,900
because an American passport

655
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,940
or an American license

656
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,780
or something like that

657
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,660
works well in Spain

658
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,340
anyway these things

659
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,780
they sound philosophical

660
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,160
I hope they're in line

661
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,440
with what we're talking about

662
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,740
no they're not

663
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,600
because we're talking about

664
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,280
the idea that you have

665
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,260
a vertical hierarchy

666
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,420
and at the top of the hierarchy

667
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,080
things start to become different

668
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,400
the closer you get to the top

669
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,660
because that's where all the power is

670
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,840
and people start to move along

671
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,640
different dimensions

672
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,620
so that's why the CEO

673
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,200
I was doing frequent talks

674
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,960
with Japanese engineers

675
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,320
in Malaysia and in Japan

676
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,700
I'm not going to mention

677
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,000
companies like Panasonic

678
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,240
Mitsubishi right

679
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,860
but what people don't understand

680
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,960
about the hierarchy there

681
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,200
I was realizing why some of the

682
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,680
real novel things we were bringing

683
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,660
to them were being refused

684
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,060
and we bypassed the engineers

685
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,020
and went to the CEO

686
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,080
but the CEO was totally afraid

687
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,160
of making any improvements

688
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,540
and we didn't understand that

689
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,380
because we always thought

690
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,480
well if you get to the CEO

691
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,860
that's the final word

692
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,860
executive decision

693
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,340
all you've got to do

694
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,720
is get that man to decide

695
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,540
and you've got it made

696
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,900
the company will do it

697
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,600
wrong

698
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,340
but people don't understand

699
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,020
in Japan

700
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,240
even though they have a CEO

701
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,120
the engineers have the power

702
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,700
of firing the CEO

703
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,320
if the engineers agree to it

704
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,160
that just renders them useless

705
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,260
and then why do you need

706
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,040
all these engineers

707
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,980
just to repeat myself

708
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,220
we thought bypassing them

709
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,400
going to the CEO would be better

710
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,440
he was even more closed

711
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
and more frightened of it

712
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,860
because we found out

713
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,620
well don't you think

714
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,700
that Steve Jobs could have

715
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,620
been fired again

716
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,320
I think he was

717
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,200
or he left the first time

718
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,100
he was fired

719
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,160
yeah but I think the key

720
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,400
word that you used there

721
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,140
was in Japan

722
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,920
you're talking about

723
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,720
a particular model

724
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,240
that existed a few decades ago

725
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,580
this is an exception

726
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,200
to the rule

727
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,860
generally

728
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,380
the model is what they

729
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,460
call 2008, 2009, 2010

730
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,080
I just gave it

731
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,680
it's still current

732
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,180
it may not be current now

733
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,960
but it's still

734
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,960
no I didn't say that

735
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,260
I said the companies

736
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,920
I won't mention

737
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,120
like Sony and Mitsubishi

738
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,720
Panasonic, Matsushita

739
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,960
there's a cultural element

740
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,420
in Japan

741
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,620
of certain formality

742
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,300
and rigidity

743
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,640
that we all know about

744
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,600
that makes things

745
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,660
almost claustrophobic socially

746
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,880
so we can't look at

747
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,300
the scale large enough

748
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,780
since when is taking

749
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,260
advantage of really stupid

750
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,120
people corrupt

751
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,160
look man

752
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,540
just using the dictionary

753
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,100
definition it's not a moral

754
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,260
judgment I don't care

755
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,220
but the point is

756
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,660
once you get to a certain

757
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,800
point people start to move

758
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,240
differently

759
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,580
so in the kingdom of the

760
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,020
Elohim

761
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,160
the God who's in charge

762
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,560
if I looked at the scale

763
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,780
it might not be like that

764
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,560
then I can see this sort of

765
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,340
what you're talking about

766
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,600
horizontal thing coming into

767
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:27,900
play

768
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,960
there's so many levels there

769
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,340
that it matches almost

770
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,340
the human society

771
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,080
would it sound believable

772
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,800
maybe it won't

773
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,460
that if I told you

774
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,420
if you met the God

775
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,500
that's in charge of grass

776
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:52,580
that you're completely

777
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,480
dumb to you

778
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,120
you wouldn't even notice

779
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,000
that there was any depth

780
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,580
or height or width

781
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,700
to the intelligence of this

782
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,660
creature it would be that

783
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,160
base

784
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,020
would you believe it

785
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,840
if I stated that almost

786
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,020
in a factual way

787
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,240
that the ones that are

788
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,700
more anthropomorphic in

789
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,820
nature from an intellectual

790
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,320
position are much much

791
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,400
more likely to recognize

792
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,100
a creature

793
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,300
like the God of the grass

794
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,240
because we're stuck in our

795
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,520
culture and our perception

796
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,880
that it has to have legs

797
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,360
and eyes and mouth

798
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,300
you could read about

799
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,740
biology in the 1930s

800
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,920
they went into some

801
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,940
caverns and they found

802
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,200
salamanders that had no

803
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,720
mouths and they were like

804
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,640
well how do they eat

805
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,920
well first they did all

806
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,000
these reports and no one

807
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,840
believed them right

808
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,760
that's the part I wanted

809
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,440
to bring up

810
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,160
when all these things

811
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,840
these creatures were

812
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,800
documented no one

813
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,580
believed them they had

814
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,620
to physically bring one

815
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,380
in for them to believe

816
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,360
that these things

817
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,320
existed because

818
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,500
can you imagine a creature

819
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,320
on this planet that

820
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,560
doesn't eat or has a mouth

821
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,460
right

822
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,040
no I mean you could

823
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,680
but if someone came

824
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,560
to you saying that this

825
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,880
is actual true in fact

826
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,140
that it exists you would

827
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,120
shake your head and say

828
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,060
no there has to be a

829
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,760
mistake somewhere

830
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,780
so that this is part of

831
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,420
the order right now

832
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,640
if you for people to

833
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,960
understand a lateral

834
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,760
kingdom of hierarchy

835
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,080
it's they're shaking

836
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,600
their head

837
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:32,920
no way

838
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:34,940
can't be

839
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,780
well well that's why

840
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,820
we're talking about it

841
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,840
you know I'm not asking

842
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,660
some scientist that

843
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,180
doesn't know shit

844
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,360
but okay so let's

845
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,400
look a little bit closer

846
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,160
at what lateral systems

847
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,700
are because I feel

848
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,760
like it is an oxymoron

849
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,820
almost to say lateral

850
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,560
hierarchy because

851
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,620
hierarchy seemed vertical

852
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,680
by design at least

853
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,160
intuitively

854
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,100
higher higher higher

855
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,220
means altar in Greece

856
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,000
a Greek word that means

857
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,920
altar or the central

858
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,680
part of a temple

859
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,140
hierarchy hierarchy

860
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,360
literally means

861
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,880
the altar of the

862
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,520
ancients or the

863
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,860
altar of the high

864
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,300
you know the

865
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,600
archos the head

866
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,700
yes like hero

867
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,520
hero means

868
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,080
hero means altar

869
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,460
that's why it's very

870
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,300
easy to use that word

871
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,160
altar in a metaphor

872
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:24,780
like you know if you

873
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,560
don't worship at their

874
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,280
altar they don't want

875
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,220
to speak to you right

876
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,180
academics

877
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,200
these are all religious

878
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,360
terms isn't that funny

879
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,060
anyway or

880
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,760
let's just say regarding

881
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,300
the gods

882
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,140
well first of all

883
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,700
hierarchies are of

884
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,680
course important because

885
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,860
they seem to exist at

886
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,400
the most fundamental

887
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,660
levels of perception

888
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,080
that is to say in the

889
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,160
realm of values

890
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,280
value systems manage

891
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,300
manage your perceptions

892
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,260
and your actions and

893
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,180
you can't look at

894
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,820
anything without a

895
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,860
hierarchy hold on

896
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,720
hold on value system

897
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,080
is based on two things

898
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,140
one is because you're

899
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,200
told it has value

900
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,720
or the other one is

901
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,820
because it's actual by

902
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,420
necessity

903
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,720
right if you have a

904
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:05,900
right

905
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,000
no two different things

906
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,180
like if you're told

907
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,180
something has value

908
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,200
which is I don't have to

909
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,300
give examples of that

910
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,360
you could look at this

911
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,320
society and look at how

912
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,180
worthless pretty much

913
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,260
everything is and they

914
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,300
think that certain things

915
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,860
have value

916
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,860
and yes it is used as

917
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,620
currency within their

918
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,680
society so if you're with

919
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,500
these morons yes

920
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,860
you're going to have to

921
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,040
operate as if it does

922
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,460
also

923
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,240
but then there's true

924
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,620
value like if you have

925
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,360
if you're starving

926
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,760
and you need bread

927
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,060
that bread has more

928
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,300
value than to a

929
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:33,400
baker

930
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,060
someone who has a

931
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:35,420
bakery

932
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,140
someone has a bakery

933
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:38,900
could say well this

934
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,740
bread here has got

935
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,180
finger

936
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,640
someone poked their

937
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,480
finger in all these

938
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,300
loaves let's just throw

939
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,800
them away

940
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,820
you know they don't

941
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,600
look good

942
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,900
very little value

943
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,460
right

944
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,020
and that's the

945
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,280
necessity side

946
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,420
and and like for

947
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,200
example gold and

948
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,360
silver was understood

949
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,060
to be the best

950
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,900
stuff from the land

951
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,680
and that did have

952
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,480
value wherever you

953
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,760
went

954
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,800
but now what they

955
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,420
consider to have

956
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,540
value has no value

957
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,260
even it's self

958
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:05,960
professed by the

959
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,860
authorities themselves

960
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,620
it's based on your

961
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,020
faith

962
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,120
you know they say

963
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,060
it's your full faith

964
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,800
and credit in the

965
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,560
economy meaning

966
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,160
they're telling you

967
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,460
it's whatever we

968
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,260
convince you of

969
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,900
because you know

970
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,660
people are incapable

971
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,780
of coming up with

972
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,220
rational decisions

973
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,820
on their own

974
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,500
that's why they have

975
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,120
to send them to

976
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,440
school

977
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,530
but anyway

978
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,090
no but I mean the

979
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,010
definition of value

980
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:28,850
doesn't change even

981
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,670
across those things

982
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,710
value is just simply

983
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:31,210
that which you

984
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:31,810
prioritize

985
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,710
the extent to which

986
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,670
you prioritize something

987
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,530
determines value

988
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,930
well hold on

989
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,990
prioritize on two

990
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,370
things

991
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:37,850
you have the

992
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,950
necessitative priority

993
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:39,770
which is my stomach

994
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,650
is growling and I

995
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:41,190
think I'm going to

996
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,010
die if I don't eat

997
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:42,670
in the next week

998
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,410
like I haven't eaten

999
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,710
in a week or two

1000
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,070
already

1001
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,310
that's why that bread

1002
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,290
is very valuable to

1003
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,090
me or the priority

1004
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:49,910
could be well I'm

1005
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:50,750
told that this green

1006
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,810
paper has a lot of

1007
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:52,530
value and actually

1008
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,250
if you do that you're

1009
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,090
going to be penalized

1010
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,870
on the other side

1011
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,610
right by the

1012
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,570
taxation authorities

1013
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,190
and all this other

1014
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,550
stuff

1015
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,330
sure sure

1016
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:00,930
but I mean the

1017
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,250
definition of priority

1018
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,070
doesn't change even

1019
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:03,810
across those two

1020
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,070
things

1021
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,090
but it does change

1022
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,590
because one is taught

1023
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,130
and one is

1024
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,830
necessitative

1025
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,390
if you're really

1026
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,410
starving the bread

1027
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,230
has a lot of value

1028
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,150
but give you another

1029
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:13,830
example on the other

1030
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,570
side with the green

1031
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,610
paper doesn't have any

1032
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,510
value as a matter of

1033
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,250
fact if there's a

1034
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,070
small bank

1035
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,450
any bank in the

1036
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,170
world right now

1037
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,570
if you go to a

1038
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,470
small bank and make

1039
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,670
a very large cash

1040
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,190
deposit

1041
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,610
and someone else

1042
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,370
does the same

1043
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,390
that bank will close

1044
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,250
down because that

1045
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,230
cash represents a

1046
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,250
liability to them

1047
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,900
where if it really

1048
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,860
did have value like

1049
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,600
gold or silver

1050
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,320
if you went to a

1051
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,300
bank a small bank

1052
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,100
and people started

1053
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,180
depositing a lot of

1054
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,020
gold and silver in

1055
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:41,680
that bank why would

1056
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,440
it close down it's

1057
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,280
actually the bank would

1058
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,060
grow wouldn't it

1059
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,020
you see

1060
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,260
there's an article

1061
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:50,620
I don't know if

1062
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,180
someone wants to

1063
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,400
find it

1064
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,880
there's a bank in

1065
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,380
Colorado

1066
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,940
the story goes

1067
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,060
thus this is in the

1068
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,740
late 90s

1069
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,460
you know all these

1070
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:56,960
evangelists

1071
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,980
so they collect all

1072
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,600
this money from

1073
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,220
people right

1074
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,060
it turns out

1075
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,700
this one guy

1076
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,740
one of the evangelist's

1077
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,920
son got into money

1078
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,420
he was in accounting

1079
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,020
and all that

1080
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,480
he was also an

1081
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,220
attorney and he

1082
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,000
started going into

1083
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,420
the basement of

1084
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,280
these little churches

1085
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,780
that are out through

1086
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,220
Florida

1087
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,240
northern Florida

1088
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:13,980
which is really the

1089
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,780
deep south right

1090
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,220
and he noticed they

1091
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,100
had all these plastic

1092
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,180
tables open you know

1093
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,100
like picnic temporary

1094
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,320
tables with federal

1095
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,200
reserve notes cash

1096
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,060
money stacked up

1097
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,360
piles high everywhere

1098
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,900
you know and he was

1099
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,040
like oh wow this

1100
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,720
is great because I

1101
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,580
know a guy in

1102
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,040
Colorado who

1103
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,020
has a bank he just

1104
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,740
started and he could

1105
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,700
probably use all this

1106
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,880
cash so they got a

1107
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,780
bunch of armored cars

1108
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,400
and they went around

1109
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,300
to half a dozen of

1110
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,040
these churches that

1111
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,540
they knew that they

1112
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,380
were stockpiling all

1113
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,440
this cash and they

1114
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,080
shipped it up to

1115
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,100
Colorado and these

1116
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:41,940
are both young guys

1117
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,060
and next week that

1118
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,860
Colorado bank was

1119
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,880
shut down by the

1120
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,620
federal reserve and

1121
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,180
the FDIC because it

1122
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,980
had so much cash

1123
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,660
deposited it

1124
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,300
represented a

1125
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:49,780
liability

1126
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,980
I know it sounds

1127
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,820
crazy right

1128
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,420
to whom though

1129
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,720
right to the I mean

1130
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,600
if you printed this as

1131
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,660
an article and to the

1132
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,360
public they wouldn't

1133
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,240
understand anything I

1134
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,460
just said I mean they

1135
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,000
would understand

1136
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,960
everything I said but

1137
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,600
they would not

1138
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,080
comprehend why the

1139
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,960
bank closed down

1140
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,520
ultimately

1141
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,560
it was a

1142
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,460
liability to whom

1143
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,120
the Fed

1144
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,220
to the bank

1145
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,980
of itself

1146
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,120
the bank itself

1147
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,400
yeah

1148
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,220
that's why well

1149
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,000
because yeah

1150
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,680
the you know

1151
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,840
think about it

1152
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,720
how many canceled

1153
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,500
checks on closed

1154
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,420
accounts that you

1155
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,040
are expected to

1156
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,000
distribute can you

1157
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,720
do before you're

1158
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,220
shut down

1159
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,060
cash money is a

1160
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,920
canceled check on a

1161
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,880
closed account it's

1162
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,980
it's illegal as hell

1163
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,980
just start searching

1164
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,940
canceled checks on

1165
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,740
closed accounts can

1166
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,400
they be used in

1167
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,040
commerce big fat

1168
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,400
no

1169
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,000
right

1170
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,500
that's like going to

1171
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,120
the pharmacist

1172
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,880
thinking you got any

1173
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,780
heroin for me

1174
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,480
sure

1175
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,560
right

1176
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,920
what's wrong with the

1177
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,940
coca-cola doesn't have

1178
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,480
cocaine in it anymore

1179
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,580
it's not can't be

1180
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,100
any good

1181
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,060
so

1182
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,220
well the value

1183
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,780
thing still remains

1184
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,600
what it is in the

1185
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,680
sense that you can't

1186
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,380
look at anything

1187
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,480
without a hierarchy

1188
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,080
of value

1189
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,660
because there's a

1190
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,320
million things that

1191
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,980
you could consider

1192
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,060
at any one

1193
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,760
given time or

1194
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,640
place right the

1195
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,400
reason why people

1196
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,440
forget trivialities

1197
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,160
like the color of

1198
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,200
the walls and the

1199
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,080
doctor's waiting room

1200
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,300
is because who

1201
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,640
cares some things

1202
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,400
have no perceptible

1203
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,540
emotional or

1204
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:30,940
intellectual

1205
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,360
significance so

1206
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,080
in that sense I'm

1207
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,720
trying to say that

1208
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,600
hierarchies matter

1209
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,040
because

1210
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,120
hold on

1211
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,880
system of value we

1212
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,060
use

1213
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,560
I'll interrupt again

1214
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,220
the fast food

1215
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,120
restaurants back in

1216
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,040
the 70s and 80s

1217
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,620
were having too

1218
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,360
many crowds so

1219
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:43,960
they figured if

1220
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,500
they made like

1221
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,240
pukishly putrid

1222
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,380
ugly colors that

1223
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,080
people would spend

1224
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,140
less time in the

1225
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,120
fast food restaurant

1226
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,600
because they need

1227
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,980
turnover and it

1228
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,000
worked you remember

1229
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,940
those days Bruce

1230
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,160
when they went to

1231
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,840
like hot pink

1232
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,900
plastic chairs and

1233
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,860
Kentucky fried chicken

1234
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,260
and stuff

1235
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,180
and some of the

1236
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,020
chairs were rather

1237
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,320
uncomfortable or they

1238
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,000
turned the air

1239
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,020
conditioning up in

1240
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,900
the summer and it

1241
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,600
was exquisite

1242
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,460
and cold

1243
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,900
and oh yeah

1244
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,360
or the heat in the

1245
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,060
summer and the air

1246
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:10,680
conditioning in the

1247
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,220
winter right

1248
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,360
so that's what I

1249
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,280
would do

1250
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,040
just make it

1251
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,700
uncomfortable

1252
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,920
get your food down

1253
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,280
and out

1254
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,140
yeah

1255
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,880
yeah but you keep

1256
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,240
yeah but you keep

1257
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,880
pulling up these

1258
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,180
fringe things like

1259
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,540
you know that

1260
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,000
you know that if you

1261
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,760
go into the waiting

1262
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,320
room for your

1263
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,020
doctor's appointment

1264
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,420
or whatever

1265
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,400
nobody cares about

1266
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,480
trivialities like that

1267
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,360
right

1268
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,080
and if they do

1269
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,620
it's

1270
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,900
yeah the witch

1271
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,100
doctors that I see

1272
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,280
they got a mud floor

1273
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,180
and a straw hut

1274
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,080
raffia straw

1275
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,320
hut

1276
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,380
and they got the

1277
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:42,840
you know

1278
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,400
whatever

1279
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,480
I'm just joking

1280
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,820
I gave an analogy

1281
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,360
recently

1282
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,900
what would you do

1283
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,460
if the doctor

1284
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,140
the doctor will be

1285
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:49,680
right with you

1286
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,380
and here comes a guy

1287
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,200
with a bone in his

1288
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,220
nose and a face paint

1289
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:52,880
what do you think

1290
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,680
most people will do

1291
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,420
they'll run right

1292
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,320
what's the difference

1293
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,960
you're trying to

1294
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,480
tell me he's not a

1295
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:57,860
doctor

1296
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,540
see the value

1297
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,360
sure

1298
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,360
it's a culture

1299
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,060
how many

1300
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,820
how much value

1301
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,560
does a shrunken

1302
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,460
head have in this

1303
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:06,860
culture

1304
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,040
how much value

1305
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,240
does a shrunken

1306
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,320
head have in a

1307
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,320
culture of

1308
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,960
head hunters

1309
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,660
think about that

1310
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,340
the answer is not

1311
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:15,600
obvious

1312
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,440
it would have no

1313
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,140
it would have

1314
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,000
no value

1315
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,760
in the head

1316
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,660
hunters culture

1317
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,180
because they got

1318
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:22,840
plenty of them

1319
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,520
it would have a lot

1320
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,580
of value in this one

1321
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,020
because it's rare

1322
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,120
right

1323
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:31,960
sure

1324
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,420
sure

1325
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,700
the point is

1326
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,140
just

1327
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,000
like I'm just

1328
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,480
trying to show

1329
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,060
that vertical

1330
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,940
hierarchies

1331
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,580
are sort of

1332
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,000
constant

1333
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,520
in a way

1334
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,120
that the lateral

1335
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,500
thing

1336
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,720
becomes a bit

1337
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,320
of an anomaly

1338
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,920
so like

1339
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,760
on a different

1340
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,080
level

1341
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,040
applying

1342
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,520
one's

1343
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:48,860
energies

1344
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:49,480
towards an

1345
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:49,880
objective

1346
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,580
for example

1347
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,440
is one of the

1348
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,060
most primary

1349
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,740
mediums of

1350
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,240
human age

1351
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,840
you there

1352
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,140
Bruce

1353
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,880
or we just

1354
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,140
lost

1355
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:00,440
Sam

1356
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,780
you there

1357
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,980
you're speaking

1358
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,300
and you

1359
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:04,800
cut off

1360
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,160
can you

1361
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,860
hear me

1362
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,140
yeah

1363
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,480
it was

1364
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,000
probably a

1365
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,560
wire issue

1366
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,120
now we

1367
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,760
can't

1368
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,360
10 seconds

1369
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,820
ago we

1370
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:11,380
stopped

1371
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,340
oh

1372
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,300
so what I was

1373
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:13,700
saying is

1374
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,680
that people

1375
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,440
set goals

1376
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,060
as one of

1377
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:16,340
the most

1378
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:16,840
fundamental

1379
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,780
displays of

1380
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,340
their agencies

1381
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:18,920
I want

1382
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,340
this

1383
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,100
right

1384
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,800
so I

1385
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,220
moved from

1386
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:21,580
point A

1387
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,160
to point B

1388
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,380
and generally

1389
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:23,960
people are

1390
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,820
assuming that

1391
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,240
what they're

1392
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:25,820
going to get

1393
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,240
is better

1394
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,620
than what

1395
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,160
they have

1396
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:27,860
whether that's

1397
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,420
true or not

1398
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,020
but in their

1399
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:29,680
heads at least

1400
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,600
that's how they

1401
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:30,900
think

1402
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,380
so any aim

1403
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,100
towards a goal

1404
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,620
is directed

1405
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,040
upwards

1406
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,940
but any aim

1407
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,420
upwards

1408
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,300
automatically

1409
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,900
creates a

1410
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,240
hierarchy

1411
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,500
because if

1412
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,180
people posit

1413
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:40,780
an aim

1414
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,340
like basketball

1415
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:42,960
is great

1416
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,440
or whatever

1417
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:43,780
and I'm

1418
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:43,940
going to

1419
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,240
be good

1420
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:44,620
at that

1421
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,680
then everybody

1422
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,580
who identifies

1423
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:46,980
with that

1424
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:47,340
goal

1425
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,460
arrays themselves

1426
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:57,420
in a

1427
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,480
hierarchy

1428
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,780
so

1429
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:13,960
the

1430
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,480
point is

1431
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,260
you can't

1432
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,860
eradicate

1433
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,640
hierarchy

1434
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,540
because that's

1435
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,040
the result of

1436
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,880
having values

1437
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,480
in the first

1438
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:22,820
place

1439
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,020
so I don't

1440
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,400
see

1441
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,760
the same

1442
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,160
type of

1443
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,760
archetype

1444
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,340
for lateral

1445
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:27,440
goals

1446
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:28,660
hierarchies

1447
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:29,160
or lateral

1448
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,540
systems

1449
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,240
well hold on

1450
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,360
within the

1451
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:31,900
society

1452
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,120
it usually

1453
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,720
will not be

1454
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,240
eradicated

1455
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,140
the way you

1456
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,580
eradicate

1457
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,160
hierarchy is

1458
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,840
by eradicating

1459
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,440
that entire

1460
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,140
society

1461
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,240
yes which is

1462
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:40,880
common

1463
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,620
which is

1464
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,580
Fresco talked

1465
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,060
about it

1466
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,760
for example

1467
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,100
if you're

1468
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:45,780
familiar with

1469
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,140
the Venus

1470
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:46,740
project he

1471
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,080
was trying

1472
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,380
to do

1473
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,120
so how

1474
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:48,300
do you

1475
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:48,740
transition

1476
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,160
he says

1477
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,540
he can't

1478
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,240
he can't

1479
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:51,720
transition

1480
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,160
this one has

1481
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,700
to completely

1482
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,620
collapse

1483
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,080
it's going to be

1484
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:57,640
very painful

1485
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,560
for a while

1486
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,200
I mean he

1487
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,580
doesn't even

1488
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,180
know scripture

1489
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,940
he sees that

1490
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,620
rationally

1491
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,440
but I mean if

1492
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,200
it does

1493
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,880
collapse

1494
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,960
what you're

1495
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,580
left with

1496
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,180
is

1497
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,860
no hold on

1498
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,400
and after the

1499
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:13,860
collapse you

1500
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:14,740
have to eradicate

1501
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,560
the remaining

1502
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,140
elements

1503
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,840
because the

1504
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,720
if you allow

1505
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,260
the remaining

1506
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:19,920
elements

1507
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:20,920
to

1508
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,320
proceed and

1509
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,040
survive and

1510
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,540
gain strength

1511
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:23,840
they're just

1512
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,400
going to rebuild

1513
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,120
exactly what

1514
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,500
they know

1515
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,380
you get it

1516
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,900
yes so

1517
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,340
we're talking

1518
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:31,680
about a

1519
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,280
paradigm shift

1520
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:32,820
into something

1521
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,220
completely

1522
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:33,500
different

1523
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,120
that's why

1524
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,640
very often

1525
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,320
again I

1526
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:36,620
know you

1527
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,040
this is not

1528
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:37,240
where you

1529
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,580
wanted to

1530
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:37,800
go

1531
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,060
everything

1532
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,640
that people

1533
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,300
consider to

1534
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,760
be normal

1535
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,440
will be criminal

1536
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,220
when the

1537
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:42,880
gods rule the

1538
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,200
planet

1539
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,320
right

1540
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,700
and you're

1541
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,300
being shown

1542
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,840
this right

1543
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,140
now

1544
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,940
there's oh

1545
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,580
our privacy

1546
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,580
is being invaded

1547
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,100
well if you're

1548
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,680
ruled by gods

1549
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:53,940
you can have

1550
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,500
any privacy

1551
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,820
nope they

1552
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,240
could read

1553
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,340
you know what

1554
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:57,820
you've written

1555
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,380
and said

1556
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:58,980
in private

1557
01:04:58,980 --> 01:04:59,740
they could

1558
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,480
hear all that

1559
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:00,960
they may not

1560
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,280
be able to

1561
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:01,980
read your mind

1562
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,780
most of them

1563
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,700
all right so

1564
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,240
you're being shown

1565
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:04,940
that right now

1566
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,260
and a police state

1567
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,140
oh the police state

1568
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:07,620
well do you

1569
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:07,980
think you're

1570
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,240
going to have

1571
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:08,680
something that

1572
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,480
resembles a police

1573
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,920
state of resurrected

1574
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,260
angelic and

1575
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,160
godlike beings are

1576
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:13,840
ruling the planet

1577
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,680
oh yeah

1578
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,880
you're being shown

1579
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,860
all these things

1580
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:19,900
right now

1581
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:20,860
AI

1582
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,560
right oh yeah

1583
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,140
this thing is

1584
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:23,800
controlling oh

1585
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,380
yeah do you

1586
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:24,760
think you're

1587
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,000
going to have

1588
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,600
something like

1589
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,260
AI when the

1590
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:26,940
gods are ruling

1591
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,960
not a machine

1592
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,660
but actual

1593
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:29,800
sentient beings

1594
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,740
that act like AI

1595
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:31,300
you know can do

1596
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,880
trillions of

1597
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,100
calculations per second

1598
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,640
an infinite intelligence

1599
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,600
and access to every

1600
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,240
tide and everything

1601
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:36,700
yeah

1602
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:38,640
you're you

1603
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,440
what you see

1604
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,200
the complaints

1605
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,920
and the concerns

1606
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,640
of this current

1607
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,920
society are

1608
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,640
nothing but

1609
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,920
a precursor or

1610
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,580
a preview to

1611
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,140
what's coming

1612
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:46,600
when the god

1613
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,640
the only difference

1614
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,240
when the gods

1615
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:48,580
were the planet

1616
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,080
the only difference

1617
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,900
is there it's

1618
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,280
going to be

1619
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,120
benevolent versus

1620
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,820
malevolent

1621
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,700
when you hear

1622
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,780
lack of privacy

1623
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,700
now it's

1624
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,560
malevolent

1625
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:56,960
intent

1626
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,420
if you hear

1627
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,100
you know police

1628
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,780
state now it's

1629
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:00,800
malevolent intent

1630
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,440
on and on AI

1631
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,500
now it's malevolent

1632
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,140
intent but when

1633
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,000
the gods are ruling

1634
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,620
it's not going to

1635
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,320
be malevolent

1636
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,500
intent

1637
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,640
so

1638
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,800
just look around

1639
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:14,980
you

1640
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,660
let me just

1641
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:16,280
interject another

1642
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:16,980
thing this morning

1643
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,540
I was out the

1644
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,080
shops and

1645
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,160
I was doing a

1646
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:19,460
little bit of

1647
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,180
talking and

1648
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,320
one guy

1649
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,060
this guy looked

1650
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,460
at me and

1651
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:22,740
he says so

1652
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,900
all this stuff

1653
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,100
one thing led

1654
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,680
to another and

1655
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,220
he's like well

1656
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,140
it'll keep going

1657
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:27,640
on I said no

1658
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,080
it's not going

1659
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:28,620
to keep going

1660
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,740
on and I

1661
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,240
got into a

1662
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:30,640
lesson he got

1663
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,340
roughly 14

1664
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:31,780
years left

1665
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,020
and he says

1666
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,480
do you know

1667
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:32,800
about the

1668
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,420
biosphere

1669
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,580
I said yeah

1670
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,840
they built

1671
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,160
this biosphere

1672
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:37,500
and it was

1673
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,040
closed off

1674
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,480
from the earth

1675
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,180
so do you

1676
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:39,400
know why

1677
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:39,720
they built

1678
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,160
that back

1679
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:40,400
in the

1680
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,860
80s

1681
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:41,300
and I was

1682
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:41,620
like no

1683
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,000
I thought it

1684
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,320
was just an

1685
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:43,760
experiment he

1686
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,180
says no this

1687
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:44,700
is because the

1688
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,200
scientists were

1689
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,220
saying we

1690
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,940
only have 15

1691
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,560
years left

1692
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,760
until 1995

1693
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,080
and we're

1694
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,580
still here

1695
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,020
basically

1696
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:51,420
he's saying

1697
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:51,900
so maybe

1698
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,460
we don't

1699
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:52,920
have 14

1700
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,280
years left

1701
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:53,640
I said but

1702
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,280
yeah they

1703
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,740
had no

1704
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,440
what was

1705
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,140
the reasoning

1706
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,500
that they

1707
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,080
gave we only

1708
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,740
have 15

1709
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,280
years left

1710
01:06:59,280 --> 01:06:59,920
in the 80s

1711
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,380
because I

1712
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,040
remember back

1713
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:01,860
in the 70s

1714
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,440
and 80s

1715
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,320
on the

1716
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:03,680
automobile

1717
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,520
speedometers

1718
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,480
they go in

1719
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:05,960
miles per

1720
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,260
hour

1721
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,980
the 55

1722
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,680
miles per

1723
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,080
hour was

1724
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,600
highlighted

1725
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:09,840
in a

1726
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,060
different

1727
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:10,440
color

1728
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,100
do you

1729
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:11,480
remember that

1730
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:11,740
Bruce

1731
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,700
back in

1732
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,140
those days

1733
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:13,800
yes I

1734
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:13,980
do

1735
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,000
yeah

1736
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,440
and the

1737
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,060
reason why

1738
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:16,800
they did

1739
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,300
that with

1740
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:17,680
the car

1741
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,300
is because

1742
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:18,840
of the

1743
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,580
coming

1744
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,580
to avert

1745
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,100
the coming

1746
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,860
ice age

1747
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,040
because

1748
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,280
they said

1749
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:23,460
when you

1750
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:23,800
drive at

1751
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,620
55 you'll

1752
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,020
be giving

1753
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,380
off it's

1754
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:26,680
the most

1755
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,080
optimum

1756
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,700
speed for

1757
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,180
emissions

1758
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:28,860
yeah

1759
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,760
miles per

1760
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,020
hour

1761
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:32,520
which would

1762
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:32,820
be like

1763
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,320
80 or

1764
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,280
75 kilometers

1765
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:34,600
per hour

1766
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
and they said

1767
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,580
well the reason we

1768
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,180
need to do that

1769
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:37,680
is to avert

1770
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,140
the coming

1771
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,820
ice age

1772
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,200
well what's

1773
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:40,680
your reasoning

1774
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,620
on that

1775
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,640
opinion

1776
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,240
you see

1777
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,440
so all

1778
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:49,680
of this

1779
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,400
sounds valid

1780
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:51,880
doesn't it

1781
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,260
I mean

1782
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,040
what's that

1783
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:53,360
Bruce

1784
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:53,880
the

1785
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,860
ice

1786
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,900
sheet

1787
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,660
or something

1788
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,240
like that

1789
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,520
yeah you're

1790
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:58,980
breaking up

1791
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,360
real bad

1792
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,000
something about

1793
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,300
the ice

1794
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:00,720
what about

1795
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,100
the ice

1796
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,360
sheets

1797
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,120
yeah it

1798
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:02,580
was the

1799
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,800
breaking up

1800
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,340
or the

1801
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:05,700
shrinking

1802
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:07,540
yeah

1803
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,540
which is

1804
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:08,960
which is

1805
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,360
stupid

1806
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,040
yeah the

1807
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,420
rising

1808
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:10,760
let's say

1809
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,040
if the

1810
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,660
icebergs

1811
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,180
melt the

1812
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,120
oceans will

1813
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,500
rise

1814
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,760
I don't

1815
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,380
know I

1816
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:15,800
don't know

1817
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,500
about that

1818
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,200
because I

1819
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:17,560
know that

1820
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,420
water when

1821
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:18,859
it's frozen

1822
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:19,580
it expands

1823
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,500
so did they

1824
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,140
take account

1825
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,520
for that

1826
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,760
you know what

1827
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,180
I mean

1828
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,939
in other words

1829
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:26,540
if you were to

1830
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:26,700
melt

1831
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,960
well in other words

1832
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,000
if you melt

1833
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,520
an iceberg

1834
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,640
you're not going

1835
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,060
to get the

1836
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,359
volume of

1837
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:33,939
water that

1838
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:34,500
the iceberg

1839
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,080
is it's going

1840
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:35,800
to be less

1841
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,040
right

1842
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,319
anyone can

1843
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:39,700
do this

1844
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,439
experiment you

1845
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:40,859
don't have to

1846
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:41,359
be super

1847
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:41,880
genius

1848
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,600
I got a

1849
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,100
chuckle out

1850
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,460
of Sam

1851
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:45,939
you saw that

1852
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:46,399
right away

1853
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:46,880
right Sam

1854
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:48,979
that's so

1855
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:49,439
funny

1856
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,600
what's so

1857
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:50,960
funny

1858
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,899
the obvious

1859
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,840
that they don't

1860
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,479
notice this

1861
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:54,800
yeah they

1862
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,200
don't they're

1863
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:55,580
idiots

1864
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:57,279
you know I

1865
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:57,740
like to give

1866
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,300
the analogy

1867
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:58,979
with you know

1868
01:08:58,979 --> 01:08:59,640
back in the

1869
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,800
late 1800s

1870
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,680
early 1900s

1871
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,200
the scientists

1872
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,800
wrote peer

1873
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,660
reviewed papers

1874
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,580
on how

1875
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:05,319
heavier than

1876
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:05,960
air machine

1877
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,700
flight is not

1878
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,200
possible

1879
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,399
but the Wright

1880
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:08,939
brothers never

1881
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:09,779
read any of those

1882
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,279
peer reviewed

1883
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:10,819
papers

1884
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,000
you see

1885
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,060
same with

1886
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,520
electricity

1887
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,700
if you want to

1888
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,359
know how electricity

1889
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,340
works you better

1890
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,020
not read peer

1891
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:21,640
reviewed papers

1892
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,160
because if you do

1893
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,740
you will never

1894
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,540
find out how it

1895
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:23,720
works

1896
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:24,819
same with

1897
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:25,620
magnetism

1898
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,200
the same with

1899
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:26,560
anything

1900
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,279
you start

1901
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:27,800
studying

1902
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,080
whatever field

1903
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:30,620
I was saying

1904
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:31,120
on Ocelli

1905
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:31,399
yesterday

1906
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:32,220
all the fields

1907
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:32,660
right now

1908
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,560
law

1909
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,040
legal

1910
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:34,760
medicine

1911
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,340
chemistry

1912
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,200
physics

1913
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,760
ancient writs

1914
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,560
anything is

1915
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,399
wide open to

1916
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:40,819
anyone

1917
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,040
because pretty much

1918
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,040
everything that's out

1919
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,740
there is BS

1920
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:47,450
so

1921
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:48,770
there you go

1922
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:51,819
pretty raw

1923
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:52,880
in other words

1924
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,600
every day you have

1925
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,500
an opportunity to

1926
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:54,840
start

1927
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:56,120
you know

1928
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,440
new on the

1929
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:57,980
real deal

1930
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,620
versus the

1931
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:58,900
bullshit

1932
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,760
but there's so

1933
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,120
much

1934
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,720
what would you

1935
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:03,960
say

1936
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,860
if you were to

1937
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,700
go the democratic

1938
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,360
or consensus

1939
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:06,920
route

1940
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,920
that is the

1941
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,380
resistance

1942
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,300
not the actual

1943
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,240
work needed to

1944
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,180
expand the field

1945
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:12,880
but what the

1946
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,380
other people

1947
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,900
in the society

1948
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,700
think about what

1949
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,320
you're doing to

1950
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,260
expand the field

1951
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,020
you see

1952
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,280
that's why

1953
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:21,980
this is a

1954
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:22,920
completely criminal

1955
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,620
society

1956
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,650
it's much

1957
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:27,430
safer to say

1958
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,450
anyone you know

1959
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:28,950
is a criminal

1960
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:29,710
than to say that

1961
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,690
maybe they are

1962
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,230
and I'm telling you

1963
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:32,790
they are

1964
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:33,650
until they're proven

1965
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,650
you can prove that

1966
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:35,210
they're not

1967
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,430
and it's going to be

1968
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,110
very difficult

1969
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,590
if you had to

1970
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,650
defend them in the

1971
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,570
court of the gods

1972
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,490
you would lose

1973
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,370
you know what I mean

1974
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,250
this is how bad

1975
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:44,950
it is right now

1976
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:45,230
so

1977
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:49,490
yes

1978
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,050
well to

1979
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,250
try to wrap up

1980
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:51,970
on the lateral

1981
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:52,950
hierarchy thing

1982
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:53,830
because I did get some

1983
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,590
insight into that

1984
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,830
in the sense that

1985
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,050
well maybe there isn't

1986
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,510
enough of an example

1987
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,050
in the current

1988
01:10:59,050 --> 01:10:59,950
society of that

1989
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:00,710
to really

1990
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,630
rationalize it

1991
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,730
the way that I

1992
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,150
want to

1993
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,970
but

1994
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,490
the idea of

1995
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,070
the most high

1996
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:07,450
god

1997
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,650
imposing his

1998
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,270
leadership

1999
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,610
well his will

2000
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,390
more or less

2001
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,950
solely through

2002
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:13,450
a vertical

2003
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:14,450
dominance hierarchy

2004
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,290
does feel a bit

2005
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:15,890
unreasonable

2006
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,030
which is why

2007
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,770
I'm looking at the

2008
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,290
lateral thing

2009
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:19,150
because I would think

2010
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,450
that the

2011
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,490
I'm going to

2012
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,810
stop you again

2013
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,950
can the most high

2014
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,730
god actually

2015
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,510
impose his

2016
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,570
will by

2017
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:26,670
imposing that

2018
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,030
he doesn't

2019
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:28,590
impose

2020
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,740
no

2021
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,200
yes

2022
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,600
in other words

2023
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,260
there are

2024
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,180
okay

2025
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,140
there are

2026
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,660
spirits that

2027
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,120
are working

2028
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,900
against us

2029
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,660
in a malevolent

2030
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,400
nature

2031
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,620
and if they

2032
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,400
think that

2033
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:43,860
he is

2034
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,880
they are free

2035
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
from his will

2036
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,100
they're delusional

2037
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:47,840
just like people

2038
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,160
are

2039
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:48,500
right

2040
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,060
so

2041
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,500
okay

2042
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,720
put it this way

2043
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,280
the

2044
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,400
winner of the

2045
01:11:59,400 --> 01:11:59,940
war writes

2046
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,320
history

2047
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,440
what if the

2048
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:01,960
winner of the

2049
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,720
war wants to

2050
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,320
actually write

2051
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:03,860
history that

2052
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:04,500
they lost

2053
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,180
for sympathy

2054
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,040
reasons

2055
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:07,680
that's fine

2056
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,460
right

2057
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,720
okay what if the

2058
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,700
most high god

2059
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,240
says that

2060
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:12,760
um

2061
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,600
these guys are

2062
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,720
rebelling against me

2063
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,640
because he allows

2064
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,120
it to

2065
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,960
to suit a purpose

2066
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,780
that cannot be

2067
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,660
understood by them

2068
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,500
or others at the

2069
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,080
moment but he

2070
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,940
sees it because he

2071
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,800
has the wisdom

2072
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,160
oh is that what you

2073
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,000
were saying initially

2074
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,560
then yeah

2075
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,020
sure

2076
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:26,920
that's fine

2077
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,180
you see he has

2078
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,460
that's why later on

2079
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,280
you know people say

2080
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,400
well you know

2081
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,280
what about all the

2082
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:32,700
you know what did

2083
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,480
the baby that was

2084
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,960
thrown in the

2085
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,180
garbage can after

2086
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:35,940
it was born what did

2087
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,620
it do to deserve

2088
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,720
what about all the

2089
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,600
war what about

2090
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,680
the poverty the

2091
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,580
deceit i said well

2092
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,320
you know later on

2093
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,020
you'll find out this

2094
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,060
was the most efficient

2095
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,160
way to do this

2096
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,460
efficient not

2097
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,680
not uh

2098
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,400
loving and

2099
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,140
caring and

2100
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,300
in the direct

2101
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,180
attribute of what

2102
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,180
you think loving and

2103
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:54,920
caring is because

2104
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,760
throwing a baby in

2105
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,460
the garbage after

2106
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,060
it's born is not

2107
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:57,840
loving and caring

2108
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,300
all the deceit and

2109
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,320
war and hate and

2110
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,280
hypocrisy and all

2111
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:01,980
this is not loving

2112
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,420
and caring and

2113
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:02,940
caring the way you

2114
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,620
think it is

2115
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,740
but i'm not just

2116
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,460
talking about the

2117
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,180
physical world i'm

2118
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,000
also talking about

2119
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,980
how things work in

2120
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,640
on the other side and

2121
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,780
perhaps you know

2122
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,520
maybe this is a

2123
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,160
stretch but what

2124
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,440
the ideal whatever

2125
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,240
that means the

2126
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,220
ideal way of running

2127
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,800
things is i mean

2128
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,840
would you say that

2129
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,860
you know the

2130
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,620
workings of the

2131
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,080
physical let alone

2132
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,020
the spiritual planes

2133
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,000
of existence are

2134
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,120
so you know

2135
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,340
sufficiently complex

2136
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,040
so that a

2137
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,940
dominance hierarchy

2138
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,200
i mean a

2139
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:31,800
dominance hierarchy

2140
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:31,960
which is

2141
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,440
would feel like an

2142
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,180
insufficient means

2143
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:33,880
of establishing

2144
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,640
leadership priority

2145
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,100
for something that

2146
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:37,720
complex

2147
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,880
yeah but when you

2148
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,480
really are the

2149
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,260
leader it's not a

2150
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,420
priority to establish

2151
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,500
it if you really are

2152
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:42,920
the leader

2153
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,900
you see in other

2154
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,400
words if that

2155
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,440
that leadership

2156
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,200
position that you

2157
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:48,960
have is empirical

2158
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,000
versus ephemeral

2159
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,840
which can change

2160
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,880
you don't have to

2161
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,200
establish it

2162
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,320
well everything

2163
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,120
needs enforcement

2164
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:56,780
no one does

2165
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,860
still has

2166
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,640
also he doesn't

2167
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,220
have to enforce

2168
01:13:59,220 --> 01:13:59,940
his position

2169
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,840
no no he

2170
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,160
doesn't

2171
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,180
if you have a

2172
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:02,940
bunch of rats in

2173
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:03,480
a cage

2174
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:05,460
whether they're

2175
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,520
peaceful rats or

2176
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,500
warring rats for

2177
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,480
rabid rats as

2178
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,060
long as they're in

2179
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,680
that cage you

2180
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,120
don't have to

2181
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:10,840
enforce anything

2182
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,720
else to control

2183
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,560
them because they're

2184
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,120
in a cage you

2185
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,700
could pick up the

2186
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,600
entire cage and

2187
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,440
throw it in the

2188
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,180
river or you

2189
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:17,620
can know where

2190
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,300
you put it and

2191
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,860
let them out

2192
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,580
yeah but you

2193
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,100
put them in the

2194
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,000
cage you enforce

2195
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,740
the existence of

2196
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,340
the cage in the

2197
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:22,880
first place

2198
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,160
yeah but it's based

2199
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,080
on a high level of

2200
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:25,840
efficiency once you

2201
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,240
get them in the

2202
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,580
cage you just set

2203
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,220
it and forget it

2204
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:28,980
you can walk away

2205
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:29,920
all you need to do

2206
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,440
is make sure they

2207
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,180
get food and water

2208
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,260
and the bottom

2209
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,060
tray gets cleaned

2210
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,080
out every so often

2211
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,240
it's a high level of

2212
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,020
efficiency that you

2213
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,340
have to seek in

2214
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:41,660
order to be in an

2215
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,060
all-powerful position

2216
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,580
it's all about

2217
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,320
efficiency and

2218
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,020
wisdom right

2219
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,940
I worked with a

2220
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:48,800
guy a long time

2221
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,480
ago and he says

2222
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,840
one of his sayings

2223
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,640
was if you're not

2224
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,560
efficient with

2225
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,220
something God

2226
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,140
takes it away from

2227
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:55,400
you

2228
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:00,790
we're not

2229
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,390
talking about

2230
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,950
typical western

2231
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,630
moron doesn't

2232
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,150
really know

2233
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:06,830
if you ask him

2234
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:07,510
to define the

2235
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,090
gods he doesn't

2236
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:08,830
know knowledge

2237
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:09,830
but I think what

2238
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:10,890
came through on that

2239
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:11,470
is interesting

2240
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,710
the combination of

2241
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,290
efficiency

2242
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:15,150
right

2243
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,470
and don't think

2244
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,630
when we speak of

2245
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,190
the gods

2246
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,970
it's very much

2247
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:22,810
like you see

2248
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:23,330
society

2249
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:23,930
there are some

2250
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:24,590
pretty dumb

2251
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,290
gods by the

2252
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:25,650
way

2253
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,250
yeah yeah

2254
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:27,470
sure

2255
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:27,930
yeah

2256
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:28,810
so

2257
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:30,990
well we know

2258
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:31,530
for sure

2259
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,110
that one of

2260
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,630
them is a

2261
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,850
horrible military

2262
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,630
tactician because

2263
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,230
he knows he's going

2264
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:36,830
to lose but he

2265
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:37,370
still goes you

2266
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:37,570
see

2267
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:39,290
anyway

2268
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,230
maybe he got

2269
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:42,910
promised a really

2270
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:43,790
sweet reward if he

2271
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:44,430
loses I don't

2272
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:45,170
know

2273
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:46,730
yeah well we

2274
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:47,270
don't know we

2275
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,930
don't know a lot

2276
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:48,610
because we lack

2277
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,210
the maturity

2278
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:51,590
again if you go to

2279
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,290
a society

2280
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,090
that's very

2281
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,090
different from the

2282
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,790
one you're in

2283
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,230
you almost have to

2284
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:57,910
introduce

2285
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,670
one society to the

2286
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:00,230
other and an

2287
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,070
immature level

2288
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:01,970
immature level

2289
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,150
very childlike level

2290
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,490
until they grow up

2291
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,270
in the thought

2292
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:06,830
you see

2293
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:07,750
hmm

2294
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,690
right

2295
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,190
you know imagine

2296
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:11,910
a society that

2297
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,370
doesn't know

2298
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,430
have electricity

2299
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:14,570
you can't just

2300
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,790
show them Las Vegas

2301
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:16,630
lit up at night

2302
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,270
I mean you could

2303
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:18,030
but it doesn't make

2304
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:18,630
any sense for

2305
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,270
understanding

2306
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:20,870
you'd have to

2307
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:21,470
you know rub

2308
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,810
you'd have to rub

2309
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,050
a balloon or a

2310
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:25,630
wool sweater

2311
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:26,850
a little bit

2312
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,430
you know keep

2313
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,010
rubbing rubbing

2314
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:28,570
rubbing and then

2315
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:28,930
put it in your

2316
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:29,370
piece of metal

2317
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:29,690
you see a

2318
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,210
spark jump

2319
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,110
right you have

2320
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,530
to show them

2321
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,030
things that they

2322
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:32,750
can relate to

2323
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,870
first

2324
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:38,490
no I get it

2325
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:38,950
I mean

2326
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:40,230
the only thing

2327
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:40,990
I mean as a

2328
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:41,830
as a concluding

2329
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,270
note on the

2330
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:42,850
lateral thing

2331
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:43,530
you have

2332
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,110
a being who

2333
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,750
calls himself

2334
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,470
the most high

2335
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:46,850
he doesn't

2336
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:47,350
call himself

2337
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:47,910
the most

2338
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,010
far away

2339
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:49,810
or the most

2340
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:50,110
hidden

2341
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:50,910
or the most

2342
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:51,250
anything

2343
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,950
he establishes

2344
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:53,410
a vertical

2345
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,330
component right

2346
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:54,850
from the beginning

2347
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,170
yeah but hold on

2348
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,850
we got that from

2349
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,390
the prophets

2350
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:57,930
right and the

2351
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:58,670
prophets are men

2352
01:16:58,670 --> 01:16:58,910
right

2353
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,470
and what kind

2354
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,930
of a kingdom

2355
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,470
do the men

2356
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,050
realize

2357
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,450
and acknowledge

2358
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,130
and recognize

2359
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,070
he doesn't call

2360
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:05,370
himself

2361
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:07,050
Elyon

2362
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:07,750
well here's

2363
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,050
the thing

2364
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:08,750
everything that

2365
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,410
we have from

2366
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:09,870
the gods

2367
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:10,310
has gotten

2368
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,950
to us from

2369
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,490
prophets

2370
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:12,770
oh come on

2371
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,630
if they're given

2372
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:14,090
the word

2373
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,890
it's not from

2374
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,310
the prophet

2375
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:17,630
sure it is

2376
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,450
well no

2377
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,090
it's given to

2378
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:20,370
the prophet

2379
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,650
they're communicating

2380
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:23,770
to man

2381
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:24,430
so they have to

2382
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:24,950
communicate

2383
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,870
within the terms

2384
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:26,430
that man can

2385
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:27,070
comprehend

2386
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,520
I've gone

2387
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:31,920
through this

2388
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,680
before with why

2389
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,300
the Christ is

2390
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:33,860
considered the

2391
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,560
son of God

2392
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:36,900
alright if he's

2393
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,280
the son who

2394
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:37,980
is his mom's

2395
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,380
you can't start

2396
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:39,920
imposing

2397
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,300
all this

2398
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,360
minutia of

2399
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:42,940
physical

2400
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,220
man on

2401
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:44,740
that

2402
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,980
because then you're

2403
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,220
going to start

2404
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:46,920
drifting away

2405
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,320
you're going to

2406
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,020
have to force

2407
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:49,960
reading into it

2408
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,840
versus reading out

2409
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,200
of it

2410
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,140
the reason the

2411
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,720
Christ is the

2412
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,340
son of God

2413
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:53,880
as I'm saying

2414
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,880
in the common

2415
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,600
western term

2416
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,620
is because it's

2417
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,340
of authority

2418
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,860
no matter what

2419
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,300
kind of an

2420
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,300
organization you

2421
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:00,820
form

2422
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,260
and how long

2423
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:03,640
you've been

2424
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,220
forming that

2425
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:04,820
organization

2426
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:05,580
the moment you

2427
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,040
have a

2428
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,880
a son

2429
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,660
when he reaches

2430
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,440
age of maturity

2431
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,520
he can take over

2432
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:10,700
the

2433
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,640
situation

2434
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,580
even though the

2435
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,620
people around him

2436
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,840
were part of

2437
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,660
the hierarchy

2438
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,460
before he was

2439
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:16,740
born

2440
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:17,480
he just comes in

2441
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,300
and bypasses

2442
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,000
because he has

2443
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,820
the first right

2444
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,420
of inheritance

2445
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,680
that's why he's

2446
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,620
the son of God

2447
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,820
in a human term

2448
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,240
you see

2449
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,180
but if you want

2450
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:29,860
to push that

2451
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,240
issue

2452
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,520
well who is

2453
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,140
his mom then

2454
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,780
well who is

2455
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:34,880
his dad

2456
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,140
and then you're

2457
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:35,540
trying to

2458
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,680
now you're

2459
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,500
walking out of

2460
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,700
the communication

2461
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,220
realm

2462
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,520
and now you

2463
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,260
want to form

2464
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,700
not you

2465
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,640
but form

2466
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,540
in your image

2467
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,740
make it in your

2468
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,120
image

2469
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,900
I used to give

2470
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,340
more often

2471
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:49,760
I haven't done

2472
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,500
in a long time

2473
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,620
the reason why

2474
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:51,940
Moses

2475
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:52,580
do you remember

2476
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,780
why Moses

2477
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,320
was buried

2478
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,020
by angelic

2479
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:55,300
beings

2480
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,980
and his burial

2481
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,760
location was

2482
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,120
secret

2483
01:18:59,120 --> 01:18:59,560
do you remember

2484
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,320
the reason why

2485
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,540
actually no

2486
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,440
I don't

2487
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:05,840
really

2488
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,620
yeah can anyone

2489
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:07,580
Bruce can you find

2490
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:08,160
that in scripture

2491
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,820
there's a reason why

2492
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,180
no

2493
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,720
I know

2494
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,040
that Satan

2495
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,520
wanted it

2496
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,140
well because if

2497
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:16,600
they didn't

2498
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,200
the people would

2499
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,100
worship Moses

2500
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,520
oh that I know

2501
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:19,780
but

2502
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,800
I mean there was

2503
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,300
something even

2504
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:21,860
under that

2505
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,700
well there was

2506
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,480
a battle over it

2507
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:24,880
with Satan

2508
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,540
Satan wanted to

2509
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,080
expose it

2510
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,480
because he wanted

2511
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,940
us to look how

2512
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,720
stupid these people

2513
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,240
are to worship

2514
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:28,920
another man

2515
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,200
right

2516
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,180
because he just

2517
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:31,780
wants to make you

2518
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:32,280
look bad

2519
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:32,900
you know I mean

2520
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,640
just think about

2521
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,240
if you're against

2522
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,060
someone you don't

2523
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:36,980
have to directly

2524
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:37,460
do anything

2525
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,220
you just make them

2526
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:38,780
look stupid

2527
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:39,660
that's bad enough

2528
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:39,980
right

2529
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,510
no no well

2530
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,550
you can suppose

2531
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,090
that you know

2532
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:47,670
but anyway there

2533
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,230
was a battle

2534
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,170
suppose not a

2535
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:49,630
battle but

2536
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,370
some kind of

2537
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,750
adversarial

2538
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,650
situation over

2539
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:53,170
his body

2540
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:53,490
right

2541
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:54,570
in the

2542
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,330
spiritual realm

2543
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:55,590
right

2544
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,350
and there was

2545
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,030
a rebuke

2546
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,710
that was the

2547
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,550
final you know

2548
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:02,790
part of the

2549
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,490
dialogue that we

2550
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,410
get right

2551
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:10,670
all these

2552
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:11,210
things you know

2553
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,810
in other words

2554
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:12,310
there's

2555
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:13,950
you know a

2556
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:14,690
little is good

2557
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,710
more is not

2558
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,810
necessarily better

2559
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:17,470
you know

2560
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,170
so you get

2561
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:19,950
just enough to

2562
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:20,510
flavor it

2563
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:21,010
we get just

2564
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:21,770
enough information

2565
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:23,050
so that not

2566
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:23,510
only is

2567
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,410
the information

2568
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,990
palatable but

2569
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,250
it takes

2570
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:26,690
taste good

2571
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:27,690
but if you put

2572
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:28,130
too much

2573
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:28,970
flavoring now

2574
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,350
it's no good

2575
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:30,790
you see

2576
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:31,790
hmm

2577
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:34,930
that's funny

2578
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:35,910
there's a

2579
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,410
level of

2580
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,230
maturity that

2581
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:37,770
we lack

2582
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,350
inherently

2583
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,050
inherently means

2584
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:40,630
from generation

2585
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:41,390
to generation

2586
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,590
you know

2587
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:44,210
there are

2588
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:44,910
certain things

2589
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,210
whether you

2590
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:47,870
regard evolution

2591
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,710
or progress

2592
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:49,330
of society

2593
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:50,930
there's an

2594
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:51,630
inherent level

2595
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,330
of immaturity

2596
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:52,870
in mankind

2597
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:53,850
that not until

2598
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:54,370
you go to the

2599
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:54,890
next level

2600
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,730
cosmically that

2601
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:56,350
you know that

2602
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:56,890
will not be

2603
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:57,950
remedied

2604
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:58,450
hmm

2605
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:01,930
that's fine

2606
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:02,590
we're just

2607
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,050
trying to

2608
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,290
that's why I

2609
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:04,470
say

2610
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,830
things

2611
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,170
no that's

2612
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:06,590
why I say

2613
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:07,110
you can take

2614
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,630
anyone from

2615
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,190
any age

2616
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:08,630
and bring

2617
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:09,150
them to this

2618
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:09,750
modern time

2619
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:10,150
it'll only

2620
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:10,570
take them a

2621
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,030
few hours

2622
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,370
or a few

2623
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,370
days maximum

2624
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,050
to adjust

2625
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,530
it won't be

2626
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,090
in any shock

2627
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:14,550
at all

2628
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,040
you know what

2629
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:18,560
I mean

2630
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,580
yeah I mean

2631
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,500
that makes for a

2632
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,760
good polemic

2633
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,740
against mankind

2634
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,240
in general

2635
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:24,580
I don't know

2636
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,180
if it's actually

2637
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,320
true but

2638
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,180
either way

2639
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,460
well you could

2640
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,100
well the thing

2641
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:29,900
that would shock

2642
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,600
them the most

2643
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,260
would probably be

2644
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:31,740
asphalt

2645
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,060
how the hell

2646
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:33,620
did you guys

2647
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,260
put all this

2648
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:34,940
black shit

2649
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,780
everywhere on

2650
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:36,360
the ground

2651
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:38,620
you know what

2652
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:39,060
I mean

2653
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,760
that's not

2654
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:43,920
you know

2655
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,960
most people

2656
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,640
would say oh

2657
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,760
microwaves and

2658
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,160
airplanes

2659
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:47,740
no no no

2660
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:48,120
they're going to

2661
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,840
be totally

2662
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,680
wigged out

2663
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,040
by seeing all the

2664
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,020
oil and gravel

2665
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,740
and putrid

2666
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,520
freaking asphalt

2667
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,460
crap everywhere

2668
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:54,980
you know

2669
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,460
anyway

2670
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,080
anyway

2671
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,360
we can put the

2672
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,180
lateral thing aside

2673
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:00,900
but let's stay

2674
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,180
with the

2675
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:01,840
hierarchies for

2676
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,220
a second

2677
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,120
there does

2678
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,100
seem to be

2679
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,000
such a thing

2680
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,180
you've mentioned

2681
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:07,880
before as

2682
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,960
archetypes of

2683
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,160
existential reality

2684
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,480
we see some of

2685
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:11,900
this in the

2686
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,460
writings of

2687
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,900
you know

2688
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,660
Joseph Campbell

2689
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,040
with the

2690
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,760
Hero's Journey

2691
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,460
this concept that

2692
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,180
underlays most

2693
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:17,960
movies and comic

2694
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,680
books and such

2695
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,800
and you know

2696
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,180
Carl Jung

2697
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:20,660
talks about

2698
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,440
some things

2699
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,580
basically the

2700
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,500
idea is that

2701
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,600
mythology and

2702
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,620
religious stories

2703
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,140
however divergent

2704
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:27,700
they are from

2705
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,060
their source

2706
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,340
material still

2707
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,920
contain some

2708
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,300
kind of a

2709
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:30,780
blueprint for

2710
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,220
how mankind

2711
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,920
exists

2712
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,660
right

2713
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,140
but hold on

2714
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:33,940
Joseph Campbell

2715
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:34,560
was very

2716
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,200
illiterate

2717
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,440
in a broad

2718
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,160
sense of

2719
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:37,680
hold on

2720
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,160
he was very

2721
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,900
illiterate in a

2722
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,580
broad sense of

2723
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,000
comparative

2724
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,580
he didn't know

2725
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,120
anything about

2726
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,540
scripture

2727
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,800
what he thought

2728
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,500
he knew out of

2729
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,080
scripture was

2730
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,780
out of Christianity

2731
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,660
which is nothing

2732
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,460
out of scripture

2733
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,200
basically

2734
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,480
out of context

2735
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,000
you know

2736
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,400
that's like

2737
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,080
putting ketchup

2738
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,380
on pasta

2739
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,040
and calling it

2740
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,920
tomato sauce

2741
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,240
you know

2742
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:55,660
he didn't know

2743
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,340
he's pretty

2744
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:56,840
illiterate

2745
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,920
and also

2746
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,160
the other thing

2747
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,960
about Joseph Campbell

2748
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,740
I got a lot of

2749
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,200
beat bones

2750
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,240
a lot of people

2751
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:03,900
in the past two

2752
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,540
decades have been

2753
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,280
discussing Joseph

2754
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:05,580
Campbell

2755
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,040
looked at his

2756
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,280
stuff and said

2757
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:06,740
this guy's an

2758
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:06,960
idiot

2759
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,560
but anyway

2760
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:07,940
go ahead

2761
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,720
I'll lay off

2762
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,380
Joseph Campbell

2763
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,440
I didn't say

2764
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:11,980
he wasn't an

2765
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:12,140
idiot

2766
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:12,720
no what I

2767
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:12,960
was going to

2768
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,280
say is

2769
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,000
even tomato

2770
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,440
sauce

2771
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,580
or sorry

2772
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,020
ketchup

2773
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,460
you put ketchup

2774
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:17,980
on pasta

2775
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,520
it's still

2776
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,680
discernible as

2777
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,900
being related

2778
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:21,560
to tomatoes

2779
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,360
so it's not

2780
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:24,120
fiction

2781
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,080
right exactly

2782
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,660
but it's this

2783
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,740
preserved stuff that

2784
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,360
they've actually

2785
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,440
deprived people of

2786
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,160
vegetables because

2787
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,160
it got categorized

2788
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,860
as a vegetable

2789
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,800
in school lunches

2790
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,360
in America

2791
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:33,800
anyway

2792
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,640
Ronald Reagan

2793
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,600
categorized ketchup

2794
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,460
as a food group

2795
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:39,940
so they could

2796
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:40,620
cut back on

2797
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,700
giving children

2798
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,300
vegetables

2799
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:42,880
do you remember

2800
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,340
that Bruce

2801
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:43,960
you're old enough

2802
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,620
to remember that

2803
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,120
oh yeah

2804
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,300
so I boycotted

2805
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,180
ketchup for like

2806
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:48,840
20 years

2807
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,160
after that

2808
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:52,700
I know I'm

2809
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,340
bringing myself

2810
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:53,700
in

2811
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,060
well good ketchup

2812
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:56,380
does

2813
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,020
I find that the

2814
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,000
quality of vinegar

2815
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,700
that they put in

2816
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,580
there is so low

2817
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,160
like mustard

2818
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,720
that you don't

2819
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,000
taste the quality

2820
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,500
of the

2821
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,400
you know

2822
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,120
the condiment

2823
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,000
because of the

2824
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,820
poor ingredients

2825
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,660
but anyway

2826
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,600
okay but anyway

2827
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,120
you brought up

2828
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:09,920
the Campbell idiot

2829
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,060
but that's okay

2830
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,260
he brought to the

2831
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:13,920
forefront the

2832
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:14,620
analogy of

2833
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,240
mythology

2834
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,400
in modern

2835
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,000
you know

2836
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,840
effects on modern

2837
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,700
culture let's say

2838
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,240
and mindset

2839
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,600
I get that

2840
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:20,840
but

2841
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,500
right

2842
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,500
would you sum them up

2843
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:23,840
as that

2844
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,420
yeah and I mean

2845
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,420
the idea is that

2846
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,580
within mythological

2847
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:28,540
stories and religious

2848
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,040
stories

2849
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,000
there is some kind

2850
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,480
of a

2851
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:32,260
hidden something

2852
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:32,640
or another

2853
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,340
some kind of a

2854
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:33,980
blueprint for

2855
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,560
how things are

2856
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,840
based on the

2857
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,520
culture again

2858
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,380
based on the

2859
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:39,700
culture

2860
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,120
I'll give you an

2861
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:40,840
example like in

2862
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,260
the American

2863
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,280
culture I just saw

2864
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,860
a movie and it

2865
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:43,460
ended like oh

2866
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,020
don't tell me the

2867
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:44,500
ending I don't

2868
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:44,980
want to know

2869
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,720
well in the

2870
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,440
Greek culture they

2871
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:47,880
tell you the

2872
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:48,480
ending from the

2873
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:48,940
in the very

2874
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,580
beginning in the

2875
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,280
first act don't

2876
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:50,840
they

2877
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,260
I didn't do that

2878
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:53,720
in some Hollywood

2879
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,220
movies

2880
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,580
some you know

2881
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:56,480
some but

2882
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:56,960
typically I'm

2883
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,640
speaking of the

2884
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,240
culture now

2885
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,920
if you go to

2886
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,700
any person

2887
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:00,980
that's a spoiler

2888
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,400
and that's what

2889
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,080
screwed up a lot

2890
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,680
of people that's

2891
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,260
why I tell people

2892
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:04,820
if you know you're

2893
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:05,060
going to have a

2894
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:05,860
conversation give the

2895
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,780
important point first

2896
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,520
then back it up

2897
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,320
forget about all that

2898
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,060
literary shit they

2899
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,860
taught you in school

2900
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:10,800
you have to have an

2901
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,780
introduction the body

2902
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,320
and a conclusion

2903
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,100
give the conclusion

2904
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:13,760
in the beginning

2905
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,320
asshole

2906
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,720
right

2907
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,640
give them the

2908
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,380
finding in the

2909
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:19,720
beginning

2910
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,460
so if you get

2911
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,260
cut off at least

2912
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:22,860
you get all the

2913
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:23,720
crux of the matter

2914
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,560
everything that you

2915
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,280
oh he got cut off

2916
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:26,720
I don't know he

2917
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,380
was trying he was

2918
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,020
going to get into

2919
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:28,360
you know

2920
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:29,960
you know like a

2921
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:30,720
movie well you know

2922
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:31,340
what happens if

2923
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,900
you're watching a

2924
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,380
two-hour movie the

2925
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,220
power goes out

2926
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,120
why don't they just

2927
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,560
give you the

2928
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,740
punchline in the

2929
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,140
beginning of the

2930
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,520
joke

2931
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:39,860
isn't that how you

2932
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:40,940
know when you read

2933
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:41,620
about how mankind

2934
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,400
is you know they

2935
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,200
get the punchline in

2936
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:43,640
the beginning

2937
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,200
but anyway

2938
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,050
yeah that's fine

2939
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,310
that's more of a

2940
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:52,250
criticism than a

2941
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:52,910
matter of fact

2942
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,330
progression or part

2943
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,010
of the discussion

2944
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:55,670
but you know

2945
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:56,410
yeah

2946
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:57,990
no that's fine

2947
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,510
but we don't

2948
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:00,810
you're saying

2949
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:01,550
culture

2950
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:03,350
okay

2951
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,930
the headhunter

2952
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:04,890
culture or the

2953
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,690
headhunter culture

2954
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:06,570
or the other one

2955
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:07,410
which is the

2956
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,270
headhunter culture

2957
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:09,070
yeah they're all

2958
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,570
headhunters

2959
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,430
yeah I mean it's

2960
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:14,110
you know the

2961
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,150
story I gave about

2962
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:15,890
the guys that went

2963
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:16,570
down to the

2964
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,490
Congo or was it

2965
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:17,910
the Amazon

2966
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,650
and they showed up

2967
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,330
with a translator

2968
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:20,970
to one of the

2969
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:21,690
tribes and they

2970
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:22,530
he lit a

2971
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:24,310
cigarette lighter

2972
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,990
and they all

2973
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:25,830
were amazed

2974
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:26,670
and they bowed

2975
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,330
down to him

2976
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,750
and he told the

2977
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:29,530
translator I don't

2978
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:29,970
tell them but

2979
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:30,550
tomorrow we're going

2980
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:31,470
to fly in the sea

2981
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:32,310
plane into the river

2982
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,910
that's really going

2983
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:33,550
to impress them

2984
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,550
and the next day

2985
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,270
they do fly the

2986
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,110
sea plane in

2987
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:38,970
and all the tribes

2988
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,330
come to the shore

2989
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:41,250
and they just shook

2990
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:41,610
their head

2991
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:42,030
shrugged and

2992
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:42,550
walked away

2993
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,710
and the westerner

2994
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,170
goes to the

2995
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:44,590
translator

2996
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,130
he says what did

2997
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,690
they say why

2998
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:46,990
aren't they

2999
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:47,290
impressed

3000
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:47,830
he says well

3001
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,150
you know if a

3002
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:49,990
man can make fire

3003
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,550
come out of his

3004
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:51,230
hand of course he

3005
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,910
can fly it's no

3006
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:52,830
big deal

3007
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:55,310
right

3008
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,750
so what impresses

3009
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,670
one group is not

3010
01:26:58,670 --> 01:26:59,150
you see

3011
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,210
see we're taught

3012
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:00,750
in the western

3013
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,430
culture that you

3014
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,450
have this progress

3015
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,070
right

3016
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:04,130
look at the

3017
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:04,910
airplanes you know

3018
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:05,710
look at them now

3019
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:06,470
you know wow

3020
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,910
aren't you

3021
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:07,630
impressed no

3022
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:09,970
right

3023
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:11,230
but they are

3024
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:11,950
impressed

3025
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:12,890
right

3026
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,670
sure but what

3027
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,050
we're talking about

3028
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:17,310
is a little

3029
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,030
different than that

3030
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,090
in the sense that

3031
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:19,390
if you

3032
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,750
know but hold

3033
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,370
it's not different

3034
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,370
because the mythology

3035
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,010
is the same

3036
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:22,510
analogy

3037
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:24,090
what mythology

3038
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:24,970
what certain

3039
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:26,690
mythological stories

3040
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:27,410
will impress

3041
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,690
upon whether it's

3042
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:29,230
the individual

3043
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:29,830
the community

3044
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:30,730
or the culture

3045
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:32,090
is very different

3046
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:32,590
than another

3047
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,390
mythological

3048
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:34,370
aspect

3049
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,410
but we're not

3050
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:36,050
talking about being

3051
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,130
impressed like reading

3052
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:37,870
a book and thinking

3053
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:38,550
that it's cool

3054
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,490
like some people

3055
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:40,110
read the bible

3056
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:40,610
and they don't

3057
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,090
think it's cool

3058
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,490
they think it's

3059
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,130
boring bullshit

3060
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,370
that doesn't change

3061
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,110
what the information

3062
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,070
is if you can't

3063
01:27:45,070 --> 01:27:46,110
rationalize it you're

3064
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,030
outside of the

3065
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:48,030
you're in the

3066
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:48,590
you're in the

3067
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,090
dumb masses category

3068
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,890
so

3069
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:52,030
well

3070
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:52,650
in short

3071
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,210
in short you know

3072
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,150
the the biblical

3073
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,310
text is done a

3074
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,090
certain way

3075
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,590
if you study it

3076
01:27:58,590 --> 01:27:59,150
long enough

3077
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:00,430
to realize that

3078
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:00,830
you're not

3079
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,650
supposed to know

3080
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,970
enough to upset the

3081
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:03,410
plan

3082
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,410
but you have to be

3083
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:06,350
given enough that

3084
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,470
later on you can't

3085
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,350
say you never were

3086
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:08,790
told

3087
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:10,570
does that make

3088
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:10,870
sense

3089
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:11,730
that's the bible

3090
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,290
in a nutshell

3091
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:13,890
so the information

3092
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:14,650
is something unto

3093
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:15,170
itself

3094
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:15,850
whether you

3095
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:16,750
appreciate it or

3096
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:17,670
your culture this or

3097
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:18,390
that is not the

3098
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,130
point it's something

3099
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:19,670
on its own

3100
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,850
so what i'm saying

3101
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,190
is the mythological

3102
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:22,650
stuff

3103
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:24,170
it seems to have

3104
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,190
been rationalized

3105
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,130
by certain people

3106
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:26,990
in a way that they

3107
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:27,610
present it as

3108
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:28,290
something unto

3109
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:28,850
itself

3110
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,330
whether whether

3111
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:31,070
you like it or

3112
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,650
you don't you

3113
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:32,270
don't believe that

3114
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:33,190
zeus did this

3115
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:34,370
or you know

3116
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,050
archimedes did

3117
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:36,910
that like fuck you

3118
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,050
this is what the

3119
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:38,750
story says

3120
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,250
can you rationalize

3121
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:40,410
it

3122
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:42,110
so for example

3123
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,090
let's look at

3124
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:43,790
something specifically

3125
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,110
when you look at

3126
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,770
certain

3127
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:46,470
archetypal

3128
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,870
representations of

3129
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,130
experiential reality

3130
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:50,590
that is

3131
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:51,710
for example in

3132
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:52,470
terms of leadership

3133
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:53,930
um in

3134
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:54,590
hierarchies

3135
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,850
um you have

3136
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,490
something called

3137
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,310
the wise king

3138
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,510
and the tyrant

3139
01:28:59,050 --> 01:28:59,850
right so the

3140
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:01,190
wise king is

3141
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:02,350
a hierarchy that

3142
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,310
sustains itself

3143
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:04,070
adds to its

3144
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:04,890
population and

3145
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:06,210
expands you see

3146
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:06,810
this with like

3147
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:07,550
somebody like king

3148
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,430
arthur that's a

3149
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:08,790
hierarchy

3150
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:09,630
i'm going to

3151
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,490
stop you again

3152
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:11,290
i'm going to

3153
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,050
stop you again

3154
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,670
because if you

3155
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:14,770
have a wise king

3156
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,430
there's always a

3157
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:17,330
subgroup that

3158
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,530
wishes the tyrant

3159
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,350
would be in place

3160
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,130
because then they

3161
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,010
would prosper more

3162
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:21,710
where the tyrant

3163
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:22,950
right a quick

3164
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:23,970
example is in

3165
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,270
america if

3166
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,110
you had a president

3167
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,030
that didn't want

3168
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:27,990
SWAT teams and

3169
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,030
militarized police

3170
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,930
that would upset

3171
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,390
the people building

3172
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:32,510
the the um

3173
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:33,750
reinforced uh

3174
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:33,990
what do they

3175
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:34,330
call it

3176
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,830
bulletproof stuff

3177
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,550
and all the SWAT

3178
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,150
gear all the

3179
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,010
special tactical

3180
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:38,630
gear and the

3181
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:39,290
weaponry that

3182
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,010
would upset them

3183
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:41,470
wouldn't it

3184
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,570
and they would

3185
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:42,870
rather

3186
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,090
right and

3187
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:45,410
there's a

3188
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:46,030
certain group of

3189
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,690
people that

3190
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,310
want a tyrant

3191
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:49,650
let's say uh so

3192
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:50,270
they can

3193
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:51,650
prosper by

3194
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:52,570
providing you

3195
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,270
know weaponized

3196
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:54,070
police and

3197
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,190
you see what i

3198
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:56,010
mean and tear

3199
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:56,930
gas and all

3200
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:57,430
that you see

3201
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,030
so this is all

3202
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,530
it can do

3203
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,370
right

3204
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:04,470
and

3205
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,050

and

3209

01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:12,950
and

3218
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:13,050
and

and

3227
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,410
and

3228
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:46,510

and

3325
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:00,630
and

3326
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:04,790
They are, but let's say when we bring up the Sons of Gods, I'll get off the topic,

3327
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:09,270
the most memorable one that we see in the Book of Daniel is the Prince of Persia, right?

3328
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:10,730
Memorable.

3329
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,230
Not the only one mentioned.

3330
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:18,710
Okay, well let's presume categorically that he is, would that be false?

3331
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:19,570
Okay.

3332
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,430
No, it wouldn't be false.

3333
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,770
It would be as close as you can get.

3334
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:24,410
What category would you put him in?

3335
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:26,370
Prince of Persia.

3336
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:26,830
Principality.

3337
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:29,390
Principality that was put there.

3338
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:31,170
The Sons of Gods got deposed.

3339
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,670
We don't know what happened after that point.

3340
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:37,810
Okay, alright, so if you want to say that they're discreet and different, then I'll just yield.

3341
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:38,910
Okay, go ahead.

3342
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:47,870
Well, the thrust of what I was saying was that generally you have these archetypes and they seem to work.

3343
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:51,470
The reason why I bring it up is because we see it consistently, right?

3344
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:56,850
But even if you look at like a fortune thousand company or government, corruption ends up being the norm, right?

3345
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:03,370
But at the same time, we know that all this is happening under the auspices of a superpowered being called Yahweh.

3346
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:11,430
And there is a difference, I will yield in this sense, there's a difference between something being partially corrupt and being totally corrupt.

3347
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:17,150
So Yahweh has allowed his creation to become partially corrupt in a general sense.

3348
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:24,890
And it seems because of that, it is unclear what the actual nature of things are because they're in this temporary condition.

3349
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:30,930
So what is the actual nature of a scalable hierarchy that does not descend into tyranny?

3350
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:37,930
I don't think we know that because all empires end up disappearing, all corporations eventually vanish, nations change, whatever.

3351
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:51,450
So does what I wanted to know is that does the scripture indicate what that actually looks like beyond the sort of poetic blissful verses about the time after the Armageddon or whatever, like the lion eating grass?

3352
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:53,670
Repeat the last 10 seconds.

3353
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:55,770
Bruce, did you lose them also or is it just me?

3354
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,410
No, I had a good copy all the way through.

3355
01:34:59,450 --> 01:34:59,710
All right.

3356
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,070
Last 10 seconds, please.

3357
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:14,790
Okay, what I was saying is that it's clear that Yahweh has allowed his creation to become partially corrupt in order to maybe push this plan forward in a general sense.

3358
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:19,470
So the actual nature of what things could be is not clear.

3359
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:33,650
Like what does a wise king hierarchy look like if it's just allowed to perpetrate indefinitely instead of eventually descending into tyranny and falling over because it's corrupt and people mess everything up?

3360
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,430
Does the scripture actually show that?

3361
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,990
Yes, but you've answered it yourself if you examine what you just asked.

3362
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:45,030
How can it be allowed one way and not the other?

3363
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,970
It's allowed all the way around.

3364
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:48,010
It's predetermined.
