1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,380
You see, yeah, most high.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:16,060
Yeah, we keep and I think what Sam is has is trying to contend with is the grammar is the semantics of saying the most high if it's lateral.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:28,160
No, no, what I'm asking, what I'm asking specifically, is there are certain structures that are in place that indicate how things work.

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,480
Right?

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,620
There is an example of a hierarchy or system of leadership or government that eventually destroys it.

6
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,840
Sorry, I'm going to interrupt.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,860
Hold on interject this when you're ruled by Satan.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,020
Even most people are going to walk away saying we know how things work.

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,900
But because you're ruled by Satan, that is actually a deception.

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,260
You see, and I'm not trying to be adversarial in that aspect.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm just trying to tell you that in this world, people don't know how things work.

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,840
They're just buying time.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,600
They're just biding or abiding time, I should say.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,760
Do you know how anything works?

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,020
Yeah, but on a sure, I do.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,460
And in many cases, I actually, I'm sorry to say that.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I'm sorry to say that I do.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,520
But on a cultural and a societal level, they don't know how it works.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
No, but we're not talking about them.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,080
We're talking about what is observed.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
No, we're talking about what's observable to everybody.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,700
Yeah, what's observable.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,100
But here's the thing, what's observable to anyone is, you know, you have a reasonable modicum of peace in society, right?

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,480
Not everyone is killing you.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,640
You know, it's not like gone into complete darkness yet.

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,700
Even you know, spiritually it might be.

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,460
But what I'm saying is, hardly anyone knows anything about anything.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,100
And you all seem to be getting along just fine till now, right?

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,960
As a matter of fact, the things that don't seem fine are actually instigated by, you know, secret forces behind the governments, right?

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,820
Like no one's going out killing other people unless they're made to, you know, for industrial reasons or whatever.

31
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,040
It's very rare that you hear about crimes of passion, even though they do exist.

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
You always hear about the ones that are propagandized.

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,560
So my point here is very simple.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,240
It's, and this is why I've been speaking, no one seems to know about anything about anything.

35
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,040
But everything seems to be fine.

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,520
And I'm telling you, it's not fine.

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,810
Right?

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,870
Have you ever listened to Greek speak cover?

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,010
Maybe a dozen different subjects, and they're very easy to comprehend.

40
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,370
But there are very stark contrast to the common understanding.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,290
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,530
And it's not as I'm not being esoteric or sublime.

43
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,150
So you know, no, no one knows what's going on.

44
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,770
No, I can't say they do.

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,970
I mean, we're not talking about them.

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,250
I don't know why you keep bringing that up.

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,830
That was whether you it's right now, just forget about them.

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,650
Just go get a random five people from anywhere in the world.

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,730
They don't know what's going on.

50
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,130
I'll bet that they don't.

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:17,990
The chances of you getting five random people from any society, and anyone knows anything about anything is so rare, that I would bet that none of them know anything about anything.

52
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,930
This is how sure I am about this, by the way.

53
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:21,950
Yes.

54
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,850
And that is not so not to extend.

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:32,370
Now to extend that ignorance and stupidity, whether it's a micro or macro scale, it's the same.

56
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,130
So no, there are no wise kings.

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,370
No, there are no, you see that no one knows what's going on.

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,110
It's a miracle.

59
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,530
You want to know what a real miracle that we're all here in the in the fat way that we are.

60
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,570
Yeah, you really think that when I say wise King, I'm trying I'm talking about an actual wise person?

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,150
No, no, you're giving an example.

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,570
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,690
So why do you keep acting like I'm not doing that?

64
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,610
Or that I'm talking about a concept?

65
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:06,750
It's a concept, but here's a concept that's so far removed that even if we use the colloquial wise King of Solomon, did he end up being fairly wise or not?

66
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,870
No.

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,990
So I see what you're saying.

68
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,589
But I don't see but I don't see how it would it would work in this in this incarnation meaning of this reality.

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,390
Okay, well, then that is what I'm getting at.

70
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,410
Like, does scripture indicate that there's an incarnation where it does work?

71
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,350
And does it offer the technical alludes to it?

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,190
Yeah, that's why Have you ever heard me say that scripture is not finished?

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,400
The scripture we have is finished a long time ago, but the actual acts?

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,440
Okay.

75
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,920
You like, for example, the Book of Acts?

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,240
Why is it called the Book of Acts?

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,480
Right?

78
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,220
Just a record of acts, right?

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,060
Or events, right?

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,260
Do aren't there going to be acts when the gods come back?

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,860
Oh, let's see.

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,760
overtly?

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah.

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,700
And do you think anyone is going to take the time or there might be in the in the, you know, the God government?

85
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,180
A position for recording these things?

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Yep.

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,220
Yeah.

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,540
You see?

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,280
So when I say scripture, not the scripture we have, but there is going to be a writ record in the future as well, records will be kept in the future.

90
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,480
So we in other words, we have very little information on those records.

91
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,160
There is one who knows what those records will be like, right?

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,600
But we have no information on that.

93
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:47,080
Okay, there's very little information, by the way, about anything that we consider to be a necessity now, in scripture, believe it or not.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,840
Where does it talk about the biological vacuum and you don't absorb anything?

95
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Where does it talk about how to make a fire?

96
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:05,300
Or, you know, or specific, you know, child rearing specifics, which is, you know, child rearing is one of the most important things that a man can, you know, humankind can do.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Right?

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,320
That would be like saying, going to a factory that makes glass molds or clay pot molds.

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,480
And, you know, oh, it doesn't matter what the mold is like.

100
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,880
Of course, it matters.

101
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,700
The rearing is the molding, right?

102
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,920
What tools you're giving, right?

103
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,300
There's not, there's very little information on that.

104
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,550
We're basically given so little information that we cannot screw up the plan.

105
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,450
But given enough information that later on, we can't say that we didn't have any information.

106
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,430
I don't think we, I think all of it is there, and various degrees of technological formats that we don't understand.

107
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,290
You know, I think I've explained that, previous sonic events.

108
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,510
I don't know, Bruce, have I ever gone public with the, the Hebrew and Greek letters being Morse code?

109
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,330
Do you remember that?

110
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,130
Or maybe I don't know if Sandy...

111
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:16,250
Yes, and as you elaborated about, if you were to put a piece of paper across, on, and just read the top row of the dots, it's like a Morse code, a straight edge, right?

112
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,770
It'd be like a Morse code.

113
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,710
And didn't you say something about that?

114
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,330
God, how did you put that?

115
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,510
That it would actually create a picture?

116
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,710
Or...

117
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,290
There's enough code there.

118
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,930
There's enough code there.

119
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:44,030
If you if you go across the letters, top, middle, bottom, the number of the letter, what is the alphabet, the number of the letter in the word?

120
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:44,850
Yes.

121
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,910
The spaces between all that, you're going to get a few minutes of video on each page.

122
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,770
Yes, there's enough.

123
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,270
Yes.

124
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,190
Bits and bytes.

125
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:52,570
Yeah.

126
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:03,550
And I ran this when I was out in LA and other times running into people that did MIDI, digital analog to digital conversion, and they looked at it and actually compiled that?

127
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,690
No.

128
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,450
Well, I've been sort of semi-public about that for a little while.

129
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,310
There's nothing on it.

130
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,790
My goodness.

131
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,530
Yeah, I don't know.

132
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,230
I can't be the only one who sees that.

133
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,010
But I don't see any information on it.

134
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,350
And I would be surprised if it's it's already been done and not made public and actually being used against people.

135
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,030
True, true.

136
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,789
But I don't think the, you know, but anyway.

137
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,299
Wow.

138
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,540
So otherwise, why are they so adamant about the preservation in those languages when we know there are errors in it?

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,960
Yeah.

140
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,060
You see, there's a, right?

141
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,320
Because at different times, it was not preserved in that it was preserved in, you know, what they call paleo Hebrew, which is different.

142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,120
They didn't have that format for other reasons.

143
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,060
You know, like, you know, people say the Jews versus the non-Jews or whatever.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,200
You know, they need to wake up at what they call Hebraic script and Hebrew and all that stuff.

145
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,900
That's all borrowed from Babylon, right?

146
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Or developed.

147
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,460
Yeah.

148
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,640
So all this bigotry and hate and race is really an instigation.

149
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
And, you know, so.

150
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,400
Somebody's working overtime to keep that going.

151
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,340
Yeah.

153
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,360
The Hatfields and the McCoys, you know, kind of thing, right?

154
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,560
Big time.

155
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,940
Do they have that metaphor out there in Europe, Sam?

156
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,700
Not really.

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,480
It's just families that are fighting and so many, so much time goes by, they forget why they're fighting.

158
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,700
They just know that they have to fight.

159
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,100
No, I've heard of it.

160
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,200
It's probably another archetype or something.

161
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,900
Loose, cultural, piss-poor, low-level, you know, stuff.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,180
I was explaining to someone, by the way, in terms of the law, brought up, like, you know, they say, love your enemy.

163
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,220
Do you know what that means?

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,840
And I said, yeah, but you don't.

165
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,600
And the guy says, what an arrogant fuck, right?

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,260
I said, well, let me explain to you.

167
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,760
He's speaking, he doesn't say, just love your enemy.

168
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,700
That's stupid.

169
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,260
Because if you do that, the enemy is always looking at a weakness to take advantage of you.

170
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Stupid.

171
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,280
That's not what it means.

172
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,180
Everything that's said in the New Testament is context with the biblical law.

173
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,940
And, of course, because the demons that run the religions and the churches don't want you to look at the law.

174
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,540
Can we come up with, is there a law anywhere that states about, love meaning do the right thing, agape, right?

175
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,900
It means without breach.

176
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:13,280
Do you know that in the law it states that if you have an enemy based on boundaries or whatever, and their animals come across to your land, that you are not to kill them, that you return them back to him?

177
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,700
That's what love your enemy means.

178
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,920
Do the right thing to the enemy.

179
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:31,900
How do you know, what's the right thing, you know, like, you know, in Scripture, when you go and do war, what do you, you don't tear down fruit bearing, fruit bearing trees, right?

180
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,430
But if you notice now, they're doing that, right?

181
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,650
Don't they do, when they do war, even in the Middle East, don't they blow up olive trees and burn them down and stuff?

182
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,390
Yeah.

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:52,210
So that's love, you know, I mean, people don't, forget about the word love, you know, that's what I like about Jack Fresco, the word love is bullshit, you don't know what it means, right?

184
00:11:53,550 --> 00:12:03,750
So, again, if you read the news, you know, turn the other cheek, you know, if someone slaps you, it's usually you're not, it means you're not a moving target.

185
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:17,390
Well, if you get hit, if you get hit because you were not a moving target, maybe it's better that you are a moving target now, because, you see, turn the other cheek, get it?

186
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,110
Time to move.

187
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:29,830
Yeah, it's not, this is, it's amazing how stupid people are, not stupid, they can't see the plain example, because they don't know the whole story.

188
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:42,810
What I was saying with Ocelli was, you know, can you imagine going to college level math and they say, okay boys and girls, you're in college now and we're going to do math, so two plus two equals what?

189
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,330
No, it's cumulative.

190
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,430
You see, when you get to the end of what they call scripture, the New Testament, that is PhD level stuff.

191
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,530
If you don't haven't done your homework and the rest, you will not understand anything in it at all.

192
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,870
Guaranteed.

193
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,410
Which is self-evident.

194
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,340
Yes.

195
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's just wrap up this hierarchy thing a bit, like what you were saying before about the rats in the cage.

196
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:34,780
So you're, you would say that, I mean, normally, if you know, in human society, there's an ethic that's associated with leadership, that is not, you know, a mere consequence of having power.

197
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,180
Like, just because you're the boss doesn't mean you do whatever you want.

198
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm going to interrupt you again.

199
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,820
Have you ever heard the saying, true power is never known in leadership?

200
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,180
True power is never known.

201
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,540
Look, if you were really in power, would you want to go out in the world and tell these idiots you're in power?

202
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,120
Are you going to put the janitor in president's uniform and say, this guy is your leader?

203
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,100
Of course.

204
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,260
Yes.

205
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,720
This is, I mean, this is planet Earth you're talking about, right?

206
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Not some other planet, right?

207
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,820
Okay, so the idea is that all leaders are corrupt and there's no ethic.

208
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,260
No, no.

209
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,480
I didn't say, you keep using that word corrupt.

210
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,920
Like, like this other guy the other day was saying all the attorneys are corrupt.

211
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,180
Okay, all leaders are malevolent and there is no ethic.

212
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:27,080
You know, they're doing exactly what they're doing according to the God that they form their society under.

213
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:36,860
Yes, but even within the context of this deception or the misdirection, people still have to adhere to the fallacy.

214
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,540
So when they say that your leaders have an ethic, people still have to see that.

215
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,960
They don't have to adhere to it.

216
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,300
You could be in, scripture tells you to be in it, but not of it.

217
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm not saying you could be a fly around the fly.

218
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,000
You don't have to get stuck on the flypaper.

219
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,400
Okay, listen, so I'll just like ask it simply.

220
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Is there an ethic associated with leadership?

221
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,260
Well, ethics is a really difficult thing to define.

222
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh shit, come on.

223
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:16,960
Ethics, the sense that you have to act a certain way, that you have to adhere to a certain display of benevolent qualities.

224
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,820
It's not that simple.

225
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,080
Yeah, again, there's so many levels to it.

226
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:34,360
One is if you understand the current intricacies of showmanship, like for example, modern world leaders, why don't they just have actors?

227
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,460
Just go to Hollywood, forget about the other political side.

228
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,860
Just put actors in there, right?

229
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,620
Supposedly they'll be better than the ones they're putting in now, at least in performance.

230
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
Or you can go to the spiritual side and say there's an entity behind it.

231
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,860
Or you could say, where's the wisdom in being a leader?

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,380
Because these people are, who wants to rule over idiots, right?

233
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,560
There's got to be something wrong with you, unless you view them as food or pets.

234
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,340
So there's so many, what ethics?

235
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,140
This is complex.

236
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:16,580
Remember again, I know this is not where we were going, but when you're dealing with the gods, you're dealing usually on that level with beings or creatures or create parts of creation and then the most high that has IQ in the millions.

237
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:26,320
And I don't like to use that metaphor, because you know, if you have never discussed the IQ test, I don't know if anyone's taken, you know, it's basically time versus how many problems you solved.

238
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,200
These gods would solve the IQ test before you handed it to them.

239
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,120
That's why I mean it's an IQ of 2 million, right?

240
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,420
Or whatever.

241
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,760
As you hand it to him, he'd hand it right back to you and say, it's done.

242
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,780
I didn't even see you do it.

243
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,620
It's all perfect, in no time.

244
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,000
So where's the ethics there?

245
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,520
I mean, what level of performance are you looking to judge what is really going on?

246
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,760
Because what is really going on is really emanating from that primacy.

247
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,360
So the rest of it is what you would like to see, Sam, from it.

248
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,200
What I would like to see is the ethics.

249
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,599
We're talking about the primacy as well.

250
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,680
Okay, put aside the man society shit.

251
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:21,599
Even in their kingdom, you have a boss, the most high, he runs everything, and he gives his followers or his subjects the choice.

252
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,160
Do you want to follow what I'm doing or do you want to go and rebel?

253
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,280
Right?

254
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,079
And some of them rebel and some of them follow.

255
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Right, yeah.

256
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:36,340
And yeah, it's his plan or whatever, but they still have the agency to say, I'm gonna do what he says or I'm not gonna do what he says.

257
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,420
Right?

258
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:45,560
And I'm trying to see, okay, so you have some of them that go with the plan, some of them that go with the instructions, some of them that don't.

259
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,640
And perhaps the ones that don't have determined, well, we don't like this guy.

260
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,620
Forget him.

261
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,500
We're gonna do what we want.

262
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,680
Alright, I'm gonna stop you again.

263
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,960
Just do this thought experiment.

264
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,660
Let's go into the future when the gods are on earth and ruling.

265
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,560
Do you think that question would be relevant?

266
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,980
No, because the bad guys have been deposed.

267
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,280
They've already lost.

268
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,140
Right, so we know that for sure.

269
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,220
Okay, so if we know that for sure, can't we act that that's been done already anyway?

270
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,800
You know, so I give the...

271
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,500
But it doesn't change the social dynamic.

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,600
There's still gonna be a rebellion.

273
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,980
The thing is to avoid that dynamic.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
But there's still gonna be a rebellion.

275
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,160
The dynamic is always gonna be present.

276
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,520
A thousand years later, you're gonna have hundreds of millions of people that do another rebellion.

277
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,380
That doesn't change.

278
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,720
So the act of how social being works is not going to change.

279
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,440
There's a nature that's built into the creation.

280
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,660
But there's a dynamic that we don't know until it's experienced because of the limiting factors that we have.

281
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,640
Like for example, when Satan is unleashed back on society, some people go for it, some people don't.

282
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,260
No, it says that no one goes for it, right?

283
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,500
But actually there's an army that is...

284
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,580
Isn't there a battle?

285
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,260
But it's put down very quickly.

286
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,920
But the only way that you can predict the future is if you have certain fixed references that do not move.

287
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,400
Right, I call it an inertial plane of reference.

288
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:25,920
Actually one of the projects I'm working on is to establish an acoustic inertial frame of reference and that just like every engineer...

289
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,320
So we're talking about 75 year old engineers now, people that are very well...

290
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,520
can't grasp it.

291
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,020
And it's a child can grasp it.

292
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,100
So do you want to go down the route of the...

293
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,680
So in other words, okay, let me just summarize up until now.

294
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:58,840
Not only are we discussing this or you're bringing it up from a, let's say, see what's valid or invalid, but ensuing perhaps at is there engineering involved and how much of it is engineering, how much of it is happenstance or, you know, or is it just all metaphysics?

295
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,380
In other words, we can't get a grip on it for measuring and managing, but we can get a grip on it cognitively.

296
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,980
I don't know if I actually simplified or made things more complicated by saying what I just said.

297
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,740
But I would suggest that at this point that when you're...

298
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,320
you cannot go purely secular on this...

299
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,080
on this...

300
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,580
on the attributes of the hierarchy.

301
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,060
Can't.

302
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,600
That's just admitting we're going to be ignorant.

303
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,540
You know what I mean?

304
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,640
I don't know that I'm being completely secular.

305
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,120
Like, what do you mean it's secular?

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Like, if I look at...

307
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,040
if the couch is red and I see that the couch is red, it's neither secular nor anything else.

308
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,280
It's an observation that something is the way it is and it functions that way.

309
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
It depends on how much light...

310
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,900
it depends on how much light you have on the couch.

311
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,360
Years ago in cycling, when people used to buy red cycling gear, I said, at night that looks like black.

312
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,040
And recently someone here came...

313
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,800
they were wearing something red and it was dim.

314
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,660
I said, is that black?

315
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,280
No, it's red.

316
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,580
See?

317
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:15,400
So, in other words, there's so little light in the world, and that sounds philosophical, that we can't see the true color anymore.

318
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,320
I mean, I'm not saying it's not possible to see true color.

319
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,080
Of course it is, and heaven forbid you do.

320
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,740
The reason why is because your life will be miserable.

321
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,140
Look, if they're having violence and war there, what do you think you're gonna have here?

322
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,340
How would you act?

323
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,660
Like, how would you...

324
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,860
would your mindset be different if you're in Europe during World War II right now?

325
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,560
Do I know everything that I still know, or am I just...

326
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,500
No, in other words, your current mindset, what would it be like if there was war in Europe, like World War II?

327
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,980
Actually, believe it or not, there were still people going on vacation during the height of the war, right?

328
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,900
Like, it was no big deal.

329
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,880
Just depend on where they were dropping the bombs, right?

330
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,780
Right.

331
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,900
You see what I mean?

332
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,440
So, there's always a place, even though it sounds categorically, oh, Europe and World War II was a nightmare.

333
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,060
No, it wasn't.

334
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,170
Sure.

335
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:36,810
I mean, one of the core things that I'm trying to see here is if there is something outside of the consequence of being the most powerful guy in the room, because clearly, Yahweh is the most powerful guy.

336
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,590
I mean, even if you look at, like, kingship on...

337
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,190
I don't want to say a secular level, but let's just say that, okay?

338
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,030
The way the kingship works is that sovereignty requires legitimacy.

339
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,230
You said that.

340
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,590
People don't just follow the king because the king said he's the king.

341
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,910
They have to see him as being legitimate, and then they get behind him.

342
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,810
Otherwise, you have revolutions all the time.

343
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,970
So, it was overtly known in ancient times that the king had legitimacy because the god was behind him.

344
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,390
So, what gives the gods...

345
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,870
if you go one step higher than that, what gives the gods legitimacy?

346
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,410
Specifically, what gives Yahweh legitimacy as king?

347
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,210
Is it just the fact that he has all the power, and the rats are in the cage, and he's like, fuck y'all, you're in the cage.

348
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,550
So, stay there.

349
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,910
Yeah, because there are certain things that occur that just can't be changed.

350
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,430
So, we're all in the cage, and so is everybody else on the other side.

351
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,370
Yeah, you could say that.

352
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:44,110
A spiritual cage would be of no relevance to the physical world, other than its imposition.

353
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:52,170
You know, if it wants to start coming in, and a physical cage in the material world would mean nothing in the spiritual world.

354
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,170
So, then everything is the result of a power dynamic.

355
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,070
Right.

356
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,590
Ultimately.

357
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,730
Dynamic, yeah.

358
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,990
Power dynamic is like saying power power, because dynamic means power in Greek, but yeah.

359
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,690
But of a power situation.

360
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,010
So, the guy with the most power rules is the fundamental understanding here.

361
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,710
Oh yeah, might makes right, correct.

362
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,590
And the most mighty makes what's right.

363
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,130
Okay, well, in that case.

364
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:36,950
I mean, do you want to explore that either in, you know, here or there, or, you know, it's the same.

365
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,450
No, that's fine.

366
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:45,030
You know, again, this is a world ruled by Satan, or the adversary, let's just say.

367
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,110
So, the things that people are striving, like for example, if you ask someone, are you striving for good?

368
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,530
Yes.

369
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,330
What is that good?

370
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,170
And they explain it to you.

371
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,170
That's mostly evil, evil stuff to the gods.

372
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,890
And if you strive to what the gods consider good, most people will say that's pretty evil.

373
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,110
Right?

374
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:09,750
Yeah.

375
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,210
I mean, think of a phaser.

376
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,870
You know, I said, I wish I had a phaser.

377
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,150
Why?

378
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,430
Oh, it's for landscaping.

379
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,230
You know, the Star Trek phaser, you're just pointing it at someone, they turn into a pile of dust.

380
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,250
You can't tell them well, because it's neat and clean.

381
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,970
They'll say that's evil.

382
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,930
Right?

383
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,350
Anyway.

384
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,380
Well, that does it for the hierarchy stuff.

385
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,260
What else?

386
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,180
But hold on, the hierarchy works the same way electricity works, it works the same way magnets work, works the same way water works.

387
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,780
In other words, those things I just mentioned are natural forces that appear to be ever-powerful in this realm.

388
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,140
Right?

389
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,080
You know, water, no water, forget it.

390
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,040
No electricity, you're not going to have anything doing anything.

391
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,940
And no magnetism, there won't be any material.

392
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,100
Once you start understanding these material things, you'll see that there's a relationship in the spiritual realm.

393
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,220
You can't change those things.

394
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,500
You know, that's why, you know, if you study the Greek philosophy and metaphysics, it's not translated.

395
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You know, you're not going to, the current mindset can't grasp what's being said.

396
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,000
Right?

397
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:42,240
Because what they're telling you is there are things that don't change, and the more you understand them is you'll understand why things do change, because the things that aren't changeable are rotating around the things that don't change.

398
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,480
Right?

399
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:51,300
It's like the concept of the atom is completely misunderstood.

400
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:03,060
And, you know, when I started looking into some of the Greek writings, I'm like, this is not what, you know, when you look at what the English professors are writing about, I'm like, that's not what's being said.

401
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,460
And I can do that.

402
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,220
I'm not educated, and I don't have any special training in that.

403
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,920
Except you know Greek.

404
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,000
Well, ancient Greek is different, by the way.

405
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,460
Just, you know, I mean, if you want to start qualifying it, you're going to have to learn it.

406
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,740
But what I found by learning the ancient Greek is similar in all languages.

407
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,020
You know, you have pre-root meaning of word, you know, you've seen that in Strong's Concordance, root meaning unknown.

408
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,640
That's bullshit.

409
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,000
Right?

410
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,580
If you know the letter, you know what it means.

411
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,540
You have prefixes and suffixes, right?

412
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
That are undeniable.

413
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,060
Like, you know, I usually give the example when you see a in front of a word it means without the root meaning, right?

414
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,580
Like amoral means without morality.

415
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:55,320
So you see the a that means without, you know, pro means running with, and para means with, pro means for, towards.

416
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:09,440
So you know, you have certain methodologies to develop, and once you hold on to those basics, which don't change, you'll start to get a definitive communication versus a version.

417
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,600
Again, that sounds familiar when you're studying scripture.

418
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:27,700
I mean, you know, here's the thing, just for shicks and giggles, like they say, and fun, I still occasionally will pull up an e-sword and various things and look at words that I would, you know, if I meditate on scripture and say, does that word really mean that?

419
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:41,340
And I look it up and it doesn't, you know, and I've done so many of them right now that I can actually meditate on scripture properly and see how simple it is, its simplicity.

420
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,170
You know, recently I was explaining to someone the word sin, you know, the Christians like to use that a lot.

421
00:28:49,410 --> 00:29:12,730
You know, it just means missing the mark, and just being in front of the computer I quickly went, I just did a search, Strongs, you know, Strong apostrophe S, Greek, sin, and Bible Hub pulls, you know, pulls up the meaning of the word, shows you what's being used, and it actually had in the definition, which is not in the other, in the e-sword, very clearly it says missing the mark.

422
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:14,950
Amartya, right?

423
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:30,790
And I was like, perfect, it's exactly the metaphor I gave, I showed this individual, I said, basically sinning is like going to a shooting range and you say you're gonna hit the bullseye and you miss, you just sinned if you don't hit the, you know, the bullseye.

424
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,670
It's missing the mark.

425
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,430
So here's the interesting part, you ever read the book Catch-22?

426
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:55,450
I can't even say that I, I did read it, but I didn't read it in a state where I could recall it, it was a very long time ago, and I didn't think it was important, but one of the guys in there in the beginning of the book was, I just want to be bored because I found out, someone said that if you're bored you don't age, right?

427
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,750
So he attached one thing to another, right?

428
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,710
So basically if you have no attachments or no desires, can you sin?

429
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,170
No.

430
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,450
If you have no desires to do anything or pursue anything or attempt anything, can you sin?

431
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,110
No, because you're never gonna miss the mark, because you're not doing anything.

432
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,860
Hmm, it makes sense.

433
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,040
It was the Christ without sin because he had no desire to do anything other than what he was sent here to do?

434
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,940
Think about it.

435
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,400
You can't say he had no desire other, there's still a desire there.

436
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:44,720
Well, because he's a man, but what I'm saying is the, what he accomplished was exactly what he was set out, set out to do, so he's without sin, isn't he, is he not?

437
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,240
Didn't, wasn't he put to death and resurrected, is exactly as planned from the promise from the beginning?

438
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,860
Very simple, why he's without sin.

439
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,490
These are simple concepts, very, very simple concepts.

440
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,730
Remember the scripture is baby talk to humans.

441
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:17,330
It's their baby talk, which, which I find reviling because, you know, I've, if you've listened to maybe some, I used to press on with this when I was doing some sonic events back in the day.

442
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,870
There should be no separate child cult society.

443
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,110
Children are just small people.

444
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:36,990
Should be no happy meals and children's, you know, subculture, children, you know, shows and children books and that's bullshit, right?

445
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:53,740
Something I like about frescoes is children are a pain in the ass, you know, until they, until they, you know, they get it, get their act together, right?

446
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,800
Or, you know, when they're not, when they have assholes raising them.

447
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:19,690
Let's just look at the language thing real quick since you brought that up, because ever since coming across Greek speak, I've been making adjustments to certain aspects of my mindset, but it's common to run into real-world situations that challenge some Greek speak conclusions and the issue of language is one of them.

448
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:29,890
So now I sort of pay attention more to etymology than I used to, but I find that when I overly focus on it, I run into other problems which raise some questions.

449
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,710
So if I were to say, like, in general, what's the purpose of language?

450
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,150
It seems that the purpose of language is for communication, right?

451
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:48,810
Irrespective of values or accuracy of speech or virtue or whatever, there's a whole range of things that could be communicated across any of those.

452
00:32:48,810 --> 00:33:00,470
Yeah, but Sam, when people, you think people are speaking to each other, they're grabbing words and trying to attach them to pre-downloaded files, right?

453
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,730
They're not really listening.

454
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,950
No, okay, so it's not effective communication, but it's still communication, I'm just saying.

455
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,210
Because they can't rationalize.

456
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,050
And let's go back to the Tower of Babel, when their languages were, their tongues were mixed up.

457
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,570
So what?

458
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,950
I know they didn't have Babelfish Google or whatever.

459
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,030
Well, I don't know they didn't.

460
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,730
I wasn't there.

461
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:28,010
But what, they couldn't develop a sign language in a method of a translating or a bridge?

462
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,170
Of course they could have.

463
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,870
It mixed up their rationale.

464
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,110
Because, you see, they couldn't rationalize anyway other than, right?

465
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:43,630
Right now, if you were in wherever you were, and all of a sudden everyone spoke a complete different language, does that mean the world's gonna end?

466
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,570
You won't be able to get anything done?

467
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,070
Bullshit.

468
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course you can't.

469
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,660
But that's presuming you can be rational about it.

470
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,620
But if you go into a panic, no, you're not.

471
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:55,760
You see?

472
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:12,120
And also, when most people are speaking, they're just thinking about attaching certain words, every other word or whatever, not the articles, you know, or whatever, but, you know, to previous, right?

473
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,500
Like, you know, discussing with an acoustic engineer.

474
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,000
So he's like, yeah, I know what you mean.

475
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,500
And then I try to go back and he really didn't.

476
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,800
Yeah, yeah, okay, fine.

477
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,900
So there's inefficiency across the certain mindset.

478
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,219
Because people can't be rational, right?

479
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,300
It's part of the cosmic censorship.

480
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Look at the, I use Jeremiah as a reference all the time.

481
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,440
When they come to him, they say, we know you're a prophet of Yahweh, we'll do anything you say.

482
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,239
And he tells them, well, don't go to Egypt, don't stay here.

483
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,219
Oh, we don't like that, we don't like what, no, we're gonna do it anyway.

484
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,920
But you know that there's rationality within that irrationality, right?

485
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,900
I don't want to say it's called psychology, you know, put it inside the field itself.

486
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah, there is no chaos.

487
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah, there is no chaos or irrationality.

488
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,280
That's why I use the term cosmic censorship.

489
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:15,920
And, you know, if you're ruled by the adversary and you don't know that, constantly, you know, adjusting like some kind of, you know, ship or plane through the fog.

490
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:24,380
You know, usually you could pilot a ship or a plane, but when there's complete fog and zero visibility, you're relying on instrumentation.

491
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,780
And most people are not relying on the instrumentation of their, you know, the instrumentality of knowledge that's been gained.

492
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,930
They're impulsive, you know.

493
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,510
So language is fine the way it is.

494
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,930
It's the way people are using it.

495
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,690
Like a hammer is a great thing, but you could bash someone's brains in with it.

496
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,550
It's a murder.

497
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,690
By operation of law, a hammer can be a murder weapon.

498
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,350
By operation of law, right?

499
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,810
This is the murder weapon.

500
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,710
He's holding up a hammer in court.

501
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,880
And you're like, no, that's a hammer.

502
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,440
That's for carpenters and other things, you know.

503
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,260
But how did it become a murder weapon all of a sudden?

504
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:16,020
By operation of law, by operation of the rationale, by operation of being led by the adversary, by the operation of cosmic censorship, language is ineffective.

505
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,140
Sure, but at its primary, in its primary functionality, it's meant, it's simply meant to communicate.

506
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,260
It doesn't have values built into it.

507
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,600
You impose the values.

508
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,120
So whether you want to use it accurately, or you want to use it adversarially, that's your business.

509
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:40,460
But the purpose is to communicate, and to open up a range of communicative potentials, right?

510
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:49,700
So having said that, I do understand that in order to formulate things, you would need language to initially be fixed.

511
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,540
Like in order to serve that function, it has to have fixed references, like any objective thing.

512
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,120
It has to have substructure, valid syntax, vocabulary, grammar, clear etymology, literary devices, and so on.

513
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,280
But then there's, of course, nothing to stop you from later on down the line, violating those frameworks and doing whatever you want.

514
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,100
But you could still be communicating effectively, even if you violate the original parameters.

515
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,420
We see that with like pigeon languages that develop in certain...

516
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,280
Or religion, religions, they say, what's your religion based on?

517
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,830
It's based on the Qur'an or whatever, you know, they say that, right?

518
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,310
But is it?

519
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,390
No.

520
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,690
But it's used against people.

521
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,970
Like, for example, have you heard of the the New Order of Barbarians?

522
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:47,330
Dr. Day in 1968 at the Pittsburgh Pediatric Society did a speech to other doctors about the coming world in 1969.

523
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:57,750
He talked about all these things you have now, you know, let's promote homosexuality, and we're gonna call it gay, right?

524
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,090
So, and anyone who's against it is phobic of it, you know, they already planned all that stuff, right?

525
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:10,390
So, or let's, we were gonna have them do this, and he was discussing things that, you know, were not even, you know, in the public eye at all.

526
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:19,390
So, I mean, depends on, you know, there's a level of engineering behind it, you know?

527
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,970
Like, when somebody said, I want a phaser, why?

528
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:30,730
And I'm not gonna, you know, tell them because it's very neat, because I'm gonna use it for landscaping, cut the grass easy, yeah, right, you know, sure.

529
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,530
Right, but anyway.

530
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,170
Let's put aside the cultural aspects, like, just the language for a second.

531
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,250
You can still communicate effectively even if you violate the rules, right?

532
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:58,770
We see that with pidgin languages, we see with mental health victims who create their own way of communicating, we see it with pop culture where everything is dumbed down to sub-Neanderthal levels, and people still speak to each other.

533
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:04,490
Now, you can say that they're not effective or whatever, but things move forward, and people still talk to each other, and, you know.

534
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:14,650
Because they're allowed, they're allowed that level of rationale to continue the society where, for example, at the Tower of Babel, they were not, that rationale was not allowed to continue.

535
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:21,590
So it was not just the languages, the language was enough to stop the rationale.

536
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:23,970
Right.

537
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:33,710
By the way, you know, language will, there's a promise of restoring a more pure language in the future, by the way.

538
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,490
I've come across that, yeah, I haven't thought about it much, but, okay.

539
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,590
But what I'm trying to get to eventually, maybe I should just give the punchline first and stop all this shit.

540
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,390
The Greek won't let me get to the point.

541
00:39:49,890 --> 00:40:03,830
So even though etymology determines the memorialized meaning of a word, we know that usage in context is what determines the social-cultural meaning, or, you know, in real-time conversations, what people think it means.

542
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:15,570
So realistically, you can't pull out single words out of a conversation stream or a text and assume that it has a bounded definition that's self-evident because you know what the etymology is, right?

543
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,470
Well, hold on.

544
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:30,190
Unless you are determined to deal on a level where people mean what they say and say what they mean, I use the analogy to bring up, here's the thing, I'll pat myself on the back, I'm one of the few people in the last decade who's made a big point about that.

545
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:37,370
I'm the only one I've ever heard bring up a lot of these words and it's actually spread and I'm glad to see it, but even though it's not going to help anyone.

546
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,830
When someone says my kids, I'm like, wait a second, you have goats?

547
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,070
I know exactly what they mean, but is this person speaking to me about their kids?

548
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,810
Do they say what they mean and mean what they say?

549
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:59,810
In an accepted reality, on their social level, it does, but from a more objective point of view, it doesn't.

550
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:10,970
So, in other words, this person who's telling me about their kids consistently, using that term, is going to have problems objectifying other things.

551
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,250
That's a pretty good scenario to put them in, to project that on them.

552
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,090
That's what I'm trying to say.

553
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:31,150
So when you find people are not using words properly, it's very clear that they don't say what they mean and mean what they say within an objective point of reality.

554
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,510
So it's about objective, but they're purely, they're totally normal within the society, right?

555
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:49,610
Because you turn on the television, a very popular television network is always using the word kids and this and that, everyone's very, you know, they make billions.

556
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,970
Everybody knows kids means that, you see, but can they objectify?

557
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:03,610
No, they're going to show you paper-thin aluminum planes going through steel towers and everyone's going to believe it.

558
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,750
You see, I mean, this is what one, this is what it leads to.

559
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,630
As a matter of fact, going back to Scripture, isn't it say somewhere if they're not interrupted there will be no life left at all?

560
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,770
So, that's what it's going to lead to.

561
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:30,750
Yeah, you do have to specify who they are, you can't just say that generally, but objectifying means that you're using references to show how something is constituted, right?

562
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,710
By referencing the references and using measurements.

563
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,490
So, are you saying that usage and culture is not a reference point?

564
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:48,750
No, well, it's not for if you're going to jump from one through time or from one culture to another and it doesn't work.

565
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:55,430
Yeah, but language doesn't exist in the other, English doesn't exist in Italy as a language.

566
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,190
Yeah, that's...

567
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,250
Go back a thousand years, there's no English, so you can't, so we're not talking about jumping cultures.

568
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:08,750
We're talking about modern English, it doesn't exist anywhere else outside of the past couple of hundred years.

569
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:25,650
So, words have an etymology, sure, but they also have a position within a phrase which is in a sentence, which is in a paragraph, which is positioned within a contextualized discussion or exposition, and you have to triangulate all of that simultaneously to extract out the meaning of the words as they're being used.

570
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,450
If you take the singular word and only look at the etymology, then you decontextualize it from the social cultural setting.

571
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,130
Right.

572
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,510
So, unless you're saying that the social cultural setting is not a reference, I mean, who said you're allowed to do that?

573
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:48,370
If the purpose of words is to communicate, if the purpose of language is to communicate, who says you're allowed to decontextualize the setting and say, this is the etymology that determines what it means.

574
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:56,810
No, you do it because, you know, when someone, you know why you do that ultimately in this society or any society that you know is going to change?

575
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:09,840
If you live in a house, don't make it out of glass, because, you know, what you're basically doing is throwing rock at the window when you do that.

576
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,020
And is it, you know, when a rock is thrown through a window, is it deserved?

577
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,520
Well, sometimes it might be, right?

578
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah, basically throwing rocks.

579
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,900
Is it correct?

580
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,240
Yeah, it's correct.

581
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,320
Is it, is it incorrect if it, you know, takes it out of context?

582
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:43,260
No, but if it's a society, if these people are idiots and they're not going to get, you know, anything done anyway, why the hell not?

583
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,280
I mean, you can't use that sort of rhetoric to rationalize the situation, because you can't tell people that they're idiots.

584
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,980
Sure, I do all the time.

585
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,660
I was having a conversation a couple of times, I bring this up, George Carlin, the comedian, right?

586
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:10,100
He'll, he'll have an American audience, he'll spend a half an hour saying how stupid Americans are, and I'm talking about deep cutting comments.

587
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,820
And there and he has a result in deafening applause.

588
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:15,960
Right?

589
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,380
But that's okay, because it's just comedy.

590
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,820
But if you look at him on stage, he's deftly serious, you know, he's not joking.

591
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,940
But the setting is a come, you know, comedic stand up.

592
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,620
So I guess it's just hits home so much, right?

593
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,800
But if you stand up in a courtroom or in public in a series that they'll cut you to pieces if you say the same stuff.

594
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,960
So I guess the context in which it's being done is important.

595
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,560
Also, you know, or the venue, right?

596
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:46,720
Mm-hmm.

597
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,280
Yeah, so context can be objectified as well.

598
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:51,680
Right.

599
00:45:51,720 --> 00:46:02,240
That's why the best way to get a point across is through show business, cause, you know, comedy or movies, you know, how many times have we even discussed, you know, maybe they're showing you how they're showing you stuff in movies, right?

600
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,140
That's going to happen.

601
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,420
So context is valid with what you're saying, as far as communicating in different forms.

602
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:20,420
Why is context not equally valid when it comes to language in the sense that the con, like, I'm not, I'm not trying to, I'm not somebody's lawyer and I'm trying to defend them.

603
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:29,020
But if people are using the word kid in a certain context and the context explains how that word functions in that setting, why is that not valid?

604
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,000
Why then say, well, it doesn't mean what you're using it for.

605
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,560
Yeah, but in the context, it does though.

606
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah, it's valid when you establish if you were to contextualize or memorialize that event, you know, or, you know, let's say you were to do a transcript of that conversation for memorial purposes, put it away so it could be retrieved later, right?

607
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:51,640
You know what I mean?

608
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,920
The summary would be, well, here, I'm having a conversation with a moron and this is the words that he's using.

609
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,280
These are the words, no really.

610
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,420
Okay, forget it.

611
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,360
No, no, why?

612
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:07,880
It's true.

613
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,430
No, this is just, this is just pejorative soft realism.

614
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,130
Like I don't, the fact that morons is neither here nor there.

615
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,710
We're talking about the language.

616
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,150
Look, attorneys do this all the time.

617
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,490
Give you an example.

618
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,370
If you go to any government office anywhere in the world and start bringing up, I want to speak to the attorney here, works in the government, right?

619
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,130
Why you guys are doing this?

620
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,230
They don't answer anything you're saying.

621
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,030
They say, you keep going because you're going to go to jail.

622
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,950
That's what they always say.

623
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,690
They don't want to address anything that you're saying.

624
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,630
What the hell, what they're basically telling you is you're just an underling scumbag.

625
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,570
We control everything.

626
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,010
Get the fuck out of here.

627
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,670
Right?

628
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,670
So, I mean, you know, um.

629
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,730
It's just that when you try to, when you try to tell people.

630
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,610
When I call, when I tell people, call people morons, I'm not using that as a put down.

631
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,850
I'm using it as an accurate statement.

632
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,130
It's actually a much higher, it's much higher than what they really should be called.

633
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,470
But that's another discussion.

634
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,290
No, it's a put down.

635
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,630
Even though, even if it's accurate, it's still a put down because most people don't understand what you're saying.

636
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,610
That's their problem.

637
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,610
I just don't want their problem to be my problem, right?

638
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:25,390
Okay.

639
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,770
But the point is, I forget the point because I'm getting tired.

640
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:30,950
No, that's fine.

641
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:40,810
But look, this, when I, very often when I speak, it's not within a culture of a specific geographic location.

642
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,750
No, what I was going to say is.

643
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,010
I speak on a worldly level.

644
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,530
I'm trying to be more worldly.

645
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:54,710
In other words, when I say moron, I'm applying it to Iraqis, Russians, Colombians, Canadians, Americans, Spanish, Italians, Greeks, all of them.

646
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,070
Sure.

647
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,310
You know, Libyans.

648
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:05,710
But the thing is, you run into people and you try to explain this, the language stuff and they always fall back on social cultural usage.

649
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,210
And you have to negate that if you want to move forward with the etymology understanding.

650
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:11,690
Right.

651
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,950
So speak a more worldly, worldly, speak in a worldly sense.

652
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:23,590
Why don't you give analogies and metaphors and things that affect the whole world?

653
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:34,390
Very often I say, what if we visit a planet where Kevlar underwear is the biggest industry because they have a tradition and custom across the planet to put thumbtacks on their seats before they sit down.

654
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,490
I didn't say one country.

655
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,660
When I say surface dwelling earth inhabitants, is that one culture or the you say, no, it's worldly.

656
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,820
It's the entire group.

657
00:49:51,360 --> 00:50:03,560
There's implications when you go from culture to culture, even, you know, you'll see inconsistencies in etiquette and tradition that might make someone seem vile from one culture to another.

658
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:13,980
Like if you go to certain Arabic countries, if you sit down and cross your leg and show the bottom of your shoe, the bottom of your foot, that's like the middle finger in a Western country.

659
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:34,770
Or if you run into like someone from the Ukraine, let's say this is, I'll give you an experience, someone moving, a Ukrainian woman engineer, she needed some help moving and all these Americans went over to help her and she wanted things stacked and moved a certain way.

660
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:39,870
She had them labeled in, you know, Russian basically and they couldn't read if it was dishes or whatever, right?

661
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,730
So I said, well, how did it go?

662
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:51,390
And she goes, yeah, they're all strong like bull, but smarter like gorillas, right?

663
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,510
Well, because they couldn't read in, you know, Russian.

664
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,430
Yeah, pretty stupid, right?

665
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:03,590
To her.

666
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,710
You get my point?

667
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,610
Yeah, that's less of a cultural thing, more of a social thing.

668
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,670
Obviously, dishes don't, you know, they go a certain way.

669
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,010
She labeled everything, all the boxes in Russian and, like characters.

670
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,970
No, well, she was expecting to move it all on her own and she needed some help.

671
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:28,510
We went to help her and she's yelling at everyone about where the boxes, how the boxes are being stacked.

672
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,890
Can't you see this is dishes?

673
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,770
And we're like, that's just scribble to me.

674
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:35,810
You see?

675
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:45,050
So there's your language, there's your perception, there's your worldly, you know, I wasn't there.

676
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,550
If I was there, I'd say, what is all your breakable stuff?

677
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,790
Put it aside, you know.

678
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,410
First, what is breakable?

679
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,170
Because I've experienced with moving, right?

680
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,490
If it's not breakable, it's less of a, right?

681
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,590
So ask questions first, right?

682
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,630
Not later, you know.

683
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:05,350
Yeah.

684
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:15,790
So she considered everyone to be smart like gorilla because they couldn't read that she wrote dishes and, right.

685
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,190
When she would, that was the truth, wasn't it?

686
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:19,610
No.

687
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:20,690
Yes.

688
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,390
Yeah.

689
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:21,890
No.

690
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:35,630
They're supposed, if you're going to go help someone who writes in Russian, you better know how the Russians label, you know, they, what they should have said is we, you know, we don't know what's, you know, what's, can you please, they should have anyway.

691
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,070
Oh, they should have.

692
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,530
Okay.

693
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:37,950
Yeah.

694
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,870
We don't know what, you know, why are you, oh, I'm sorry.

695
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,390
You know what?

696
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,190
The help should have.

697
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,490
Oh, the help should have.

698
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:42,770
Yeah.

699
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,430
All, but look, you know what that means?

700
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,030
Well, neither one should have, and they all should have, but it's called working.

701
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,390
It's called working together.

702
00:52:52,090 --> 00:53:01,440
You get into a situation where everybody has to work together is the best situation, right?

703
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,840
So you walk into a room and you know, you're moving stuff and you don't recognize the labeling.

704
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,800
The reason there's a label is to communicate.

705
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,440
So in other words, you're walking into a situation where you won't be able to communicate.

706
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,020
How about resolving that first?

707
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,540
Goes back to your language.

708
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,600
Communication is very important.

709
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,660
Now I could read that language, but I don't know what it means.

710
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:42,040
Just like, you know, if you don't know, let's say Italian, you could read, if you know Roman letters or English, you can read the Italian newspaper, but you don't know what it's, you know, what it means.

711
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,440
But these guys could look like foreign symbols to them completely.

712
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,700
You know, they didn't understand the Cyrillic characters.

713
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,040
And so there's two levels there removed.

714
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,520
That's why I'm saying that most people are sounding words without comprehension.

715
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,480
They can read.

716
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,980
I mean, at times you heard me say they're functionally literate, illiterate.

717
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:16,350
I don't know what these words mean, but ultimately it breaks down to rationale.

718
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,650
It can't be rational either.

719
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,410
How can they?

720
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:29,590
They were not raised to, you know, the culture doesn't promote it, promotes the opposite.

721
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:46,740
You know how it does that by, well, I shouldn't say confusion alone, but because you have so many choices that you can't make any more choices.

722
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,540
But conveniently, when you want to make a choice, because there's so many choices, it's very easy to, and I'm telling you, you have no choice.

723
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,240
There are no choices.

724
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,460
It's an illusion of choice.

725
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,990
Oh, well, we're all doomed then.

726
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:07,790
No, you're not doomed.

727
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:13,110
Well, if you believe what the adversary has set up, yes, you're doomed.

728
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:20,850
That's where the doom lies, because doom is a realization of an unfortunate ending that was not expected.

729
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,390
If it was expected, it's not, you know, it's a tragedy.

730
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,850
You know, you knew it was going to happen anyway, so.

731
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,710
No, I'm just joking.

732
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:38,610
That's why I say, you know, if the bad news is you've got 14 years left and you know what the good news is, you've got 14 years left.

733
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,720
Anywho, we can wrap up or we can attack one more thing.

734
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,420
Yeah, so it's up to Bruce and if we're, are we still streaming?

735
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,000
Yep, we're doing fine.

736
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,640
That's fine.

737
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,460
I have coffee and cigarettes and I plugged in a power supply.

738
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,060
If you're tired, we can stop or if you want to do one more thing, that's fine.

739
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:17,970
You there?

740
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,190
Let's see.

741
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,110
Should be.

742
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:20,890
Bruce, can you hear me?

743
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,310
Yeah, I can hear you fine.

744
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,890
Oh, you're breaking up the same towards me.

745
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,890
Does Bruce sound like he's duplexing or break intermittent?

746
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,830
I'm definitely breaking up.

747
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:34,390
Yeah.

748
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,610
Hello?

749
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,050
Yeah, go ahead.

750
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,950
I was gone or did, was I not?

751
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:42,790
I don't know.

752
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:46,450
No, you were gone and Bruce is breaking up and am I coming through clearly?

753
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,110
I can hear you, you know.

754
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,590
You just messaged, I can't hear anything.

755
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,410
Oh, but now I can hear you.

756
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:55,950
What was the other thing?

757
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,410
Uh-huh.

758
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,230
What was it?

759
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,590
Do you want to do one more thing you said?

760
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,010
Oh, the other thing.

761
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:10,510
Well, that was sort of the idea of natural, sort of the natural rights fallacy that comes along in the enlightenment period.

762
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:26,050
So despite the encroachment of certain Eastern religions and the philosophical influences of that in the 19th and 20th century, Western civilization has predominantly been shaped by two pillars of tradition, which is the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman.

763
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,750
And that saturates everything from tradition to culture to laws.

764
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:44,470
So to narrow in on that, over the past 400 years or so, movements like the Reformation, the Enlightenment have produced a consensus of morality that's predicated on certain presuppositions that have organized society.

765
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:56,330
And part of that is, obviously it's not in the Bible or in scripture, but it's something like the divine, that there's something divine or sacred in all human beings.

766
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:02,390
And that's a presupposition that's embedded in the legal society, in the idea of natural rights.

767
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:11,430
And basically the result of that idea of natural rights is that society claims to value the individual above everything else.

768
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,170
So it puts sovereignty in the hands of the individual.

769
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,070
That's what the adversary teaches.

770
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,990
There is nothing sacred in the individual.

771
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,390
But go ahead.

772
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:19,910
Right.

773
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:30,210
So like I'm looking at the Enlightenment period, and you see that pop up a lot with people like John Locke and Jacques Rousseau, and stuff like this.

774
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,390
And this is where the Patriot movement gets there.

775
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,490
The individual is sovereign and this sovereign blah, blah, blah.

776
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:36,710
Right.

777
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,270
They're idiots.

778
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:37,610
Yeah.

779
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,450
They're full of hate and stupidity.

780
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,450
The Patriots, the minute you see that.

781
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:42,750
Yeah.

782
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:55,890
But in addition to that, the Enlightenment stuff, since the 60s counterculture revolution, people have been further indoctrinated into the idea that their lives center around freedoms and rights.

783
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:02,630
And through a ramp up in consumerism and Buddhist philosophies and stuff like that, it's really gone kind of far.

784
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,470
The Buddhist religion, not the Buddhist writings.

785
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:05,810
Yeah.

786
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,710
Which is like Christianity versus the Bible.

787
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,010
Buddhist religion has nothing to do with the Buddhist writings.

788
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,810
They're a bunch of assholes, the Buddhists.

789
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:14,990
But go ahead.

790
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:20,470
So in general, I'm just trying to examine ways of discrediting that in a rational way.

791
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:25,990
Like, even if I didn't, if you don't get to mention scripture once, because you're talking to somebody that doesn't know it.

792
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:31,550
Is there like a Greek speak way of just approaching that I'm trying to find?

793
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:39,330
Regarding speaking regarding from a platform to someone without referencing it?

794
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:39,570
Sure.

795
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,290
I do it all the time.

796
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,870
Yeah, in trying to...

797
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:44,790
How can you not?

798
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:51,950
If you comprehend scripture and meditate on it, everything, it will change the way you speak.

799
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,590
Yeah, that's fine.

800
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:56,690
But I mean, talking to a Mormon.

801
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,450
Don't say we don't talk to Mormons, because we do.

802
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,330
But I mean, it's impossible not to.

803
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,070
Unless you're by yourself.

804
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,110
So if you sort of wanted to explain that how there are no such thing as natural rights.

805
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,670
Oh, I see what you're saying, discredit that fallacy.

806
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,410
Yeah, I want to discredit the whole notion.

807
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:28,770
Well, before you get into, well, if you want to discuss natural rights, so basically, if you can define nature, if you can define rights, you know, I mean, but then again, that might sound like you're being, you know, sidestepping the issue.

808
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,410
You know, natural rights is very simple.

809
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:40,430
You could say, if we go out to that pond over here and take out some water, look under a microscope, you're going to see all the organisms are fighting each other.

810
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:50,210
If you look in the jungle, you know, one, the larger animal eats the smaller animal, usually, and the smaller animal learns instinctively to avoid the larger animals.

811
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:52,330
Right.

812
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,650
So yeah, no, there's still order there.

813
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:21,370
If a person is hooked on natural rights, if you there's two ways to do it, you know, when I have time with a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or a Buddhist, if I have a lot of time and I know I'm going to dedicate time, I tend to seem agreeable and let them tell me as much as they can about what they know about what they believe in.

814
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:23,210
Right.

815
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:36,470
And instead of saying, well, that's stupid or that's whatever, I start, you know, working in to see, you know, how much they really can back it up with the rationale that they've been taught from other areas as well.

816
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:45,710
To give you an example, a negative way of doing this is when I discuss with people regarding how the body works, I don't want to hear them say, are you a doctor?

817
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,830
Oh, you're not a doctor, so you're not qualified to tell me how the body works.

818
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,410
Then I say, are you a doctor?

819
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,710
And they usually say, well, I don't know anything about the human body.

820
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:56,850
I'm not a doctor.

821
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:04,530
And then, right, then you have to walk away because then, you know, they cannot, they lack the rationale.

822
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:10,430
They, you see, it's like going to a headhunter and ask him, are you upset that you have five shrunken heads?

823
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,150
And if he says, yes, because my brother has 20.

824
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,990
And then how do you deal with that?

825
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,520
You know, how do you begin to inform them?

826
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,880
Because there's no way you're going to have a conversation with him on his level.

827
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:29,000
So if they're going for natural rights, one thing, you know, it depends on the individual again.

828
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,960
Like the word nature means God in ancient Egypt.

829
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,240
So God, right, and the gods don't give rights, they give laws.

830
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,100
I would say maybe there are more laws than rights.

831
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,160
Like the laws of nature, maybe.

832
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,500
Yeah, but we can't maybe our way through it.

833
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,560
And frankly, ancient Egyptian language is not the end-all be-all for etymology.

834
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,840
So you can't keep saying that.

835
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:58,300
No, but the reason I say it is because it may be it's a good way to stick a crowbar in that loose piece of plywood and get it off.

836
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,180
So you can put a fresh piece of plywood on it.

837
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,040
But it is true, by the way, the niters.

838
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,980
It's not even nature, it's niter.

839
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,160
Yeah, in ancient Egyptian.

840
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,240
N-T-R, it's constant, there's no vowels.

841
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,040
It's N-T-R, if you were to really spell it out.

842
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:24,700
But I would just suggest that it's sometimes better instead of doing one-on-one, do it in a group setting.

843
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:33,880
But if you're, okay, if someone is in a natural law or natural rights, natural rights is really, that's almost like an oxymoron.

844
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,640
I think that there is no pat, simple answer.

845
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,160
I think a lot of it takes work.

846
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,080
And essentially, this might sound superstitious or supernatural.

847
01:03:49,700 --> 01:04:07,080
But if you have a keen observation of humanity, you're going to have to be inclusive of the cosmic censorship and be able to discern and recognize who the gods want to see this and who they don't want to see it.

848
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:16,200
And that means making very rapid, swift judgments that you don't etch in stone, but you hold as a reference point.

849
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:17,820
Right?

850
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:22,960
So.

851
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,280
Yeah, right.

852
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:25,860
It's simple.

853
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,680
I mean, what part of cosmic censorship don't you get?

854
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,440
If the gods don't want someone to see something, you can torture them to death, they still won't.

855
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,320
That has nothing to do with it.

856
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:52,460
I'm trying to, it's about a certain type of rationale that can be used to explain something in a way that the only way to oppose it is to be arbitrary and to just deny what somebody is saying.

857
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,580
It depends.

858
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:01,120
Again, Sam, this is not being whatever, but you're trying to bring, you said, rationale to the irrational.

859
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,480
And that's valid to say that.

860
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,820
How do you bring rationale to the irrational?

861
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,000
You're saying it like it can't be done.

862
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,940
Of course it can be done.

863
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:17,920
No, I didn't say that can't be done, because if you discern those that can accept it, from a cosmic point of view or spiritual point of view, then it can be done.

864
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,360
You know, very often, I'll give you an example.

865
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm out at the shops, and you'll have a big store, you know, a food store, and they'll set up these demonstration tables.

866
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,340
You might have seen it, you know, where they're giving samples of products.

867
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,740
And if I, you know, if I have time, I'll stand there and start doing Greek speak.

868
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,400
And before you know it, there's five, six, seven, eight people all crowded around.

869
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,420
They're not interested in Sam, they're interested in what I'm saying.

870
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,340
Right?

871
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,880
And some of them are not, some of them are, but some of them get really excited about it.

872
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,160
And they're like, oh, how do I get in touch with you?

873
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:53,640
This is great.

874
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,720
You need to write a book, blah, blah, blah.

875
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,680
I said, okay, are you going to email me?

876
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,480
Here's the email.

877
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,780
And I said, when do you think you're going to email me?

878
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,580
Oh, in about an hour.

879
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,100
Guess what?

880
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,100
They never do.

881
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,200
So there's that level also.

882
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:13,500
What I mean is, you might have a conversation and have a breakthrough moment, and you can get past the natural rights and evolve.

883
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,240
And then, then so what?

884
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,740
They might say, well, good Sam, I want to stay in touch with you.

885
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,160
And they do.

886
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,240
Or they might say, Sam, I'm going to be in touch with you.

887
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:21,960
And they never do.

888
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,960
Are you going to be attached to that?

889
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:25,200
No.

890
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,420
Nobody's attached to that.

891
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,180
So the thing is, all right, well, no one is or no one isn't.

892
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,320
But this is irrelevant.

893
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,140
What I'm saying is, you do what you do.

894
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,380
And if it happens, it happens.

895
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,560
It's like panning for gold.

896
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,240
No, no, no, no, no.

897
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,060
You have to do what you do in a certain way.

898
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,800
You have to do what you do.

899
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,680
I don't want to say effectively, because it's not about the outcome per se.

900
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,560
Because like you said, they can go either way.

901
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,360
But you have to do it in a methodological way.

902
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,620
I'm not saying that right.

903
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:57,900
Methodology.

904
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,600
You have to have a methodology that is valid in the way that you do things.

905
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:06,920
You can't just say, I went out and I talked to people and it didn't work.

906
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,440
Well, maybe it didn't work because you suck.

907
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,540
And you don't know how to communicate.

908
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,820
And you didn't pick the right words.

909
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,580
And you're not eloquent.

910
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,640
You don't have any charisma.

911
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,080
And you were impatient.

912
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,340
Like that's your problem.

913
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,540
As long as I hit all my...

914
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,540
It could be a personal problem.

915
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,780
Like maybe you don't want your self-development to be along those lines.

916
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,400
It could be a temporal problem.

917
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,820
Like it's not time yet.

918
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,820
But for you to be able to learn how to communicate...

919
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,720
Not for you, for anyone.

920
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,680
Like the steam engine was around 2,000 years ago.

921
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,220
But Fulton was the one that made it in industry.

922
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,160
What?

923
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:41,940
Something new?

924
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,360
Light bulbs were around 300 years ago.

925
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,480
Electricity was around 300, 400 years ago.

926
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,440
500 years ago, 1,000 years ago.

927
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,400
But we have electrified cities.

928
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,600
It wasn't time yet for that.

929
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,800
No, but there were people who knew how those things worked.

930
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,640
And they used it for their own personal gain.

931
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
So kudos to them.

932
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,000
The society, the fact that they didn't have it is their problem.

933
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,160
So I'm talking about you need to learn how to communicate for your own personal gain.

934
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,500
As a point of self-development for yourself.

935
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,160
Personal gain would go in...

936
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,240
If you keep pushing the issue of personal gain, for example, you go into the commercial realm.

937
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:16,359
Now it's about doing commerce.

938
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,520
Who says you have to do that?

939
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,779
Well, no, if you push the realm of personal gain in this society, it's commercial.

940
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,439
No, you might just want to power your house or whatever.

941
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,340
That's your thing.

942
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,640
You don't have to push it.

943
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:35,020
But how are you going to power your house without getting wire and all the other necessities?

944
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,960
Are you going to make it yourself?

945
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:36,740
That's fine too.

946
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,939
But by the time you make a generator from scratch, you'll be so old, you won't need it anymore.

947
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,100
Well, but it's not about setting up an enterprise to sell stuff to anybody.

948
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:56,300
No, but acquiring it, you're going to have to find, you know, depending on the level of...

949
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,740
What level of convenience are you willing to accept or not accept?

950
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:08,359
Like, for example, if you lived in, let's say, 100 years ago on the Polynesian islands, your level of convenience would be a straw hut, and that's fine, right?

951
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:10,899
Sure.

952
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,140
So what level of convenience...

953
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,939
You know, this is another example.

954
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,439
A lot of people say, I want to live off the grid.

955
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:17,960
I'm like, why?

956
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,640
It's going to cost a hell of a lot more than being on the grid.

957
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:24,340
And anyone who's ever proven that out found it to be true.

958
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,779
Electricity costs three to five times as much than being on the grid.

959
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:30,939
Well, I don't want to be a part of the system.

960
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,540
What if it closes?

961
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,920
Well, it's super cheap to, you know...

962
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,399
I wouldn't, I can't...

963
01:09:45,399 --> 01:10:00,840
The point is, from a heuristic point of view, which is, you know, quick problem solving, for example, you don't have to have a problem to solve it.

964
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,460
In other words, there's a mindset behind that, right?

965
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:10,500
But the problem sure helps, you know, the mindset exercise that problem-solving ability, right?

966
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,500
You see?

967
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,940
You know, like creativity.

968
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,060
What does a crisis create?

969
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,600
You know, problems create creativity, you know?

970
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,100
And also the concept of accidents, you know?

971
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:30,120
Most of the people that I've met that are inventors with patents and things like that, their inventions are not stuff they ponder.

972
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,500
They're things they discovered by accident or through failure.

973
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,480
So when you bring up, you know, how do you communicate this or how do you do this?

974
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,660
Why don't you try and come back and report how effective it was?

975
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,400
If it wasn't effective, tell us it wasn't effective.

976
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:51,560
So now we know as a step on the ladder that, you know, that's a step on the ladder that we need to keep walking on.

977
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,680
Don't dwell on it, right?

978
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,140
That's why very often is, but how does this work?

979
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:57,700
Or should I do this?

980
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,260
I don't know what to do and report back.

981
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,120
But it has to be consistent.

982
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:10,340
If you're engaging with people on how to do this or how not to do it or what if, if they don't report back, where's the accumulation?

983
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,200
Where's the evolution of the matter?

984
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:12,960
There is none.

985
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:18,320
So it goes back to communication, reliability, proximity.

986
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,920
If someone says, well, you know, I don't know what it's like to do this.

987
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,300
And you say, I don't know either.

988
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,540
Are you willing to try?

989
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,440
Yeah, I'm willing to try it.

990
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,340
Well, when you do try it, let us know how it worked out.

991
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,160
If they never come back, it's as if that conversation never happened, right?

992
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:36,950
Even though they did it, you have to come back and report.

993
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:44,390
You know, once that is established as, you know, see, that's another thing that's going on, you know.

994
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,490
That's part of the censorship, by the way.

995
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,230
We, again, back to scripture.

996
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:58,670
You know, we read about the end time scenarios, you know, Antichrist, all these macinations, all these events.

997
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:02,890
I'm telling you, when these things start unfolding, they're going to be a secret.

998
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:08,310
You see the rationale behind that, I hope.

999
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:16,790
Because if they're happening and everyone has access to exactly how they're going to happen and when, they're all going to shout foul, aren't they?

1000
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:20,590
But the scripture says they're not going to shout foul.

1001
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,990
That means that they're not going to know.

1002
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:27,850
Just like when the Christ came to earth, how many people knew who he was, even when he was standing in the room with them?

1003
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,270
Not unless he allowed them to.

1004
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,730
Spiritually, mentally, you know, from a cosmic or divine level, right?

1005
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:45,970
When he opened the scroll in the synagogue, let's say, the study hall, I call it, was he acknowledged as the Christ?

1006
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,950
Or just some guy with a bunch of followers who was popular that they got really pissed off at?

1007
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,310
The latter, you see?

1008
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:02,610
So, this is a very interesting...

1009
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:04,210
Here's another thing to recall.

1010
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:10,630
Once you see that something works, don't be so, don't just stick with it because you're stubborn.

1011
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,090
Keep, and don't be happy with because you found out how it works.

1012
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:20,550
Keep investigating it so you get the fine points also, so you can make corrections where needed, right?

1013
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:33,670
That's why very often, you know, like for example, I did the thing with Ocelli and very often I bring up, you know, things from the past that I know are going to happen again and again.

1014
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:38,450
Just not to say that, look what I did, but because you can do it too, and this is what's being used.

1015
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:56,230
I remember in 2015 with Ocelli, I was saying, the spring of 2018 is when you're going to see movements in the Middle East that are going to be for sure, you're going to see the transition of change, and for sure, it's going to be the precursor to the Middle East Union, you know, like you're going to watch what's happening in Israel.

1016
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,010
And Ocelli comes up, says, I think it's 2017, not 2018.

1017
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,110
And I'm like, well, why?

1018
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,230
What are you basing it on?

1019
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,730
He's like, well, no, I just think it's 2017.

1020
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:10,930
And I'm like, no, it's 2018 because the seven-year period ends in the fall of 2017.

1021
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:14,570
In the spring, there's going to be, you see, planting and then growth, right?

1022
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,810
And there's going to be, was I correct?

1023
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,230
Yeah, I was correct.

1024
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,170
Is it my just like, oh, great, I'm glad I'm correct this time.

1025
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:26,790
And I, you know, no, because I can give you all the reasons why, you see.

1026
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:39,190
So again, when you interact with people about natural, right, or natural, are you prepared to give them all the reasons why they, you know, from their point or another point, you see?

1027
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:46,690
And once you understand the details and the fine points of all of it, there's nothing to, you know, it'll work out or it won't.

1028
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:49,510
But you know that you don't have a deficit, right?

1029
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:52,210
You know, it's not like shooting dice.

1030
01:14:52,910 --> 01:15:00,750
Yeah, that's part of it is trying to overcome the deficit or trying to fill that to a point of surplus.

1031
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,590
Which is still a process.

1032
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,470
I mean, I can do it partially, but very definitively.

1033
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:14,030
A very simple thing is, you know, do the animals have a problem with natural law?

1034
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:23,850
No, because no one's really had a conversation with a bear, you know, or a dog or a cat or whatever about natural law specifically.

1035
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,720
So maybe is it natural law as it applies to man?

1036
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,740
And why are there so many different types of law?

1037
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:38,780
But you know, even though there's an appearance of so many choices, you really there is no choice, right?

1038
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:50,140
So, you know what it boils down to eventually?

1039
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,500
This is all of its entertainment.

1040
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,280
How do you keep a society multiple?

1041
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:02,080
Honestly, society is in plural preoccupied for 6,000 years because the society is not important.

1042
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
It's the 6,000 years that's important, right?

1043
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,260
To pass.

1044
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:13,040
So you have to make sure they have fire and they have genitalia because without those two, they're not going to be around.

1045
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,330
That's it.

1046
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,350
Pretty simple plan.

1047
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,990
And then the rest is entertainment.

1048
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:20,130
What?

1049
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,250
You don't think the world religions are entertainment?

1050
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,690
Of course it is.

1051
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:33,090
Do you think there is ever entertainment where people were thrown to the lions or munched up in machines and killed for no reason?

1052
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:34,270
Sure.

1053
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:38,410
Is it possible to have entertainment where people lose their lives?

1054
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:39,590
Sure.

1055
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:44,210
You ever heard of something called the theater of war?

1056
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,340
Right?

1057
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,300
Yeah, it's all entertainment.

1058
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,920
The gods have no qualms in wiping out billions of people.

1059
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,940
They don't care about your body.

1060
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,460
Not because I say so.

1061
01:16:58,900 --> 01:16:59,860
It's because they say so.

1062
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,550
So, you know.

1063
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:08,270
It's harsh.

1064
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,990
It's harsh because you have a body.

1065
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,050
Physical body.

1066
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,530
That you can't shed, you know, at will.

1067
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,310
Or dematerialize and appear somewhere else if you wanted to keep the body.

1068
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,110
That's why, you know, years ago, I used to run into a born-again Christian.

1069
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,290
I remember a conversation.

1070
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:31,870
I won't forget.

1071
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:32,550
He's in the parking lot.

1072
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,290
Well, I'm born again.

1073
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,250
I don't have to believe in what you're talking about.

1074
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,490
I'm like, oh, you're really born again?

1075
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,350
Is there a parking lot across the street?

1076
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,890
Can you just show up right there right now?

1077
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,710
But don't move from here.

1078
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,550
Just, I want to see you in that parking lot across the street.

1079
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,190
Can you do that?

1080
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,510
Yeah, I'll be right.

1081
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:45,970
I'm going to walk.

1082
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:46,510
No, no, no, no.

1083
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:50,950
Just go ahead and, you know, you're born again, right?

1084
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,350
Okay.

1085
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,550
You're a resurrected being.

1086
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:52,990
So go ahead.

1087
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:54,710
Let's see you show up across.

1088
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,930
Just one demonstration.

1089
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,530
You see how stupid these people are?

1090
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,770
Yes, that is already evident.

1091
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,830
Yeah, yeah.

1092
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:09,550
So if you're born, you can do that, right?

1093
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,530
So anyway, this is, yeah.

1094
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,070
So is it entertaining?

1095
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:17,770
No, but yes, it's bad entertainment.

1096
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,390
Is there such thing as bad entertainment?

1097
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,250
That's a really big one.

1098
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,510
We still, I make a joke.

1099
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:28,150
I was trying to make a joke.

1100
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,290
Like we have this thing called Chick-fil-A here.

1101
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,690
It's a thing like Hobby Lobby is another one.

1102
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,050
They pride themselves as being closed on Sunday for worship, right?

1103
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,090
And it's a chicken.

1104
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:41,430
They serve chicken and I always joke around.

1105
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:43,390
That's the born again chicken sandwiches, right?

1106
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:46,670
You know, we're the born again hobbies or whatever.

1107
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,130
You've heard of Chick-fil-A?

1108
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:49,550
Not to mention.

1109
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:52,450
Yeah, I call them the born again chicken sandwiches.

1110
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,450
I love that.

1111
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:54,950
Yeah, yeah.

1112
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:55,650
These are idiots.

1113
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:56,830
I mean, these are, you know.

1114
01:18:57,570 --> 01:19:00,030
I mentioned that to a Christian one time.

1115
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,470
That was probably a rather uneasy moment.

1116
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,430
Oh boy.

1117
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,430
And everything is uneasy with them.

1118
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,550
You have to be more honest.

1119
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,250
I just couldn't help it.

1120
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,870
Yeah, I mean, Satan's laughing his ass off at these people, you know.

1121
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,510
He's laughing his ass off at us right now, I'm sure.

1122
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,990
I don't think he cares enough to be listening to this.

1123
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:26,450
But, you know, I'm sure that everything is being observed.

1124
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:29,110
And taken into account.

1125
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,810
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:32,870
Yeah.

1127
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,110
Yeah, I'd say the depths, what is it?

1128
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,290
The depths is immeasurable.

1129
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:45,750
Because look, what we see as being unattainable or infinite is very finite.

1130
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,910
Once you, you know, you're not bound to this material realm, so.

1131
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,140
I think I'm good for this one.

1132
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,200
Yeah, this one.

1133
01:19:59,400 --> 01:19:59,880
Yeah, sure.

1134
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:01,980
Okay, thanks.

1135
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,680
We haven't done this in a while.

1136
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,080
Thank you, Sam and Greek.

1137
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,420
Okay.

1138
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,920
Beautifully articulated by both of you.

1139
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,280
A lot of Greek information.

1140
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,960
Greek just spent the whole time just shooting my stuff down.

1141
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,600
That's funny.

1142
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
We're shooting it up.

1143
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,440
No, no, I think interjecting is fine.

1144
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,000
It's a, you know, why not?

1145
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,180
It adds dynamics, right?

1146
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,020
It does.

1147
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,820
I could sit back and be quiet and listen.

1148
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,340
But I think interrupting might be good, too.

1149
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,140
Interrupting is fine.

1150
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,120
We just want answers.

1151
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,360
This is all I'm saying.

1152
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,180
Yeah, well.

1153
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,260
Maybe I have to think about it a bit more.

1154
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,620
Yeah, yeah, think about it.

1155
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,740
Yeah, I think when it sinks in, you're just going to, you know, wonder why bother.

1156
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,440
I'm telling you, food, clothing, and shelter, man.

1157
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:04,080
If you don't know that now, eventually, you know, food, clothing, and shelter, and good conversation.

1158
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,660
Fire and genitalia.

1159
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:11,640
Yeah.

1160
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,240
Without fire and without genitalia, there's no human race.

1161
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,420
Yeah, you're done.

1162
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,480
As it is.

1163
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,300
Yeah, you're done.

1164
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,420
No fire, you've got nothing.

1165
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,240
No genitalia, it all stops.

1166
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,540
Okay, so simple.

1167
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,340
There's your answers.

1168
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,320
Thank you, Greg.

1169
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,560
Yeah, you're welcome.

1170
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,260
Carbon as usual.

1171
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:34,940
Thank you, Sam.

1172
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,520
You'll get over it.

1173
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,460
All right, guys.

1174
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,140
Yep.

1175
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:38,720
Thanks again.

1176
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,560
All right, later.

1177
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:40,440
See you all, guys.
