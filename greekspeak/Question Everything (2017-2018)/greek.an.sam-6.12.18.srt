1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,180
We're popping in right now and we're on Okay, great.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,540
All right, so we're on with Sam and Bruce, right?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:20,120
Yeah And I'm making coffee and doing laundry and all this other stuff as this happens to be a conversation that we're streaming for the I Wouldn't say benefit or could be benefit or demise of others, right?

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,180
Right depending on how they view Whatever is being here or heard by them That's funny.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,720
Can you see sound that sounds like an acid trip, right?

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,940
right The the aspect of Sam asked, you know want to ask that question again this Sam What are we gonna?

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,860
What do you want to talk about?

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,080
Right?

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,880
Do you remember that?

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,500
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,780
Yeah Yeah.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:51,380
Well, how about things that people don't notice in their everyday lives whether everyday commutes or their everyday Travels or their everyday whatever they do You know what?

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,980
I mean, whatever.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,120
I mean, whatever right?

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,500
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,060
So but the thing is doesn't that sound kind of paradox or goal to say?

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,080
Let's talk about things.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,120
You don't notice Yeah, I could seem that way but Obviously an outsider can comment on what he sees other people not noticing.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm guessing that well, that's what we're gonna do Mm-hmm like I wanted to just bring up like I was gonna I was started to for a moment is There's a YouTube channel called seven second riddles.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:48,460
It's not very good I actually don't endorse it or even recommend it but it has an idea of I show this to someone earlier To break through your mental models like it'll show you what what's wrong here and it'll show you six columns and six rows of the letter V and they'll and and it looks like all V's but there's a W in there So you have to find the W, right?

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:02:05,700
But it's very difficult to find and the way you look at that is when you have a string of V's, you know You have the two legs in a gap the W would be missing the gap right in the center It would look like TVs touching let's say so instead of looking for the W Why don't you deduce it and look for where the gap is missing you see the pattern?

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:25,180
Because most people if you showed them four columns and six columns and six rows of V's find what's wrong here They're like the pad it looks because their mental model is just a little they're not really looking at the picture They're looking at the letter V repeated and they said oh, there's so many V's here.

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:43,420
They're all V's, but they're not you see Yes So I would suggest that What I called mental modeling is what's used To go back to what I said earlier for people not to notice what they in in their daily lives You know, what?

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,200
Do you not notice in your daily lives?

25
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,040
It sounds kind of a riddle to ask that in the first place Because how can you discuss something you don't notice right, right?

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,800
so

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,000
There's when I when I have discussions with people that I have been

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Speaking to in the past which I try to avoid by the way

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,300
I always constantly looking for new leaves to turn, you know new pages to turn new people

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,820
Not in a sense of burning bridges or anything, but discarding the

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,060
Separating the wheat from the chaff and discarding the useless

32
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,980
you know and

33
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,960
But not like, you know because in Stalin said there are useful idiots, too, so

34
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,340
but

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,220
When as you keep moving through people, there's seven billion people to move through, right?

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,120
So even if you move through seven thousand a minute, you don't have enough days Is is you're gonna start to realize that?

37
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,080
Even with mental modeling or without mental modeling

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,960
They're all the same essentially meaning based on what culture like Jack fresco talks about you pull them out

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Of right with small idiosyncrasies and small differences and likes

40
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,420
You know, so and then you have to see how forgiving are you

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,880
You know, like he give an example personal example when I was doing with Shelly in the Greek somebody and I would agree some people

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,540
Commented that was some of the best Sonics out there.

43
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:21,100
But if you ask me my personal opinion, I think it's completely idiotic Because you know, you know speaking to Chuck is you know talking to the straw man and the Wizard of Oz, right?

44
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,180
If you know what I mean, I'm looking for brain, but he's not but he would be considered

45
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,620
I'm this is not pejorative to him

46
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,220
But in other words the subject matter that we were discussing when you have someone like anyone that just is not on Chuck

47
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,760
But you're so mentally modeled that you cannot examine what's going on

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,840
Unless two or three people around you already it's become fashionable to do so you see

49
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,900
You know if you once it's like the in crowd, this is like the trending or the in discussion to have

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
right and and

51
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,500
That's part of the culture.

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:04,200
That's part of the mental modeling So when people start to hear things that are really obvious that no one notices Well, it can't be so because no one else has noticed, right?

53
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,900
so Okay, let's go back to what I wanted to say what people are not noticing.

54
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll give an example I just wanted to chat.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,120
I did a speed read up a few lines and people are apparently discussing interlinears.

56
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,980
Why?

57
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Why?

58
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,260
Let's say you read the interlinear.

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,740
So what?

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:32,240
So what there's plenty of people that have spent their entire lives there are schools dedicated to Translating the Bible, but guess what?

61
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,500
Can they tell you what the Bible and Scripture is about?

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, so nope.

63
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,780
Can they tell you prophecy?

64
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,200
Nope.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,160
Can they tell you what timekeeping is?

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,760
Nope Can they tell you the application of the law and the metaphors and the analogies?

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,060
Nope.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,540
I Would prefer that no one read the scriptures analytically and even out of the piss-poor Kim King James For example identified all of the mistakes.

69
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,720
I once have suggested more than once.

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:16,280
How about 49 people or a hundred people grab eat two people each or one person each grab a book of The Bible and sift through it in an interlinear and make an appendix or an index of all the mistranslated words and submit it as an Outline like, you know, here's the book of Genesis.

71
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Here's a 102 occurrences where you have fatal mistakes in the King James Right and the and then explain what the purpose of what do you got out of Genesis?

72
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,340
No one is still doing that, right?

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,560
And this is not I've seen this in other places, too.

74
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,100
I

75
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,340
Wouldn't I would say that

76
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,200
Looking for an interlinear to find what where it's mean is more noble

77
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,880
Than making up stuff like everybody else does on the Internet

78
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, this really means that and this is this and this is that outside of any rationale or logic you see

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
Which is just piss-poor

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,900
But can you tell anyone what the message is in Scripture and the answer is no

81
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,860
It's not being done

82
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,160
Outside of those asinine religious sense or outside of a fine point being discussed which spins off into error anyway

83
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,140
So what the hell is going on here?

84
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,020
What what's so difficult about?

85
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,560
Discussing a communication from a parallel society of high dynamics known as the gods.

86
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,000
What's so difficult about that?

87
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
It's not being done by the way, right?

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,080
Well, it's not being done in chat.

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:45,540
I mean, which is an indication of nothing No, no, yeah, no, but where is it being done on the Internet without including in having met a extreme let's say extremist views extremist meaning Fringe views that are wrought with error.

90
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,060
I Can't say that I can localize such a discussion.

91
00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:08,180
I can't I can't either Well, and you know, there's no do make and yeah, but they do make there's there's a Christianity right away thrown in in order to keep the popularity and a monetary income coming in.

92
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,480
So it's a lost cause there Yeah, or astrotheology or Judaism or messianic or?

93
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Like the stuff what's a Vlodovsky and Jordan Maxwell picked up on that astrotheology in the metaphor of synchronism

94
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,760
Bonacci does that and yeah nothing

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,800
So, you know what that tells me the grapes are sour to these people

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,419
Right, yeah that yeah, yeah to those people which it was just no consequence

97
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,020
I do feel like to this kind of rhetoric does devolve into sort of

98
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,940
monotone repetitive grumbling at some point because if there was such a lack of that type of discussion and

99
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,680
It was something of issue then we would just provide it because it's never been introduced

100
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,860
We don't well, let's but hold on who's we I mean, I know who we is.

101
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Well, maybe Greece, you know Yeah, but provided how?

102
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,020
And to who and when and how and Methodically speaking.

103
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,860
Yeah, but those things can be structured.

104
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,980
Okay, and they can be structured kind of easily Yes.

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,380
Yes.

106
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Okay, they can write So we're not we're not lamenting the lack of the conversation because we can create the conversation instantaneously Well, they're methodically one can rationalize with ease that it can be done, right?

107
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:37,580
Oh, yeah You just do a podcast you write a book you just go out and tell people or you you know promote it or Right, that's the methodological Well either actually it is, you know spending spending Three hours a day for less than a month.

108
00:09:37,660 --> 00:10:00,620
You'll be surprised what you can do on the Yeah You have to grovel a bit, you know on the publicity and you have to start, you know Groveling into channels, you know, I mean come in in a very benign way let them know what you're offering and hopefully they want to Promote what you're doing as well indirectly or directly, you know all this other stuff, right?

109
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,360
That's not correct.

110
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,180
Yeah All right.

111
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:27,700
So if you want to explore that methodology You know anyone is free to do it because the stuff that I bring up is so obvious that to say that Greek says This or this is the Greek stuff is ridiculous, you know to say that time keeping is the way the Greek does time is ridiculous to state that The views on the human body is the way the Greek says is ridiculous.

112
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:35,320
It's freaking obvious Right, and I show yes, and it has to be promoted that way that it's obvious Obvious.

113
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:45,420
Yeah, I really would like to be left out of it unless it was Viewed as a business venture or a decision where I would benefit from it from investing time in it, right?

114
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:58,420
Right, but Sam on the other hand you could say well It's not happening organically You know what I mean Organically, I mean just put it out there and watch it grow on its own, right?

115
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,300
So what is your what is your idea about?

116
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:26,480
About this, I mean you said well we could go, you know, it might devolve into simple grow grow, you know, whatever I mean, how obvious Always okay fine Yeah, it does and it has been for quite a long time on a social cultural level as well How how does one show the obviousness of things?

117
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:41,480
when The people don't see it at the moment and I'm being kind, you know, of course because they're censored and they're morons But let's say they weren't let's put the censorship and the idiocy aside How do they how do you present something?

118
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,360
That's just blatantly obvious to them, right?

119
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,780
Well, I think there's a sense in which you ask Yes, it would be too.

120
00:11:48,300 --> 00:12:00,520
I don't know You know as always what kind of audiences that you have in mind, I mean don't we're not we're not thinking about it Yeah, but we're not thinking about Catering to a general mass of people that are disinterested, right?

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:15,060
So even with corporations or with the entertainment industry they Have an endeavor that is geared towards identifying an audience whether it's through focus groups or it's through some kind of online research So I don't think that anybody is exempt from that.

122
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,620
You have to first identify the audience and then go after it.

123
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,660
Okay Let me let me just throw a little insight.

124
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:31,420
Have you ever been around people in film production and Producership like B movies or even on People that worked on like sound and editing for major movies.

125
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,360
I have

126
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,460
Mm-hmm, and when you bring up that point

127
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,160
Regarding what you know what people whatever, you know what they always say the people are stupid

128
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,620
Always and you hear it so much

129
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,460
But you're like, oh this is bullshit because there really is no creativity here

130
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,140
In a sense because they've already presumed

131
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,180
It's kind of like the thing is, you know

132
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,480
I heard of someone in the street recently discuss a political thing and she said something like what do they think?

133
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,780
The American people are stupid.

134
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,120
I said no, they don't think the American people are stupid.

135
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:14,800
They know the American people are stupid so I've seen this so much Even in that video audio that I sent about dr.

136
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,440
Day He said the people are so dumb.

137
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,780
They're never gonna realize anything.

138
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:38,340
You've heard me discuss the money system for example In great detail and all that and even like, you know, any host is like, okay Right, so Good I mean Anybody anybody can lampoon the foolishness of the masses?

139
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,020
But once again, we're not talking about that.

140
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,520
We're talking about An effort that is geared towards Constructing contours around a particular group of people and locking in on that.

141
00:13:47,840 --> 00:14:04,280
So if there is no Scattered No, it's it's a mist it's a it's a mist it's it's a it's an ethereal group It's not a group like an Ecclesia or a body of people.

142
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,320
There's no body to it

143
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,600
I didn't say that what I said was we have to sculpt the contours around this

144
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,160
If the ephemeral, you know existence of people that could disperse at any moment

145
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,600
so if you don't want to do the grunt work of doing that and you want to shove that onto somebody else who's not showing

146
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,660
Up to accommodate that fine

147
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,920
But if you can't succeed with that then you have to do it yourself and you don't want to do it yourself

148
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,960
No, I'd rather just show up and the mic is ready and you pick it up and you speak

149
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,120
But that's not going to materialize under the current conditions

150
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,400
So you can either a doubt, you know adapt to the circumstance or you could just continue in your current vein

151
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,780
But when you take right, I mean, sorry

152
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,900
No, it's not even it's not even there is no current vein

153
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,740
we just have these sonics that we put on and and just

154
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,920
To put out a little bit of information here and there and and whatever and tell people how moronic they are and that's about it.

155
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,600
I Mean, you know, I mean A little more but that's fine.

156
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:14,960
Then that is the current vein, but here's an interesting There's something called a litmus test or testing the waters or whatever Yeah, are you familiar with that concept right an introductory aspect?

157
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:26,900
You know if you plan on running a marathon and you can't even run a warm-up Around the block once I think the second part of your endeavor is worthless Did you get it?

158
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:38,620
Yeah Yeah Yeah in a sense I mean you can if you show up to run the marathon Which is 35 40 kilometers and you can't even run a quarter of a kilometer to warm up Don't even think of trying the other thing, right?

159
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,680
And I'm not saying this is not a let me just focus a little bit more what I'm trying to say here That's not because I'm not doing it.

160
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:57,800
It's because so much stuff has been put out Let's say on the human body on Scripture this or the other as is there any interest on evolving it and Evolving a meeting unraveling it more.

161
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,660
No, they're very little I get, you know the similar, you know You're judging that based on what you see on the Internet not even based on real-world interactions.

162
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:23,160
I don't know how far away It is based on real-world interactions I've traveled I wouldn't been everywhere, but I've traveled around past decade and discuss things with people and the moment What you did a decade ago doesn't count oh Really?

163
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,660
Okay.

164
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,900
We're talking about what are you saying?

165
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,540
The same stuff?

166
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:37,740
I'm saying the same stuff same stuff wherever I go I bring up and people know me as one that To go to and ask some questions about this or the other and and it's like oh, yeah.

167
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,680
Okay, whatever No, there's no There's several points.

168
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,500
I think prophetically it's not time yet, and I'm not the one or whatever.

169
00:16:47,600 --> 00:17:04,880
I think it'll happen Simultaneously I just think that maybe a lot of this stuff is a precursor to the simultaneous Evolution of it, you know unraveling or opening of it We might just be a little too early for the party, you know what?

170
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,220
I mean, and that's fine, too

171
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,079
Yeah, but if that really was fine

172
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,819
Then we would suffice with the current state of things and yet obviously the Greek doesn't because here we are

173
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,660
So there's no point in talking about that

174
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,720
You know sure there's always a point about it because there are fine points that can be brought up with different people

175
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,339
You know viewing on the subject matter

176
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah, but then we'd be addressing the fine points now.

177
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,320
I wouldn't be addressing, you know Well, I'm makes we well, we might be addressing the fine points in the next 30 seconds.

178
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,740
You don't know Sure, you know is this that we always have to go through these hoops, which is fine I'm not averse to it.

179
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:50,500
But I I personally am waiting for development in in the sort of Protest or the criticism or the belly-aching because what are we actually complaining about?

180
00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:05,820
We should be measuring What we're seeing based on the efforts that we're making Right not based on what some random massive people are doing that are under the control of spiritual beings Anyway, that has really nothing to do.

181
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,520
I'll speak for myself.

182
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,400
It has nothing to do with me, right?

183
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,380
I just want I want to measure my progress based on my efforts.

184
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:29,520
So if the if the if the If the apex of our efforts is to come on this stream and Whine about the state of the world Then I don't think I don't think it's the apex or I don't think it's about whining I think it's really just giving an update but which is the same, right?

185
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,640
You know if it's like when you're in the desert, it's sunny every day if you turn on the weather almost

186
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,620
360 days of the year guess what they're gonna say on the weather

187
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,120
It's sunny

188
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,060
So that does that does that mean because it's sunny 360 days out of the year that you don't do the weather

189
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,120
But anyway, go ahead

190
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,360
There's an element of redundancy there and you can address that instead of being I don't mean you but we can address that instead

191
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,220
Of being monotone about it, right?

192
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,900
So if there are fine points, let's address the fine points if there are if there's a Grand here this is this is the fine point.

193
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,540
The fine point is very simple

194
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,880
You'll remember me saying this and I don't say it as often as I should I want and you'll see why I said why I

195
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,120
should

196
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,840
This is not about any subject or this or that or whatever it's about

197
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:27,820
Anything that mankind is involved in that's cognitive based knowledge based rational based or you know, quote-unquote science

198
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,480
which means knowledge and

199
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,000
Communication anything that you involve yourself in any field or trade if you look at Thomas manual

200
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,220
I think there's 30 different 30,000 or 23,000 different categories in industry, right?

201
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,420
And beyond that right?

202
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,640
Anything anyone wants to get involved in any field is still completely wide open Let me just say that.

203
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah again if you want to talk about the gods

204
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,940
You can go out and muster all the information everything that's been written about it doesn't even cover one-tenth of one percent of what can

205
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,380
Be done with that information

206
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,520
If you want to study human biology not even one-tenth of one percent is covered on that

207
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,560
In other words a layman right now

208
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,640
What it was is this is what I champion if I were to say some words that would champion Greek speak would be this

209
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,840
Anything you want to learn about or get involved in on a rational cognitive knowledge or scientific basis or spiritual basis?

210
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,500
Any field is completely wide open

211
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,660
Don't ever feel that

212
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,440
Any more than one-tenth of one percent has ever been accomplished in any field it doesn't matter if it's physics

213
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,100
Anything's spirituality meaning knowledge of the gods in your own self the human body biology energy

214
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,120
Mathematics anything airplanes not even one-tenth of one percent of that topic has been dealt with

215
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,440
Are you with me on this what I'm trying to say?

216
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:52,720
Yeah.

217
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,440
Yeah, but it's not but you're saying it's on from saturation Open to anyone who's interest.

218
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:04,120
Mm-hmm No, no It's not just open to anybody who's interested as if we can just pick out any random person and expect them to function at that No, no.

219
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,140
No, I'm talking about.

220
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,660
This is the mindset that I'm giving

221
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,720
Yeah, but the mindset notwithstanding

222
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,340
It's open to those who have the background and the technical proficiency to even grasp that field in the first place first

223
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,600
It would be the inspiration

224
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Well, you know, you know like an airplane designer

225
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,840
There was one guy a French guy and he they asked him a while back

226
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,500
What made you want to become an airplane designers is that four years old?

227
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,820
I took interest Well, what the hell did he know at four years old?

228
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,620
It was inspiration.

229
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,140
You see?

230
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah, but a four-year-old has the buffer of the next 20 years to amass that Sensibility, there's no point in looking at a 25 year old who's already cemented his not just the mentality But also his skill set and his idiosyncrasies and say you can go study aeronautics.

231
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:56,580
No, you can't of course you can No, you don't because you don't have a buffer as far as time as far as resources and as sure it is No, you don't.

232
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,120
Well, okay.

233
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:08,860
Hold on If you go look at let's take the human body, which is very simple If you can go and study anything and everything about the medical Industry and all the science of the human body.

234
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,880
That's not even one-tenth of 1% of what the human body is even about not even

235
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,380
Anything that you might study regarding the human body in medical science, let's say

236
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,380
Doesn't even address the biological vacuum

237
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,080
All you need to do is pick up the bylot the concept of the biological volume which vacuum which is completely ignored and pick up

238
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,440
On that and in three days you will be a thousand times more advanced than the most advanced medical technician

239
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,580
Because he's not even looking there.

240
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:52,680
It's the same thing as as as you know, if we're all in a room and We say we're gonna walk to China The person who gets up from the sofa and walks five feet towards the west or the east where is closer to China Is he not measurably you're still a long way there, but you're so much closer.

241
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah, but you're 300 percent.

242
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,660
Nobody Mm-hmm.

243
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:03,540
No, but nobody measures progress relative to something as minor as that kind of effort What progress?

244
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:14,600
as far as the progress of you Moving forward with your own personal endeavor if there's three people and they take, you know One guy moves a few steps closer to China and he's close.

245
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:25,700
He's closer to check Yeah but he's closer to China relative to those other three guys who have done nothing and He himself in the grand scheme of things will have done nothing like there's no Missed it.

246
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:25,880
Now.

247
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,620
Hold on a second.

248
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:43,880
It's not Yeah, but it's not measurable relative to himself and I've done this when I was out in Texas For example, you could walk into a medical conference and when they're finished They're doing question and answer and then if there anyone wants to bring up any upcoming whatever you just don't know What about the vacuum in the body and you give a couple of examples?

249
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,460
That makes everything everything that they've done seems so asinine

250
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,900
That they've that they are ignoring that and now you are the expert in that field

251
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,280
They're gonna be they've got 40 years medical practical experience

252
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,700
But they're looking at you now as the expert because they had never considered it

253
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,760
And you keep building upon that

254
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,040
So after you research it for two weeks you report back because remember you're still the world expert on it, right?

255
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:22,120
So It's it's the same with the magnetic fields Once you find out how a magnetic field works You could go to all the physicists in the world doesn't matter how much experience they have and you show prove to them how?

256
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,840
It really works, even though you've discovered it yesterday

257
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,960
They're gonna look at you as the expert on that new concept

258
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,100
Yeah, but you're once again presupposing that this person even knew what

259
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,300
Magneticism was in the first place you go on on the street and you ask the average person what the net is

260
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,200
Is what I'm talking about find that no, of course, we're not taught even physicists can define it

261
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,100
They can't nobody even on there even according to even according to standard

262
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,260
Money, whatever education they they can't do it.

263
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,600
Mm-hmm.

264
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,480
Now if you can and you could prove it That makes you a world expert now.

265
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,460
We're not talking now, you know that we're leaving out like

266
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,340
about five or six critical points and one of them or two of them might be that you're not going to be recognized an

267
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,860
Expert because you don't have the credentials

268
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,360
Also, they're gonna they're gonna the second thing is the the the culture is going to say

269
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
well, this guy can't be an expert based on his

270
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,580
race

271
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,780
based on his culture based on his

272
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,560
That's those going on by the way and based on his education based on how many years he's been doing it

273
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,980
You see you're gonna have an answer a seemingly unsurmountable amount of resistance

274
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:35,020
Against you but it doesn't negate that you're the only one that knows about it or are progressing in a new direction

275
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
You know

276
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,280
Progressing by what by what measure and by let's go back to the same thing that we started on this

277
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,340
Conversation if this is the apex of our conversations or whatever.

278
00:25:47,480 --> 00:26:00,600
Yeah, it sounds pretty it sounds pretty piss-pathetic Just to do these little streams, but instead of let's say doing the stream Let's say that you just want to talk about the human we can do let's say a stream on the the biological vacuum in the body Right.

279
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,780
Well, or we can write do a website on it.

280
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,480
And then once we do the website on it

281
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,500
Write a little thing about it

282
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,680
I'll do a blog on it do a podcast on it send emails to people in places that might be interested you see

283
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,580
Sowing seeds and then seeing how and then take a break and if that doesn't work try another

284
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,520
Thing on the biological like him or airplane flight, it's very simple, you know, I never saw a

285
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,220
Bird with a propeller on its nose or a jet under its wing of you

286
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,200
No, so yeah, so how do they fly

287
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,580
Yeah, what way changing their environment?

288
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:46,820
The bird doesn't fly bird changes its environment gives the illusion that it's flying You see that like for example cork doesn't float on water.

289
00:26:46,920 --> 00:27:04,940
That's an illusion It's because it doesn't displace it's because of its density that it ends up rising to the top You see So if you had say if the cork had more density than water it wouldn't float It has nothing to do with what you call a whole cork floats.

290
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:13,880
No, it doesn't cork is floated Relative to water if you blow bubbles very fine micro bubbles under the water.

291
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,920
What will happen to that cork Bruce?

292
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:31,940
You might move around no sink Really would fire you oh yeah, because the bubbles if you took a given volume of the water and Measure the density of the water with the bubbles.

293
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,080
It would be less than the cork wouldn't it?

294
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,740
Depending on how many bubbles that's how you sink a large ship.

295
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,500
You don't need I shouldn't sit

296
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,000
Well, anyway, I'll say you just have a submarine with a drone

297
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,120
With compressed air and go underneath the ship and you you form

298
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,260
Cavitating bubbles

299
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,520
Underneath the battleship

300
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,800
you don't have to do the whole battleship you just do the

301
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,540
The engine compartment side which is heavier and then they all the ballast will run towards it anyway

302
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,500
And you just dip the back

303
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,220
But what happens even the largest battleship or aircraft carrier if you dip if you dip the bat one side of the ship underwater

304
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,140
What do you think will happen?

305
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:24,880
She's going down Yeah, she's going down it doesn't take much you could do the math it requires about 160 cubic feet of compressed air Which is the size of a small tool shed a small tool sheds up really 500 cubic feet.

306
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:36,660
I Mean the size of a large, you know house refrigerator could do it right And what does that cost a couple thousand bucks take down a billion dollar aircraft carrier?

307
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,560
And no one wouldn't even know what happened, right?

308
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,860
So, I mean Yeah, you want to get into weapons design, but like Jack Fresco said don't cast your pearls to swine.

309
00:28:46,320 --> 00:29:02,940
Here's one for your Sam even Weapons design is completely wide open You know, occasionally I'll run into websites on the current weapons and I laugh I'm like are these people like eight-year-olds in 80 80 year old or 75 year old man general suits.

310
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,360
Are these people stupid or what?

311
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,740
This is their weaponry.

312
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:20,100
This is ridiculous But anyway, are you guys familiar by the way, it's just a little trivia here Are you familiar with the aircraft carrier that was sunk by a Vietnamese sponge fishermen that was never really reported You could look it up.

313
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,460
Yes.

314
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,340
I remember you mentioned me not It's very embarrassing to the Americans.

315
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,320
Are you familiar with that Sam?

316
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,040
Yeah, you know, you know an aircraft carriers is like a very expensive piece of

317
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,560
You know, it's putting all of your liability in one basket

318
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,360
Well, you know even back then it was considered the most expensive thing you could have floating around and a bunch of sponge divers

319
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,040
Well, how much resources do sponge divers have of your you know, they're like the poorest, you know

320
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,860
In the fishermen culture, the sponge divers are like the way at the bottom

321
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,240
They're not even fishermen are like Kings compared to these guys if you know what I mean, right?

322
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,800
Great.

323
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,060
So anyway

324
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,300
Any field is wide open

325
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,740
Everything is completely wide open

326
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,600
That's the point of Greek speak, I mean how many times you ever listen to any

327
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,060
Sonic event that I've done and I do only one subject never

328
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,400
And some people say what's your problem need to focus on one thing

329
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,320
I'll say well, it sounds like a personal problem that you might have with what you're hearing

330
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,040
so

331
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,720
The concept I mean, it's all very well to elaborate

332
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,740
You know somewhat anally on narrow scientific fields at 99% can't follow

333
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,260
But what I don't see is any comprehensive effort to condense that into a presentable product or a format or a package you avoid that

334
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,820
Right despite that also being open to you, right?

335
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:58,760
So the only actually in many cases I do have I do have pretty elaborate writings and bodies of work Some people say you have any wheat or white papers or treatise Someone said you have a treatise on your end and I was gonna send it to him and I was like now I'm just gonna send him one page just one page.

336
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:13,800
See what happens And and then it was like I got well, you guys see the rest I'm like, well damn I said that that one page should have floored unit didn't so I'm like, yeah You know, you just want to read words, you know Or do you do you get what's being said here, right?

337
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Also when they engage they don't engage enough.

338
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,280
No, they don't engage in a pertinent way But in other words, how are you determining what's perfect?

339
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:36,960
Oh, it's very I mean because the what I did send I had a couple of Things that would have made anyone jump out of their seat and say that's not really so is it Yeah, but he might have done that on his own away from the conversation.

340
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:51,800
Yeah, but it wasn't it wasn't done at all ever So I don't send stuff out Back Yeah, I didn't I didn't send any Either either you Bruce or personally Sam you anything either?

341
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:09,640
No Because it's just you know, I haven't seen any direct interest I need to see more and more and more and more on this because here's the ultimate thing Is power knowledge in the knower is knowledge power to the knower the doer, you know What are you going to do with that?

342
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:09,960
Right?

343
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:23,640
But What this conversation is like Sam what you're bringing up perhaps might be what you're gonna do with it is just keep it in the informational realm and Just structure it so it can be you know It's some kind of distributorship, right?

344
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah, I mean the extent to which people I don't know act on what they know is also based

345
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,400
Upon how strongly they're hemmed in by their circumstances

346
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,120
So, I mean if you give if I have a million dollars what I'm gonna do with the information is very different than if I'm

347
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,240
Dead broke and I'm only hearing the information then I can perhaps only contemplate on it

348
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,320
So once again, we come back to what is the target audience and how are you, you know looking to?

349
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,620
Empower people to work with this information as far as targeting certain groups or starting circuit certain individuals

350
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,300
And it doesn't seem like you've identified those people at all

351
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,380
You're talking about because they're everywhere who have no resources whatsoever to do

352
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,360
They're the people are all over I've been around billionaires who are complete morons and I've been around homeless people who are geniuses

353
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,100
That's the gamut, you know

354
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,980
I've seen street sweepers that would make better heart surgeons and I've met heart surgeons that would make good street sweepers

355
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
So when you say target, yes, it sounds like something you you know

356
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,760
It sounds weaponized again, and you know when you bring up the million if you want to make a million dollars doing this start off

357
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,520
with five million

358
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,420
Anyway, it's a joke get it

359
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,020
Yeah, yeah, but it's not about you're gonna lose four million doing it.

360
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,540
Yeah, so anyway

361
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,820
Here's the other thing, okay

362
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:41,080
Do you ever tell you about the two brothers selling watermelon they needed something to do and they had some money to invest and

363
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,040
they were selling watermelons and they they rented a truck and they went down to the

364
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,120
market and they bought the watermelons for five cents apiece wholesale and

365
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:57,240
They filled up the whole truck and they showed up and they sold each watermelon for five cents and they sold all the watermelon

366
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,520
The end of the day they counted the money and they said well, we didn't make any money

367
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,240
And he says well, I know what we need a bigger truck

368
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,300
anyway

369
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,360
They bought it for five cents up, but okay you see

370
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,560
So what does that sound like you like this?

371
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,139
They missed the point, right?

372
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:37,020
All right Let's go back to a little bit of Criticism of either people in chat or emails or people that we run into or whatever You're gonna notice let's just the simple criticism Jack fresco stuff the about you know, you're part of your culture Right.

373
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,380
Yeah.

374
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah.

375
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Okay.

376
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
All right, you know that the shrunken heads analogy.

377
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,780
Okay, are you upset?

378
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,260
They have five shrunken heads?

379
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,780
Yes, I am.

380
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,699
My brother has 20

381
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,719
right

382
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,659
so what happens here is

383
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,360
Also, you have mental modeling

384
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,659
right

385
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,280
The reason why people I found

386
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,120
Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the people which except for one or two or three maybe the past 15 years

387
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:10,040
Want to say they want to study scripture is because they were raised as young children told them told through society that it's something important

388
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,360
That's the only reason why they want to do it because they know it's important but they have no cognitive or rational reason

389
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,680
Why to study it?

390
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,340
Yeah, you're talking about a group Which is pretty much everyone.

391
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:37,000
I've spoken to thousands of people in 15 years only two or three have risen above that So then work with the two or three Okay, so so in other words what's going on here, I mean Where's the group?

392
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,320
Where's the Greek study group with these two or three people?

393
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:59,500
I don't see that either So no, I don't even know where they are now The last time I spoke to one of them might have been three years ago and the other two maybe five or ten Okay, so so there and actually I would include I'm still Waiting to see that there are some potentials You know, you never say they don't exist.

394
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,020
You just don't know of them

395
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,480
Right and also people that are working on it now that I'd say in chat or yourself or they're out there might be at that

396
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,820
point

397
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,960
What are you I don't see you doing anything to empower people to go down this road

398
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,920
Besides putting out information that you hope that they can assimilate on their own

399
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:26,800
like when you can show me the group of people that you've put together as an effort and it failed because they dropped the ball then

400
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
We can say that people are not ready

401
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,780
But if you're not putting the contours around any sort of endeavor to crystallize what you're doing in the form of some kind of outworking

402
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,200
this is just

403
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,880
Complete what I

404
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,040
Can't even find the word.

405
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,580
Well, the thing is they failed.

406
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,080
You don't want to just fail you want to do failures?

407
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,000
You want to do in heuristics?

408
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,500
You want to run through do as many failures as possible.

409
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,120
So, you know how not to do it, right?

410
00:36:51,220 --> 00:37:09,380
but the the interesting thing about this is That if you have let's say the methodology or the example that you gave one group that failed that with this the second group that you assemble or try to procure Through whatever Program is forming a group.

411
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,240
How much different is this system going to be?

412
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,460
You see like certain research groups when they're turned science to told to do some not much anymore

413
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,960
When they have to do stuff

414
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,220
They try to they deliberately create failure systems to measure the failures to know how things fail to know

415
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,920
That if they think that they're on something good if they start seeing the signs of failure

416
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,080
They don't have to go down all the way so they want to go through as many failures and study as possible

417
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,800
But when you're putting a group together or forming a group, hopefully, it's not a Gustav Le Bon type group

418
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,040
How much different is is the failed group going to be from the successful group?

419
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,420
How much different can it be or are you going to be doing the same failure thing over and over and over?

420
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
That's called insanity, right?

421
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:01,600
How can You don't have to answer this but think about how would one group fail where another one wouldn't what would be the system?

422
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:16,740
That's employed if the information is the same I don't I can't see how the information can be changed because the information is not that specific Information is very general in a direction that no one is looking at It's kind of like having ten doors.

423
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,480
Everyone's looking at that six or let's say three doors and you're saying hey

424
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,220
There's seven more doors that never been opened

425
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,360
You know just crack the door a little bit and look in you're gonna see a lot more of that than if it were closed

426
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,300
the whole time I

427
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,280
Can't see how forming groups and organizations and efforts and having them fail is going to be different the second time

428
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,960
well, the

429
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,280
The potential climate is different the second time.

430
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm assuming that you could be speaking to different individuals second time Oh, that's a good point.

431
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, the gods might just choose to favor you the second time.

432
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,500
What do you mean?

433
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,500
No, no No The thing is also you're further down the road when the climate is different when you said that the climate the weather is different meaning You're further down the road in time.

434
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:11,260
Yeah I'll tell you right now that there's a different attitude from let's say discussing this seven eight years ago this same stuff same exact stuff Seven eight years ago.

435
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,620
There is less of a Gustav LeBond attitude now

436
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,840
Like seven eight years ago people would say oh this guy

437
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,580
He's the guy blah blah now people are not focusing on that mother trying to focus more on the content

438
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,060
I noticed as the group loosely put

439
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,740
You see that's the only difference I've seen which is positive

440
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,960
So, okay, but the thing is what are it whether the point of

441
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,540
Speaking tonight is what people are not noticing and I'll bring up something like again

442
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,180
I went into chat I put on that we're on doing a

443
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,500
Sonic right now and there was just a couple of last entries about all

444
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,760
interlinears

445
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,820
So what?

446
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,260
So what you can so what are what are people not noticing?

447
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:08,160
Let's say it's a tool, you know If you want to build a house and you're just focusing on a good saw and a good hammer and getting a really good You know, whatever.

448
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,820
I don't know what else do you you know used to build a house level and measuring tape?

449
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,960
Ultimately, those are just tools that based on your skill and level of performance is going to build the final craftsmanship.

450
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:30,680
I've seen You can go to like a Stone Age Woodworking shop and they build fine furniture or you can go to a computer controlled Woodworking shop all the latest stuff in their furniture is crap.

451
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,980
You see what I mean?

452
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:43,380
Yeah the tools, you know a poor mechanic blames his tools a good mechanic can pretty much work on a car with kitchen utensils and Again, I saw the thing about interlinks.

453
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,160
I would rather see this is just everybody close your ears.

454
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,540
I'm not saying this But I'll just say it anyway What you've discovered in in the message rather than?

455
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:03,080
What you're discovering in the tools which By the way, interlinears and versions and all that are completely outside of the scriptures.

456
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:18,580
Those those are just tools There are metaphors of reaching for the information So The level of discussion in the chat concerning any subject is never going to rise above the mundane So I don't know here nor there.

457
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:38,780
No, of course, but but the other thing is you also see this In various information systems, whether it's the rectangle whether it's stuff that's been written prior whether you go down to the university to the theological department or the archaeological department by the way is also Very much involved in a lot of this stuff, right?

458
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,240
But when you say various groups, you're talking about

459
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,340
something in terms of

460
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,560
Conforming to a certain culture or a certain climate

461
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,760
Culturally, you're not talking about the reality on the ground where anything could be the case

462
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:59,020
There could be people doing all kinds of research right now into something more substantial than what you're talking about

463
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,740
But perhaps you don't know of them where they're only doing it on an individual level, right?

464
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
Right, you're all the absolutely.

465
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,240
The only one is ridiculous.

466
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,480
But to say let's say you're the only one on the Internet.

467
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,420
Yeah, that's obvious Or whatever.

468
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:13,780
Yeah

469
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
but you know

470
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:23,260
It's but here's the other thing the the mental modeling, you know people think like well if you're you've got if you've got a great idea

471
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,660
regarding computer hardware

472
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,040
most people will tell you go to

473
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:35,480
Hewlett-Packard Apple one of these big computer manufacturers, right and that seems to be stands to be correct because they're naive

474
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,980
But if you try to do it on your own

475
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,120
You you don't have the resources to do it.

476
00:42:42,380 --> 00:43:07,180
You see Okay, so now there is there an in-between ground yeah, of course, it's still wide open There's a huge in-between ground Look with regards to that if somebody really wanted to get off the ground with their product or whatever They'd look for some middleman investor Right, they'd look for somebody to throw them some money and only then can you know that person who's giving them the money?

477
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,460
Claim that look I gave him this money.

478
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:26,380
He didn't do anything with it Once it so we come back to the when I see the Greek getting behind somebody or some endeavor to say look I'm gonna put some time and effort into this instead of just throwing seeds to the masses and half the swine is just gonna trample on it Until you during that.

479
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,800
I don't see you moving forward in this regard at all Hmm, you're coming back.

480
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,540
I don't think the point.

481
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:45,960
I don't think my point was ever to move forward At all on this as on a what people call as a career or an endeavor to be the highlight of one's existence Then what are we talking about here?

482
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,640
Other than I don't know.

483
00:43:47,800 --> 00:44:01,560
This must make it a short sonic and hang up The point is what I found interesting is just looking at things that you don't notice and why you don't notice them What is it?

484
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,460
Is it censorship?

485
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,480
Is it mental modeling?

486
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:11,460
Oh We're not going to talk about specific things that people don't I thought you're gonna bring up specific things that people don't know They're there.

487
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,960
Of course, there's specific things.

488
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:26,050
You can this is a Western culture It's very easy to pick once you pick up once you under start studying the culture itself It becomes very obvious.

489
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,810
What to you what is not obvious to others?

490
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:42,590
Right a very simple thing is timekeeping people don't seem to mind that they have Days of observance different days of the week every year They they don't mind.

491
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,610
Oh, I think yeah, I mean they know they think it's how to reckon it, right?

492
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,890
They don't know how to reckon it, right?

493
00:44:48,910 --> 00:45:00,010
So it doesn't take much to to Go beyond that but then the noticing is not the crux of the issue the it's the knowledge of how to implement it But here's the thing.

494
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:06,350
They they only notice it once the point is brought up a point doesn't ever made it Really okay.

495
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:12,750
I know because I noticed this the discrepancy in those things when I was like 11 12, but it's like well What am I gonna do with this?

496
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,210
Oh nothing.

497
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:13,550
Okay

498
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,830
Well, then let's go play video games tons of people notice tons of things

499
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,870
But it has no practical significance because it's not given that outlet

500
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:24,710
That's a different thing and we can talk that down to cosmic censorship or whatever

501
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,010
but if it's chalked down to that then there's nothing to address because that's coming from a

502
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,230
From a unilateral place position of force by the gods

503
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,590
So there's nothing there to address anyway, right exactly hence to the point that I've been saying for the past few months is why bother

504
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:47,110
It's the same thing like if a day if you have a father a very strong patriarchal matriarchal figure in the family and

505
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,250
You know all the children in the house by five o'clock and they shut the door and you can't go out

506
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,590
If you if one of the children gets a call from a friends has come out to play at six o'clock.

507
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:06,190
There's like I can't Yeah You're using the model, you know of a 1950s 60s society in today's situation.

508
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,290
You get a call from a friend No, I can't come on.

509
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,450
Okay, let's get on Skype.

510
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:23,550
We'll do some stuff on the computer I got a project you get out your tools from whatever I want and why and why is but you still but you're still doing it Informationally spiritually new no physical other than the actual device itself.

511
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:34,470
There's it's all mental, you know other than the pixels Changing oh, I just said no like I just said I you can walk me through a process Why if we have a science project, okay, I'll get out stuff.

512
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,270
You're gonna tell me what to do I'm gonna do it.

513
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:45,190
I report back to you the Feedback it becomes a game So Here's an example right now.

514
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:53,350
This is not that easy to find but if someone is diligent, they'll find it There are patents on solar panels that are 30 to 40 percent efficient.

515
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:06,710
The best panels now are 10% not even 5% really Some might say they have some for 20% but you can't buy them So three times more the efficiency or four times actually some of the panels are more than 50% efficient, right?

516
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,490
This information is not difficult to get it.

517
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:15,990
So over a hundred years old now why you know Why isn't any interest being done in that direction?

518
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:16,930
Let's say to do that.

519
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:24,310
That's something very practical and simple you see Yeah But that could very well be done by people who just don't have the wherewithal to see it through what's the name of the dude?

520
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:35,990
With the Nikola Tesla recreations, he's doing what he's doing, but he's also hemmed in by just being you know Down and out and health-wise in his old age, and he's not gonna get it off the ground On dollar.

521
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,230
Yeah Kind of a madman also Surprised house.

522
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:47,790
I'm surprised how civil and how composed he is on his public interviews He's a madman but in a good way.

523
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,650
I mean obviously because he's not working on stuff.

524
00:47:50,730 --> 00:48:03,890
That is Irrelevant he's working on very relevant things But okay, but he's not he's not mad in and of himself He's if anything he's been driven mad and secondly, he's old and you take a 23 year old dollar.

525
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,150
It's not the same thing So once again, but he was doing a 23.

526
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,190
He was still doing that.

527
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,970
Yeah Okay.

528
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,750
Yeah, he was doing at a 20.

529
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:20,290
Yeah, he was he was doing it at 8 years old at 15 years old 12 years old actually, I think it's 16 years old.

530
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:32,150
He that the one of the big laboratories hired him right, so anyway Yeah, the point is that is there a methodology that?

531
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:54,730
That can be You know standardized and put on a platform and promote it is that what you're saying because You know and it's not about scripture, you know, it is well, you know The only have I maybe I haven't said this enough in public, you know, the most people think I just talk about scripture Do you know why it's not I just don't talk about scripture.

532
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:14,830
There are many other things to talk about but why because it's information that comes from the most powerful beings in That we can conceive of and because it comes from the most powerful beings we can conceive of it's the most powerful information So it's a matter methodology using a basic rational hierarchy, right?

533
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:26,930
So like if you're going to set up a mining operation and you know, you could pull on gold just as easy as you could pull on iron well That's a no-brainer.

534
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,130
You should pull the gold you see If it's the same effort.

535
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,170
Yes, so that that's my point.

536
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:54,970
Yeah, so but the thing is it's not about just about scripture It's about anything and every every subject really And what I found out is the people's I wouldn't say they resist I think they're apathetic And stubborn as a general whole and then like going back to address the point that you said, what group do you target?

537
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,910
Well, I think the groups have to be formed, but then you're gonna have the pitfalls of Gustave Le Bon, right?

538
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:05,550
so it has to be a leaderless a leaderless Personality lists.

539
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:17,970
I don't think that you've made I don't think you've made the kind of comprehensive effort That is necessary to establish whether or not a group even a group of two or three people or four people is viable I don't think that you've run those tests.

540
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,590
I don't think that you've gone out into the field to find those people.

541
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:21,170
Oh sure

542
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,990
I think you can make claims as the efforts that you made a decade ago, which count for very little at this point

543
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:32,330
I don't think that you've done anything within the past year that would be tantamount to anything significant

544
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,630
No, I wouldn't say the past year at all

545
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:40,870
But I would say that I could tell you from from a failure from a heuristic point of view from a failure and success point

546
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,510
The you would probably

547
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,630
Put your personal stuff out, but simply you're you're single in your 20s would be the best

548
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:57,750
Profile human for this type of information why because if you're married or coupled it's going to most likely break up

549
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,210
The relationship unless both and the chances of both

550
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:08,310
Living if any lifestyle changes were to come because of better ways of living through information

551
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,030
The couple will not survive it

552
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,330
right, so the people between let's say

553
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,110
18 and

554
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:23,950
26 are the most viable for this kind because they tend to be most flexible and almost every aspect of their lives

555
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,130
All right.

556
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:41,090
Yeah So, right And I've noticed that yeah Yeah so if you can hem down that kind of a profile and sort of measure in a roundabout way the statistical probability of Who has a greater success rate versus somebody else and that is the part a part of some kind of an effort that can lead?

557
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:54,570
Somewhere and yet I don't see Aspect yeah, so the success rate being high another, you know, there's several other Ones, you know, I can go I can go down a long and short list.

558
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:05,650
It's up to you, but you know, I've Yeah, but but what you're not doing is assimilating that into a sort of comprehensive report and then acting on it It's not it's not taking on it.

559
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:29,530
No, of course not That's up to you guys to act on it Oh us guys, but we're not but we're not the ones who are being vocal about it If the Greek was being vocal about the state of things, I think it's on a random Sonic here and there or a weekly one recently here and that's about it Oh, so the best we can do now is go off our whims Instead of putting together something that's comprehensive.

560
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:41,150
No, you could put it anyone could put anything together But it's it's all that most of the stuff that I've discussed is excessively cognitively any Yeah, we're not talking about anyone.

561
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:49,070
These are your streams So what I'm saying is that if the best that you can do is go off the whim To get off and do a stream and complain about things.

562
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:53,990
I Think that that's an indictment on the Greek because you're the one taking the comments.

563
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:10,800
No, the comments are that Comments are made when comments can be made if it's if it's not comment our then let's not comment I don't think it's common our I think it's making things happen our Okay, so let's so let's make it happen.

564
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,940
I don't know.

565
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
I'm outside right now near the garden.

566
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,600
Just had some chicory coffee I'm gonna go back inside.

567
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,480
Is there any reaction?

568
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,700
What do we have the chat?

569
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,780
I could open the emails I don't know who's listening or what's listening.

570
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:27,740
But Bruce anything you want to add or take away Well, you know I sat and listen Sam.

571
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:53,950
I really respect your ideas on this But we we've got These streams going out to people at different walks of life different areas different time zones Yes, I Can I expect nothing from people on chat by the way and that has nothing that's neither here nor there But Greek has a right personal circle.

572
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,370
He has his own professional connections.

573
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,350
He gets emails I don't know.

574
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:05,790
I don't know if the quality of the communication in the emails differ significantly from the chat, but I've garnered that yeah, they do They're better if nothing.

575
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:22,090
Yeah, right So there there's a lot of things that are not on the table as part of this discussion That you know, I know of privately he knows of privately so if there's no effort being made to move It's not for lack of there being no pathway to walk down That's what I'm saying.

576
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,170
So the alternative to that is is this which is you know redundant?

577
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:42,090
To sit here and you know go on we can we can have a good conversation here on these streams But I'm just talking about this aspect of continuously lampooning the state of society and people's unwillingness to act Which is neither here nor there because that'll change in two or three years.

578
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,890
Anyway, so right this should just be put aside and

579
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:50,210
Yeah, but by the way, then, you know, what's in the short

580
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:56,070
what's going to change in the next few years is the level of tension is going to increase and

581
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,430
and when some of the cosmic censorship is

582
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,670
Let go so people are more open

583
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,970
So it won't really even though they can see more

584
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,430
It's not going to benefit them because the tension will be higher you see

585
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,560
Sure, but anyway

586
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,080
Because otherwise, how are they going to be deceived later on?

587
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:23,360
So if everything's hunky-dory all the way through so right now we still have the luxury look quote-unquote to

588
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,100
Well, either openly or semi-openly discuss these things, but I assure you in the next few years

589
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,540
There's going to be a lot more tension in the air from various

590
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,340
Things are going to see people are going to be more urgent about other things

591
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,740
And how do we get things out you see and at the same time the censorship will be lifted

592
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,160
more and more

593
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,600
Yeah, that's fine.

594
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,440
And by that time you should be ready to reposition yourself based on the things that you've learned.

595
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,620
So There's an appropriateness that goes even with that now if you haven't reached that level, that's your problem.

596
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,860
I have no problems not you

597
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,540
But whoever it may concern it's their problem

598
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,060
Mm-hmm, so

599
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,420
Once again, it's not it to me

600
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,480
It's never about the masses or what humanity has in a holistic sense wants to do

601
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,000
it's about people that are interested and you cannot tell me that there are not people that are genuinely interested and

602
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,280
willing to pursue this

603
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,560
route of inquiry

604
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,880
the question is can we establish who they are and put together some kind of a

605
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,300
However, small collective of people to to to pursue something and yeah, I'm pretty sure that can be done

606
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,920
But I don't see it being done by the Greek which is fine

607
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:39,000
but you know, it does put a dent somewhat into the the legitimacy of these

608
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,420
Complaints as I call them because you could be doing more we could well, okay

609
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,240
But remember this is knowledge basis information base.

610
00:56:47,340 --> 00:57:02,720
There isn't a there isn't a product being sold, you know where people do e-commerce Right, even even if it's a writ, there's nothing being sold like as a product You know how people sell DVDs and books or you from informational also, I mean, it's informational based.

611
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:13,100
We're not Doing confer physical conferences or trying to build, you know, how people do funding drives or go fund me to get something done Mm-hmm, right.

612
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,500
There is no physical thing.

613
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:19,960
It's not like the sponge Divers who said let's go sink an aircraft carrier or something like that.

614
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,180
It was there is no

615
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,140
Man a physical manifestation of this

616
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:31,420
just because there isn't any manufacturing or economic component doesn't mean that that the only reason that there isn't is because we

617
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,500
The endeavor is not at that stage yet where that is pertinent

618
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,680
But even if only at an informational level this was something that was given priority

619
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,200
We would see what we would see a more comprehensive Greek website

620
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,960
We would perhaps see some kind of a collection of Greek speak writings somewhere

621
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:52,040
We would see something that is more useful than random streams that are really hard to find unless you're part of chat

622
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:58,420
So even on the informational level, this is not being hammered in in a way that suggests any urgency anyway

623
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:06,900
So the whatever level of analysis that we apply to this effort this criticism to go all around

624
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,640
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

625
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:23,140
So I'll accept that but doesn't it doesn't It doesn't change the matter It doesn't matter meaning in other words that doesn't inspire me or anyone else to say, okay.

626
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,420
Well, maybe we should do something

627
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,740
You know, here's the interesting thing

628
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,580
There is an example

629
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:40,160
Okay years ago, you know what a tone arm on a turntable it holds the cartridge which is the stylus

630
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,580
You know that you swing over and drop on the vinyl record

631
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,720
And the audio file said oh, it's really important that if you use it, you know

632
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,200
Something between the base of the cartridge and the tone arm it changes if you bond it slightly

633
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,800
So it's not just bolted in you use some kind of bonding agent.

634
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,240
It sounds better You get better bass a little more dynamic.

635
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,960
So this music sounds a little clearer.

636
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:08,240
We found that this this Stuff that they use the real like decoupage glue.

637
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:13,980
It's like white wood glue, but it it's not even for wood It's like just tissue paper anything beyond tissue paper.

638
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:24,040
It doesn't hold very well Well, we put a little layer of that underneath a tone arm and a cartridge and bonded it and it kind of stuck pretty good And you could break it off and clean it off.

639
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,320
You could rub it, you know comes off, right?

640
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,560
and we bought a gallon of that for eight bucks and

641
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,060
We put it in quarter or tenth ounce bottles

642
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:41,420
Which so bet that that gallon made a thousand bottles and we sold the little tiny 10,000 10th of an ounce bottles for $10 each

643
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:49,260
So eight dollars were worth of the stuff and forty dollars worth of packaging yielded about

644
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,500
$2,000 and we called it tweak and

645
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,020
And none of the people were all the wiser all the better to say hey

646
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,200
This is just that really cheap ass decoupage glue.

647
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,300
They thought it was some high-end formula Do you see?

648
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:15,660
But you see but if we told them go to the store and get some decoupage glue And that's enough to do a hundred turntables even a small amount for two dollars Do you think they would listen?

649
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,700
No, they wouldn't buy it.

650
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,160
It's that's ridiculous For that coupons glue on a high-end turntable.

651
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,500
That's stupid But if you repackage it to something you Bruce you understand what I'm saying, right?

652
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,620
Oh, yeah Mm-hmm.

653
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:42,880
Yeah So there's your marketing in other words, that's why nothing's gonna check because I'm not gonna go down that route I'm telling people I'm telling people this stuff is this decoupage glue and they're like No, that can't be good.

654
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,880
That can't be true.

655
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,800
I Can just see that happening to yeah.

656
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, it's company called cheating the 80s

657
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,300
We also did you know, if you look at highly polished metal under a microscope, it looks like the Grand Canyon

658
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:59,480
You know, we're mountains and valleys a very good, you know, so when you put interconnects together

659
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,680
We found that if you put slightly conductive mineral oil it increases the contact of the two

660
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,460
Pieces of metal by 20 or 30 percent and again that sounded better

661
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,700
so we did we went up a tenth of an ounce bottles and got unscented mineral oil a

662
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,940
Gallon of it was like four bucks and we said we sold the tenth of an ounce for ten dollars also

663
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,320
do the math that so, you know ten less than ten dollars of mineral oil and

664
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:30,220
$50 worth of containers made another two or three thousand called it tweak connect, you know

665
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,840
This is it back in the 80s, but if we told people

666
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:39,100
Wrote a little article and said hey just try this inexpensive mineral oil with a swab on your

667
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,580
Interconnects will sound better.

668
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,160
Nah.

669
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,800
Nah, that's not gonna work.

670
01:01:42,960 --> 01:02:08,060
Nah, I Was just picturing my my friend from back in them days who was a real audio nut He was a sound engineer high-end Audio systems for the time you think back then it was a quad I and I'm just picturing him shaking his head in Disbelief and and what he would be uttering.

671
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:26,740
So yes, I can relate to this totally Yeah, let's go back to what Sam was saying about each Sam You said you noticed that there was discrepancies in Events and and days of observances as well as you were you you were young You said around 11 or so you noticed that the you know, that was evident, right?

672
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,960
Mm-hmm.

673
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,340
Okay.

674
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:38,880
Well, that's because you know, and you said you went and did video It just went about your life like nothing like it wasn't a big deal because if you made a big deal of it It wouldn't be a it would be a non event also, right?

675
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:59,580
but but it does apply like The middle of the month when the moon is dark metals do not coalesce in crystal form or plating So it when you know, the metal plating industry is very large like doorknobs kitchen faucets bathroom faucets You know all that chrome that you see and Fancy brass that's a plating.

676
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,340
All right, and there is a large industry that does that and their reject rate

677
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,640
Meaning where the blemishes are high and and it doesn't pass

678
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,960
Standard is highest around the dark moon

679
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,080
This is documented by the way

680
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,000
But they

681
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,180
But they persist on running their operations

682
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:30,140
During just as if it's any other day on the dark moon and they put up with the blemishes and the defects and

683
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,540
They just you know, we do them

684
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,040
So there's some total of that.

685
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:45,110
So it's so some total of that is that it's not a non event for them Is it right if you can't apply it?

686
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:55,950
Yeah, but see but here hold on But if they look at the regular calendar one month, it might be the 13th the next month It'll be the 20th so they can't use the popes work schedule.

687
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:00,010
They have to find a moon Schedule, you know or visibly do it, right?

688
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:04,590
That's what once you suggest that that's now you might as well.

689
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:24,990
It would be no different Then going to the appointment to the CEO I'm speaking firsthand now of that company and instead of walking in, you know in Casual Western attire or business attire you walk in with a bone in your nose and face paint with your hair up You know with a with, you know chicken wings and chicken blood on you.

690
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:37,980
It's that's the reaction you're gonna get From them the minute you say that not once but twice but three times in industry once you bring this up Like you're some kind of voodoo doctor You see what I mean?

691
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,060
Mm-hmm.

692
01:04:40,500 --> 01:05:01,820
Oh And another thing of my favorite thing is oh, we're gonna run this by our site University scientists and they'll tell us Right, I had what somebody wants to tell me Oh Greek your water stuff doesn't work because I couldn't find anything I talked to some people at university and they never heard of it So it can't work Okay, so there is your your what does it go?

693
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,180
Who are these people in industry?

694
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,180
They're humans, right and they're part of that culture.

695
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,320
So it's not the people.

696
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:24,760
It's the culture that you're going against you see and And in order to and you might be going against it because you've pulled yourself out and when you pull yourself out when you come Back in you can't relate to them the way they're used to the only thing you could do is inform them So let me go back When you you know the plating shops, I don't know.

697
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,900
Are you familiar with how they work?

698
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:46,680
They have three shifts They're basically going 24-7 Right, because the reason they have the three shifts and they go 24-7 is because the labor is not that expensive It's economically feasible to do so because it's Mostly mechanized, you know, you put into these tubs of liquid the liquid doesn't care the conveyor belt doesn't care You just need someone to man the operation right Bruce.

699
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:55,300
It's a mess like two people three people can produce a 10,000 Metal plating Yeah, okay.

700
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:55,820
There you go.

701
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,440
It's just bath bathtub square.

702
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,740
It's just bats of liquid and conveyors and inspectors.

703
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:23,560
Yeah, okay Yeah, so they have these things running 24-7 You see so when you approach them and you give them this kind of information They look at you and say well This has been going on this way for so long and look at everything we've invested in you How can you be the only one that's noticing that knows this can't be true?

704
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:41,160
You see they don't look at it so It's not only the people in industry It's the you know, and he and Jack Fresco does a thing about this also I'll bring him up again when like when you he brings up a few examples like this Thin wire can hold 5,000 tons.

705
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,500
Most people say nah, no way, but if you speak to an engineer Engineer will say oh really?

706
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,140
What's the tensile strength of that and he'll go and test it, right?

707
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:58,180
Or if you show them a little point and say this is 50,000 lumens But the average present not in a million years that will light engineer won't say that it says how do you power that?

708
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,560
What is it made of right?

709
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:05,140
But I'm telling you one step beyond that is that when you do go to the engineers They still don't want to hear it.

710
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,920
So there's another this is in other words

711
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,860
If you you have to be plausible to get through to people

712
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:19,820
Yeah, but what you I mean, you're making it look as if you're taking this you're trying to take the situation apply to a broader

713
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,120
Exposition on the state of society what I hear you doing is grieving about your impotency

714
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,220
To penetrate industry with your endeavors or to reach through to industry folks

715
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,360
I mean, that's you know, it's it's regrettable.

716
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:43,340
But ultimately that was a small factor of things Yes, it is but it's not it's not regrettable because it's many many many people like I said I know a handful of inventors and their inventions are genuine.

717
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:54,220
They're very unique and they can't penetrate either No one could penetrate the state it because they they don't want to you have to understand the times and you have to understand what?

718
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,040
It takes to go through that

719
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,180
Like the Wright brothers never read all the peer-reviewed scientific papers that said heavier than air flight was not possible

720
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,560
They never read those peer reviews

721
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,760
Yeah, and that's why they develop, you know what they did and it wasn't just the Wright brothers

722
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,220
There were other people that were doing and they were viewed as kooks or you know on the fringe

723
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:21,779
You know, for example the US the Wright brothers did several demonstrations from the military and and the military denied it

724
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,100
And it wasn't until the Wright brothers went to the World's Fair in Paris and they were greeted

725
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,920
You know with great fanfare and publicity then the military says, okay.

726
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:48,920
We'll look consider it So it's not a matter of penetrating industry or whatever, it's a matter of public opinion if you if I gave you the idea of why you didn't penetrate industry is because What they do is is let's we're gonna call a university and see if they could substantiate this.

727
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:53,500
I'd never don't bother You see Or look at us.

728
01:08:53,560 --> 01:09:17,260
We've been we have 50 million invested in in several plants and we've had people from all over the world Consultants none of them ever said any of this So it can't be true So maybe then what it is to go to the media and have the New York Times write an article about it Then you think the plating people will come back and say well, it will consider your dark moon theory now Yeah, yeah, sir.

729
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:17,920
I hear what you're saying

730
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,080
But the end all be all of this diatribe is that ultimately people are stupid right which is a circulant

731
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:31,899
They're stupid about many things they're moronic meaning they're stuck in an immature mental rat irrational state

732
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,600
You're right all the same right which is caught no, it's not the same

733
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:41,740
It's very like idiocy is different than more being a moron and being stupid and being ignorant

734
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,399
Those are different levels

735
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:47,819
There is a mental cognitive handicap that prevents people from moving forward.

736
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:48,180
Essentially.

737
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,600
It's all this It's it's a deficient.

738
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:56,700
In other words, it's a deficiency that you don't want around if you're gonna have progress and efficiency You can't have that.

739
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Yeah, right So I'm just struggling to see the viability of this type of polemic if it if we're not going to break new ground This ground has been broken since Ocelli in the Greek days So at some point it has it has to be left behind and other things explored.

740
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:12,800
Oh

741
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,260
There's tons of stuff to explore

742
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:20,200
There's stuff in industry that I'm considering right now that I have I am not discussing and have not discussed

743
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,540
That's quite interesting and because of my experience

744
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,100
I ponder it and

745
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:31,260
What I'm probably going to do is have a more diversified or different approach than before

746
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,160
But then the standard approach right the standard approach is approach those

747
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,780
Excuse me already in the industry or do it yourself

748
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:44,560
But neither one is really viable because you know when you try to do anything yourself

749
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,440
You are the the let's say the boss the worker the mop the janitor the accountant

750
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,920
It's it's a 30 hour a day job, right?

751
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:01,340
If you've ever been on a business venture where you have you're dealing in an industry you have to portray or you have to

752
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,860
Satisfy all the needs of the operation which are many and that's not what I want to do

753
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,160
And I don't want to go approach the industry

754
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:15,800
There's another way in between and I'll discuss that maybe if we're still speaking publicly or whatever in the next few weeks or months

755
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,220
Okay, there's still being

756
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,300
And it's quite interesting and I did bring something up in the last sonic that the for example

757
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,940
I would suggest that someone does a highly marketed website

758
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:34,160
that invites even viable or semi viable ideas for people to publish and

759
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:40,100
Also is sent to the Patent Office and the International Patent Office on a regular basis even if they ignore it

760
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,760
Even if you don't get a response

761
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,960
What that'll do is it'll throw a major

762
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:51,140
Patent industry because basically the patent industry is to restrict is create restrictions, right?

763
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,360
Basically, you know if Michelin tire comes up with a new tire and they patent it

764
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,360
Well, the other tire companies can't use it unless they license it from Michelin so restricts the industry

765
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,740
right and the reason for this is because I was doing some research and

766
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,660
There's a guy in the 80s on a spoof

767
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,560
He did it he looked kind of technical a document called a digital loudspeaker

768
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,720
And he showed how it would work and a friend of his or he was a writer at a magazine

769
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,220
They published it and even today when people want to get a patent on a digital loudspeaker.

770
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,600
The Patent Office will cite that publication

771
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,320
Public notice and they will not issue a patent

772
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,360
So the there will never be a patent issued to digital loudspeakers or very slim

773
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,600
they will be because this guy wrote a

774
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,000
comprehensive

775
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,300
fictional or a science fiction article on how

776
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:46,860
Digital loudspeaker would work in the 80s and the and the Patent Office is still citing it today

777
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:52,320
So if anyone has any broad or narrow ideas about a gizmo a device or a methodology

778
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,820
You can have a website where they just do a comprehensive if they can't we'll find someone who could write it up

779
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,740
Descriptively and just put it up there and send it to the past so that in the future if one of these big companies like

780
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:07,820
Apple or whatever wants to patent this they can't because it's already been made public

781
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,300
People don't understand how patents work.

782
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,700
They think you have to have a patent

783
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:11,840
No

784
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,740
If it's publicized the Patent Office will research it and if they do find it

785
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,680
They will not issue the patent not because it has previously patented but previously

786
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,380
publicized you see

787
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,520
so that would be a great thing to throw a

788
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,740
monkey wrench into industry or whatever that entire

789
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,080
gamut called patent patenting or patent

790
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,120
Patent licensing and all I think that whole thing needs to go away.

791
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:36,800
You know what I mean?

792
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:52,220
How you get what you're saying, but I mean a lot that's an idea in itself right there that that should be implemented Yeah, but this is you can't just pull out ideas and say that this would be interesting or this would be interesting I mean there has no it's not interesting.

793
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,620
It's more than interesting.

794
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,320
It's it's more.

795
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:05,340
It's almost like a public domain protection Because if someone if there's if someone if an idea is put out there and someone can't capture it Hey, let me give you another example.

796
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,780
It's in pharmaceuticals How many times do you you know have you here?

797
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,300
Well the reason why they they offer this drug is because they're patentable, right?

798
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,300
All right, that's why they do that, but but if something is not patentable

799
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,340
There's no benefit to them you see

800
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,820
To do it to get involved in it

801
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,740
so if you have all these

802
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,740
Semi-synthetic compounds

803
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:36,160
Anyone in biology that understands that have applications for let's say medicinal purposes even on a far shot start publishing them

804
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,440
So the big pharmaceutical companies can't do it

805
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,660
Do you see what I mean just throw a monkey wrench?

806
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,740
Yeah, did I cut it out for a second you might have yeah?

807
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,880
Okay, it's not a night.

808
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,480
Just an idea.

809
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,560
What if it should be done?

810
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:56,720
in other words to to balance out the Wanton wanton Capitalism which is useless, right?

811
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:18,940
Yeah, but what I was saying, I don't know if I cut out is that that that still feels like a zero-sum effort I mean look at a lot of what you're talking about to me Sounds like it has the veneer of careerism attached to it where a person goes out In carves a space for himself within an industry works with a bunch of people There's a research funding manufacturing distribution element and to me.

812
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:29,080
I'm like for what though like comparatively That is an interesting when you position it next to scripture and say that you're gonna pursue that which is to me a higher Order of things like what are we gonna?

813
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:39,480
Go do all this industry stuff for for what it's not gonna be here But it's not even if you want to you want to talk about industry scripture is an industry What's the most highly printed book in the world?

814
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,440
Statistically, that's no I don't know from I know but from a mentally ma mental model.

815
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,120
What's the only mental model?

816
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,740
I know but hold on.

817
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,460
It's not scripture

818
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:57,260
But it's the only book that you'll see published that goes from Genesis to Revelation or Genesis to the Psalms

819
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:00,080
So it is you know, they're modeling it after that

820
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,660
You see and by the way

821
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:08,940
you know, the King James was considered copywritten and restricted in many academic uses back in the day and

822
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,860
Obviously, it's a version but when you bring up the entire subject

823
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,400
Just like I've said and I think it's very rational to say so when people say well

824
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,060
I want to just read the interlinear or the Hebrew and the Greek.

825
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:38,240
I'm like, well, yes, that's that's good to extract the the Key point so you could communicate what it's about But if you're going to have a discussion with pretty much anyone in the Western world You must know the King James because that's the level on how they're going to discuss it.

826
01:16:38,280 --> 01:17:00,280
Also, you know, although Only when I say that you won't even be able to have you won't even most likely Succeed in having a rational discussion in the King James because what they're going to be do is giving you the core doctrine That's it's created Now you can have a good discussion that depends on your level of communication Once again, that's each person's business and that can be done.

827
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:06,380
I've done it to a certain extent and It's yielded, you know results that are satisfactory for me.

828
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,640
I didn't do it out of altruism

829
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:14,120
But that's between you and yourself like a lot of the things that you talk about should be addressed at the level of the individual

830
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:18,580
Where it's it's about your effort and it's about your willingness to pursue a certain thing

831
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:24,120
But instead you and you address it at the level of the group, which is completely useless because the groups won't don't get anywhere

832
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,280
Well, then I'd have to do one-on-one like a psychotherapist.

833
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:29,870
I

834
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,770
mean at the level of

835
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:35,470
Analysis that we're at all the only thing that matters is the individual

836
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:40,270
Individuals who are willing to participate in this endeavor as a matter of almost personal gain

837
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:47,270
I do this for personal gain not necessarily in the economic dimension, but certainly in the cognitive dimension anything knowledge

838
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,390
Knowledge is its own reward, by the way

839
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:50,970
Yes

840
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:55,350
Wisdom has its own reward because you can you how many fools I would say

841
01:17:55,350 --> 01:18:00,230
Do you know that are worth tens or hundreds of millions and they're just fools and if I?

842
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,690
In in someone would you want their money?

843
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:06,070
Well the answer to most people would say yes, but would you know in order to get their money?

844
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,350
You have to be a fool like them.

845
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:13,860
I'd quickly say no Yeah, so what I yeah, so you go back to tool.

846
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:14,840
Yeah, so you go.

847
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:26,140
Well, yeah Now if you want to say that but that's being but that's being done anyway behind, you know at the scenes I don't discuss I don't take all that Okay.

848
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:26,540
Okay.

849
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,240
So then there are people that I'm in communication with that do call for consent.

850
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:41,020
Yeah and counts counseling on various things Yeah, no, I what then if you know that there is a realm in which some kind of progress is being made Why are you getting on these?

851
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:42,860
Diatribes.

852
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,400
Oh, why should I don't know?

853
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,220
Maybe maybe it's it's time not to not to not do it at all.

854
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:54,820
Yeah Well or not no diatribe Pull up a subject and let's discuss it or not.

855
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,020
We could just you could just send the stream right here.

856
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:05,580
That's fine Of course, there's things that could be discussed but I Just don't know what you're doing Why are we not discussing the things?

857
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:06,860
Why are we talking about this stuff?

858
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:08,800
This other stuff.

859
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:11,880
Well, let's just let's just well, let's just focus on one thing.

860
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,640
What's interesting is that right now?

861
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,900
What what?

862
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:24,220
Just change the subject segue This is obvious but the Comprehension of prophecy is is of dire importance, right?

863
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:34,400
if anyone is going to be a student of scripture they Need to prioritize understanding Prophecy, which is multifaceted.

864
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,880
You have to understand how to keep time.

865
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,000
You have to understand what is

866
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:43,360
Coming in the future based on what has happened in the past and what how it will be different

867
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,940
and also you have to understand how to discern the lack of

868
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:54,520
detail of this current society and what I mean detail in this current society in the biblical narrative is that you don't see like

869
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,520
computers actually being mentioned and automobiles and

870
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,900
Rocket ships and right all this stuff.

871
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,920
So you need to understand the narrative

872
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:11,400
The this the very partly nature of the narrative, you know, in other words, there's no detail regarding our society

873
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,760
so you can't use the details or

874
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,600
Or lack of them that are in the narrative to pinpoint where you are

875
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,300
So you have to understand timekeeping and when and how events will repeat and that is really a dire

876
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,020
Need in the comprehension of scripture, believe it or not.

877
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:40,680
So your knowledge, you know history would also have to be pretty good then, too Yes, and but the history that pertains to scripture correct now now how often have you been in a situation?

878
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:53,580
Where let's use the term again Like we've been discussing a group of people that you found completely irrelevant or stupid If you were to go explain that group to another Group or a colleague, would you give a lot of detail?

879
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:01,760
No, you just say there's a bunch of idiots that like to go and do this and that's it That's how the scriptural narrative is when it comes to this society.

880
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:05,500
The gods are not impressed by anything technological that we're doing

881
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:06,660
obviously

882
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,880
They're not impressed by

883
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:10,560
much

884
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,340
Really, there may be a few individuals were you know, we're impressive to the gods and that's it

885
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,600
It for us to you know mention

886
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:25,280
So, how do you how do you know what's coming and how it's going to come because if people did comprehend the scripture

887
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:30,380
On these worldwide events, don't you think some would cry foul when they were happening?

888
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:45,520
but I'm telling you they're gonna be happening in front of everyone and no one's gonna be noticing and I don't mean no one because it does say some people do So, how do you put that together in today's language and comprehensible in today's mindset?

889
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:55,360
That would be a project to do all right In itself, but you know when people start discussing I need an interlinear for what?

890
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,520
Through osmosis.

891
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:02,260
You just put it on your head and you sleep with it at night and you'll understand it doesn't work that way

892
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,460
Yeah, let's go back to another way to look at it

893
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:10,360
If you were if if all you had was the King James Version

894
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:16,600
That's it and you read it with comprehension more than once or twice you would get about 90% of it

895
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:25,580
it would be extremely frustrating because after the first or second reading you would start to notice anomalies because the

896
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:31,120
What the words that are being used are not supported by following doctrine in the text.

897
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,900
So you'd say that word cannot be here, right?

898
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,000
Like for example, he says my name is the Lord.

899
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,800
I am your God

900
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,740
Well, you there's only so many times you could read that and say well Lord is not a name

901
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,920
there's something else missing here and you mark that as

902
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:52,200
spurious or a detail that is erroneous you see and then you're finally going to keep going and

903
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,940
Notice things that just don't make any rational sense, but you're going to get the story

904
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:02,500
You're going to get the timeline even though the books are out of order and you're going to get the law

905
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
Because if you don't understand the law

906
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,660
You're not going to understand the principles that are given in other places, right?

907
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:28,230
Mm-hmm So that's strictly with the King James no interlinear you can do that By the way, you can do that with the requisite level of urgency and focus, which is very rarefied Very rarely, but we're not talking about it.

908
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:45,270
It is possible Yeah, and you're also saying that in retrospect after having done your own research over the period of a decade plus So once again, that's out of most people's purview to even say it's possible it's it's still impractical Sure.

909
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:46,030
Sure it is.

910
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:57,390
But because ultimately Let me give you an example that might be helpful just sticking with the King James and I ran into someone Stayed over here for a few days during the Passover about a decade ago.

911
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:58,750
It was an older head.

912
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:11,130
He was twice my age and We were talking about scripture and a couple of people brought out some different versions and I and he looked at me and he says Yeah, you know after a while of reading the King James you end up finding out where all the mistakes are It's no big deal, right?

913
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,150
He's that's what he told me.

914
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:13,290
I said, yeah, exactly

915
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:17,630
He supplied that to me, you know, and I was thinking the same thing

916
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,070
You see it was in other words

917
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:24,630
We had a parallel thought on the document because what was arising during there were other people here

918
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:27,910
There were arguments or debate on which version was better

919
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:32,190
And I just we just looked at each other and basically said if you find out where the mistakes are, it's no big deal

920
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:40,830
You know on a general doctrinal point of view, but you're gonna miss there are specifics that you will miss by the way

921
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,690
You know, like the word forgive is not in there, you know

922
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:47,850
And things like that, you know, and the word sin will not really be defined

923
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,430
Until you go to the you know

924
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:53,670
The one that give is not there, but the word pardon sort of is

925
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:59,270
The word pardon is yeah, but it's not yeah, so in other words

926
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:06,710
What there is a benefit to going into the languages of preservation of what we have or can call the languages of preservation?

927
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,150
To the best that we can access still today.

928
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:13,250
You will glean more but they will not change the story that much

929
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,770
You see in some cases if you look at it

930
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:23,870
From a narrow and deep perspective some things are changed very deeply

931
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:32,270
You know like your perspective on the Christ because there's nowhere that you pick up in the King James that his name was

932
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:37,690
Yeshua or Joshua if you use the J you see you don't pick that up

933
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,020
But once you find out it was Yeshua and the sixth book of the Bible's Yeshua if you insist on using letter J

934
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,120
It can't be Jesus.

935
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,520
There's something really amiss there.

936
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:54,580
It has to be Joshua You see so there's some legal ease something a legal loophole.

937
01:25:54,740 --> 01:26:02,280
That's being down there And I think I've explained it on a sonic the reason they use Jesus instead of Joshua's later on if you put their feet to the fire.

938
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,960
They'll say well we never talked about

939
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:08,460
The one in the Bible anyway, this is a whole other invention on top of it

940
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,260
So it's like giving them room for denial

941
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,440
But anyway

942
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,210
No anyway

943
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:30,140
Amen, I'm just I want to move along ever more increasing lines of efficiency when it comes to these kinds of discussion

944
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,620
I'm so past getting

945
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:38,860
Forget about the discussion the thing is you've got any updates or any improvements on food clothing and shelter the rest of it doesn't matter

946
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,460
Well look if here's the thing if you understand scripture.

947
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:41,920
What are you gonna?

948
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,260
Do you can tell your children and grandchildren like it matters?

949
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:54,960
I'm going to stockpile that knowledge until such a time that the times change and I can position myself more efficiently to use it of Course exactly and and you'll be dodged.

950
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,360
Hopefully dodging the cacophony of the Antichrist, right?

951
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:27,340
and his group Yeah, hopefully Yeah And again bringing that point up if it's so obvious You know half the idiots on the internet are talking about this guy Already know the term Antichrist as a world leader Right so how you know It's gonna be a secret who he is even even when he's Performing his duty as such no one will know that it's him.

952
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,900
I mean now say no one.

953
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:50,110
I mean you know the general group So think about the import yeah, well yeah, which is irrelevant Mm-hmm It's irrelevant qualitatively, but quantitatively it is very relevant because it's the mass Majority who cares you love this group stuff, okay?

954
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:56,990
So go do something man go go put together up Do you like I get so you you do it?

955
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:01,270
I'll show up if I do if it's Sonic if it has to be written.

956
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:09,950
It's or whatever is I charge like $2 a word so Maybe five And that's pretty much it.

957
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:18,550
I'm not gonna work for free I'll go paint someone's kitchen to make a hundred bucks.

958
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:36,050
What the hell you know I'm not gonna sit there and write stuff for free No, the writing is the easy part That can be done by Gruntz Yeah, yeah, it's no, but the import of everything is do you know where you are in navigation if you navigating?

959
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:42,670
Scripture and I give many examples if there were plenty of evangelists in World War two in Europe that were crying

960
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:50,510
This is the apocalypse, and it was very convincing when those what bombers were they using b-29s and C

961
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:56,470
Was a tens Bruce were they using World War two that those twin-engine planes that were hard to shoot down

962
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,470
You know you bring a rudder off landed

963
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,830
See nines or something whatever they in that area.

964
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:19,870
Yeah Yeah, they were dry they were blowing the shit out of everything the evangelists on the ground were Saints the apocalypse and the people were saying Yes, it is very convincing But they didn't know how to navigate scripture They didn't know where they were in time if you know how to navigate where you are and how you are you know?

965
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:32,570
You got to know you had to have a clock and the clock is you got to watch what they call Israel The land and the attitude of the people Have we you know I've been doing by the way.

966
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,050
This is a so what am I doing?

967
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,570
You know what is the Greek doing?

968
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,030
I'll tell you what I'm doing recently past year.

969
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:43,270
I've Been doing some very gradual Meaning gradual in one week.

970
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:46,830
I'll do a lot Maybe a month will go by and then I'll do a lot for three weeks.

971
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,110
You know it's it's very spurious

972
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,090
I mean the sporadic on the

973
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:53,950
specifics on the rebuilding of the temple

974
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,610
Right I think we've discussed that at one point

975
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:58,950
I was you and I Sam and I was

976
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:02,970
Ready to fall out and I was like I need to talk about some other time because I've been really looking into and there's a

977
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,370
lot of details that have come up with

978
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:09,710
That is something that is quite interesting that would be a very interesting

979
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:13,430
Because of recent events also to write a short paper on

980
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:18,990
And give the details and the scripture because it's not what you think yes

981
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:23,330
there will be a temple, but it's not going to be the way people envision it and

982
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:31,130
Also putting in detail the other the temples that are mentioned in there you see like Ezekiel's temple

983
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,670
You know is not going to be in Jerusalem.

984
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:45,770
You know so It's gonna be north of it, but Let me just give a little bit a highlight out right now when the The final temple is built.

985
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:50,530
It's going to be completed way at the end Where it where it's ready to be?

986
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,230
dedicated

987
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:59,990
It's it's very very very end because it's not around for a long time before the Antichrist steps in into it

988
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,270
You know it's like brand-new almost

989
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:07,300
You see what I mean mm-hmm, but there's so much political

990
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,830
Mayhem that surrounds the concept of the temple that needs to be forgotten and

991
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:16,230
Pushed aside, and it needs to be more practical

992
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,250
before

993
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,650
You know it actually happens

994
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:22,470
And it's not going to be on the Mount of Olives like certain groups

995
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:26,910
State because unless they scrape the Mount of Olives down to bedrock

996
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,930
Because you're not it because what is the Mount of Olives predominantly

997
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,430
Known for it's a cemetery.

998
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:42,370
You know cemetery, and you can't bill It would be you can't put it on top of a cemetery unless you scraped it down to bedrock You waited a moon or two, right?

999
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:44,850
So anyway

1000
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:52,290
There's some very you know very specific points that need to be

1001
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,330
Addressed that are in Scripture that no one is talking about

1002
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,410
So and

1003
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:05,130
Some of the points you see what happens is the scripture will give you like a B's in C

1004
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:11,850
D won't be there, but you can write about D because of a B and C you see it's like a it's like a triangulation

1005
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:15,650
They'll give you the coordinates and you then start naming the location

1006
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,260
We've already discussed that the Antichrist is not going to have an open

1007
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:27,620
Assyrian identity and various things like that there's other things that could be discussed about him

1008
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:36,020
He will be a Syrian, but not openly right, I think you said Jewish.

1009
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,340
Yeah, he was gonna show today Yes, yeah, did you do?

1010
01:32:39,860 --> 01:33:10,840
Yeah, yeah So as in as in lineage right right Because if you read in Scripture like in the New Testament is the festival of the Jews It doesn't say that's the festival the Judeans and the Judeans had adapted Babylonian timekeeping They still used the Levitical days, but they did him on Babylonian times That's why the Christ when he was invited to go to the feast of booths.

1011
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,440
I think in Mark He says this is not my time.

1012
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:24,540
This is your time It's an evil time and a lot of Christians or whatever cite that as the holiday being bad No is he specifically discussing when it was being done?

1013
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,520
Anyway

1014
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,480
That's that's a very obvious point

1015
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:37,780
But you know with mental modeling people don't see it because they've approached it with a model that they've been shown prior to seeing the information

1016
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:52,350
But here's another if you're going to consider from here on out the tension worldwide tension is going to keep increasing

1017
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,710
All the way to the end

1018
01:33:55,250 --> 01:34:01,670
But it's going to get increased to the point also the cosmic censorship will be lifted so you will you can't complain later

1019
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:08,220
that you didn't know and also that you fall for this promise of

1020
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,940
What's going to be done by the you know world geopolitical and religious and scientific community on humanity?

1021
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:24,660
Because you know as time goes on you notice that there's a blur between the legal Scientific and political community you notice that there's everything the lines are blurred.

1022
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:39,240
They all overlap The religious is the site well scientific legal and political overlap You know like the politicians will write a law that you have to have vaccines right and if and then the attorneys back it up Right so they have science.

1023
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:46,560
You know BS bad science politics and Attorneys you know just you know the goddess religion.

1024
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:56,440
They all work together So all this is going to be worked together So that's why I say food clothing shelter just chill the fuck out.

1025
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,560
It's not a family hour.

1026
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:26,700
It's a medical term, but So if you're in don't play this sonic event for your in-laws right Bruce Yeah Anyway Yeah, all right.

1027
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:33,120
Let me see if there's Anything going on here no emails, and I think no one in chat, right?

1028
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,440
Someone's in chat why bother how about the Mets are you supposed to spell dem?

1029
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:50,660
DEM Mets how about dem Mets like turdy turd and turd Mets Dem Mets yeah, damn DEM It's funny again with accents you know if you have a New York accent.

1030
01:35:50,800 --> 01:36:06,540
You know like hey, how you doing turdy turd and turd How about the Mets no matter how smart you are you sound stupid you ever notice that people that have a heavy accent like that It doesn't matter what how smart you are you said you sound stupid Yeah, well you can use that as a form of misdirection.

1031
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:29,350
You just sound stupid doesn't mean you are that's right Anyway so great anything else on your chest no not at all I'm just chillin, bro.

1032
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:30,650
I

1033
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:35,430
Have to I have to take this whole this kind of thing with a measure of light heartedness because it's like

1034
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,570
It's almost like listening to somebody vent

1035
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,030
on some therapy stuff

1036
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:46,130
Depends on what end they're venting from sometimes if they vent from the other end

1037
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:51,150
It's not you don't want to listen to that right whoever smelt it dealt it right remember that when you're a child

1038
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:53,130
Bruce you brought it's an American thing.

1039
01:36:53,390 --> 01:37:08,210
Yeah Because you can vent various ways Yeah, I don't think it's quite reached that level of Flatulence what yeah or turpitude or whatever yeah, it's fine.

1040
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:37,670
It's fine for now But um Yeah, I mean it would be fun to address things with a higher degree of I don't know specialization or certain certain things but um We'll take things as they come I guess I Do think that in general and I think I've said it enough that We can do a bit better than the reoccurring harangues against society and things like that.

1041
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:47,130
It's not against it's just a matter of But just the general the general vibe of you can't go against them and well I Think it's quite.

1042
01:37:47,290 --> 01:38:15,320
I think it's quite scriptural actually Okay, I mean I'm sure that one can bend anything to towards one's bias You know I'm happy to be I'm happy to be a part of streams, but it's a forward bias It's a phone you know anything about electronic design at Bruce You might this might jive with you when you forward bias something.

1043
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,820
Yeah, I can take right.

1044
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,760
Yeah, it's a good thing It is yeah, you're forward biasing look it up.

1045
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:44,410
Yeah Things are generally measured by the extent to which they are they are productive and useful And I don't think anybody feels empowered by being a part of something that leans towards the factuous so This could be this could be done better, and we can do it better, but It depends on you know the extent to which people want to apply themselves.

1046
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:44,770
Well.

1047
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:53,730
There's many ways of doing it you know there's like for example the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a jestful even though.

1048
01:38:53,850 --> 01:39:04,510
It's stupid is a jestful way to Objectify things you know what about writing something well if someone were to visit this planet.

1049
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:06,190
What would they see?

1050
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:28,830
You know Keep it simple make it a children's book or planet earth for dummies You remember those yellow and black books Yeah, I have one of those or you could just make a book of Greek speak No, no, no, I think I think I think bowing out.

1051
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:30,850
I think bowing out of that is

1052
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:39,550
Just speak how about just speak why Greek speak Greek speak is kind of like a pet thing

1053
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:42,610
You know for sonic events in the past

1054
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:51,690
So or speak you know any whatever suits your fancy the point is that things could materialize in a more substantive way

1055
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:55,910
And there there are valid avenues to take that down

1056
01:39:55,910 --> 01:40:00,750
You have the the Winston Churchill book like that's a format if you wanted to do it you could do it

1057
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,390
You know I'm familiar.

1058
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:05,510
I also have one on various quotes from Einstein the

1059
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:08,970
Memoirs of another and see I have it somewhere here

1060
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:16,080
several several people in industry science politics have memoirs, and it's just a compilation of letters and

1061
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:21,330
Quote unquote smart things that were said that were worth memorializing you know

1062
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:26,270
Various formats and doing that with con you know Sun Tzu is a good one

1063
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,970
You know Sun Tzu is only like a few hundred words, but it's it's a it's a small pocket

1064
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:35,230
Version you know several women maybe less than a hundred pages most of its commentary

1065
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:37,690
so you can you can

1066
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,250
compile any bit of information

1067
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,610
With some commentary or not

1068
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:46,810
If you're here's the other thing if you're going to avoid any commentary.

1069
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:49,030
You know what you do right t-shirts

1070
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:50,770
anyway

1071
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,370
So right

1072
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,070
You have bite-sized

1073
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:06,650
Presentations at BYTE or however either way that's fine, but

1074
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:11,510
Yeah, I think it has to if it's anything's going to be done

1075
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:15,890
It's going to have to be from an objective point of view as one would say visiting planet Earth

1076
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:17,490
And you'd have to go break it down

1077
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:23,870
You know temporarily conditionally qualitatively you know temporarily would be you know spring summer

1078
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:32,690
Fall winter these are the you know you know building up growing and breaking down events on this you know political whatever personal

1079
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,830
Happen this way.

1080
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:36,350
You know it's just be real objective.

1081
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:44,960
I keep history out of it unless you have to show an analogy That's why history is bullshit.

1082
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:45,720
It's too neat

1083
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:52,980
Anyone who's has any practical experience on this planet knows that nothing is as smooth and as neat as history is shown

1084
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:58,150
That's your first sign that it's bullshit

1085
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,380
right so

1086
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,340
It's too tidy

1087
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,560
Even people's concept of the scripture is too tidy

1088
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,740
You know like I think on the last sonic event I brought up

1089
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:19,680
I heard several people during the week and different aspects of life say why does God you know they don't know

1090
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:24,760
But this is what they said why does God allow all this misery in the world, and I'm like duh

1091
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,300
It's very clear in scripture.

1092
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:28,740
They have no problem killing

1093
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,320
85,000 Assyrians in their sleep

1094
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:37,400
Did it say may they rest in peace after they did that no

1095
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:44,100
Right so I mean come on the people's miscon you know how do you give a miscon

1096
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:48,880
Misconception of the gods is by just leaving all information about them out

1097
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,320
It's not that they have a misconception

1098
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,420
They have no information you see

1099
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,880
So start from scratch on that

1100
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,100
Mm-hmm

1101
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,920
I'm sure you've heard that before

1102
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:12,920
Say how can God allow all this because it's not that they're misconceived that they have no concept no information when someone asks that no

1103
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,860
information at all

1104
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:19,580
How can you so it's like asking?

1105
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:21,140
Why do people get hit by cars?

1106
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:42,470
You know it's it's like well Get inside of one get busy or whatever or have a mechanical failure and see how easy it is to do that When the time is right, so I mean you know they have no concept they have no concept not a miss So the thing is again.

1107
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,470
There's no constant.

1108
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:48,710
There's no information out there, but yet it seems like you have practical industry

1109
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:51,250
practical culture practical

1110
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:56,210
Science practical whatever right it's practical is it it seems practical

1111
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:15,050
Yeah, I think food clothing shelter and that encompasses knowledge of the human body which is also the mind

1112
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:17,750
Which

1113
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,570
Is completely intangible

1114
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:25,960
between that that transitions segues into the realm of you know other realms, let's say the gods and

1115
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:32,190
Is would be paramount because everyone has one you're presuming that anyone and everyone

1116
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:39,170
That you're approaching let's say like you said earlier marketing this information to as a human body, right?

1117
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:51,950
So that would be what they all have in common, so you have to cover that really first Or within you know primary so I Mean again.

1118
01:44:51,970 --> 01:45:05,430
I've had several healings this past week Pretty deep cut and like okay Put the squeeze on it paper towel electrical tape and next day.

1119
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:19,130
It looks like a paper cut and if it would have been a standard Westerner in America they would have ran to the hospital So it works well with burns as well You ever lean up against something hot, and you don't know what's hot and you're like wait a second.

1120
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:20,150
Oh, I'm being burned

1121
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:21,310
right

1122
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,130
And you pull yourself away

1123
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:29,410
That's very common by the way with people that have motorcycles larger motorcycles where the exhaust pipes are exposed

1124
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:36,110
You'll see burns on the inside of their legs from the between the ankle and then the calf if you've ever seen that before

1125
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:40,390
Usually usually women that ride on the back

1126
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:45,930
You know of the older motorcycles now they tend to tuck exhaust pipes

1127
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:48,770
So they're out of the way Bruce.

1128
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,890
Are you familiar with what I'm saying?

1129
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:50,690
Oh, yeah?

1130
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:59,210
Yeah, people in shorts get on a motorcycle You know a 10 15 20 30 year old motorcycle exhaust pipes coming out the side.

1131
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:01,290
Yeah, oh, yeah They're not you know.

1132
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:05,550
Yeah, you don't know you're burned until you smell something or you're like why why am I so uncomfortable?

1133
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:20,210
Oh, you're being burned idiot Right it's not like you're approaching a hot stove, and you know it's hot and when you touch it You immediately retract knowing that it was going to burn you before it actually does that's the less severe.

1134
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:20,670
Let's say

1135
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:24,770
but what I'm saying also the the

1136
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:29,950
Extreme compression on the body for also works with burns

1137
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:36,790
I've had discussions in the future about how burns can be treated even to some real esoteric stuff

1138
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:42,790
Which we've discounted ever heard of someone called the burn doctor when someone is burned the you call them up and give them some

1139
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:46,550
Information and they do some kind of radionics thing on you no matter where you are in the world

1140
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:48,610
The burner the burn heals faster

1141
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,810
I shouldn't have even said this because I don't endorse that

1142
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:53,930
But I just want to throw it out there that stuff like that exists

1143
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:56,370
Mmm.

1144
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,420
Yeah, yeah

1145
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:04,100
So and they have a lot of testimonials they even have people in fire departments

1146
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:06,900
They pull someone out of a building and they have their ID

1147
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,320
they just want like the day you were born in your name and

1148
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,280
Then they do a radionics thing and you heal faster

1149
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:18,660
And there's testimonies that people have and I did but there's people also that I've told to use it

1150
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:24,680
This is a while back decade or so or less and they said I'm not sure but we know

1151
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:29,500
There's other ways because what a burn actually is here's a here's a hint

1152
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:36,100
Have you heard me discuss energy how electricity heat and light are interchangeable

1153
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:43,140
You could take light make electricity heat make a little light or they're all three interchangeably ever heard of someone

1154
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:49,040
Getting burned by light, you know sunburn right you ever heard of getting burned by electricity or getting burned by heat

1155
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,140
They're all interchangeable.

1156
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:55,820
So essentially what a burn is is Light heat and electricity which are interchangeable.

1157
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,840
It's like saying steam water and ice.

1158
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,620
It's the same thing, right?

1159
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:10,420
When you get a burn what it is It's something compromising the insulation of the body because you're electrical the skin is Imagine in a very rudimentary sense.

1160
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:31,400
This is not really accurate, but just to meant to model a thought Imagine your body is the wire and or a conductor and the skin is the insulation That's pretty easy to imagine that analogy and Can you imagine a wire where the insulation gets burned pretty easy analogy?

1161
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,920
Right anyone who's has a curling iron or a toaster or electric stove, right?

1162
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:45,300
You've seen that done before right soldering iron, especially So how do you and but now that we know that the heat is actually electricity or light or heat?

1163
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:53,600
Not and or or either form So then what do you know about insulators and what do you know about heat light and electricity and put those together?

1164
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:59,940
And how do you take that knowledge understanding that there's a vacuum in the body biological vacuum to make burns heal rapidly?

1165
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:03,040
Regardless of what type of burn it is Pretty interesting.

1166
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:09,330
I haven't gone public on this at all yet And I'm not really experimenting with it on it.

1167
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:13,030
Like I should like walk up to and physically burn myself, right?

1168
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:15,770
To and then try to you know, I'm not into that.

1169
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:33,910
You know how they have Psychotherapists before they get their certification They psychoanalyze each other and write reports before and they have to produce the report as being a viable Report and analysis in order to get certified you familiar with that practice you've heard of it.

1170
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:35,030
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:53,150
No Okay, you know a psychotherapist or a psychiatrist has to produce a certain amount of certifiable or reports on his colleagues They do it to each other to show a model analysis, you know to their peers to get awarded a certificate Like part of their internship, right?

1172
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:57,410
Now do surgeons start doing surgery on each other?

1173
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:06,350
And to see how well they did the surgery on each other in order to get certified as a board-certified surgeon No, they don't do that.

1174
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,710
Do they?

1175
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:10,290
What's the difference one is spiritual one is physical?

1176
01:50:11,130 --> 01:50:24,830
People are very squeamish You see when it comes to doing physical experimentation Unless it's of course to a subgroup Cultural subgroup right like prisoners are usually experimented on right?

1177
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:34,890
You see how it works it doesn't seem right to you that the Psychotherapists have to do that amongst themselves, but the surgeons don't are not allowed to cut on themselves.

1178
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:53,220
It doesn't seem right to me So you're going to be experimenting on a subgroup anyway You see is does that mean that there is a double standard there?

1179
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:57,340
Yes, clearly there is but on the other hand, it's a quite a serious thing to

1180
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,640
start just

1181
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:09,480
Cutting you know someone open that doesn't need to be cut open just to show that you are capable right anyway

1182
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,500
These are things that need to be considered

1183
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:19,320
That's why I bring up like you said earlier marketing this to people they were presuming that anyone and everyone enter

1184
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:22,820
Acting with this information has a human body.

1185
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:50,980
That's useful So that is paramount so then I think understanding basic dietary principles and basic healing mechanisms or First aid mechanisms would be one of the things at the top of the list But you have to be careful how you position such information in a general body of work because if someone just sees it In a serial way they'll say I'm not interested in that anyway, which is funny, right?

1186
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:54,420
I've by the way, you know, it'll turn them off to the rest of it.

1187
01:51:54,460 --> 01:52:04,500
So it has to be categorized in an equal footing I've you wouldn't believe how many against I know you don't like this Sam, but I'll say it Anyway, how many people I've discussed basic?

1188
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:11,420
Dietary principles or healing modalities and they say well or you simple the fact that you don't absorb, right?

1189
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:15,380
It's not possible anatomically and they'll say well, I don't know anything.

1190
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:15,920
That's funny.

1191
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,180
I'm not a doctor I don't know anything about the human body Right, but you have one, right?

1192
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,700
Okay You see.

1193
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:47,100
Oh, I have I have a couple of cars, but I don't know anything about them That's okay, right that's fine that means it's a ritual, you know when most people when they get in a car It's a ritual to them They know that if they do this and do that it's going to get them to where they want to go outside of that They don't know anything about it most people View their own physical body as a ritual.

1194
01:52:47,220 --> 01:53:05,960
They know that if they don't sleep they they the next day is ruined So they sleep, you know, so they sleep and they do this and they do that, but they don't know anything about it See and they don't want to know because there's been a selective group of entitled people called doctors that they Right.

1195
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:07,660
Does that sound right to you?

1196
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,060
That doesn't sound right to me

1197
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,520
And by the way, if you've I don't know if you've ever had the experience of doing this is rhetorical

1198
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,340
I'm not expecting an answer, but if you ever approach a medical technician aka doctor of any type

1199
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:27,120
Especially an internal medicine type and you and you go over the anatomy

1200
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:32,420
They will agree through the anatomy that nothing goes through any of those walls

1201
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:38,340
Let's say the you know through the lumina of the intestine nothing or the lungs nothing ever penetrates through there

1202
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:42,380
And then once you say then well, how does how does the food get absorbed?

1203
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,820
Then if they you've just agreed that nothing goes through there

1204
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:50,840
Well, they they all medially immediately abandon all reason and they look and it says it must be absorbed and they walk away

1205
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,280
Just like that's something you would hear from a four-year-old

1206
01:53:54,280 --> 01:54:03,260
You see you see so they they don't want to see it now and the other answer whatever

1207
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,500
an intelligent

1208
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:12,660
What they call that when a child has a little tantrum connect tantrum, yes

1209
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:15,800
They have a little mini tantrum the the most rational

1210
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:21,300
Answer I've seen to that once they've come to the conclusion themselves

1211
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:29,440
There's no selling here, there's just presentation or I'm just telling not selling this to anyone when the most rational answer

1212
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:33,920
I've had I heard more than once which is the most rational is passing the buck

1213
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:39,440
Like they're not responsible for how screwed up the medical systems what they say is oh, yeah

1214
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:45,200
I see that now, but they don't acknowledge that I said who's they well, you know the hot the people that teach me

1215
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:49,540
And the people that supervise me and the people that are over the the industry

1216
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:55,520
They don't acknowledge it so that means oh, so that's okay because you just passed it over to them like oh

1217
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,000
I just work here right?

1218
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:58,380
I was just following orders

1219
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,260
That's the most rational that I've heard

1220
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:04,980
That's about typical for just about every place you go

1221
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,260
Yeah, no from the medical people

1222
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,060
And I know well, I shouldn't I'll just say I know there's been

1223
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:18,680
Maybe a small handful that have abandoned practice because of being subject to this information

1224
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:23,430
You know found another vocation

1225
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:26,970
Which those would be at the top of the list

1226
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:31,870
You know in terms of the what you would call a moral compass.

1227
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:51,190
You know what I mean And I've also run into some attorneys that have abandoned that profession because they were found out what the bar Association was about and what the courts were really doing And the attorneys do the same thing they say well, that's what they do.

1228
01:55:51,290 --> 01:56:00,070
That's what they tell us to do You know pass the buck, you know So it's still wide open.

1229
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:19,410
It's everything is completely wide open Sure is And you've got a decade and a half maximum At this point, you know decade and out less than that You always keep shifting these dates.

1230
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:20,910
No, it's the same.

1231
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:25,010
It's like three or three to five years No, not at all the last year.

1232
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:45,710
I said 15 years now I say 14 years, but still a decade and a half you were rounded off a debt a little bit more than a decade 20 25 around 20 around 20 25 you'll you'll be in the throes of a Middle East Union and in the throes of an upswing Global upswing and don't believe anything.

1233
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:51,490
I Mean that that keeps stating it's not going to be a propagandized upswing.

1234
01:56:51,570 --> 01:57:00,310
It's going to be an actual one You will actually see manifestations in Every aspect of you know, what what can be conceived or perceived?

1235
01:57:01,030 --> 01:57:12,210
You know supporting that upswing It's going to be real no one's gonna cry foul On the aspect of it not being real.

1236
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:14,610
There will be some crying foul about

1237
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:21,470
You know from a prophetic point of view, you know what I mean crying foul that this is

1238
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:24,650
going going lead to abominations

1239
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:26,530
So

1240
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:35,750
In other words you could show something as being right and it's not right at all like I give the example of patriotism

1241
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:40,610
You know, if you didn't have patriotism, would you have a military that no you wouldn't

1242
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:44,070
You wouldn't have a military as such you would have

1243
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:46,950
Every the government would

1244
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:52,410
Promote that all of its quote-unquote citizens were well armed and well trained

1245
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:55,090
So you wouldn't need a military?

1246
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:07,540
So anyway, hmm All right, anything else anything else you see Bruce any messages or anything or we'll just call it Not really.

1247
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:15,260
No, we got a 1517 people on there Listening, okay Yes, Sam's laughing.

1248
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:36,160
Yeah, they don't expect much And you won't be disappointed No, I've never disappointed saying well, there's stupid stuff, you know, or or there's nothing there and just showing that I'm disappointed at it No, because I never expected anything You know Well expectation and hope is slightly different.

1249
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:37,080
Yeah.

1250
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:55,950
No, I don't have any Will hope is that's too broad of a term to apply to you know Something is as reactionary as a comment or a question No Yeah, the how can you have any hope when you've been elected to?

1251
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:04,630
Subsist and exist in a world that is Leased out to the adversary and his lease is expiring.

1252
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:27,270
Of course is coming to an end but you know, how can anyone find any hope in a world that is You know, basically you share you're sharing a bed with the adversary protection Yeah Yeah, yeah more like sharing a building but he could he's on floor 78 you can be on floor 20 Yeah, there you go.

1253
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:35,790
But still You know, there's no hope in that condition Yeah Within within that condition nothing.

1254
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:37,650
There's hope outside of it.

1255
01:59:37,650 --> 02:00:06,510
Yep, and that's all knowledge-based and and any hope or any Advantage advantage you have even within it is still knowledge-based So, there you go Mmm, it's all knowledge-based You know when people act Without any knowledge It's either they consider it a stroke of luck or good fortune or they said that was just a stupid thing to do But it turned out okay, or it doesn't turn out.

1256
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:06,830
Okay.

1257
02:00:06,830 --> 02:00:08,510
It was just a stupid thing to do.

1258
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:16,630
Anyway, you see so What do you think Bruce anything?

1259
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:19,150
I got nothing on this and great.

1260
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:50,390
Nobody nobody's chatting or anything Anything closing for you Sam Um, no, I feel like I've said what I need to say Perhaps next time we can be a bit more topical Well, the topic is was a slightly paradoxical to discussing while discussing Discussing things that not circular at all things that you don't normally notice we didn't even get to that.

1261
02:00:51,030 --> 02:01:02,110
Yes, we did I opened it with an example was that not to bring up the chat again But people when I went into chat to write down that we're gonna do a sonic There was about two or three comments about an interlinear.

1262
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:02,810
I'm like, why bother?

1263
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:08,570
You could read every interlinear all day and I can you explain what script can you get the message?

1264
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:13,190
The answer is no Yeah, this is just repackaged stuff that you said before ain't nothing.

1265
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:17,430
Yeah Well, you know the Sun's gonna rise tomorrow like it did today and yesterday.

1266
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:21,050
There's nothing new there But I don't ask anything of the Sun.

1267
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:25,130
So I don't invest my time in the Sun the Sun does what it does

1268
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:27,190
I invest my time in these streams

1269
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:35,410
Not true, you know, believe it or not solar flares are are instigate able from Earth, you know, but anyway, that's another discussion

1270
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:44,570
Yeah, yeah, so again, it's it's very simple

1271
02:01:45,790 --> 02:01:49,570
You know what it boils down to is communication is there any communication

1272
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:57,250
Meaning if from then in here and and now and then in the future and I would say no there's no communication

1273
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:02,270
That's that's the standard precept of rational and caught, you know

1274
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:09,070
beings is is to being able to communicate properly and I'm telling you there is no communication and

1275
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:11,750
Communications and things that what are them?

1276
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:13,230
What are memorialized events?

1277
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:14,370
What are what are scripture?

1278
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:15,330
What are textbooks?

1279
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:17,590
What are his real history?

1280
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:18,470
What is anything?

1281
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:28,250
It's communication You know art is a communication, you know Clothing fashion is a communication, right?

1282
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:42,130
Speaking of the Sun and things that can be known objectively What's this idea about the Sun goes through periods of what they call coronal mass ejections?

1283
02:02:42,810 --> 02:03:02,490
Which yes some kind of a discharge that can heat up the earth's surface and set fire to things Well that there you know, there's an 11-year cycle of high and low that they've been recording for a long time since 1860 something 1840 right the the coronal mass ejection if you study that term very Very carefully.

1284
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:04,750
It's not the actual Sun itself.

1285
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:11,770
It's the corona of the Sun In other words, it's the immediate surrounding boundary layer of the Sun that the ejection happens, right?

1286
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:17,050
What happens on the Sun is expansions and contractions and things, you know on the surface, right?

1287
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:25,970
So what they've missed out and this is more on I've had discussions with quote-unquote people on this that are this is their job to study.

1288
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:37,530
This is there's a misunderstanding of The in other words is a difference between the Sun It's activity what the Sun is actually doing itself.

1289
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:43,450
It's visible Versus what is at the corona that affects us you see what I mean?

1290
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:55,610
So that is that is the crux of the understanding So the Sun goes through a minimum which it's at right now now The last what sparked this science or this field on the Sun was in the 1800s.

1291
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:58,510
I think 60s or 70s It was a mass coronal ejection.

1292
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:00,150
They call her solar event.

1293
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:01,790
That was so electrically powerful.

1294
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:20,730
It fried all the telegraphs Yeah, and the telegraphs were the you know, that's like frying all the Internet, you know all communications now it would fry, you know But also you have to comprehend that it was very they were the were very different now than then But still susceptible to it.

1295
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,250
This is a particularly high

1296
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:28,370
With this past week is pretty high for the cosmic radiation

1297
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:31,750
Yeah, but you know

1298
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:37,150
But you understand that if you're if you went out into space past the Earth's atmosphere, you wouldn't see the Sun is not there's nothing

1299
02:04:37,150 --> 02:04:42,870
There it's basically induction through the atmosphere that makes the Sun the Sun to us

1300
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:50,230
So, all right, I do understand that it plays a big role in prophecy as well, you know in terms of what it does

1301
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,310
And it's going to be anomalous.

1302
02:04:52,430 --> 02:05:00,650
The scientists will not know it's doing what you read about in prophecy That's why it's in prophecy because if it was not anomalous, it wouldn't be in prophecy.

1303
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:01,390
Does that help?

1304
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:03,210
Yeah, that's fine.

1305
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:06,790
But I'm I'm trying to understand also as far as

1306
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:10,250
the cycles apart from the 11-year cycles, which I've

1307
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:18,230
Seen there's also this idea of a 10,000 year cycles as far as violent outbursts that if you map backwards you get

1308
02:05:18,230 --> 02:05:22,390
something with them, they can only measure that by the

1309
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:29,750
Geo plate geo a job a geology by going down layers and I'm telling you when they go down through layers of earth

1310
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,570
It's not as accurate as what they believe

1311
02:05:32,110 --> 02:05:33,010
We don't know.

1312
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:35,530
Yeah, the only time I could substantiate

1313
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:39,390
Anything that they say is going back to the mid 1800s

1314
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:43,870
when they start when you start going beyond a hundred and something years when I

1315
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:48,810
Older stuff to me is isn't it has to be re-examined and why they're telling us 10,000

1316
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:57,310
You see what I mean can't be trusted and that which is the antithesis of what their purpose is because the purpose of these guys

1317
02:05:57,310 --> 02:06:02,450
Is people could go about whatever interest they have in life and when they want to know about the Sun they go to a trusted

1318
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:04,810
Source these scientists and I'm telling you they can't be trusted.

1319
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:06,610
So Everyone's on their own.

1320
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:07,710
That's why I'm saying again.

1321
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:10,770
That's wide open Mm-hmm.

1322
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:13,490
I don't think that particular aspect is a mainstream thing.

1323
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:18,990
That's more of an alternative stream of conversation Not that that's necessarily any more legitimate.

1324
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:21,430
But yeah, I'm just throwing that out there.

1325
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:24,410
What's the relationship between cosmic rays and cloud cover?

1326
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:35,930
They have some kind of a relationship do they not where when one picks up the other decreases and vice versa space weather and There's a boundary layer.

1327
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:41,970
It's kind of like saying, you know, you have a motel or a hotel with one room next to the other What's the relationship?

1328
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:45,690
Well, you know if somebody knocks on the wall on one side, they're gonna hear it on the other

1329
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:48,630
Even though the one knocking is in the other room

1330
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:56,130
Of course, there's a really they can't even define cosmic rays and all that activity, but there is weather in space and

1331
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:57,610
We're in it

1332
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:02,970
Think of it as the the nature of the oceans and a ship

1333
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:09,570
How it's affected by the what the ocean or the sea is doing and that's what we're the planet is in that condition

1334
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:15,730
Or a relative state, you know what was going on and what they call space which is not really empty space

1335
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:21,150
Is affecting the boundary layer known as the atmosphere, you know, which is cloud cover and all that

1336
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:22,730
Mm-hmm

1337
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,860
Okay, so anomalies

1338
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:29,480
It's all anomalies.

1339
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,960
It's it's been gradually the thing about prophecy.

1340
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:49,530
It's progressive and It takes you know, some prophecies take a long time to build up, you know with these end time scenarios I start seeing the pre what he called a precursor to them now So they seem more gradual.

1341
02:07:49,750 --> 02:08:15,010
It's the frog in the in the pot to slowly Yeah And then clouds are misunderstood also, there's no information on what clouds are on the internet by the way What they really are there's no moisture there's no water there's might be some moisture but there's no water in the clouds, you know Because if there was they wouldn't float they'd be pulled down to the ground Now fog is is water.

1342
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:20,910
That's why it guess what when you see fog, you don't see it up in the sky You see it where it descends down into the valleys.

1343
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:32,470
It's actually pulled down by gravity Pushed down by gravity So when you talk about if you want to bring up clouds, I think I have discussed what clouds are in the past so And it's not there's nothing written.

1344
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:32,910
You want it?

1345
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:33,910
Here's the thing.

1346
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:36,030
We can just write a thing about what clouds are

1347
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:42,250
And put that out that that's a thousand times more than what's out there right now and provable as well

1348
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:49,330
You know people the they have this grotesque

1349
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:53,490
View that clouds bring rain

1350
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:54,970
I

1351
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:59,510
Mean bring the rain they do bring rain the conditions for rain, but they don't bring any water

1352
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:03,910
you know a square kilometer with a

1353
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:07,030
Centimeter of rain is a million tons of water.

1354
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:18,630
There's you times on there's a million tons of water in that cloud there's no water in the cloud and They say well the humidity then accumulates around dust particles Well, if that would happen you'd have transfer of energy.

1355
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:21,310
So that means when it rains the humidity should go down

1356
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:22,950
Right

1357
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:26,550
Because it turns into water

1358
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:29,790
But the humidity actually rises

1359
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:35,490
Incrementally as as the it gets to the rain event and when it's raining the humidity goes up even more

1360
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:43,540
So anyway, I've discussed what what's going it's it's if that's why I have if

1361
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:45,540
I've said this a while back

1362
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:50,740
Maybe not as frequent as I should have or could have if you were completely awake and aware of what's going on

1363
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:56,700
You would be you would be considered a total madman in comparison to anyone

1364
02:09:59,180 --> 02:09:59,620
So

1365
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,160
Hmm.

1366
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:09,540
Yeah, I bet you've heard the the Greek speak on you know, right before it rains if you know, it's surely going to rain go

1367
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:10,440
stand underneath

1368
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,200
Something and watch the whole process

1369
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:17,740
From the clouds rolling into the rain starting and all that watch the bottom of the cloud

1370
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:22,180
Watch how the rain is actually formed if you have some good polarized lenses or glass

1371
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:26,000
You can see it more evidently what's going on how the rain is created

1372
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:31,600
It's it's quite, you know, you know as I go a Greek I've done it.

1373
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:37,440
I don't know I said well, okay watch for this watch for like a small short list of stuff Then they come back to yep.

1374
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:47,600
Everything was exactly like you said You have to kind of help people out, you know like people with weather So when you go out and see a clear blue sky, do you see the 14 shades of blue?

1375
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:59,200
And they're like no, I just see it's blue Right, most people can see the three or four shades immediately All right Once you point them out, right?

1376
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:08,000
And these are not we're not talking about like super subtle Things where you know, you pick up the violin and start playing with no lessons.

1377
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,820
I'm talking about this is technically accessible to anyone You see what I mean?

1378
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:13,100
Right.

1379
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:17,940
I mean, yeah so No, I get it.

1380
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:36,290
I Think my roommates just came back Yeah, I might have to check out because I can't make noise when they're around hello Yeah, no, we're here.

1381
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:40,050
Oh I just think I'm just clanking it around here.

1382
02:11:40,570 --> 02:11:44,470
Yeah I think I'll call it a day because people just came back.

1383
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:45,730
All right, call it a day.

1384
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:46,390
Call it a night.

1385
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:46,730
Whatever.

1386
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:51,690
Thanks Maybe we'll do it again Yeah, be prepared for you.

1387
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:55,150
No, you know, you've been around long enough, you know, I'm gonna rant and rave for 20 minutes

1388
02:11:56,190 --> 02:12:02,470
So anyway 20 minutes 20 minutes is fine when it gets to 50 is when I'm like, oh shit, yeah

1389
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:12,720
Yeah, that's like someone wants this guy was an author an English major and all that I said

1390
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,620
I'll just go read he was interested in reading the Bible

1391
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:18,620
Would you recommend so start with the book of Jeremiah gets back to me says this guy's a real whiner

1392
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:21,780
I read the whole chapter is whining like I you don't get it.

1393
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:41,420
Never mind Anyway, you get it But No, no, no, no, no, no because there's not a one-to-one ratio of conflation between these things as if you're saying something profound You're saying shit Everything that you're saying is you understood and grasped and it's fairly but my who Well, certainly by me.

1394
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:41,800
I don't know.

1395
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:58,080
I'm gonna send you a multiple-choice question and answer test I'm gonna Skype with you I'm gonna write one up and then I'm gonna share the the the results with the rest of the class Well, let's see how much you actually get but I doubt you'll actually send it because you say you'll do stuff and you never do It anyway, so that's fun.

1396
02:12:58,640 --> 02:12:58,800
Yeah.

1397
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,420
Yeah, not no regarding this kind of stuff.

1398
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,600
No, I'm not working for free Mm-hmm.

1399
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:07,960
I mean, I'm not that smart, but I'm not that stupid Right.

1400
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:21,920
Sure Whatever it takes to preserve the integrity of the Greek online There is no such thing It's like walking through the sewer or landfill.

1401
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,860
It's like oh, yeah, I don't leave any more.

1402
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:29,380
Don't leave any more poops here Well, who's gonna notice the place is full of poop?

1403
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:31,600
Anyway, okay.

1404
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:31,840
Cool.

1405
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:32,500
Well, thanks Sam.

1406
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,960
Well, maybe we'll do it again.

1407
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:57,500
Yep Okay All right Yeah, so the main point I guess for my rant and all that coming on is Whatever you're coming across anything any information Be rest assured that it's quiet.

1408
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:59,160
It's it's completely open

1409
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:03,800
Any field that you get into is wide open and if you don't see it, it's

1410
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:09,080
partly because of whatever mental model you bought into or allowed yourself to

1411
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:13,960
solidify around you regarding that thought right so

1412
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,860
Yeah, like if you want again eventually interest in the human body you say oh, well

1413
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:21,660
There's not much more research to be done on that

1414
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:29,480
Look at all these universities and all these medical centers and all these government agencies and I'm telling you they don't know jack shit

1415
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:38,340
Comparatively to the effort and the resources that they have they should be ashamed of themselves shameful shameful

1416
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:45,190
completely any field aeronautics aerospace medicine

1417
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:47,710
acoustics electricity shameful

1418
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,970
shameful

1419
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:55,950
You know the that what's that CERN that big thing they have wherever it is in Europe now

1420
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:59,650
If they took all the copper they used in that or whatever.

1421
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:08,090
They could have built enough Joseph Newman machines to run Half of Europe, you know for free right usually yeah.

1422
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,910
Yeah.

1423
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:09,590
Yeah.

1424
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:10,730
Yeah shameful

1425
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:17,030
They are all across the board automobiles any field, you know, you know, so and there's no one by the way again

1426
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:19,530
There's no one on the internet talking about anything useful

1427
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:24,510
And it might see even if you think it seems like it in the beginning, you know, you go to some alternative

1428
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:28,730
Speakers where they start bringing up the importance of bringing down your blood pressure

1429
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:33,650
I'm like, oh boy, you know how many times you heard that right or the immune system?

1430
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:42,830
Yeah, you know, it's like there's nothing I think I put in chat the the the Internet is hosted by either morons idiots or assholes Take your pick.

1431
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:44,710
So you're pretty much

1432
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:46,910
It's the same thing as the

1433
02:15:48,490 --> 02:15:53,910
As what the culture can provide, you know, in other words, I would stress that one

1434
02:15:54,610 --> 02:16:00,830
Learns to relate to what has been set in culture before what is provided within that culture

1435
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:05,950
you see like in other words if you're living in the Western world and

1436
02:16:06,650 --> 02:16:09,150
You're using the English language and you go on the Internet

1437
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:15,330
Whether it's alternative or mainstream or commercial or corporate or where it's all this I'm telling you

1438
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:19,910
It doesn't matter because they're all coming from the same cultural perspective

1439
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:23,190
Which is who's going to get the most shrunken heads you see?

1440
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:27,810
Yeah, how many times have you gone on to the alternative radio Bruce?

1441
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:36,570
it doesn't matter what the subject matter is whether it's Fox News or Any the most fringe alternative when Christmas comes around?

1442
02:16:36,650 --> 02:16:37,370
What do they all say?

1443
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:38,450
Merry Christmas?

1444
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:59,490
Yeah, when when there's Yeah, when there's the Pope's work schedule when there's a when the when the agency's put out You know the medical scares about these outbreaks whether it's Fox News, you know, it's a swine flu whether it's the Fox News or the most fringe alternative radio what they're all concerned about the same bullshit, right?

1445
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:09,430
Yeah, why because commercial in between so that they can garnish their money income and sure For money, it's a little hole.

1446
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:11,170
Remember the hole in the walls.

1447
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:16,129
Oh Depends on what's wrong Restaurants.

1448
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:16,350
Yeah.

1449
02:17:16,389 --> 02:17:16,510
Yeah.

1450
02:17:16,549 --> 02:17:17,410
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1451
02:17:17,450 --> 02:17:25,650
Yeah Downtown New York, they had the glory hole politicians could go right there Genitalia through in the meat district.

1452
02:17:25,650 --> 02:17:27,209
But anyway, yeah, what right?

1453
02:17:29,330 --> 02:17:42,030
Talking like small business or a tiny little building in between mom-and-pop shop Yeah, yeah, and that's what you got on the internet right now.

1454
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:43,910
It's just a bunch of little hole-in-the-wall.

1455
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:46,209
Oh, yeah, that's come on Yeah, there's nothing.

1456
02:17:47,010 --> 02:17:55,370
Yep, and they're all the same Regardless if it's the big corporate mainstream Internet or the smallest Mom-and-pop hole in the wall.

1457
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:58,010
They're all interested in shrunken heads.

1458
02:17:58,330 --> 02:18:00,190
Yep, because they're that's their culture.

1459
02:18:00,350 --> 02:18:08,410
They they yeah, so that's a real Like Sam was saying earlier, you know, he senses an urgency maybe, you know, why don't you do something?

1460
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:10,670
We got to do something I don't see anything going on.

1461
02:18:10,809 --> 02:18:23,090
I think that's hardly a and that's the thing I was trying to I was trying to wrap my head around but you have Yeah, I have 160 some hours Which might be too much.

1462
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:24,950
I think a little overdone overdone.

1463
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:27,129
Okay, how much of its repeat?

1464
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:28,250
Okay fine

1465
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:34,170
But half of it, yeah, and it's done in fantasy it's articulated different

1466
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:41,930
Sure, it's like looking at a natural might not capture the attention as well as the next one, you know

1467
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:45,070
It's it's subject to the person their understanding

1468
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:46,730
what first

1469
02:18:47,549 --> 02:18:49,830
Attracted me was the history

1470
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:55,750
Straight up so, you know where things come from, you know, right and

1471
02:18:56,370 --> 02:19:00,230
Then I started putting two and two together and his whole leash, you know

1472
02:19:01,309 --> 02:19:01,709
Yeah.

1473
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:20,110
Oh Yeah, it's from that point on it's it's been you know, I got to find I you know I'll I'll go on little tangents looking up different things in history, but I it's it's all different than what I was given every bit of it Mm-hmm.

1474
02:19:20,209 --> 02:19:23,709
Well, how can you know anything about a thing if you don't know where it came from?

1475
02:19:23,709 --> 02:19:35,350
What how long it's been around The understand first thing about understanding anything is the history of the thing That's why one of the most important things I go out and say is that anything and everything people are interacting with right now?

1476
02:19:35,549 --> 02:19:54,690
It's hard to find that anything goes back more than a hundred years Yeah, it's like they've negated everything Prior to that and I'm telling you that around that time more than a hundred year years ago Anything that could have been known was known They talked about it it was continuous, yep, it was Better.

1477
02:19:55,370 --> 02:20:03,690
Yeah The next city was talking about it Yeah, you know anything that was the growth of our generations.

1478
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:21,230
None of us passed on none of us talked about Let's go have a beer grab a brat or you know, whatever, you know Mm-hmm This new song this new TV program this new radio show In total distractions to take your mind off.

1479
02:20:21,370 --> 02:20:22,870
Well, is it between each other?

1480
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:35,470
But it's not so much of a distraction as it's food clothing and shelter You're you're here because of the gods number one number two You're here because of the gods and number three you're here because of the gods and why are you here because of the gods?

1481
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:41,970
Because a certain amount of people have to come through a certain amount of time So why are you gonna fuss and muss about all the stuff that's going on?

1482
02:20:42,030 --> 02:21:01,630
Just have a good time Like I said lately I've been trying to Entertain the concept of watching TV again because I noticed I'll turn it on and sit in front of it And I'll see how stupid it is and I'll say to myself This is this is how you know, it has a technical effect on the brain on the cerebellum and other parts, right?

1483
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:07,450
too and the medulla to Affect you through the freaky flicker rates and things like that.

1484
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:10,670
Relax like you said with the new and improved stuff.

1485
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:15,450
It's you know, you got Four or five times as much Easily.

1486
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:19,970
Yeah, and I'll sit back and I thought for just a second when you said technical.

1487
02:21:20,170 --> 02:21:21,850
I thought you're gonna go to the

1488
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:23,830
you know what the

1489
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:29,450
adversary uses as a tool because you know clearly there's

1490
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:34,610
The distractions alone are just you know, look at all its tamed

1491
02:21:35,230 --> 02:21:36,690
multiples of generations

1492
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:39,230
the different technologies, you know

1493
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:46,330
What he's using as a tool or the purpose one of the purposes seemingly it's it's indirectly

1494
02:21:47,210 --> 02:21:53,210
Scriptural is to show how inadequate mankind is is you know, and it's all voluntary by the way

1495
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:57,450
No one's putting a gun to anyone's head right spiritually to do anything now people

1496
02:21:58,090 --> 02:22:02,890
Spiritually if you got enough people to do something they will put guns on other people to do it also, right?

1497
02:22:03,230 --> 02:22:08,030
Sure, but he's not doing it, you know later on I had a conversation with someone recently

1498
02:22:08,030 --> 02:22:09,730
he was an English teacher and he

1499
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:13,550
we just sat outside for an hour in the shade talking and

1500
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:21,830
He was a quote-unquote Christian or you know was a proponent of it and I'm so I'm not for it or against it

1501
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:23,830
I just find it to be you know, not a good thing

1502
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:30,150
If I could be easily against it if you look at how much harm it's done

1503
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:34,430
But at the same time if you see what the purpose of it is as a dummy load

1504
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:37,910
That's you know, then you can't be for it or against it but I was having a conversation

1505
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:42,190
With an English teacher who supposedly is an English teacher.

1506
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:43,810
So, you know, he's he's a wordsmith.

1507
02:22:43,890 --> 02:23:05,830
You're alleging, you know, and They didn't have comprehension of you know what the words mean not only even in the English together when you string it together or The importance of reading it all in context versus verse out of verse You know how the crit, you know how they use just verses to build a piece Versus together to create a new doctrine.

1508
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:08,750
That's not really there right and he thanked me.

1509
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:10,370
He was like, well, you know This is interesting.

1510
02:23:10,490 --> 02:23:24,610
I never thought of reading the whole thing in context and this is someone who's was an English teacher who Grades people on writing essays that they have an introduction body and conclusion and context supported, right?

1511
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:26,430
Oh, this is their job.

1512
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:28,590
You think about it how how?

1513
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:55,150
Ridiculous Anyway, yeah Yeah, that's why I keep saying to the people you're screwed because the ones that you're going to for knowledge and training are screwed Or miss, you know, don't know anything or they seem like they know but they don't Qualitatively Quantitatively, they have a lot to say but the quality is very low So essentially again back to the adversary and us being here.

1514
02:23:55,210 --> 02:24:04,550
It's just a matter of taking time So let's go have a beer or Brad or you know, or watch TV or whatever, you know Ultimately scripture tells you the rich man and the poor man both die naked.

1515
02:24:04,730 --> 02:24:05,670
You can't take it with you

1516
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:10,490
I never saw never saw Brink's armored truck follow anyone behind

1517
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:13,750
Not a one, right

1518
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:16,610
Or whatever

1519
02:24:17,470 --> 02:24:20,330
Yeah, they don't pour the money in the coffin

1520
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:27,570
And again, like I think on the last sonic event the reward that will be gotten later by everyone by the way

1521
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:29,310
even the malfeasant ones

1522
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:38,050
Will be greater greater to the point where not only will it compensate whether you know or didn't know what was going on

1523
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:42,810
But it'll overly compensate you see so it is in the end.

1524
02:24:42,890 --> 02:24:48,670
It'll be worth it, but not this end Because if you want to go even further, this is not the end that's coming.

1525
02:24:48,710 --> 02:24:56,270
It's the beginning You know is when a when a child is born when it exits the mother Is that the end or is it the beginning?

1526
02:24:56,330 --> 02:25:01,510
We never see it as the end We it's the end of the pregnancy, but we see it as the beginning, right?

1527
02:25:01,790 --> 02:25:02,250
Mm-hmm.

1528
02:25:02,330 --> 02:25:05,690
No, no when a baby is born people don't run around saying it was the end.

1529
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:06,370
It's the end.

1530
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:15,270
It's the end Well, it is the end right the end of the pregnancy, but you don't focus on that you focus It's the beginning you have a new baby with a new right?

1531
02:25:15,310 --> 02:25:19,890
It's the beginning right you see Congratulations you see mm-hmm.

1532
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:24,690
So what's coming is really the beginning anyway?

1533
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:28,690
And the thing is I don't want to you know

1534
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:34,330
There's so much optimism and I deliberately hold myself back because I don't want to sound preachy

1535
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:38,090
Right, but those who you see if you have all the background

1536
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:43,170
I'll say it and then it doesn't sound preachy because now you understand you see it

1537
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:49,790
But if you don't understand the message in Scripture and not aware of what's going on here, then you sound preachy

1538
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:54,490
You're not going to do the the homework that's necessary to understand why it's going to be so wonderful

1539
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:57,430
You're just going to go for it and fall for the yeah

1540
02:25:58,070 --> 02:26:01,510
If you want to feel good stuff, there's plenty of stuff to make you feel good.

1541
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:14,510
Oh, yeah Yeah, and stay stupid or ignorant or whatever So stupid is as being negligent and Negligence basically ignorant.

1542
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:16,250
It means you just don't have it.

1543
02:26:16,370 --> 02:26:20,610
You know, it's an empty bucket, you know, yeah, so stupid would be pouring a

1544
02:26:21,410 --> 02:26:23,330
gallon into a one-quart bucket

1545
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:30,550
Ignorant would be you don't know, you know, what size bucket to get which is I think the latter is better, you know

1546
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:33,410
Yeah, and wasting so either way

1547
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:40,250
Yeah, but I think Sam most Sam knows and private we say there's nothing out there at all and he's

1548
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:45,850
Followed looked at various things and yes there there is if you're interested in

1549
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:49,270
Finding edible corn in poop the yield you can do that

1550
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:55,150
But we what if it comes to the point where you just want fresh corn right now, what do you right?

1551
02:26:56,090 --> 02:27:07,310
And let's just not even use the poop analogy just use you don't want can a corn out of a can Right, you know, you know Do you want fresh corn?

1552
02:27:07,470 --> 02:27:08,070
Where are you gonna go?

1553
02:27:08,490 --> 02:27:17,330
I'm telling you there's nowhere to go And it's it's sad and you know It's qualitative not quantitative because I haven't gone through every page on the Internet.

1554
02:27:17,530 --> 02:27:38,180
I don't need to Yeah Yeah Yeah, and the thing is like just to address the thing with Sam I'm not gonna create an endeavor You know like for example, Bruce you you you work, right?

1555
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:45,900
You you know to get credits and support yourself and do those other stuff in order to do what Sam was talking about It's it's actually quite an endeavor.

1556
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:48,060
It's basically is a lot of work.

1557
02:27:48,400 --> 02:28:14,480
Yeah, I'm not going to The idea on the website about the one where you want it where anybody could come on and place their thoughts about a gadget or whatever You know That's not an easy task Well, you know Domain right the page you still got to get it visible to The masses we need moderators, right then you're gonna have the the corporate assassins.

1558
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:28,280
They don't want to take it down Oh, yeah, because it's a good mother Because you know, there's gonna be an interest that does not like to see that Right and a coming for you.

1559
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:29,580
Oh

1560
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,520
There well, yeah, cuz it's gonna mess up there, you know

1561
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:37,480
I'd say you hit them in there what they consider to be a pocketbook, which is just digital now good starting place

1562
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,140
Yeah, I mean

1563
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:43,900
Yeah, I mean I could spend the rest of the next three days just coming up with various semi

1564
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:47,820
Synthetic and semi organic and organic compounds the nail that you know

1565
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:52,040
So the pharmaceutical people can't do anything for patent anything for the next 10 years.

1566
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,020
What do you think that's worth?

1567
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:55,760
That's worth taking you out quickly, isn't it?

1568
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:57,340
So that's that's a given.

1569
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:57,680
Yeah.

1570
02:28:58,140 --> 02:28:58,540
Yeah.

1571
02:28:58,540 --> 02:29:04,380
Mm-hmm You know once you put that kind of but it needs to be done It needs to be done.

1572
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:18,880
Why should it has to you know, you almost have to be a hundred percent anonymous to it Mm-hmm And very clever you have to know you're networking and a lot of good stuff and Sure.

1573
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:32,240
I mean there's there's tons of stuff to do But I think that Like Sam was saying to build something up well You know when you're gonna start a business or an endeavor you think about how long do you have to do it for?

1574
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:36,580
It's not like being a roadie, you know when you're it's easy when you're a roadie

1575
02:29:36,580 --> 02:29:40,340
Let's say you're gonna go on tour with a band, you know, you've got five

1576
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:46,740
Nights and you've got ten shows or whatever and you give it your all, you know

1577
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:52,340
You work 20 hours a day sure because you know, you're you and that's it, you know, or you might work, you know

1578
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:54,800
It's not practical to work more than 20 hours a day

1579
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:59,200
You need three four hours sleep like in the military even infantrymen, but I would say that

1580
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:01,340
You know, it's finite

1581
02:30:03,180 --> 02:30:07,040
And and that's how it has to be viewed in a sense because this is finite

1582
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:12,100
This is and and also you have to understand that most of the stuff is not for this society

1583
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:14,680
So they got that working against you, right?

1584
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:15,720
Yeah, right.

1585
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,920
It's not you know, so It's for the next society.

1586
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:22,040
So, you know, and then of course, are you casting pearls to swine?

1587
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:22,960
Yes, you are

1588
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:26,780
Yeah, so, you know, so the best thing is just chill

1589
02:30:27,460 --> 02:30:33,700
It's it's um, have you ever met anyone, you know is rhetorical that has a bona fide treasure map and

1590
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,360
Actually, you say too much

1591
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:38,440
but let me just say this sure a

1592
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:45,080
bona fide treasured map and but it happens to be that the treasure map is old enough that that where the treasure is now happens

1593
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:48,520
to be State Park land because you know since the 18 late

1594
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:53,960
1800s 1930s and in the 70s started turning a lot of this public lands into state parks

1595
02:30:53,960 --> 02:31:00,800
So you can't quite you can't quite show up with backhoes and start digging can you no you can't

1596
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:02,120
All right.

1597
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:03,160
So what do you do with that?

1598
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:10,520
Well, you know, the gold is there And but you know, you can't quite You still can do it.

1599
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:27,220
You still all you got to do is get enough people insiders, you know You know just get hired by the Parks Department and pay off some people you get it done, of course Without letting the CIA and other people know because they'll come and steal it from you Once it's validated that it's there Right.

1600
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:28,160
So what do you do with that?

1601
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:37,360
I mean, don't you feel kind of wealthy knowing that it's there even though you haven't you can't really quite spend it Yet, but you know, it's there you got it.

1602
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:42,880
You don't have the concerns that other people do Well, what if I only had was a fiddler on the roof?

1603
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,060
What if I was a rich man?

1604
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:46,080
You know that song if I was a rich man, right?

1605
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:51,560
No, you don't you don't sing that song But you don't have it you see so that's another perspective.

1606
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:52,420
Mm-hmm

1607
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:57,140
Mm-hmm

1608
02:31:57,860 --> 02:32:00,220
Sometimes it's just better off to leave it be

1609
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:06,080
Yeah, leave it be but it doesn't mean you don't have to say it and ultimately before we go

1610
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:07,440
I I know for sure

1611
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:09,080
validatable and confirmed

1612
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:14,120
Through firsthand and through digital, you know emails and messages

1613
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:20,140
the Greek speak has helped quite a few people with health and food and other things practical knowledge and

1614
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:21,960
Yeah, I've gotten enough

1615
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,740
That you know

1616
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:31,420
Some people said, you know, you've heard in artistic circles if I can just help one person that would be it worth doing right, right?

1617
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:40,440
So I know it's helped quite a few And that in itself is quite a reward oh Yeah.

1618
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:56,440
Oh, yeah but either way, it's it's The stuff that people have in their minds is insurmountable if a bunch of sponge divers can take down an aircraft carrier Right, I mean Doesn't that tell you that anything is possible?

1619
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:10,740
You know mark Yeah, so I mean One oh, yeah, and of course, you know that was never publicized, you know, oh god, no No, that's a David and Goliath.

1620
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:26,660
I mean, it's more than it's more humiliating than David It's actually far more Yeah Anyway, yeah Yeah, so Maybe we'll do we'll just it's it's coming on site.

1621
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:28,260
What's middle of summer almost?

1622
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:29,120
Yeah.

1623
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:39,760
Yeah, well summer and Sure you're on Yeah, well the fall pay attention to this time.

1624
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,740
Well, of course always pay attention, but

1625
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:46,420
This year spring middle of summer and then fall

1626
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:52,620
Winter, of course, there's a lot of international movement and then you have one in other words

1627
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:59,600
Let's just put it this way the seasonal effects of spring building up summer growth fall breaking down period winter transitional

1628
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:04,300
Is going to be even more important now as time

1629
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:05,720
goes on

1630
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:14,080
Especially when you if you start to understand prophecy or the narrow the biblical narrative you're going to see the majority of these things

1631
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,440
or the turn of events

1632
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:21,000
Dynamically happening in the spring and in the fall

1633
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:23,520
right, so

1634
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:27,540
That's why when you look at even scripture historically

1635
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:33,800
You have more events happening in the first second third month and then in the seven eighth ninth months, right?

1636
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:42,740
If you you can just do a biblical a search on the computer Put in first month, you know, what do you get second month?

1637
02:34:42,860 --> 02:34:46,500
What do you get third month and then skip go to the seventh month eighth month ninth month.

1638
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:52,620
You'll see so much activity Mm-hmm, right again And that's where I got it from.

1639
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:57,040
By the way, this spring is planting building summer and tear down fall.

1640
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:57,380
So

1641
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,420
so you'll see

1642
02:35:00,980 --> 02:35:01,420
I

1643
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:08,800
Noticed those events and like well, yeah, and this spring was kind of quite of a bang, you know when spring ended you notice

1644
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:15,820
So change of events that will pull geopolitical and in your own lives, you know, I tell people if you're gonna start a business

1645
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:19,500
Get all your stuff together, you know

1646
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:24,520
If you're gonna make your decisions get all your stuff together by summer

1647
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:31,960
So you have it all organized by fall you winter you design everything and you and you ready to go into business when?

1648
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:36,380
Opening in the spring spring your campaign starts in the spring.

1649
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:39,700
You can't just you're gonna open a business You just don't you know, it takes time.

1650
02:35:39,720 --> 02:36:01,840
So you You know by get the decision made by summer You know, whatever you're gonna invest in the business have it ready by fall right the harvest winter you get at the space Get your signs made get all your employees in order get the the space built up by the end of winter So when springtime comes you have your grand opening you see how it works.

1651
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:08,270
It's a matter That's what I mean by the seasonal thing.

1652
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:29,450
It's not as you know, you don't get everything done within the season it you know, but you use the seasons to create the rhythm that gets you to the The purpose that you want, you know, if you want to break close a business Let it run through summer and you should close it down and liquidate when in the fall, right?

1653
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:34,910
If you want to it's springtime you say oh where you should go out of business You know what?

1654
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:48,590
Hang on to summer and then just liquidate it in the fall because that's more in accord with the natural cycle of things And you'll probably get more for it then You know So hmm very simple.

1655
02:36:48,690 --> 02:36:49,410
It makes sense.

1656
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:49,750
Yes.

1657
02:36:50,550 --> 02:37:07,430
Yeah Yeah, it's it's simple and you know I think well, maybe what Sam was trying to say is give them even more about it when you write a paper You just don't say well spring is planting summer build-up fall is breaking down and winter is transitional.

1658
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:09,050
That's not much of a paper

1659
02:37:09,050 --> 02:37:10,350
That's only 30 words

1660
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:14,770
you might want to give examples and historical and references and

1661
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:17,250
Engineering of it, you know

1662
02:37:18,450 --> 02:37:25,310
So, yeah from that point of view Sam is correct, I've never really gone into depth on that, you know on many things

1663
02:37:25,310 --> 02:37:27,670
there's no reason to I

1664
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:35,390
Don't see any reason to or when there's a in terms of private consulting and industry if I asked to a master work on a project

1665
02:37:36,130 --> 02:37:40,090
Very often I see the organization that I might be dealing with and I'm like, oh

1666
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:46,050
There's so much these people need but I better leave my nose out of it and just address what they want me to address

1667
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:46,450
You know what?

1668
02:37:46,490 --> 02:37:47,450
I mean, right?

1669
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:49,590
Because no good deed goes unpunished.

1670
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:50,210
You know what I mean?

1671
02:37:50,450 --> 02:38:00,410
So great Mm-hmm Yeah, okay.

1672
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:07,170
Well, you're not gonna really sit back and try to Fix all the other things.

1673
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:07,910
Oh, no.

1674
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,170
No.

1675
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:09,030
No.

1676
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:20,070
Oh, no, and you know when they want to send you something during Christmas You're like well I'll read I'll take it only if it's a Tribute as tribute and when they say oh, yeah.

1677
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:20,410
Sure.

1678
02:38:20,750 --> 02:38:34,730
Well great now It has now you transmuted it from a Christmas gift to tribute right, and if you don't know what tribute is look up what it means, it's Yeah So I'll take it as true as a random tribute, but not as a Christmas gift.

1679
02:38:34,870 --> 02:38:34,970
Okay.

1680
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:35,430
Okay.

1681
02:38:35,970 --> 02:38:37,830
It's tribute then I'm like, all right, cool.

1682
02:38:38,250 --> 02:38:43,670
I'll take it right you see this you can transmute things that way, right?

1683
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:54,390
All right, because you know in the corporate culture they do that around this holidays they want oh, yes, they do that's how yeah I can't receive it unless it's fabulous, wasn't it?

1684
02:38:56,070 --> 02:38:59,950
Well skeptic is the god of health it's an Egyptian Greek hybrid

1685
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:03,170
The Greeks had other gods as well

1686
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:08,630
And the Egyptians had other gods and they came together and formed a split the occult of a sclepolis

1687
02:39:09,430 --> 02:39:11,570
escapolis, which is the the cult of

1688
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:11,970
Of

1689
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:16,030
Health it's the god of good health and well-being

1690
02:39:16,030 --> 02:39:24,030
Right Christian the the JES US character the bust with the nimbus and all that what you see is usually

1691
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:25,630
that image

1692
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:33,870
That's why the Christians say God bless you right right there is there's no God bless you or

1693
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:35,430
Anything like that in Scripture at all.

1694
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:40,910
That's from that, you know, like when you sneeze Didn't the Christmas bonus came out of that too, wasn't it?

1695
02:39:41,990 --> 02:39:45,650
hmm That Christmas is a is a mesh.

1696
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:53,810
Yeah, it could be it could be as well Yeah, but Christmas is a really strange thing because it's a strange.

1697
02:39:54,150 --> 02:40:30,770
It's an invention that the Romans finalized later on Based on the calendrical system, but it's a mishmash of you know, the the dark days of Babylonian magic Yeah, I high black magic mixed with Mithras mixed with Yeah, who's the one that the The women were wearing black crying for ball Tamu's Okay It's mixture of all kinds of it's a hybrid.

1698
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:53,490
It's a synchronistic hybrid worship of ball of the grove the tree worship Yeah, it's it's really it's just like when you go in the sewer You know what floats by Yeah shapes and size and things you can meet people through leftovers down the drain, you know that You know what?

1699
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:53,690
I mean?

1700
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:55,090
It's not just poop.

1701
02:40:55,150 --> 02:41:08,430
Yeah, it's urine feces and other waste in general all put together and formed into The high holidays of the Western culture and you know, Eastern don't the Easterns are not scot-free That's why very often.

1702
02:41:08,590 --> 02:41:13,650
I say the a lot of these East White people that go to Buddhism and Hinduism.

1703
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:25,970
They're just reek of Jewish Christian rejects You know what I mean, they don't know anything How can they know anything if the high gurus the Dalai Lama doesn't even know anything?

1704
02:41:27,370 --> 02:41:29,210
Provable by the way, he's an idiot.

1705
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:44,790
How do I prove that very simply is by Reading all the stuff that he all of his quotes and stuff that he's written and put out none of it has anything to do with the Basis or the scripture that his religion is based on none of it.

1706
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:46,530
He's a complete completely devoid

1707
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:48,790
So if the very highest

1708
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:54,810
Almost sainted leaders of these people know nothing about their own writs

1709
02:41:55,650 --> 02:42:01,150
What is the possibility of the lower adherence knowing anything notice I said adherence

1710
02:42:01,150 --> 02:42:07,830
because there are those that want to go into Buddhism and you know in the beginning they're naive enough to go along with everyone and

1711
02:42:07,830 --> 02:42:08,610
They're like wait a second

1712
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:11,770
There's something here that doesn't ring right or this says that you know

1713
02:42:11,770 --> 02:42:13,710
The censorship is lifted and they go and study

1714
02:42:13,710 --> 02:42:15,870
Some of the scripture and they're like wait a second

1715
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:19,790
These people are doing the opposite of what it says in scripture or they're devoid of rice in it

1716
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:26,210
This is with every religion, this is doesn't matter what it is even Scientology, which is a total mind

1717
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:26,930
You know what?

1718
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:40,830
psychology And manipulation And black magic on the inner circles those people too They'll say if you you know ask people what it's about.

1719
02:42:41,050 --> 02:42:46,090
It's not at the core of what they teach So any any group?

1720
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:49,810
You know and the ones that leave it ain't pretty

1721
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:52,010
You know

1722
02:42:52,730 --> 02:42:58,110
Yeah, but this is early Christianity was was like that

1723
02:42:58,110 --> 02:43:04,190
It was started with Simon Agus and the Gnostics that that got heavy investors

1724
02:43:04,190 --> 02:43:09,750
Because they saw it even moved in one name when they quote-unquote discovered America

1725
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:10,430
Oh

1726
02:43:11,270 --> 02:43:18,630
The Jesuits followed the one they just well, you know under the what discovery is a legal term

1727
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:21,450
When you bring something to trial

1728
02:43:21,450 --> 02:43:25,690
It's used as as evidence to why you're prosecuting something

1729
02:43:26,270 --> 02:43:31,530
So the process you can call it the prosecution of the Northern Americas here

1730
02:43:31,530 --> 02:43:37,910
Yeah, which one was done by the Explorers to claim it under you know, the the Vatican

1731
02:43:37,910 --> 02:43:41,310
Let's say not directly, but the adherents, you know

1732
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:43,590
the kings and queens and Dominions that were

1733
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:48,490
Because the Europe was run by the Emperor and the Vatican together in parallel

1734
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:53,310
You had the Emperor's and the last Emperor was 1790 something Edward in Holland

1735
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:55,890
And he also had yeah

1736
02:43:55,890 --> 02:44:00,830
Yeah, people don't they talk about the Popes, but they don't talk about the Emperor's so

1737
02:44:02,330 --> 02:44:09,110
Yeah, but they ran it together, you know, it's kind of it's like in Congress you have the Senate and the in the

1738
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:13,730
Whatever the House of Representatives or whatever, you know, you have the two houses

1739
02:44:13,730 --> 02:44:17,430
You had the two houses running Europe the Emperor and the Pope.

1740
02:44:17,830 --> 02:44:18,310
Yeah

1741
02:44:18,870 --> 02:44:26,690
So yeah, it's yeah, it's not as neat as people you ask most people, you know anything even the pretty even

1742
02:44:26,690 --> 02:44:30,810
University professors I recently spoke to someone who's college major and

1743
02:44:30,810 --> 02:44:38,250
History and had never studied for four years history world history and American history and just general history and he had never

1744
02:44:38,250 --> 02:44:40,670
Heard the Parthian Empire being mentioned

1745
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:43,410
So, I mean go figure

1746
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:45,130
Mm-hmm

1747
02:44:45,730 --> 02:44:52,130
That's why I think the last time we did a sonic I try to bring up the example of reading the MIT nuclear physics curriculum

1748
02:44:52,130 --> 02:44:52,650
actually

1749
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:54,870
If you read through it great

1750
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:56,850
It's kind of ridiculous

1751
02:44:56,850 --> 02:45:01,630
Yeah, it's basically just a bunch of hokey-pokey stuff that's why

1752
02:45:02,150 --> 02:45:04,650
Yeah, there's no progress in the world

1753
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:06,430
And why should there be?

1754
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:14,180
All right, anything else or we'll just wrap it up.

1755
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:19,080
We can we we certainly can wrap it up We we certainly threw away some time on that.

1756
02:45:19,360 --> 02:45:19,500
Well

1757
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:22,600
Very well done

1758
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:30,220
Okay, well contrary I think what Sam was bringing up I think these these are semi-productive if

1759
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:35,860
I would if other you know from feedback that I get from others and I would say so myself

1760
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:39,300
Simply because what's being said here is not being said anywhere else

1761
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:45,720
No, so then it's not just not just saying it and and it's not just saying it because not being said anywhere else

1762
02:45:45,720 --> 02:45:49,380
It's just saying it because it needs to be said right so

1763
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:52,720
It's a provable point most of the stuff.

1764
02:45:53,800 --> 02:46:02,380
Oh Yeah, yeah Yeah Okay, okay Bruce, well, thanks up and we'll do you have yourself a good night sir.

1765
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:02,940
Yep.

1766
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:03,760
Okay.

1767
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:04,440
Bye
