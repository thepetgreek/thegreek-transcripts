1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,430
Greetings, folks.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,530
How are you all tonight?

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,410
And Greek, how are you doing tonight, sir?

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,650
Greetings, everyone who cares to listen and hear things.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,670
Doing okay, as usual.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm gonna grab some coffee and smoke, so I'll go back over there and see if there's anything going on in chat.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:28,450
And if that's not cringeworthy, and like Sam says, and we'll maybe do a little short sonic.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,509
It might be really short if Sam doesn't come on.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,010
Unless you got any ideas, Bruce?

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,550
I don't.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,190
I'm fresh out of ideas.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:48,590
I was just scanning through the chat today and got my little self some nourishment on the Hebrew language, which I found very refreshing and very enlightened with.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,670
And that was given to us by one Thomas, and I'm very thankful for that.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,850
What an eye-opener.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,870
Oh, okay.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,250
I was a delight to get those little things.

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,290
What was it?

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:12,130
It was a rabbi teaching the video on the DNA of Hebrew.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,550
I hope he didn't say there's DNA in Hebrew.

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,830
No, no, no.

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,190
He was, I guess, dissecting the...

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,330
Yes, it is.

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:32,130
Yeah, but you gotta also listen to what rabbis say, but they, in other words, and also watch what they do, and they're two very different things.

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,770
You know, I don't know enough about the man.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,510
They say, do as they do, not do as they do.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,250
Yeah, the rabbis will never...

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,590
Here's an interesting thing.

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,230
Rabbis generally, they don't last long if they tell people the truth.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,630
Does that make any sense?

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,450
Just like lawyers and doctors, right?

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,870
Yeah, it does, yeah.

32
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,550
And again, I'm always astounded by that.

33
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:04,290
Yeah, so what they do, they have a story, a spiel, as they say in Yiddish, for the public, and then what they've discovered and how little they know is another spiel.

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,729
And I'm speaking from experience, but that's okay.

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,110
I have a feeling I'm a little more advanced than you guys are, unfortunately or fortunately, and you'll figure out more stuff.

36
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:26,270
I mean, you do bring a lot to the table and certainly give a lot to ponder on and chew on later, and I'm thankful for that.

37
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:39,610
You know, even small little bits and pieces, I go a long way in helping to understand this, and for me that's an enlightenment, and I need that, clearly.

38
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,990
I think we all do.

39
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:53,090
Well, you mentioned, yes, but it varies again, and you mentioned, let's go back to what you were saying earlier, this was a video presentation done by a rabbi on the DNA of Hebrew.

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:53,990
Right.

41
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,050
Is that about right?

42
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,250
Okay, so that's basically suggesting the origins of what's in it, right?

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:09,790
Dissecting words, the numerals of the words, the meanings of the word, taking it apart letter by letter, adding things up.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,490
I mean, there were some things that just were absolutely, you know, I took for granted when reading.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,050
Okay, good.

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:26,810
Now, the reason why we, let me just bring us back down to earth, because this is, I assure you, that was not in that text, the presentation.

47
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:42,950
The significance of anyone considering what is held within technical aspects, or the communicative aspects of the Hebrew language, usually bears its significance on what's called the Old Testament, or scriptures, you know, what's been preserved in that language, right?

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:50,790
That's why anyone would see that that language has any notable bearing on knowing what it's about, right?

49
00:03:51,150 --> 00:04:02,790
So, whether you know Hebrew, or English, or whatever language, can you communicate, and is what's being communicated, the information held within the Scripture being communicated to you?

50
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,150
Because if you don't understand something, it's not the information, it's you, right?

51
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:27,690
Like, for example, if you, right, so if you sit down, if you go to like a computer programming convention, and they have a one-hour lecture on C++, or COBOL, or whatever all this other stuff, old or new is, and you don't understand a dang thing, it's not the information, it's you, right?

52
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,250
You don't have the training, you don't know how to, right, you don't know what's being communicated.

53
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:44,150
So, my point is this, if you sat that rabbi down, not surely, but if you bet, this is a really good bet, and ask him to explain the scriptures to you, do you think he can?

54
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,570
And I would bet that he can't, outside of a religious, whatever, you know, dogma he's been showing.

55
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,390
So, my whole point of bringing these things up is, is the communication coming through?

56
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:14,490
You know, it's kind of like, you know, you got an 18-volt cordless power drill with a battery pack, 18-volt DC, and you got a socket on the wall that's 110 50 cycle AC.

57
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,570
You're with me, right?

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:32,750
So, when the battery on the 18-volt cordless drill starts to run down, you know that you somehow need to get the power from 115 or 110 AC, 120 AC, into that battery pack.

59
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,390
How do you do it?

60
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,570
You got a charger, right?

61
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:43,010
And the charger's got its own, it takes the AC 120 into DC 18 or like, you know, 19 and a half volt to charge, right?

62
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,790
Do you see my point?

63
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,850
Right, yes.

64
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,810
And this is what's going on with what's been held in ancient texts.

65
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,810
Can you convert it?

66
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:01,190
Or not convert it in a way where you change it, but get it so it's usable for what you're using, right?

67
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,050
Right, right.

68
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,590
And it's going to be an interesting road trying to get that mindset, you know.

69
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,190
It's all about mindset.

70
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,910
Yeah.

71
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,250
And you know, let's just play around a little bit.

72
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,950
I call it dicking around with this stuff.

73
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,830
You know, it means you can't take it seriously, but you're playing around with it, you know.

74
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,130
Playing with your thing.

75
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,530
So, what it is, is very simple.

76
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,230
You know, you got mindset, which means, well, you know, it's not subject matter, it's mindset, right?

77
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,510
Regardless of subject matter.

78
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,750
And then you've got weak mindset, strong mindset.

79
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,370
Then you've got mastermind set, right?

80
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,130
Right.

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,230
Think about that, right?

82
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,430
You've got the various aspects to it.

83
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,510
Which would go along with growth, I would think, huh?

84
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,950
Yeah, but you could grow crooked.

85
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,810
Yeah.

86
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,730
You could grow in the wrong direction, like a tree.

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:07,710
Unfortunately, based on people's decision-making ability, they make decisions that they can't change, believe it or not, you know.

88
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,170
Well, look at what happened with Christianity, you know.

89
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:20,630
Well, that was rotten from the beginning, because when I say beginning, that's, you know, 500 to a thousand AD.

90
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,810
There was really no such thing prior to that, other than various groups that couldn't be defined.

91
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:37,470
Yeah, it's just, but so it is, you know, the term Jewish was not used in common vernacular until about the late 17th or 18th century.

92
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,850
That was a fairly new development, you know, like African American, you know.

93
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,430
Right.

94
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,570
That was not used.

95
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:59,210
There was another one that was thrown in a chat about Jesus, and people trying to understand Jewish people when it came to the word Jesus.

96
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,590
And that was an interesting little, I guess, 10-20 minute documentary.

97
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,010
Well, you know, that's a real easy one to fix.

98
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,830
There's no such thing.

99
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,650
That's a fiction.

100
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,610
Right.

101
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,030
It's fiat.

102
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,470
There's no such thing as Jesus, yeah, as they say, you know, the Christian, they go blank.

103
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,830
But then again, there, you know, if you look at Christianity as a movement, look at the sci-fi convention movements.

104
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:35,470
You ever see, remember this, even if you haven't been to one, which I have not, the Star Trek conventions and the Star Wars conventions.

105
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,169
These people take these things very seriously, even though they're fiction.

106
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,870
And they've got, you know, a billion and a half, two billion strong.

107
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,690
So remember, the point is, it's not how many, it's the quality of what's going on.

108
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,890
Look at McDonald's and look at, you know, all the stuff, the information that's put out there.

109
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,490
Look at the rectangle, the dumpster.

110
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:14,210
What's on the rectangle, you know, other than a, you know, weather map and whatever you can glean from reference material, but otherwise there's not much on there.

111
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,930
I don't know if you guys remember the old pocket reference.

112
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,990
I found one the other day.

113
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,530
It was a little, the navy blue.

114
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,910
It's got about 400 pages, real fine print.

115
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,970
It's got every, you know, conversion chart and melting points of metals and freezing points and gases.

116
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,610
Do you remember those little references?

117
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,590
Yeah, yeah.

118
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,070
I used to saw them until a few years ago.

119
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,150
I used to see them at the checkout near the, you know, point of sale item at the hardware stores.

120
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,330
Yeah, they're quick buys.

121
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,870
Yeah, I don't see them anymore.

122
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,560
No, a little piece of nostalgia.

123
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,140
Yeah, I'm not even gonna get into slide rule and all that either, because slide rule is a mindset.

124
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Slide rule is a mindset, by the way.

125
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,500
It is, it is.

126
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,620
Yeah, so, you know, here's an interesting thing, just to throw around.

127
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,340
I guess people like to talk about Scripture.

128
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:15,640
I like to talk about Scripture, but there's a lot more to talk about that matters as well from us, you know, from just being a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant.

129
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,160
But there's like a thought of the minute, you know.

130
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,180
I wouldn't say thought of the day, but thought of the minute.

131
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:33,400
There is a certain book at the end of the compile, what they call the Bible, and it says that Satan, you know, the adversary comes to the earth with great wrath, you know, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, right?

132
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,460
You, you, does that ring, you know, do you recall something like that?

133
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes, I do.

134
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,340
Hmm.

135
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,620
All right, let's take a three-second pause there.

136
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,520
Okay, so you recall it.

137
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,640
It's pretty common, you know.

138
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,240
It'd be hard to find anyone who hasn't, who says they haven't, has even studied a little bit they've heard of it, right?

139
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,580
Okay.

140
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,680
Where does it show that the people complain about that?

141
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,070
901.

142
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,810
Yep, they don't mind it at all, because he's giving them, he's doing what?

143
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,750
He's accommodating them.

144
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:22,970
When you have a school bus full of second graders, and they're all yelling, we want ice cream, and the teacher and the bus driver say, okay, next right, we're gonna go to the ice cream store.

145
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,490
You think any of those children are going to be complaining?

146
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,410
Unless, you know, of course they can't make the transaction.

147
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:39,730
So what's going on is humanity's being watched on their level of free will, you know, what they want to do while they're on the ship, and they're being accommodated.

148
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,150
You ever hear of cryptocurrency?

149
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:43,790
Oh yeah.

150
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,930
You ever hear of freedom of religion?

151
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,070
Oh yeah.

152
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,050
You ever hear of freedom of speech?

153
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,110
You ever hear about, you know, voting secretly?

154
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,690
Mm-hmm.

155
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,150
Yeah, where do you think those things are inspired from?

156
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,750
You ever hear of vaccines, chemtrails, on and on and on?

157
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:14,150
There was another one that was brought in there this morning, I believe, by one lady of CHAT, wanted to talk about viruses and flu and a couple other things.

158
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,290
It's a medical fiction, basically, and there have been many medical fictions.

159
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,170
Manufactured by our unknowns, I guess you would call them.

160
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,850
The Rockefeller Institute, there was a group out of France that took care of the Europeans.

161
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,930
The Asians have sort of, you know, the Asians are the drones.

162
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,910
They just do, they believe in, you know, whatever the authority says we do.

163
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,130
Not all of them, but the great majority.

164
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,470
I mean, just like the rest of the world.

165
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,470
But they, they're the servile mentality.

166
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,050
They don't question it.

167
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,070
So they don't get bombarded with a lot of that free will steering about, like the Westerners do.

168
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,430
They don't have the propaganda machine as elaborate as the Westerners do.

169
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,910
They don't need it, right?

170
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,550
Because they focus on food, clothing, and shelter.

171
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:23,730
If you know people from Asia, all the way from the Pacific Rim to mainland China, and even Japan and all that, they have a sense of statism or authoritatism, that it's there to serve a function, and our function is to work within, you know, a certain framework of what we understand as our, you know, food, clothing, shelter.

172
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,450
Where the Westerners have somehow been given this idea that they can do whatever they want.

173
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,230
You know, they have this concept of, I don't know, we don't call it freedom and liberty, and they could choose to do whatever they want.

174
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:37,850
You know what I mean?

175
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:46,230
Like, for example, you know, they can have a Midwestern farmer, you know, and if the boy, young child says, I want to grow up to be a doctor, no one's going to complain.

176
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,450
Alright son, just make sure you study well, and we'll send you to a good school if we can afford it.

177
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,090
That's the response to that, right?

178
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,790
Most likely.

179
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,010
Unless, you know, the next summer, you know, when, you know, there's a new tractor, and it's like, what's the new tractor for?

180
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,890
To make sure you stay on the farm, right?

181
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,510
That's for you.

182
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:14,330
Well, there's that response also, but in Asia, if you come from a certain group or whatever, and you say that, that's like, you know, we're just going to ignore that, right?

183
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:34,950
So, until it became more Western to a certain degree, and of course, you have, you know, the idea of, I don't know how much of an underground market there is, but there's a lot of Asian people from, I've met quite a few actually, quite a few, meaning like 30 or 40 or 50 in the past couple of decades.

184
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:42,750
They come over here, they're washing dishes, and they phone back saying that if you come here, you'll make enough money to live like a king, right?

185
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,350
Right.

186
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,950
It's just different, right?

187
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,310
So, you know, there's an interesting cultural aspect to many of these things.

188
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:05,870
Just like, for example, if you go to the continent of Africa, in some suburban or semi-developed, you know, areas, even cities, you'll see buildings half-finished, and they're sitting there for like, you know, 10, 20 years, and you're like, what the hell, you know?

189
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:16,550
And well, they don't believe in getting low construction loans, so if they save up enough money, they'll put some of the bricks down and build the shell, and then like, if they have enough money in five or ten years, they'll put the windows in.

190
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,110
You know what I mean?

191
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,990
It's not like here, where, you know, well, let's just get a construction loan and build it all in one, you know, go, right?

192
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,330
Right.

193
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:34,630
Yeah, so you got to understand a little bit of the culture, but now it's all being, now, let's go back, you know, everyone is being accommodated by these demonic forces.

194
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,170
So what, you know, what do you want?

195
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:49,310
Because you're going to be accommodated as long as it's in line with what you've been raised to believe in, is what you should want, which is, that goes back to the mindset.

196
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:57,710
And the society you're in, I would think, also, plays a big part, you know, what the economy is like.

197
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:06,570
Well, there's the mindset, you see how the triggers work, you know, like, okay, let's say when you said the society, how it works, let's use the computer as a metaphor.

198
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,890
Would you say that everyone who has, like, a Microsoft computer is in the same, all those computers are in the same society?

199
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,990
They use Windows and, right, Microsoft's operating system, right?

200
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:28,130
No matter where they are, there's that computer culture society, whether, how far or how close they are, if it runs a Microsoft operating system, that's pretty much that Microsoft society, right?

201
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:40,730
So what happens is, even though they're all in the same society, they all break down and have different problems and catch different viruses and are susceptible and use different ways, each machine, typically.

202
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,690
Many of them can be used the same, but typically you can't say that they're all going to have the same problems, right?

203
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,630
Right.

204
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,110
So, and a lot of them is hardware based also.

205
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,570
So, I mean, not a lot, but often.

206
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,790
Let's go with people.

207
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,510
I'll give you an example.

208
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,550
I won't use names here.

209
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,550
If I use names, you folks might know who it is.

210
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:08,849
I made a phone call to a particular place and I got a receptionist and it got bumped up to a secretary and I started having a conversation.

211
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,470
This was regarding medicine and research.

212
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:21,450
And I brought up a few terms, you know, he says, well, you know, they're not available, but, you know, I'll take your query, I'll take some notes on it, and I'll move it along.

213
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,410
I said, oh, wow, I've never had that, because usually when you get a secretary, they say, I'll give you a name, they'll call you back, and that's it, right?

214
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,069
Right.

215
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,210
Very rarely do they say, I'll take, you know, give me a synopsis on what you want to know and I'll take notes on it and refer that as well.

216
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:38,090
I mean, that's really, that's a pretty cool, I mean, you really feel like you're being obliged, right?

217
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:45,030
So, I got a few things and then I paused because it got real quiet and I said, well, what do you think about that so far?

218
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,570
She goes, I don't know, I'm not technical.

219
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,050
I'm not a technical person, the secretary said.

220
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,870
I said, really?

221
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,070
Oh, okay, interesting.

222
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:05,190
So, because this happens often, and I explained, I said, can I make a personal comment, you know, don't take offense, but can I just give you what I've discovered with many people that say that?

223
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,950
She goes, oh, sure.

224
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,610
So, at some point in your life during your

225
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:15,850
youth, there was someone within the area, either family or social, that said

226
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,850
they're not technical and all the other people either applauded it and said

227
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,610
that's fine and they were still respected or still accepted and you

228
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,910
looked at that and you said, well, you know, being tech, you know, that's, I

229
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,870
have to discipline myself to learn technical things, let's say, and this

230
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,770
person here is respected and liked by others and they say that they don't like

231
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,870
technical stuff and they get away with it.

232
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,250
You know what?

233
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,390
I'm going to use that line the rest of my life.

234
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,420
Does that make any sense, what I just said?

235
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh, yeah.

236
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,120
The same way that people say, oh, I want to talk about, you ever hear about, oh, I'm not religious, you know, no, no, I don't want to talk about God, I'm not religious.

237
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:10,480
It's not that they're not religious, of course they are, you know, if they wake up in the morning and brush their teeth or, you know, doing anything regularly, they don't know what that means, but what happened with them also, at some point in their life, they recognized that people that were still liked and respected said that and got away with it, and they said, I'm going to use that line.

238
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,420
You see what I mean?

239
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,360
Yeah, that does make sense, yes.

240
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,160
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Okay, so anybody who benefit from this, email me for contact information, it's 150 bucks an hour for a PsycheVal there, there you go.

242
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,400
You know, it's funny, I had a guy once, he used to do these Skype calls, these group calls, and he says, oh, I said, why do you keep coming here?

243
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,820
You never say anything.

244
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:51,020
He says, oh, man, I got a really good deal from a psychotherapist, and you know, I pay like half because it was a friend of the family, but I get more out of listening to you than them, and I'm like, oh, I'm gonna stop right here, you got to send me your contact information so I could send you a bill, but anyway, that's just a joke.

245
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,980
So, all right, I'm going to move

246
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,900
from this, I'm just doing some weather work, I hate to say, right, say or not say,

247
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,720
yeah, actually, if anyone's interested, I'm aiming pretty much north from the

248
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,520
southwest, you go to any weather map, you'll see there's a huge swath, go to a

249
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,220
24-hour one, and you'll see what's going on, it's pretty interesting, and

250
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,920
then the idea is to reverse it, so you know, half the weathermen get fired

251
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,360
because all of their forecasts won't work.

252
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,860
I'd be grateful for a warmer weather.

253
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Yeah, we could do that, that's actually, we could do that, you know,

254
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,840
once back, there was someone in Chicago, an investor type, it says there's a big

255
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,100
snowstorm coming in four days, if you could stop that, I believe it, and we

256
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:49,840
stopped, it was sunny, it went up 20 degrees, and they were really

257
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,620
enthralled, but after, skeptical again, it was like, oh, I gotta keep doing it, it

258
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,060
doesn't work that way, you know, so, Sam, there we go, Sam, we're on with Bruce,

259
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:12,560
and so, what's going on, Sam, anything you want to talk about, I'll just

260
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,440
share with everyone, you know, there's no subject of study for tonight,

261
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,740
other than just getting, you know, some, you can either save our breath to cool

262
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,180
our porridge, or blow balloons, or whatever, but there's really not much to

263
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,480
talk about, is there, tonight?

264
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,400
Well, I mean, initially, that wasn't the case, but we can bounce around, I suppose.

265
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,680
I guess I had a general question that I've been

266
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,100
walking around with in my head, and I've had some encounters with people where

267
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,060
you try to talk to them about their perspective on things, and these are just

268
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,760
sort of, I don't know, regular people, for lack of a better word, like young people

269
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,820
in their early 20s that don't really have much direction, and they're just

270
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,580
doing whatever, and when you try to have a conversation with them about, say, the

271
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,600
ideal interplay between being objective and subjective, because when you try to

272
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,280
objectify things, there's this trendy mindset currently, which I guess you

273
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,260
could say is some kind of an offshoot from the New Age, where people want to be

274
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,840
very feelings-driven, and want their sensory experiences to sort of dictate

275
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,800
the direction of their lives, and when you try to suggest that they should be a

276
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,040
bit more rational, they associate this with some kind of, um, what's the bad guy

277
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,260
in the Stanley Kubrick movie?

278
00:22:34,360 --> 00:23:02,960
Dr. Strangelove, evil, overly cold, not very warm, projecting, and they seem to have a hard time getting over that image, and I try to sort of show that the objective and the subjective can go hand in hand, that you do have to have some kind of a metric to measure what you're seeing in the world, whilst at the same time, sure, you can go out and be sort of engaged in emotional pursuits also.

279
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:13,500
So my question is sort of, how would the Greek, using Greek speak, sort of show that interplay as being the ideal, rather than having it swing to one extreme?

280
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,060
Okay, let's go back piece by piece.

281
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,700
The crux of the matter is the younger people, twenty-somethings objectifying, right?

282
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,320
Maybe they don't know how to objectify, because it was never simplified.

283
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:43,140
I would suggest that the easiest way to define objectification, other than it's the absence of subjectivity, is whether it's a concept or a physical thing, is to start by understanding its origin, right?

284
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,900
So like, for example, can mankind be objectified when we have, let's say, creationism versus evolution?

285
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,940
And I put the verses there because it's still viewed that way.

286
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,640
And then there's the attempt to harmonize them.

287
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:12,140
Well, yes, because if, let's just look at the origin of the creation myth or story or declaration, because I gave you the ways it's viewed, and then let's just look at where evolution came from, that whole concept, its origins.

288
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,540
And now we can start objectifying the information, right?

289
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,480
But the problem with, you want to do what they call psychoanalysis of young people, is very simple.

290
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:35,860
Well, they're small people, they were just recently children, and now their stature has increased, so they're not so small, but their minds are still small, just like their parents.

291
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,980
I think you've heard me discuss that people stop developing at eight or nine years old, but this is not good to tell them, because they think...

292
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:56,820
But the evaluation of these young people is that, especially this generation right now, has realized, even though it's difficult for them to elaborate or communicate it, is that the old people are fools.

293
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,920
They've been lied to, and the stuff that the old people do and believe too is rubbish.

294
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,820
You get it?

295
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,320
Okay, but then now they're in a conflict, because wherever they go to get

296
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,820
edification, it's usually an older person, like a college professor, or, you know,

297
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,980
the talking heads on TV, or church, or wherever they go, or, you know, they're

298
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,980
told to usually garner information from other people, and, you know, that know,

299
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,740
they're in the know, and they tend to be older, so you got a little bit of a

300
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,080
problem.

301
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:46,440
That's why I think you and I once had a conversation, and one of the best ways, and I'm not really for it, but I wouldn't disagree, or I would say, I would agree, but not strongly, is that the best way to get through to young people is through video games, music, and that culture that they adhere to as being, you know, something that they find happiness in.

302
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,040
You know what I mean?

303
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,600
So that's why very often it's said, imagine making an objective film about subject matter.

304
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,180
Okay, what does that mean?

305
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,040
Well, let's actually make a, you know, there's a Bible-themed films.

306
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,000
Let's just do, let's make a film that's in scripture.

307
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:25,240
You know, that'll, you know, let's do a Ten Commandments movie, how it really went down, right, with Moses being 80 years old, and the tablets being, like, really small in his hand, and, you know, with them walking on an ice bridge, let's say, right, because it was really cold out, which was a miracle for it to freeze like that, you know.

308
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,240
So anyway, you know, the older demographic, if you're 21 and older, you're going to lose it.

309
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,440
They're not going to be able to stand it, but the 21 and younger are going to love it, right.

310
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:49,500
They will, from personal experience, I'll tell you, young people do, quote-unquote, resonate with the truth much better than older people do, as a general group.

311
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,860
Yeah, that's understood.

312
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,160
And they're not going to get it from the older people.

313
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:12,440
But what I'm talking about is more of a linguistical methodology for making a case, because you'll talk to these young people, or at least I will, and you can't really get them to see what you're trying to say about objectivity.

314
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:22,900
Like, they're very stuck in this feelings-driven way of thinking, where if you try to put that down, they feel like you're demonizing it, and they don't even know why they have to be rational about anything.

315
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,220
Yeah, if they don't like something, they'll just say, that's an opinion, that's why I don't like it, it's not the truth, yeah.

316
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:46,660
Well, that's the problem, that's the armoring, you know, Wilhelm Reich talked about armoring, and I gave a mild example of it earlier, how people latch on to catchphrases they carry for the rest of their lives, because it gives them a feeling that they could get away from a certain discipline, right.

317
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,680
And accomplishment, yes.

318
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:57,980
Right, so, yeah, well, let's just look at it several ways.

319
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:06,160
One way, let's go back to Scripture, these people that we're discussing, these younger people, are not viewed favorably in Scripture, right?

320
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,240
This last generation is probably the most wicked group of people to ever walk on this planet, right?

321
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,220
And we're like, well, how could that be?

322
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,940
You know, well, we'll find out.

323
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,040
Okay, so that's a big thing to consider, right?

324
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah, I would suggest the ones born after 1998, or specifically the ones born after 2003, 2004, right, those would be in the last generation more specifically, you know.

325
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah, but their vessels for that.

326
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,280
Sure, sure, but that doesn't mean that you can't talk to one of them and get them to do something.

327
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,720
No, I think the whole group niche can be, if you talk to one of them, you can talk to all of them, and vice versa, right?

328
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,880
And then there's the more specific side.

329
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,340
The other way I would, the way I approach young people is by questioning.

330
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:13,300
Like, for example, today I was out doing commerce, and I noticed the clerk was within the range that you were discussing, young 20s.

331
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,820
I mean, actually, if I told you they looked like 13, but they were really around 20, 22, around there, you know what I mean?

332
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,940
So, and I handed them the notes, and they gave me the number.

333
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,800
I said, here are the notes.

334
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,080
I hope you get money for it someday.

335
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,700
And they kind of gave me like the stare for half a second.

336
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,260
And I said, well, do you know the serial numbers on the money?

337
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,840
She goes, what?

338
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,680
I said, the serial numbers on the money.

339
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,120
You know where they come from?

340
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,800
They're like, no, I said birth certificates.

341
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,960
And they're like, really?

342
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,300
I said, does Does that sound morally correct to you?

343
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,400
Have you ever heard that before?

344
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,260
He goes, no, that doesn't sound morally correct to me at all.

345
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:59,340
So right there you're asking several questions and you're actually providing within the answer the issue of morality.

346
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,380
She didn't understand what you said though, that's just a pat answer.

347
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,160
Yeah, but it's a start.

348
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,900
No, but that's not good enough.

349
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,560
I mean, I'm talking about how do you present objectivity as being desirable, not throwing like little crumbs.

350
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,700
That's like telling people they have to like something.

351
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:34,260
Well, no, it's not saying that they have to, but that it is advisable that they would at least inquire into it.

352
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh, that's a different thing.

353
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,420
Yeah, now you've become their attorney though.

354
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,260
No, I'm not their attorney.

355
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
I know, I know.

356
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm an attorney for what I'm saying.

357
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,680
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:53,900
See, I've been, just from personal experience, I've done it one-on-one and I've done it in groups.

359
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,180
And with both you have to use a very high sense of discernment of the group.

360
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,920
You have to put every aspect of what you know, what's called profiling and stereotyping at its highest and best use.

361
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:23,680
Like if you see a guy who's 20 years old with jet black hair, black fingernails and a duster coat dragging on the ground with work boots and he looks like Eddie Munster, you're not going to say the same thing to them.

362
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,960
Because I've seen them, those creatures walking around.

363
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,640
Oh, yeah.

364
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:40,740
And if you see, you know, a Latin or black dude with a baseball cap to the side, you know, dragging knuckles on the ground with his pants all the way down, it's different, you know.

365
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:50,480
So, and then you got the preppy white boy, you know, that's different too.

366
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,780
Yeah, but what you're saying about different is just the tone of how you approach them.

367
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm talking about the content.

368
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,640
Anybody can adjust their tone that has some sense.

369
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's tone the content also to a certain degree.

370
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,200
Content also.

371
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,480
That's really a big question.

372
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,960
But that can be adjusted when you think about how would you address a mixed multitude of people at once.

373
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,320
No, no, I'm talking about one-on-one, not a mixed multitude.

374
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,680
One-on-one, you have to use every profiling, stereotypical, prejudiced thing you can imagine at its highest and best use.

375
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,600
In other words, all those things that I tell you are not politic, you get it?

376
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,400
Yeah, I don't mean be stereotypical and profile on a loose and nonsensical way.

377
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,380
You almost have to be a bit of a shrink, you know, just to get in their head and feel them out and know where they're going and where they came from.

378
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,330
Yeah, but you can see it depends.

379
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,670
If you could read what they call the spirit through the eyes, that's a really good one.

380
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,030
I'll give you an example.

381
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:04,610
These sodomite types or lesbian types, once you get a point, they're very easy.

382
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,630
Because when you look at their eyes, their eyes look like plastic.

383
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,730
They have no light coming out of it at all.

384
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,770
They have no glint.

385
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,530
It looks like they're mannequins.

386
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,790
It's really interesting.

387
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,670
I've been showing people that and they're like, yeah, that's real interesting.

388
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,290
I say, yeah, well, there's a spirit that's working in that, right?

389
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,890
All this stuff has a spiritual counterpart to it.

390
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,570
But how would you communicate it, Sam?

391
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,510
Again, it's so highly specialized.

392
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,870
It sounds like what you're saying is not…

393
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:38,150
In other words, what you're saying, Sam, is how do you objectify being objective?

394
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,190
How do you objectify imparting an objective reality to someone?

395
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:53,100
Yes, and also how do you objectify that to them as they're looking back at you?

396
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,560
Because you're trying to give them something that they can then make sense of and establish as being valuable.

397
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,240
Timing is important as well.

398
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:11,520
If they've got to get somewhere and they're not really listening to you, it doesn't matter what you say.

399
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,900
No, well, here's two different scenarios.

400
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,960
So, one, I'm talking to a certain girl.

401
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,100
She's 20, and the conversation goes relatively well.

402
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,320
I'd say, you know, 7 out of 10.

403
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,440
She's receptive.

404
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,120
She's listening.

405
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,780
She's interested.

406
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,940
She's asking questions.

407
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,960
She actually has to go take a smoke, and she's like, why don't you come with me so we can continue the conversation?

408
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,080
And then even when I don't go with her because I'm working, she comes back and says, let's keep talking about what we were talking about before.

409
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:51,260
But then, you know, the next day when I show up, there's hardly any exchange of words at all.

410
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,960
And you can tell that, like, the spark has sort of died down or the spark of curiosity has died down.

411
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,460
And I know that I'm not going to meet her the next day because she's going to be gone from the city.

412
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:10,540
So clearly she's not feeling any kind of stress or urgency enough to establish a permanent connection, like give me your phone number or let's be friends on Facebook.

413
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,120
So I might never see her again.

414
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:20,440
But I know that for a brief moment, she had this sort of lucid realization of something that was pertinent, and then maybe it died down later.

415
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,700
I count that as a success because it shows that rhetorically I was able to establish something.

416
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,560
But then in another situation, you come up to somebody who is exactly the same age, same gender.

417
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,080
And they're essentially antithetical to everything that you're saying, not in a violent way or aggressive way because I'm being diplomatic.

418
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,500
But you can see that they don't really want to continue in that subject.

419
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,240
And then they say, well, I have to go to the bathroom.

420
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,700
And then they come back and change the subject so that we end up going somewhere else.

421
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,780
OK.

422
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,980
I'd say the first one, Sam, I think you might have given just enough that maybe later on they might pick it up.

423
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,960
But that second one sounds like a lost cause.

424
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,340
Yeah.

425
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,880
This is either one.

426
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,940
If it's the same gender, Sam, just remember this.

427
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,300
All right.

428
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,600
Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.

429
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,700
But anyway, that's an old saying.

430
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,360
Bruce is old enough to probably know that, right?

431
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,800
But anyway.

432
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,420
I mean, it comes down to what I'm seeing as being skill.

433
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,840
Because I had the skill to deal with whatever the mindset or the spirit was behind the first girl.

434
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
And with the second girl, it was a completely different armory.

435
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,540
OK, let's get ghetto.

436
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,800
Ghetto means you got game.

437
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,160
You got game, man.

438
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,920
You ain't got no game.

439
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,800
Anyway.

440
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,000
What?

441
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:43,960
What?

442
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,520
Jesus.

443
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,520
I'm just joking, yo.

444
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,460
But anyway.

445
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,340
That's why I said back in the days, was it the 50s, 60s, there was a saying, candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.

446
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,260
Liquor is quicker.

447
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:57,620
Yeah.

448
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,520
No, I would suggest it's mindset.

449
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,660
And regardless of what you're talking about, if the mindset's not there, it doesn't matter.

450
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,720
Like, you know, in Greek-speak, we cover every subject under the sun, right?

451
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,720
And ones that are not even under the sun, let's say, allegedly.

452
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,800
So the thing is, it's a mindset that allows one to do that, right?

453
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,080
You're presuming.

454
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:30,040
Like, when I do Greek-speak, let's say I go on, let's say, something like a Ridiculous Freeman interview, I try to set the mindset immediately.

455
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,380
And right away I know it's OK if there's 1,000 people listening.

456
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,400
If we lose 995, it's OK.

457
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,860
And the mindset's already set that up.

458
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:51,440
So when I, let's say, give an example, this sounds like, you know, you and I now are playing table tennis, right, back and forth with this conversation, because it's going to be very personal aspects that have to come up.

459
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,140
I like to address the mindset.

460
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,480
And within that address, I also tell people, within a few words or somehow, that most people don't want to talk about this because it's uncomfortable.

461
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:26,180
But, you see, so instead of making it seem like what we're saying within this framework of objectivity, let's say, is going to be all peaches, peachy keen, and roses, and rosy, and all that, try to let them know right away this is, you know, what did they do with the gangster rap albums after, was it Ice-T, F the Police, all that.

462
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,680
You've got to put the explicit lyrics sticker on the CDs and, remember?

463
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,780
Yeah, so you've got to let them know that there's an explicit lyrics and explicit thought forms on this conversation.

464
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,080
So anyway, that's one way.

465
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:48,940
Well, there is a facet of pop culture which has sort of valorated or valorized a sort of thinking.

466
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,000
You may have heard it.

467
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,240
It's sort of trendy right now.

468
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,780
It's called wokeness.

469
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,720
So it's this idea of being aware or being awake of what's, quote, unquote, actually happening.

470
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:09,380
It doesn't really extend further than, say, sort of benign conspiracy theories like be aware that there's GMOs in the marketplace or be aware that the government lies or things like this.

471
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,540
But it's still this idea that you want to be keyed into certain knowledge that the masses are oblivious to because they're stupid.

472
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,100
So you're the one who's not stupid and therefore you're woke.

473
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:33,960
So you can use that sort of thing to make inroads into a conversation by appealing to people's sense of wanting to be special or there's self-exceptionalism by touching on the mindset and suggesting that, well, have you considered this?

474
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,780
And they'll find that to be interesting.

475
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm going to stop you right there because if we went back 500 years ago and told anyone that the government lies and the church is full of crap and the drugs are bad or whatever, whether they're legal or illegal, people will agree.

476
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,000
They know that.

477
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,320
It's always been that way.

478
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,400
The government always lies.

479
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,440
So how about one suggestion would be do you know how people say the government lies and they do and how this is so?

480
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,860
That's because they're accommodating the mindset of the people.

481
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,300
There's a difference there, a big difference.

482
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:18,200
To expect that the government is not going to lie, if we went back 4,000 years, any time in history, except for certain people that were supposed to be lawful, the government didn't lie.

483
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,300
For example, if you go to Scripture, I'll get back on the subject real quick, there was no secrets from the people.

484
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,340
There were sequestered places where not everyone can go.

485
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,240
Let's say the high priest can only go at a certain time, but there were no secrets.

486
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,120
So what's happening now is the people have been let down to a belief and have been groomed and bred.

487
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,840
Now, you can groom something out of someone, but you can't unbreed something out of someone.

488
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:57,260
So they've been bred and groomed into a certain way where everything, there isn't all-out chaos, where everyone's just killing each other at random because they're being accommodated.

489
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,720
For example, that's why I always say that, maybe you haven't heard me say this, but I'll say it.

490
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,580
When there's something to be acquired, I won't say I can't afford that.

491
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,160
I'll say I don't want to afford that.

492
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,620
Because how many times have you heard people working, flipping burgers at minimum wage, and they want a brand-new car, and they get it.

493
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:26,260
They'll get enough for the deposit, they'll get someone to co-sign, they'll get a loan, and then in two years they have a brand-new car.

494
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,440
You're like, wait a second, that's like a three-year salary, how'd you do that?

495
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,500
Because they wanted to afford it, even though they couldn't.

496
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,400
So instead of saying I can't afford that, say I don't want to afford that, past, present, future.

497
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,100
Or another way is that doesn't accommodate me.

498
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,180
Instead of I don't like it, or I don't want it, that doesn't accommodate me.

499
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,940
Actually, let me just bounce around a little bit here.

500
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,960
I had a conversation with someone over a decade ago, and I was talking about legal stuff.

501
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,000
And I said, look, man, it's all contract.

502
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,160
I saw him about a year later, and he says, Greek, you were right.

503
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,900
I said, what happened?

504
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,780
He says, well, they wanted to give me 30 days in jail.

505
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,940
And I told the judge that sentencing, I told him that I can't do that.

506
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,700
And the judge says, why?

507
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,140
I says, because that doesn't benefit me.

508
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,260
And the judge stopped and said, then what does?

509
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,420
He says that I have this case dismissed, and I don't do any time in jail at all.

510
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,900
And the judge says, okay, how about a $500 fine and 30 hours community service?

511
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,840
He says, yeah, fine, I'll do that.

512
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,680
So let me back up here.

513
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,440
The judge wanted him to do 30 days in jail agreeing with the prosecutor, right?

514
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,900
This was over, like, signing paper.

515
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,760
Like, they charged him for being a false notary or something, and he wasn't.

516
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:55,920
Anyway, to make a long story short and just focusing on the matter here, when he objected to the 30 days in jail, it was because, you know, he needs to work to pay his rent, and he had a child or whatever.

517
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,800
So he can't be gone for 30 days, you know.

518
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,680
So when the judge says, why don't you object to the 30 days, it's because it doesn't benefit me.

519
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,900
And the judge says, okay, then how about this then?

520
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,340
Do you see my point?

521
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:28,460
So when you're having a conversation, even on a layman level, when you're dealing with people, either social or from an edifying point of view, like if someone brings you somebody, let's say you tell something to someone and they can't explain it like you, they'll actually bring them to you and say, hey, Sam, why don't you tell them what you told me because you could say it better, right?

522
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,780
That's a possibility, right?

523
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:38,480
When that happens and when there's a communication, why are people listening?

524
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:47,780
You know, is it because if they hear the information they'll be better, you know, financially, stature-wise, you know, status-wise, or what?

525
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,640
Is it going to alleviate a fear that they have?

526
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,960
Is it going to satisfy a curiosity?

527
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,420
You know, how is it accommodating or benefiting them?

528
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:11,100
So, you know, like Sun Tzu said, you know, the art of war, one of the reasons it was essential to compile this is because he thought about what all people have in common is personal gain, the desire for personal gain.

529
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,080
You see?

530
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,100
So how does it benefit anyone?

531
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,700
I'll give you a reason why.

532
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,760
The reason why I did Greek speak is very simple.

533
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,760
It's because no one else was saying these things, and most of them were blaringly obvious.

534
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,180
I mean, it's just so obvious.

535
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,500
It's like the 800-pound gorilla in the room filing, clipping his toenails.

536
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,940
You know, that's how obvious, you know.

537
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,280
So I had to say it from that point of view.

538
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,120
I never went out and said, well, this is going to benefit anyone.

539
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,740
On the contrary, I said this is going to break up.

540
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:53,740
If you try to decide to go down this road with even half the subjects discussed with Greek speak, I assure you, it will break up your family, you won't have any friends, and you're going to have a miserable time.

541
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,240
But at least you'll have a miserable time being happy you know the truth.

542
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,360
Let me say that again.

543
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,060
You'll have a miserable time being happy that you know the truth.

544
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,500
Amen.

545
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:17,920
Sure, but that kind of thing pertains more to sort of these closed intimate relationships between family members where there are certain expectations of how people should act and things are a little more sensitive.

546
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:30,160
Whereas if you're going to run into a stranger, you have the ability to sort of create the lay of the land on the fly if you respect whatever the dynamics are between your personality and their personality.

547
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:38,840
And as far as what you said about personal gain, I feel like everybody wants to have a narrative that they can use to contextualize their experiences.

548
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,140
Otherwise they end up becoming apathetic or misled or deceived or there's a cognitive dissonance because they can't understand the world around them.

549
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,640
Well, hold on.

550
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,460
Most people are living under the presumption that other people care about what they have to say.

551
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,500
And I think I've mentioned this before.

552
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:02,960
From public speaking, I'd look at people and I'm wondering if they're really listening or they're just waiting for me to shut up and sit down so they can get the microphone and say what they have to say.

553
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,220
Well, I think about that occasionally.

554
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:15,300
And what I keep coming to is that if what you have to say is interesting enough that it captivates them, then it does tame down that desire to then jump up and speak.

555
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:23,160
So what I'm trying to find out is how can you create a presentation of this objective mindset in a way that is captivating to people?

556
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,040
Simple.

557
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,080
You've got to be on the fly.

558
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,200
Do you have to be a surface bear?

559
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,680
Maybe, but at least you're getting somewhere.

560
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,600
Well, yeah, the surface bear, I've thrown that out there a couple of times.

561
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,000
I never explained it fully, but I could another time or maybe later.

562
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,080
But it's very simple.

563
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,700
I can only, for expediting, review what I've said.

564
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:54,580
If you've ever heard Greek speak, especially, like I said, when I do like a ridiculous Freeman thing or whatever else, I'll come out and I'll mention timekeeping.

565
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,020
Why?

566
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,520
Because that's the most obvious that most people will encounter that.

567
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:06,080
Most people will encounter, let's say, the money system or currency, but they don't think about it.

568
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,180
But most people will think more about time than they think about the money system.

569
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,580
So there's a certain order.

570
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:28,620
There's a bringing up the obvious and why and how it can be considered for what it is versus what the person might think personally about it.

571
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,170
And that goes back to what you're saying.

572
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,370
Now you have to find people that want to be objective.

573
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:46,110
Just like I said earlier, if I do get an interview and there's a thousand people listening, I make sure in the first 30 seconds that I lose 99% of the audience.

574
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:53,610
Yeah, but that's because you have the luxury of choosing 10% of the audience because you even have an audience to begin with.

575
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:58,290
But if you're talking to one person, that is your skills versus their censorship.

576
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,470
And what is the level of your skill and your rhetorical presentation?

577
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:12,830
Well, the level then, again, is you need to figure out who you're talking to really well and get into their desire, which is common.

578
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,410
If they're uncomfortable, they want to be comfortable.

579
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,870
If they're hungry, they want to eat.

580
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,050
If they're stupid, they usually don't know they're stupid, so they don't want to learn.

581
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,210
You see?

582
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,850
You know, stupid people don't know that they're stupid, by the way.

583
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,590
You know how I know that?

584
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,570
I go talk to a professor, ask him if he's stupid, and he'll say, no, I'm not stupid.

585
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:41,930
I tell these idiots usually, I said, you know that if you knew the truth, you'd be fired in like a week, right?

586
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,550
Not a truth in general, you know, like some kind of altruistic truth.

587
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:54,510
You know, I'm talking about the specific field that they're studying, even if it's the anal glands of the Moroccan housefly.

588
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,030
A misunderstood subject.

589
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:00,710
Right.

590
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:23,530
So, again, it's very specific, but I would say if I was speaking to a plebeian, you know, just someone out on the street, it might be a little harsh, but generally when you're walking about and running into people, they are so far gone that when I use the term space heater, I mean it.

591
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,070
They're just taking up space and giving off heat.

592
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:42,930
Yeah, but this is just, I mean, at the end of the day, we can choose to not reject that view, and it shouldn't be rejected because it is pointing to enough truth.

593
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:51,910
But it is pejorative, ultimately, to say that they're space heaters, even if they are space heaters, because you can reach one person.

594
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,490
You know, Sam.

595
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,210
So do you have the skills to do that?

596
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,550
Look, it's winter season here.

597
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,290
I reach for a space heater occasionally.

598
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,670
Do you get it?

599
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,910
Because it's cold, space heater warms up.

600
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,470
Okay, so if you need a body, you know.

601
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,950
Usually when the Greek gets stuck, he starts making jokes.

602
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,350
No, it's not about being stuck.

603
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,050
It's a matter of, you know, it's too open-ended.

604
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,290
I think it's personal.

605
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,250
Let's go back to the interviews.

606
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:30,490
Usually when someone wants to interview the Greek, I look at the rest of the stuff that they're doing, and I know, you know, I see the response that they've gotten on the rest of the stuff, and I see the mindset of the people that are coming repeatedly because the chances.

607
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,410
Let's say I get interviewed by someone who's got 10 YouTubes.

608
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:39,990
The chances of each of the 10 YouTubes being watched by individual people that have not repeated is very slim.

609
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:40,830
They're usually repeats.

610
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,490
So I get to see the mindset, right?

611
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:48,490
So you could use that concept with people that you know or even don't know.

612
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,630
You know, if you see someone out.

613
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,770
You're doing an analysis ahead of time.

614
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,110
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:50:54,170 --> 00:51:12,210
And most people right now, just like at any time other than right now, what's so interesting right now is that the, believe it or not, people are not so concerned about food, clothing, and shelter as much as they used to be because they don't have to interact with it as much.

616
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,130
Specifically.

617
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:24,190
In other words, you could work a certain job or a job that has nothing to do with food, clothing, and shelter, and what you get, the money that's ordered up with the paycheck, you know, pay to the order of, you're ordering money.

618
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:32,690
You used to get food, clothing, shelter, where years ago, no matter what you did in society, you had to invest a certain amount of time in food, clothing, and shelter.

619
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,570
You didn't buy a shirt.

620
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,270
You didn't buy a coat.

621
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,910
You had to know someone or make it yourself, let's say.

622
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,210
Or, you know, you didn't buy a meal.

623
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,850
You had to make it.

624
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,030
And shelter, you also had to modify or make.

625
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:56,650
So now people are totally removed in most cases from that in most parts of the world where they can pretty much think they can do whatever they want to get those things.

626
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,610
There was a bartering going on back then, you know.

627
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,510
You were in touch with other people.

628
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,810
You knew other people.

629
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,870
One way or another, if you had to have a shirt made, you were two people away from having it done.

630
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:18,670
Well, gold was the currency of the elite, the monarchs, and the lords.

631
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:25,110
Silver was the currency of the common man, and barter was the currency of the poor.

632
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:26,830
Yeah.

633
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:27,550
Yeah.

634
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,230
So whenever you hear bartering, by the way, that's poor, the poor classes.

635
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,510
The common classes, meaning the society at large used silver.

636
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:45,910
That's why if you remember pre-1960s American coins, whether they were dimes, nickels, quarters, half dollars, were made of what, Bruce?

637
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,390
You remember?

638
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,450
Silver, mostly.

639
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,190
Right, yeah.

640
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:50,770
So that was common.

641
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,870
And then you had the gold certificates.

642
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:59,730
You know, whenever you got a 50 note that said, you know, at any Federal Reserve Bank, exchange it for what?

643
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:00,650
Gold.

644
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,190
When it was 20 or $10 notes, it was exchanged for what?

645
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:04,830
Silver.

646
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,010
Yeah, yeah.

647
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:13,750
By the way, Seth just mentioned that he will call in in about 10 minutes or so.

648
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,550
Oh, okay.

649
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,310
So long.

650
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,330
Yeah, anybody else wants to call in, that's fine.

651
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,850
We don't have any subject matter tonight that we're hammering out.

652
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:29,650
And if you'd like to bring up a subject and call in, you know, welcome to do so.

653
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:29,790
Sure.

654
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,270
The point that Sam is bringing up is an interesting thing.

655
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:44,030
And I've mentioned loosely to I think Sam personally and other people about that general roundabout subject.

656
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:49,410
How do you communicate this to other people or, you know, why is there mixed reaction on this?

657
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:56,750
And ultimately, there's something that I've been speaking of called cosmic censorship, right?

658
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,830
And another thing that I've mentioned is our thoughts are externally garnered, right?

659
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,950
We receive and communicate.

660
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:15,350
So just like in the computer, when you have a port or something, you know, that the information coming in or out is controlled via that port or that program.

661
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:29,290
In other words, when you're addressing someone, whether it's known to you, so the person is well-known or just unfamiliar or just vaguely acquainted with them, you're not just speaking to them directly.

662
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,570
You're speaking to what's controlling them on the other side.

663
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,640
Yeah, but you can't just presume that they don't have any agency of their own because certain facets of their mind.

664
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,180
Yeah.

665
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:41,900
They do.

666
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
That's why it's demanded and commanded that we are disciplined and educated, right, throughout the years, right?

667
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:01,280
And what that does is the discipline and the education and the edification that we have as people within a culture and also individually is how do we free will handle that situation without knowing it.

668
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,880
I'll give you an example of how that works so simply.

669
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,480
You've heard me discuss lymphology and the biological vacuum.

670
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:18,640
And they're both very different, but I bring up lymphology because it's closer to the reality than the allopathic medicine, you know, that you're just chemical dump, right?

671
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,500
Okay.

672
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,080
So if you burn, bruise, break, what do I say?

673
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,660
Squeeze it.

674
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,080
And I don't mean just squeeze it.

675
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:45,180
I mean methodically go into a regimen where you have extreme constriction that relieves within an interim, so you have to maintain circulation and maintain that squeeze to produce a biological vacuum or retain that so it heals very quickly, anywhere from five to 100 times faster than normal.

676
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:55,140
So when you bring up that point, it's like, oh, okay, why does that make sense to most people?

677
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,120
Because you ever see someone bump their nose or their elbow?

678
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,120
What's the first thing they do?

679
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,260
They grab it and they hold on to it, don't they, right?

680
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,020
You ever see someone?

681
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,980
Bump my elbow.

682
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,660
What do they do?

683
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
They put their hand on it.

684
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,540
Grab that bugger and hold on to it tight, yeah.

685
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,600
Yeah, and you're like, hey, what are you doing?

686
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,940
Oh, I just bumped my elbow.

687
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:19,400
And if you were doing a storyboard for a film, someone who just came around the corner, bumped their elbow, how would you cast the actor?

688
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,060
How would you direct the actor?

689
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,780
You would have the actor, let's say, if he bumps his left elbow, have his right arm facing to the left with his hand cupping the elbow.

690
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,500
Wouldn't you see that in the scene, let's say, to make it realistic?

691
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,080
Or if someone just got punched in the nose, you would have them coming around the corner as an actor.

692
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,240
Wouldn't you direct them to put their hands on their nose while they're telling the other actor, I just got punched in the nose, you see?

693
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,180
And doesn't that seem very logical and rational to everyone, that's the normal thing to do?

694
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:54,440
Okay, so when you give a piece of information which is reactionary also, what is normal for them to do?

695
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:59,820
Well, they have to contemplate it or ignore it because they have that choice.

696
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,450
I mean, yes, I do understand how the censorship works on their end.

697
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:11,390
I'm just trying to find an offensive with which I can pierce that.

698
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,950
And like I said, it's some kind of a skill that I haven't quite nailed down.

699
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,130
Sure, sure.

700
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:28,750
One thing that I would do on that is when you, you know, the concept of a mirror, right, is to send a reflection and that's the general, you know, back to the source.

701
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:36,810
So one thing that I would suggest is public speaking because you will learn more about your delivery when you're doing public speaking.

702
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,650
I'll give you an example.

703
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:47,610
Let's just say the first time I got on radio on AFR, it was to co-host the Vinnie Eastwood show and have Trevor James Constable as a guest, right?

704
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,710
And I was just by myself.

705
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,050
I knew I was just alone because Trevor wasn't even on the line yet.

706
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:58,590
And the moment they said you're on, it was like I was just in the room with a microphone.

707
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:04,930
I was facing a proverbial black hole and I felt like I was going to fall into it, right?

708
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,410
I didn't know.

709
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:11,850
I just all of a sudden realized this giant abyss of silence, right?

710
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:31,350
If you ever speak publicly to a small audience, when I would mean like five to ten or more people, and you present yourself to speak and they all go quiet and they're listening, ready, focusing on you, there is a moment there, whether it's a short moment or a long moment, where you're like, uh, okay.

711
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:37,730
What you're noticing is a vacuum that happens there.

712
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,250
You see, Bruce is saying you've experienced that, right, Bruce?

713
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:42,750
Oh, yeah.

714
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,390
And this is natural and normal.

715
00:58:46,550 --> 00:59:00,810
And all the speech classes in the world, because there are speech classes, by the way, some better vocational schools give them in the lower grades, let's say in high school, and there are speech, you know, how to present things publicly.

716
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,010
None of those help.

717
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:08,510
I mean, they could tell you how to set up the subject matter, how to address a crowd, but nothing can help you with that.

718
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:13,350
You know, I think being a people person really, really helps.

719
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:27,010
You know, interchanging with people all day long gives you kind of a skill to read them really quick and kind of wrap your head around where they're at and then opening.

720
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,470
If you get that opportunity.

721
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,050
And, Sam, I empathize with you 100%.

722
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:49,290
I've been in that spot where I've tried very carefully and articulate, you know, articulate, bring my point across, and I really do empathize with where you struggle from.

723
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,030
And it's a tricky course.

724
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,350
You really have to read on the fly.

725
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,350
But, Bruce, how would you say that's changed at all, or does it change?

726
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,730
I think this is what we're trying to maybe impart to Sam.

727
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,650
I think every person is different.

728
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,830
And for me, it's like dropping a seed.

729
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,270
I throw it out there.

730
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,890
If they come back, great.

731
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,630
If they don't, you know, I try.

732
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,790
In some cases, that's great, too.

733
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:16,490
Yeah.

734
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,050
I'm just joking.

735
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,530
Well, it's acceptable, you know.

736
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:19,750
Yeah.

737
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:20,490
It has to be.

738
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:30,970
But what I wanted to ask you, Bruce, on this is when I was explaining how the vacuum, you know, shows up when you first do public speaking, you said, yeah, you've noticed that.

739
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,510
But do you notice that that's changed at all the more you do it?

740
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:35,190
Yes.

741
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,650
Yes, I believe so.

742
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:37,690
I believe so.

743
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:43,270
A little more outspoken, not timid, certainly not mic-shy.

744
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,830
I've been in front of a mic before many times.

745
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,530
Well, let's say there's no mic and you're in front of people.

746
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:50,850
It's the same thing.

747
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,130
No, that would be a different thing.

748
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,610
Well, no.

749
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,550
No, it wouldn't be.

750
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,370
I've been there.

751
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,830
I've played in front of people.

752
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,770
So I think in that respect, no, I wouldn't feel intimidated.

753
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:03,810
All right.

754
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,150
As long as you don't play with yourself in front of people, you'll be fine.

755
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,250
Exactly.

756
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,010
Exactly.

757
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:08,850
Okay.

758
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,090
Yeah, you know, there's many aspects to it.

759
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,430
I think eventually it's public speaking.

760
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:25,110
And eventually you're going to discover whether you're addressing one person or many when you're comfortable.

761
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:32,690
The same, you're pretty much you've got what they call the gift of gab, or now you can gab, you know.

762
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,130
Yep, you're ready to fly.

763
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:35,350
Yeah.

764
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,470
I've found that most people can't communicate, period.

765
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:41,690
I'll give you an example.

766
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:52,110
Very often I hear people in conversation and they'll give all the adjectives and the point that is salient or that needs to be conveyed is given in the end.

767
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,710
And it kind of labors the listener.

768
01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:04,410
And that comes from, I can not wholly blame, but the concept of when someone says they saw a movie, you know, the spoiler concept, I don't want to know what happens.

769
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:17,610
So that develops a framework where people just keep creating, you know, like, you know, I went to the store today, you know, the store that I usually go to and so and so and so and so and they were out of this.

770
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,030
Well, okay.

771
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:22,650
Well, why don't you say they were out of this at the store first, right?

772
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:26,950
In other words, give the important stuff first, right?

773
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,370
Give the spoiler first when you're communicating.

774
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,630
Give the important stuff first.

775
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,230
Don't follow the social norm, which is, oh, I don't want to know what happens.

776
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:39,870
I want to watch it for myself, you know, a TV show or the movies or a book.

777
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:47,050
Where if you know anyone that works in film, by the way, or in the creative arts and performance, they want to know the end first.

778
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,070
They want to know how it ends.

779
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:50,750
And that's how they judge the whole thing.

780
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,470
They're like, okay, great.

781
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,190
So the rest is film.

782
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,770
They know that.

783
01:02:52,870 --> 01:03:01,030
But the common person somehow has been groomed to not want to know what happens until the show is over.

784
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,210
You ever notice that?

785
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:22,170
Yeah, but if you tell them, like for some people they go, like if you go and you watch Scream and you don't know what Scream is and you're watching it and you're enjoying what you're seeing for the first hour, if you had been told that it ends with the bad guy getting stabbed 50 times and dismembered, you might not have watched it.

786
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,990
But now you're stuck and you want to see how it ends.

787
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:27,210
So exactly, people are stuck.

788
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,470
People, they are stuck, yes.

789
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,790
Now, stuck can mean different things.

790
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,990
If you're working in a mine, you don't want to get stuck.

791
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:38,170
You know, they have gears that if you throw your hard hat in there, it crushes it like a piece of tissue paper.

792
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:40,770
So it depends on the situation.

793
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:47,130
And there is a big machine that's grinding people, and they're not going to get stuck in it.

794
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,810
They're just going to get ground and spit out.

795
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:51,590
Here's another example.

796
01:03:53,550 --> 01:04:00,690
If I know I have to get to the point with someone, when they give me a date, you know, I say, that's a work schedule, you know, you can't keep time with that.

797
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:04,210
You ever notice weekend, weekend, weekend, weekday?

798
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,990
That's the Pope's work schedule.

799
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:10,050
And some people just, huh?

800
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,770
And other people are like, holy crap.

801
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:14,870
Say no more.

802
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,510
I got it.

803
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,990
You notice I said some people?

804
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,050
Mm-hmm.

805
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:24,550
Yeah.

806
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,470
It's always been a one out of a million scenario, by the way.

807
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:36,310
You know, what was it, 7,000 have not bowed their knee to ball is an interesting thing.

808
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,170
That speaks volumes.

809
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:38,670
It's different.

810
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:45,110
It is different, but it's a one out of a million situation.

811
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,950
Yeah, but is it a one out of a million because of them or because of you?

812
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:54,310
Well, that has to be determined, like Bruce and I were talking about earlier.

813
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,130
Mm-hmm.

814
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,730
It's because of them.

815
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,390
They are a certain way.

816
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,130
It's always them.

817
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,370
But here's the thing.

818
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,490
The crux in Greek speak is this.

819
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,710
I don't say it often enough.

820
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,390
If the situation's screwed up, it's not you.

821
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:06,870
It's them.

822
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:07,450
How do I know?

823
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,970
Because they tell everyone it's you that's doing it, not them.

824
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:10,650
No, it's backwards.

825
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,130
All the psychologists, psychiatrists, self-help gurus say it's you.

826
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,750
No, it's them.

827
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:20,570
You are in a fucked up, sorry, medical term there, world.

828
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,190
So when stuff goes bad, it's not you.

829
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:23,930
It's them.

830
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,120
Yes, it is them.

831
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,560
And I got scripture and ancient writs to back me up 100% on that.

832
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:44,460
So you can even have the elite, the modern-day elite, Illuminatis or whatever you want to call them, Freemasons or whatever.

833
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,080
They know it's them, the people.

834
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,460
The whole society's screwed up.

835
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,160
Yeah, but the Freemasons and the Illuminati, they themselves are stupid.

836
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,100
Yeah, I know that.

837
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:58,380
So because they're stupid, they can't offer any kind of – and I'm not saying that you could really do a remedy because God's doing it.

838
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,200
But they can't even offer anything in the semblance of a remedy.

839
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:10,180
Whereas what I'm saying is what adjustments do I have to make to myself so at least I can make a bulletproof presentation?

840
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:11,580
Publicly?

841
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:12,340
Yeah.

842
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,480
Publicly, you should appear impeccably.

843
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:22,980
You should wear good clothing and have impeccable appearance, first of all, because this way it's difficult for people to judge you on fashion.

844
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:31,480
In other words, if you can always appear unfashionable but impeccable, meaning like you're not following any trends, people will listen.

845
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,260
Like giving an example on that, Bruce, you're with me on this, I think.

846
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:43,660
I remember growing up and I was pretty young in the 60s and 70s and I always heard this thing about hippies.

847
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:50,160
And whenever I remember going out in public, if I saw a guy with long hair, I said, oh, that's what they're talking about.

848
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:51,760
Right?

849
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,180
You remember?

850
01:06:52,680 --> 01:07:02,900
The hippies in the 60s and 70s, they were talking, it doesn't matter what you said or what you did, if you were classified as a hippie, forget it.

851
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:03,900
That's it.

852
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:04,500
Remember that?

853
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:04,940
Yeah.

854
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,900
So I didn't know really exactly what that meant until I saw it happening.

855
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,660
And I was like, oh, that's no big deal.

856
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,240
That's just the way they wear their hair and their dress and the way they speak.

857
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,100
What does that have to do with…

858
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,020
But they were ostracized before you got, you see.

859
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,340
There were pot smokers, all sorts of things wrapped up into that.

860
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,520
Anti-war people, everything was wrapped up into the word hippie.

861
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:32,860
Yeah.

862
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,260
It was undesirable.

863
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:39,120
Like if you brought home a hippie, it didn't matter what they…

864
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,700
It was a fashion trend, though, because obviously there's no such thing.

865
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,660
It's a fashion, right?

866
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Right.

867
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,340
So you want to be unfashionable but acceptable.

868
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,680
The other thing is timing.

869
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,380
If someone's late for work, they're not going to listen.

870
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,300
If they're ready to go to work, they're not going to listen.

871
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,700
But unless you live at a job or work, you live at a job.

872
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,140
You guys are right.

873
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,340
Most of you are waking hours.

874
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:16,200
If you're at what they call a job or a yob where the boss lets everyone punch in and go to the movies, then you can talk, you know, especially if the boss allows you to – if the boss wants to hear, the rest will follow.

875
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,010
I don't know.

876
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:22,290
Again, you notice we're getting very personal.

877
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:30,529
When I go in public, I always wear a dressy button-down shirt, an Oxford type.

878
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:35,290
It's usually no less than a $50 or $80 shirt.

879
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,350
It's not a cheap shirt and khakis.

880
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:42,029
And good-looking shoes usually when I'm out in public if I can.

881
01:08:43,729 --> 01:08:45,830
So right away, I stand out in a crowd.

882
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,590
It's like, where does this guy wear an expensive dress shirt?

883
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,689
Usually, there's a professional type that looks like that.

884
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,770
So I don't know.

885
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,430
I mean that's a good place to start.

886
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:06,069
I know if I didn't – if I was trendy, I was walking by a mall the other day and I saw $100 jeans in the window with holes in them, rips in them.

887
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:12,810
I wouldn't – if you paid me $100, I wouldn't wear those in public, let's say, not buy them.

888
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:18,470
I mean so we're dealing with a very superficial aspect, but your appearance is very important, first of all.

889
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:22,649
The second thing is the setting is very important.

890
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:29,090
And the third thing is can you give an important point immediately?

891
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:46,010
The other thing is how would you put yourself in a situation that you know you would be definitely rejected and see how long you can maintain yourself there?

892
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:54,050
Again, didn't they have game shows like that in the 70s, Bruce, where they put – see how long someone could be before they get dunked or something like that?

893
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:54,670
What was it?

894
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,050
Yeah, you had a few of them out there.

895
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:01,170
Yeah, an endurance kind of thing, but it was a prank kind of endurance.

896
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,090
It was mostly a prank, yeah.

897
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:11,730
Yeah, go into a situation where you know you're going to be kicked out and see how – you know you're going to be kicked out in the end, but see how long you can keep it going.

898
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:17,630
In other words, you know the audience is going to be unfriendly to you.

899
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:23,890
So in other words, if you can get an unfriendly audience to listen, want to listen to you, can you imagine what a friendly audience would do?

900
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:48,870
Yeah, I mean these sort of things, they do address the issue in a sort of roundabout way, which is not ineffective, but I guess the only way to actually get down to what would work is to find yourself in the practical situation and make adjustments on the fly.

901
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:53,010
You know, it's an interesting thing if you really take that seriously.

902
01:10:54,390 --> 01:11:01,370
I was thinking of experimenting with this before, going to what they call a Craigslist or putting out flyers to do a public speaking engagement.

903
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:04,150
I know places that would allow me to do a public speaking engagement.

904
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:12,530
You'll see very often there are some restaurants that have speaking engagement whatever, and they don't charge you to do it because they want the customers.

905
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:13,830
They have an area in the back.

906
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,630
What's your slowest night?

907
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:20,530
You know, our slowest night is Wednesday night because of those damn Christian Bible studies.

908
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,310
All right, okay.

909
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,450
Well, Wednesday night, I'll need an area for 20 people to sit down and do a speech here.

910
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,030
Okay, great.

911
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,110
That's, you know, they've got to order something.

912
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,250
You know, it's 20 potential plates.

913
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:38,330
And set something like that up and go speak about something and see if you can do that and do it little by little.

914
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,230
And you're going to notice that you're going to get a spirit of speaking.

915
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,950
There is a spirit behind speaking, by the way, publicly.

916
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,450
There's a spirit behind everything.

917
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:53,550
And those people that we're told are so savage Native Americans and all that are not.

918
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,750
You know, they have totems to everything you can imagine.

919
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:58,950
I agree.

920
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:03,550
Seth is mentioning that he was trying to call.

921
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,530
Yeah, he was.

922
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,270
And because if I let him in, it would have put this one on hold.

923
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,410
Ah, okay.

924
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,690
He was just calling in.

925
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:12,990
Yeah.

926
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,170
Let's see if we can get him online then.

927
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:18,690
I could add him to a group call.

928
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:19,850
Yeah, add him in.

929
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:21,610
Yeah.

930
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:27,630
Let's see if he has anything to add or take away.

931
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,070
Let's see if this works now.

932
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,070
Public speaking is essentially public speaking.

933
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,050
It doesn't matter how many people you're addressing.

934
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,770
Or even private speaking is the same.

935
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,650
And there is a spirit behind that, ultimately.

936
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:56,310
I think you and I, Sam, have discussed that when something happens or doesn't happen, the primal elements or the gods either allow it or disallow it, right?

937
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:57,990
Mm-hmm.

938
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:11,690
This is one of the hardest things for fleshy humans to comprehend and live with constantly, is that there is a spiritual element behind anything and everything we can experience.

939
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:27,750
I especially prove that when I speak to the, quote, unquote, religious leader types, whether it's a rabbi, an imam, or a priest, or a minister, whenever you bring up something like an emergency or financial, they'll say, oh, that has nothing to do with God.

940
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:29,810
They actually say that.

941
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,530
They profess that with their own mouth, right?

942
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:36,230
So this is the type of spiritual leadership that's out in the world, which is, you know, the opposite.

943
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,870
Let's see, do we have Seth?

944
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:40,310
Yes.

945
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,050
Am I audible?

946
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,050
Yeah, low but audible.

947
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,330
Yes, you're there.

948
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,790
I can fix the lowness.

949
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,950
Yes, do that.

950
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:50,830
And on the mic, too.

951
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,430
Yeah, go ahead.

952
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,410
All right.

953
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,390
Is that better?

954
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,130
Yes.

955
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,190
Yes, thank you.

956
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:56,990
Thank you.

957
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,330
The mic is echoing.

958
01:13:58,530 --> 01:13:59,310
Somebody's echoing.

959
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,630
I'll fix that.

960
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,010
It's speakers, maybe.

961
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,130
So we're discussing public speaking, Seth.

962
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:12,430
Anything you want to throw in there with Sam about speaking publicly?

963
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:16,030
I think you brought up discussions that you've had with people.

964
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:22,770
I know you told us about the academic at the bar scene several times, and perhaps things that happened personal or whatever.

965
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:25,910
But anything you want to say about what Sam has been asking, if you've been listening?

966
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:27,970
Yeah, absolutely, actually.

967
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:31,570
I missed the last, like, maybe three minutes of the conversation.

968
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:32,610
Oh, that's fine.

969
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:48,410
But I was going to – public speaking, Sam was asking more about speaking one-on-one to a person, and in one sense I suppose that is public speaking, if it's, you know, with a relative stranger.

970
01:14:49,830 --> 01:15:07,610
But I would say that in talking about the objectivity and the subjectivity is kind of you have to realize who your audience is, whether that's one person or, you know, a multitude of people.

971
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:14,410
And beyond that, let them change the subject and pull apart whatever subject they turn to.

972
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:23,710
Etymology makes that a very easy thing to do because any subject that's spoken about they speak about with words.

973
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:34,390
And so, you know, a common one is, well, that's nice, but what about people move on using the word nice.

974
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:45,010
And as I'm sure everyone's well aware, nice has a very interesting etymology, especially being that it's used colloquially to describe something that is pleasant.

975
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,970
You know, that's not the intent of that word.

976
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,190
That's not what that word means.

977
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,430
It means silly or stupid.

978
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,290
Right.

979
01:15:53,430 --> 01:16:03,290
I think about three-quarters of the words that people use commonly looked up etymologically will probably differ in meaning to how they think they're being used.

980
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,950
I'd say three-quarters because I've been looking at that.

981
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:19,230
I've put etymology down, but 50% to 75% is conservative, that about 50% to 75% of the words that people use are not aware of what their etymological meaning is.

982
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:23,630
So that would be an easy place to grab their attention if they so cared.

983
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,590
That's the point, if they're not empathetic, right?

984
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:41,450
And if you can take the perspective that, you know, all things are connected one way or another, then juxtaposition from one subject to another doesn't really occur.

985
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,990
If we're discussing the all, then we're discussing the all.

986
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:54,010
And then it just becomes, well, how can you describe your observations in a manner in which the person that is listening hears?

987
01:16:55,170 --> 01:17:00,110
And even if they don't understand, they have the possibility for comprehension.

988
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:10,010
Well, speaking of possibilities, I want to throw this in real quick, and then we'll just jump back on the various things on the possibilities.

989
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:16,310
Do you know that there's a spiritual counterpart to these actions?

990
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:34,470
And do you know that there is more than an eventuality, or more than, I'm sorry, more than a presumption that when someone is listening to you, or let's say finding out what you have to say interesting enough for them, that they were brought to you, you didn't bring them to yourself, in other words?

991
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:38,910
In other words, it's happening somewhere else as well, right?

992
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,730
In other words, it was meant for them to hear that, right?

993
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:52,750
So one way is to ask for those that are ready to hear it, and it's meant for them to hear it, then just, you know, how do we randomly stamp these things out?

994
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:54,050
Right.

995
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:08,570
Now we're getting more into the woo-woo spiritual side of things, which is, you know, believe it or not, it's the core.

996
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,310
Yes, but this is known.

997
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:26,450
Like, we're not, we can't just continue, I mean, there's a certain sphere of one's consciousness that should be aware of that, but you can't just continuously defer to the sense of the fate of what we have been dealt.

998
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,810
Like, what are you going to do?

999
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:34,230
You have a level of skill, that level of skill can be improved, and it can give tangible results.

1000
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:36,470
Like, that's what I want to see.

1001
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,150
What is the result that you are asking for?

1002
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:41,570
I'm not here to overcome the spirit of the world or convert people.

1003
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:42,010
No.

1004
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,310
I'm just here to see my results.

1005
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,890
What I'm saying is there are billions and trillions of spirits at work here.

1006
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:55,250
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that I cannot achieve a result that is satisfying for myself, because I was never trying to convert the person anyway.

1007
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:58,630
I already gave the example of the girl that I felt, that was a 7 out of 10.

1008
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:00,270
She's gone, I won't see her again.

1009
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:00,870
Don't care.

1010
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,670
But I got what I wanted out of that.

1011
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,690
I'm not going to get what I want from other people.

1012
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:06,850
Well, okay.

1013
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:10,930
Then how would you read that from a primal perspective, from primacy?

1014
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,470
That was one that was just sent by.

1015
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:13,970
That's fine.

1016
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:16,070
That's like when you're on a raft going down a river.

1017
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:21,950
You see one rock, here's another rock, or this is the rock that sinks your raft, or this is the rock that you tie to.

1018
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:22,610
I mean, I don't know.

1019
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:27,630
You want to view it from a philosophical point of view, it could be viewed that way also.

1020
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,230
You're going to pass through many people.

1021
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:39,490
Just be happy that when you do pass through many people, no one wants to kill you, because they have that potential of violence also, verbal and physical.

1022
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,750
We're talking about earth now, right?

1023
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:49,530
So now it's a numbers game, isn't it, if you want to look at it that way.

1024
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:55,110
In other words, in the beginning maybe I was saying you have to change what you're saying.

1025
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:56,610
No, you don't have to change what you're saying.

1026
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,610
You say the same thing.

1027
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,590
And is it tonality?

1028
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,310
Possibly.

1029
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,450
Is it timing?

1030
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,130
Possibly.

1031
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,350
But ultimately there's a primacy to it.

1032
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,160
And the primacy is it's those that are meant to hear it are going to hear it.

1033
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,460
And you could ask for that.

1034
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:21,080
And you could tap into that aspect of reality, where there's a primal reality that controls this reality, to maybe give you the fine points.

1035
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:24,980
And is it time to bring those that are maybe.

1036
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,320
Maybe now?

1037
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,800
I'm hearing a lot of maybes.

1038
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,160
Yeah, well, maybe this is what I mean by maybe.

1039
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:41,960
You don't know for sure if within the area that you physically can reach, and even acoustically through the Internet or the rectangle, how many people are ready to listen to what you have to say.

1040
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:42,380
A hundred?

1041
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:42,940
A thousand?

1042
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,400
A million?

1043
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:43,780
Ten?

1044
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:44,420
Fifteen?

1045
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,960
Ask to have those brought to you when you're ready to do it.

1046
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:57,600
That harkens back to the is it what you say or is it how you say it, which is a bad question because it's both.

1047
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,100
It's when you say it and who's backing you up to say it.

1048
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:01,680
Greek has an echo.

1049
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,340
It's Seth.

1050
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,620
There's going to be some kind of hum with him.

1051
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,220
If you mute out when you're not speaking, we're okay.

1052
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,220
When you speak, it comes on, it's fine.

1053
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,540
Hey, I'm cool with the subject.

1054
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:27,320
I feel like I'll have to review what's been said and think about things a bit more.

1055
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,280
Well, hold on before you're cool with the subject.

1056
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:41,900
You can do an overt, outward, dynamic demonstration of the subject matter by simply seeing how many people you can organize by communication.

1057
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:45,960
I'm going to be speaking on A, B, C, and D on this certain day.

1058
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,920
See how many people show up.

1059
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:57,150
Then that's going to temper your metal and see if no one shows up, how you feel about it, or if 100 people show up, how you feel about it.

1060
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,230
The less you're attached about what they do, the better you'll be at what you do.

1061
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,860
There's a marketing aspect to this too.

1062
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:22,800
You know that typically businesses, meaning individuals that start businesses, let's say, that are very specific on one thing tend to be more lucrative than those that are general.

1063
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:29,080
For example, a plumbing contractor will probably be more lucrative business than a general handyman.

1064
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:33,380
The more specific you get, the more lucrative.

1065
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:47,340
If you, let's say, opened a plumbing store that just sold washers or faucet handles, chances are you might even be more lucrative than the regular plumber who is more lucrative than the general practitioner, handyman, you see.

1066
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:54,010
Sam, can I ask you a question?

1067
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:03,310
What is the result that you were after in the public conversation?

1068
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:13,390
You said that you got the result that you were after once, and then another time you gave an example where you didn't, and I heard those.

1069
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:19,150
But what would you say the result that you were seeking?

1070
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:24,370
What is it you were trying to take away or give in these conversations?

1071
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:45,060
It's an endeavor on my part to create sort of a unilateral presentation that is unrebuttable in its content because it addresses things that are objective in a way that also explains those things using metrics that people can understand.

1072
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:55,900
So I'm not so much interested in having a back and forth so much as I am in showing something that stands on the merit of what it is in and of itself.

1073
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:06,460
And that doesn't really require that, you know, the person that I'm talking to likes it per se or even that they remember it, but just that they acknowledge it in the moment.

1074
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:17,200
And some people obviously don't do even that because of censorship, but it could also be because your presentation is not suitable.

1075
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,180
It's not adequate.

1076
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:25,300
They find it grating, or you're just not being efficient with your words or your body language or some other intangible.

1077
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:36,020
So I'm out to improve my own ability to make that presentation, and I measure that by how accepting they are of what's being said.

1078
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,380
I've got to interject comically here.

1079
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,420
This is a planet of censored assholes, basically.

1080
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:53,760
So if you're looking for that, it ain't going to work out too well for you.

1081
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,180
I don't know.

1082
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,700
I mean, says the guy who goes on radio and when he talks, people just shut up and listen?

1083
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,220
Yeah, well, here's the other aspect to it.

1084
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:09,620
Like Seth, when I used to go on, when he was doing thing on Revolution Radio, I used to basically say, look, I'm not here to have a conversation.

1085
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,840
I'm here to throw rocks, and occasionally someone would say, Greek, you've been talking for 20 minutes.

1086
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,380
The rest of us have to want to say something to us.

1087
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,000
I said, I don't care.

1088
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,840
What the hell could you possibly say?

1089
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:25,400
Now, that's what I just said sounds really crass and awful to most, but that's the truth.

1090
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,500
Is that what you want to tell people?

1091
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:28,620
No.

1092
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,220
That's the truth.

1093
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:31,580
Sorry.

1094
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:32,660
I'm not using those words.

1095
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,100
Yeah, right.

1096
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,880
So what brought that up is it's unrebuttable, but to who?

1097
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,800
You know, you can tell a rock that the elephant is really a banana.

1098
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,640
He's not going to rebut that because it's a rock.

1099
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,080
It doesn't care about that.

1100
01:25:50,520 --> 01:26:02,520
So, yeah, what do you tell anyone that is a part of a society that has no idea what's going to be happening to them in the next decade and a half and what they're going to fall for and what they're set up for?

1101
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,940
What do you tell someone like that?

1102
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:12,400
What do you tell people on the Titanic, or which was the Olympic, let's say, that this ship is going to hit the bottom tomorrow night?

1103
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,220
What do you tell them?

1104
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,620
And you're on there with them, too.

1105
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,400
Yeah, where do you begin?

1106
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:17,780
Yeah.

1107
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,140
Well, you tell them that the boat's going to sink.

1108
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,500
Well, they'll lock you up in a cage if you say that too much.

1109
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,200
Yeah, it depends on your presentation.

1110
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,440
Well, that's what Sam is trying to say.

1111
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:30,580
Thank you.

1112
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,580
That's what I was trying to get.

1113
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,180
That's what Sam is asking for.

1114
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,500
How do you present that, right?

1115
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:40,560
Well, and just to be clear, I'm asking, or I was asking, not so much anymore.

1116
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,980
I kind of feel like we're going in circles.

1117
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:56,380
The specifics of the nuances of a presentation that is at its most effective or the closest thing to a template that you could establish for that, because obviously I already know how to make some kind of a presentation and make headway, but it's about making it hyper-efficient.

1118
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,720
And, you know, ironically, perhaps it's not even something that you could give an answer for because if you could, then it wouldn't be hyper-specific.

1119
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,100
It would be general.

1120
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:09,280
So maybe this isn't kind of a pointless thing to talk about.

1121
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:15,880
Well, the thing is, no, it's not, because here, I had some communication with someone recently who does a lot of interviews and stuff like that.

1122
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,320
They have YouTubes and all that crap.

1123
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:31,620
And I said, how about having, how about, you know, all your guests, they talk about all these different subjects and whistleblowers and all that stuff, but I've listened to some of your stuff and I've never gone away with anything I could use right away.

1124
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:41,140
How about discussing about something or anything that to whoever is hearing, they could use, they could walk away and they could use it.

1125
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:46,420
They could use that information to improve their lives, their pathetic, miserable lives.

1126
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,440
Let me just add that as a footnote, what's left of it.

1127
01:27:49,440 --> 01:28:07,740
So you see, dare anyone go on the rectangle anywhere, even the medical people, and watch as many presentations or read as many presentations as you can and tell me what you walk away with that you could use right now or you can apply either immediately if needed.

1128
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,200
Nothing.

1129
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,140
There's almost nothing like that.

1130
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,520
Don't get sick in the United States?

1131
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:16,570
Yeah, either way.

1132
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:17,390
It doesn't matter.

1133
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,210
Any subject.

1134
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:29,190
What can you get a presentation on, whatever subject it is, and walk away feeling that you can apply something there immediately?

1135
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:37,730
And I'm not talking about a how-to video like replacing a water pump on an LG Trom washing machine or something like that.

1136
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:41,950
I'm just talking about what is generally referred to as conversational stuff.

1137
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:45,470
And that's the easiest way to get through to people.

1138
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:54,690
Food, clothing, shelter, personal gain and fear.

1139
01:28:55,230 --> 01:29:03,910
Personal gain is how are they going to go to bed or wake up tomorrow knowing that they gained a little bit more financial whatever.

1140
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:07,870
I guess a skinny person, weight, if they want to do that.

1141
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,530
Or shed some fear.

1142
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:11,870
How do they shed some fear is another way.

1143
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:19,470
Food, clothing, shelter, what they call money, what they call their fears or phobias.

1144
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:28,230
The ultimate thing, believe it or not, it might sound kind of petty, it's not as health.

1145
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:35,030
Most people are, because there's so much fear attached to health, that's why it's gotten so.

1146
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:41,050
Anyway, it's a long, I've never really given the background on what I've discovered on this.

1147
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:47,330
There's so few people left on the planet today that understand how to keep a body healthy or how to make a body healthy.

1148
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:56,090
And that's because they've always had so much fear of that subject and understanding the conditions of society that's ruled by malevolent entities.

1149
01:29:56,950 --> 01:30:04,070
The fear gets to a point where now anything will do and that anything now became the opposite of what they should be doing.

1150
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,330
But not to kill them directly, but to keep them vulnerable.

1151
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,600
Proof of that is, like today I was out at the shops and there was people discussing buying tropical fruit.

1152
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:25,700
And it's still cold, it's still the end of winter, but a couple of people, I said, I gave them the lowdown, this is going to change your body chemistry to the tropics.

1153
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,820
And two people were like, wow.

1154
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,280
And one person was like, oh, I'm allergic to that anyway.

1155
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,780
And I said, by the way, there were no allergies 50 years ago.

1156
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,160
And just walked away.

1157
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:44,330
So, do you want to interject?

1158
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:50,350
I was going to say you can just share information is one way of doing it.

1159
01:30:50,450 --> 01:31:05,750
Another way, Greek, that I've observed you communicating with others is simply asking questions and uncommon questions, questions that are not generally asked like, well, who tells you what day it is?

1160
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,850
Where do you get your, what is food?

1161
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,510
These simple questions like that are not presented.

1162
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:18,430
Very simple questions with relatively simple answers, realistically.

1163
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:35,330
But at the same time, those questions are so very uncommon that when you present someone with something that is unexpected, it almost produces like a hiccup in their train of thought.

1164
01:31:35,810 --> 01:31:50,910
So where even if someone was simply waiting for their turn to speak or their chance to share their ideas or their experience, you can derail that almost completely just with simple, simple questions.

1165
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:57,010
Yeah, like children ask where babies come from, but adults never ask where credit comes from.

1166
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:01,710
I mean, yeah, that's one way.

1167
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:06,330
But you also, I think opposite of Sam, I'm not attached to it.

1168
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,750
When I run into someone, I know they're an asshole.

1169
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,350
I never said any words.

1170
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:13,470
I presume it 99%.

1171
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:20,170
The only time I'll get involved with them personally is if they absolutely, positively reached out or needed some help, that was obvious.

1172
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:22,730
Otherwise, they could go about whatever.

1173
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:32,950
I've completely separated myself from what other people are interested in or what their needs and wants are, and that allows me to be objective.

1174
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:41,870
So, for example, when they go into a political fervor over something, I look at it and I'm like, okay, the subject matter is all wrong.

1175
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:42,890
This is really stupid.

1176
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:46,670
And for them to take it so seriously, that makes them even worse.

1177
01:32:50,690 --> 01:33:00,530
So you're in a really – well, you, whoever is listening, if you really become objective, you will find humanity be repugnant, which is another word for disgusting.

1178
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:06,150
That's why I always tell little children, if you're not disgusted with people, you're not paying attention.

1179
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:12,410
And adults standing there, they didn't say, how dare you say that to the children.

1180
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,030
They were in agreement.

1181
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:15,410
They didn't.

1182
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,230
They didn't say, how dare you tell that to them.

1183
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:18,750
They didn't.

1184
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:20,870
They were like, yeah, okay, that's pretty much right.

1185
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,210
Isn't that funny?

1186
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,730
You would expect them to freak out over it, right?

1187
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:36,770
I have two small children that I talk to – I have two sons that I talk to with regularity.

1188
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:44,630
And they are of an age where they both ask questions and like to share what they have learned.

1189
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:54,150
And I find myself very, very often explaining that the people that are telling them these things have no idea what they're talking about.

1190
01:33:54,150 --> 01:34:02,010
I'm like, yes, in this – in what is being shared, what you're talking about is true – not true.

1191
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:03,690
It's not a word I would use actually.

1192
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:08,630
It is accurate, but there's no precision here.

1193
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:22,810
What is being discussed is their guessing, and they're basing their guesses upon guesses that have been – scientific theory is that.

1194
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:27,690
It's all theory because no one is – it's baseless.

1195
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:28,790
It's based upon emptiness.

1196
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:30,090
Well, all of it is fiction.

1197
01:34:31,370 --> 01:35:06,650
And so explaining to two small children the fiction and seeing it blossom, I suppose, the realization that what is being – these people that we present as authorities of information, be them a school teacher or a scientist or a faceless nobody behind a YouTube video, that none of them have any concept of what is real because this concept of what is real has not been presented to them.

1198
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:25,990
Well, if they get a handle on religion, which means what you do regularly, that's why religion is very important because you get your – what you – the reason why you do what you do from your god, and that's been totally watered down and eliminated now from society completely.

1199
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:42,510
When they understand that as children, they don't have to go around telling everyone they're using the word wrong, but you essentially get that from the parents first, and then the parents had gotten it from a god.

1200
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:49,350
So whether you know there's a god or not, you're still, as a child, functioning in the religious manner because the parents are doing it.

1201
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:56,310
That is a key aspect to – I don't know.

1202
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:59,050
You want to talk about creation, right?

1203
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:04,290
Because none of the stuff that the scientists, like you're mentioning with the theories, add up.

1204
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,250
Mathematically, it doesn't work.

1205
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:17,210
So ultimately, it was made by another group that we know only what they want us to know about them and settle into that and go on from there.

1206
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:28,390
That's why I always discuss – not always, but I bring up the hypocrisy of what is going on and the stupidity.

1207
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:36,050
But you see, also, another thing that's kind of harsh is that this is not only a grooming, a programming.

1208
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:40,430
It's bred into people, just like a water dog and a bird dog.

1209
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:43,950
You get a water dog in the backyard with a bird dog.

1210
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:46,090
One has been bred to be in the water.

1211
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:48,930
If there's a swimming pool, he's jumping in, and you ask him, why did you jump in the water?

1212
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:49,390
I don't know.

1213
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:50,550
I wanted to.

1214
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,070
And the other bird dog is chasing birds.

1215
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:53,630
Why are you chasing?

1216
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:55,250
Why do you want to jump up the tree?

1217
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:55,610
I don't know.

1218
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:57,010
It's just what I feel like I have to do.

1219
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,690
It's kind of a little late to breed that out of them.

1220
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:09,570
So humans right now have been bred into this nastiness, and you want to find the ones where it's not bred into them.

1221
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:10,090
You know what I mean?

1222
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:39,930
But on the same token, or the other side of the same coin, is that, as you've illustrated in the past better than I'm going to right now, is that if a dog is raised by apes, it's still going to behave as a dog, whereas if a human is raised by apes, it's going to act like an ape.

1223
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:52,090
Whereas humanity, or mankind, is much more susceptible to its environment and its information and how it uses that information.

1224
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:59,530
And what I mean by the breeding, it's actually the downbreeding of humanity also.

1225
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:03,270
They've lost robustness, and they're actually physically weak.

1226
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,050
Physically weak.

1227
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,580
Well, they call them descendants instead of ascendants, right?

1228
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,340
Yeah, perhaps.

1229
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,600
I'll give you an example.

1230
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:22,440
After the 1950s, they introduced bovine milk to Korea, south and north.

1231
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,420
It wasn't customary for them to incorporate that in their diet to children.

1232
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:34,660
And within one generation, the adults were 20 to 30 percent larger because of the bovine milk.

1233
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,080
And the girls started menstruating earlier.

1234
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:40,720
Yeah, perhaps.

1235
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,780
Yeah, I remember that study.

1236
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:48,580
Yeah, there's a Japanese anthropologist who did this in the 50s and 60s.

1237
01:38:49,040 --> 01:39:00,760
So the average person living on the Korean peninsula was 5'4", and within one generation, the average height was 5'7", 5'8", for male, and for men.

1238
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:04,400
And they attribute it directly to the bovine.

1239
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:31,620
So what I mean by the breeding is that right now the chemical constituents and the toxins and the poor water quality and all that have changed the human body, just like if you had a radio that had good reception, if you opened it and started tweaking some of the values on the resistors and capacitors and inductors, it won't have that good reception anymore.

1240
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:38,230
I think that's a perfect analogy right there.

1241
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:44,340
We have breeded ourselves so poorly.

1242
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,100
Here's an example.

1243
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:52,420
This is a striking example, and it may or may not be pertinent, but Wal-Mart phenomenon.

1244
01:39:53,640 --> 01:40:00,760
When I had first gone into a Wal-Mart, I was astounded at the level of – I'd call them Wal-Martians, right?

1245
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,040
Where did these people come from?

1246
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:12,640
Most of them looked deformed and just like strange creatures, anthropomorphic obviously, but they don't look like fit humans to me.

1247
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:20,040
After a while I was thinking, where were all these people, because there's not just one or two, we're talking thousands.

1248
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,460
Where were all these people before Wal-Mart landed on planet Earth?

1249
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,540
Where were they hiding?

1250
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:32,780
I mean, I was out in public, I was at various places like Sears and J.C. Penney's or the movies.

1251
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:36,280
I didn't see so many malformed creatures like that.

1252
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,720
Where did they come from?

1253
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:46,500
Were they always there, or did they come through some kind of vortex, wormhole, when Wal-Mart opened up?

1254
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,820
I know, it sounds kind of crazy.

1255
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:54,540
I think about that sometimes when I'm wondering, am I living in some kind of a stepped reality here?

1256
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:00,840
So I tie all that back to speaking to people.

1257
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,640
It's still shocking.

1258
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:10,760
I haven't been everywhere in the United States, but wherever I go, I know I'm going to see a freak show if I go to a Wal-Mart, whether it's the employees or the customers.

1259
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,000
And such a freak show did not exist prior to that.

1260
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:22,380
Now, I don't like using corporate brand names like McDonald's and Wal-Mart and all that other stuff, but sometimes it has to be brought out because it's very specific.

1261
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:34,640
Well, I think one of the things that I noticed was the girth, just the sheer girth of people in general.

1262
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,200
It struck me.

1263
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:41,360
Well, just like you're saying, the girth there, Bruce, I just want to bring this up real quick.

1264
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:52,440
The first thing that came up in a millisecond was, you know that when you have a society that's quote-unquote have an obesity problem, that's because they're malnourished.

1265
01:41:53,980 --> 01:42:05,480
In other words, they're eating enough in quantity, but the body is not recognizing it as food and it's producing this store because it's in a crisis mode.

1266
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,340
I could go along with that.

1267
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:21,760
If you go to places like France, for example, where they eat tremendous amounts of protein, animal protein and fat, right, and wine and cigarettes and all that.

1268
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,840
And by the way, you can light up a cigarette in a Paris restaurant, no problem, right?

1269
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:26,580
Right.

1270
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,100
Or a bar.

1271
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,100
Okay.

1272
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,140
And when I tell you the French, do you think of people with girth like you mentioned here earlier?

1273
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,280
No, God no.

1274
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,020
God no.

1275
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:38,520
But they eat more quote-unquote fatty foods than here.

1276
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,260
Yeah.

1277
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,460
But see, the difference is there's no…

1278
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:53,300
I think I mentioned to you, I've been in the Midwest and several, all the way from people living in a trailer to people living in a six-bathroom, five-bedroom house, McMansion.

1279
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,620
And if I sat and ate with them for a couple of days, I felt sick.

1280
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,400
And this is how they ate normally.

1281
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:00,420
Imagine that.

1282
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:09,220
So these people, you know, I used to say publicly, Americans, most American children have never had real bread or real cheese or real milk in their entire…

1283
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:14,560
Or people, most Americans never had real bread or real milk or real cheese in their entire life.

1284
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:20,360
They're going to go from cradle to grave not knowing what real bread tastes like or real milk or real, you see, cheese.

1285
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:20,800
Yeah.

1286
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:26,020
So that's what I mean about the breeding aspect.

1287
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,980
The grooming aspect is what Seth brought up, external input.

1288
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,700
What kind of external input are they getting?

1289
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,540
And unfortunately, where Sam is…

1290
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,360
Yeah, well, is it a horror to who?

1291
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,160
They seem to be enjoying it.

1292
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,420
The Observer.

1293
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,460
Could you imagine a horror film being billed as a comedy?

1294
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,040
I don't know.

1295
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,980
Is that what's going on?

1296
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,640
So where Sam is…

1297
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:56,180
Sam, how Western would you say where you are and, you know, I'm not…

1298
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,040
You're not in America, let's say.

1299
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,780
So let's say how Western would you say it is and Americanized?

1300
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:06,020
Pretty Americanized or still retain non-American culture?

1301
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:08,800
Pretty Americanized.

1302
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,280
Yeah, see, that's…

1303
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:10,900
Is that okay?

1304
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,060
All right, pretty Americanized.

1305
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:15,260
I'd say ugly Americanized, but let me just put it this way.

1306
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,240
Is that a positive or a negative?

1307
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,320
I mean…

1308
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,060
It's hard to say.

1309
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:32,020
But personally, it's something that one is accustomed to seeing to the point of being apathetic towards it.

1310
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:38,060
Now, how far West can you go before you start going East again?

1311
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,400
America, right?

1312
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:41,200
Yeah, no kidding, yeah.

1313
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,580
You know, I had an interesting treat a while back.

1314
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,660
Once in a while, we'll go and listen to radio stations from another country.

1315
01:44:50,460 --> 01:45:01,520
And I'm always amazed at how Americanized the music is in different areas and then some that just retain their own stuff and that's it.

1316
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,620
It's few.

1317
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:15,180
Okay, so mankind is sent out from the West going to the East, then he comes back to the West and keeps going West.

1318
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:17,540
Just looking at the directions here.

1319
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:26,360
Anyway, I think public speaking is when you meet someone.

1320
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:41,180
Just to go back to what Sam brought up, if you just meet someone and you're in the early parts of acquaintanceship, let's say, it is no different than being a general public interchanger.

1321
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:46,540
Obviously, the dynamic changes when you have multiple people listening.

1322
01:45:46,540 --> 01:46:07,500
But I would suggest that the question at heart is public speaking, whether it's to one or 500 or 1,000, if you're vaguely, especially if they're not acquainted at all with the subject matter, then you could be in a prison cell with someone, it's still public speaking if they're not acquainted at all, and if they don't know you either.

1323
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,400
So I think it's the same rules.

1324
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,280
Each time you test yourself.

1325
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:15,680
Right.

1326
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:21,860
I think going in front of more than one person at a time is best, and then asking for feedback.

1327
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,620
I'll give you an example.

1328
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:26,860
Have you guys ever heard of boiler room high-pressure telephone sales telemarketing?

1329
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:27,700
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:28,800
Okay.

1331
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,420
Well, I've experienced that.

1332
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:41,340
To make the story kind of short, there's a construction material catalog, and the first day there, they said, okay, here's a list of Dun & Bradstreet cards.

1333
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:44,440
These are companies listed on Dun & Bradstreet, and their phone numbers are on there.

1334
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,100
And you go ahead, and it's your first day here, and just start calling them.

1335
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,840
You can only sell them extension cords.

1336
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,040
I'm like, wait a second, there's like 300 items here.

1337
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:54,380
Yeah, but you can only sell extension cords.

1338
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,620
Only extension cords, right?

1339
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,000
I'm like, okay, I'll play along with this, right?

1340
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,760
Not everything in the catalog, right?

1341
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,240
Because you think in everything in the catalog you're going to make a sale, right?

1342
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:04,820
Right.

1343
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:09,560
And the next guy that was there the first day says, you can only sell yellow marker tape.

1344
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:11,960
That's it.

1345
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,060
It's only one item.

1346
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:16,240
You know, when you go to a construction catalog, it has all those things in there.

1347
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:18,080
So one thing for the whole week.

1348
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:18,860
So anyway, I'm sitting there.

1349
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,500
I'm like, okay, fine.

1350
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:33,960
Well, at the end of the second day, not the first day, they bring me in after everybody leaves, and there's another guy waiting outside, and they hit a button, and they have – they prerecorded me speaking to people, and they were – two of the guys were – they said, why did you say that?

1351
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,080
Your pauses are too long.

1352
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:38,420
They had recorded what I was saying and then criticizing it to me.

1353
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:40,900
Yeah.

1354
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,540
I didn't know any of this was going to happen.

1355
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:46,920
And they said, we don't do this with everyone, but you have – you got what it takes, right?

1356
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,640
And I'm like, no, no, no.

1357
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,980
Actually, as a matter of fact, I got what it takes, but not with you guys.

1358
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:51,860
You guys are insane.

1359
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:57,760
But I sold $700 – what they call dollars' worth of extension cords in two days.

1360
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,400
Oh, nice.

1361
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:00,520
Yeah.

1362
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,160
Well, yeah.

1363
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:01,900
Yeah, it was nice.

1364
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:06,060
I didn't mean it that way, but – But they wanted me to stay, and I was like, no, no.

1365
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:06,940
You guys are crazy.

1366
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:07,680
But you know what?

1367
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:18,300
After I left there, after I got my sense of normalcy back – because it was traumatizing to go sit down, and they start playing a recording of what you've been saying all day, and you're like, holy shit, I didn't know it was being recorded.

1368
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,840
This is like listening to your own voice.

1369
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:23,860
That's when I realized I don't want to listen to pre-recorded stuff I say.

1370
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:29,860
But, okay, so what they were doing is they were criticizing what you were – you see what I mean?

1371
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:36,080
The trauma – but once this trauma wore off, after a few months, in retrospect, I thought about it, and I was like, what a crazy situation.

1372
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:44,070
But I learned a lot because I never had anyone come back and criticize how I spoke, right?

1373
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:49,170
So I'll keep that in the back of the mind.

1374
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,410
That's helped me tremendously.

1375
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:54,170
Well, it made me realize I don't want to hear myself recorded.

1376
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:55,910
I don't like the way I sound, number one.

1377
01:48:56,030 --> 01:49:00,490
Number two, maybe it's like a repulsion of some – two similar polarities repelling.

1378
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:01,250
We all have that.

1379
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:13,230
And the other thing was that when – the reason these guys were doing high-pressure sales is because they were trying to maximize efficiency, right?

1380
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:15,610
They were not calling people to have conversations.

1381
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:21,490
The purpose of the call was to make a profit, was to maximize that, right?

1382
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,730
Anyway, I'll be back in about 30 seconds or so.

1383
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:28,890
Okay.

1384
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,820
Well, greetings, salutations.

1385
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:38,320
Thanks for allowing me to join the conversation.

1386
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,880
Oh, you're more than welcome, more than welcome.

1387
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,970
Sam, are you still with us?

1388
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:50,030
Yes, I'm still here.

1389
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,690
I'm just a bit slow because I'm tired.

1390
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:56,830
Okay.

1391
01:49:56,910 --> 01:49:59,530
Remember, Sam, you can only talk about extension cords.

1392
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:04,390
I like the orange ones.

1393
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:12,130
Well, the blue ones with the lighted end, which tells you that they're engaged.

1394
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:15,570
I've seen orange ones like that as well.

1395
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:16,990
In different lengths, yeah, yeah.

1396
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:25,240
50-foot, I've found to be very useful, although it can be laborious to drag around.

1397
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:28,420
100 feet is always something.

1398
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,640
I've got milk crates.

1399
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:34,680
Actually, I got the milk crates by permission.

1400
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,120
You know, most people have milk crates you're not supposed to have, right?

1401
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:44,120
But with 100-foot, 10-gauge cords, you try to carry it 100 feet, you're tired, right?

1402
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:44,680
It's really heavy.

1403
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:52,540
Because at a young age, I found out that if you use an under-gauged wire on a motor, you eventually ruin that motor, right?

1404
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:53,500
All right.

1405
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,780
Very valuable as well.

1406
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:17,260
Those are the cables that when I was doing the carpentry, which involved setting up and moving a lot of tools and powering those tools from varying distances, one of the things that always got locked up very, very thoroughly was the extension cables.

1407
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:30,280
Because the heavy gauge and their copper, and copper is valuable, and people will steal what is not tied down, as they say.

1408
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:34,800
Well, now they have a thing here where they only get bare copper at the salvage yard.

1409
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:39,380
So, the crackheads have to sit there and strip all this insulation off.

1410
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:47,380
I've seen or at least been told that they'll just burn it off, throw it all in a fire, burn it off, rinse the carbonation off.

1411
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:54,440
They've had places where people would rob the house if it's been sitting idle for a while and just strip the copper out of it.

1412
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,100
Okay.

1413
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:57,940
Now, about wrapping extension.

1414
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:06,180
One of the things is, Bruce, wrapping or Seth or even Sam, wrapping an extension cord, any kind of cord, and pulling it apart, you get tangles, right?

1415
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:07,460
Right.

1416
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:13,400
When you work at a TV studio, some of those cables are very expensive because they carry both audio and video.

1417
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:18,400
If you've ever been in a TV studio, if you stand on one, I mean, everyone yells at you, right?

1418
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:19,620
Immediately.

1419
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:24,080
Yeah, and you have to wrap them a certain way.

1420
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:27,980
Do you guys know about the over and under when you coil up a long cord?

1421
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:32,860
I'm familiar with it, but admittedly not adept.

1422
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:36,720
Well, look, maybe there's a YouTube video on how to wrap the coil over.

1423
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:39,540
That's one of the things they train you when you wrap up your coils.

1424
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,620
You go over and under.

1425
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,920
If anyone wants to look it up, I don't know if there's anything on the rectangle about it.

1426
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:53,980
Basically, as you bring the cable into the coiled section with your palm facing where you're wrapping it, you grab it, palm facing the opposite direction, bring it in, right?

1427
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:59,180
You keep rotating the way you grab it, so palm facing the loop, then palm facing opposite the loop.

1428
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:02,500
So when you pull it apart, it kind of acts like a coil.

1429
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:08,440
So you have, instead of it being stacked, it's an intermittent stack, you know?

1430
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:12,000
Anyway, I don't know if I gave a great visual on that.

1431
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:12,340
It's a great idea.

1432
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,420
Yeah, it does, yeah, and you don't get tangles.

1433
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:21,820
So, again, back to communicating this.

1434
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:27,420
100 foot sneaks is what I learned on.

1435
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:29,860
Well, yeah.

1436
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:35,600
100 foot, I like the 50, 25 or whatever sounds, 25 is really short.

1437
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,700
50 is pretty good.

1438
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:39,160
100 gets a little long.

1439
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,380
It is long.

1440
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:52,740
On the 100 footer that I've got here that I like to use, I went to a Granger and I bought the real heavy-duty male-female plug and I spliced it into 250s, you know?

1441
01:53:54,560 --> 01:54:02,460
So I could use, now I have, you know, but I still store it as 100 because 250s are more useful than a 100 footer, I think.

1442
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,740
Also, at the middle junction, you could put a junction box, right?

1443
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,740
Yep, and you could put all your phantom if you want.

1444
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,120
Yep, all stuff coming off of it.

1445
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,300
But essentially, I just want to go back to the general discussion.

1446
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,940
Who are you communicating to?

1447
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:31,200
You're communicating to a society of people that are set up by the gods to be basically slaughtered at a rate of 90% slaughter, kill rate, right?

1448
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:33,860
Okay, that doesn't sound good, right?

1449
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:38,900
I mean, whether, you know, whether you want to be apathetic to the cause of whichever one, it doesn't matter.

1450
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,380
It doesn't sound good statistically or anything.

1451
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,700
That's the truth of the matter.

1452
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:55,140
The second aspect is we know, based on the writ, that these people won't know what's happening to them when it's happening, so they have to be that oblivious to it.

1453
01:54:55,140 --> 01:55:17,080
Let me just ask you, if you just did a general statistical informational exchange with anyone in the galaxy saying that these people in about a decade and a half are going to be slaughtered at a rate of 90%, 10% survival, and they're not going to be aware of it, what the hell else is more important to be able to get across to these idiots?

1454
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:23,310
It seems like all the other subject matter just fades away, doesn't it?

1455
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:30,810
I mean, the last thing you want to do is go around and say, you morons are going to be slaughtered at a rate of 90% in a decade and a half.

1456
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:32,750
You know what they're going to do to you, right?

1457
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:35,210
They're going to be in a padded cell with a lollipop, right?

1458
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:53,840
You know, as you said that, I was thinking about the slaughterhouse and the cow.

1459
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:57,180
You know, the dumb animal.

1460
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:01,600
We've been reduced to such a dumb species.

1461
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,720
Well, no, you're not really that dumb.

1462
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:06,760
You're being deceived.

1463
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:08,800
Okay, yes.

1464
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,020
But statistically, yeah, you are.

1465
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:16,840
Because the fact is that you are going to be slaughtered at a rate of 90%.

1466
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:18,560
Slaughter, right?

1467
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:21,080
Yeah, so in essence, just like if you go to a...

1468
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,820
Okay, Bruce, I'll grant you that for sure.

1469
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:29,180
If you go to a ranch and say that these cattle within the next year will be slaughtered at a rate of 90%, we would all say, yeah, pretty much.

1470
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:29,920
That's about right.

1471
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,000
Maybe more.

1472
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:34,480
Yeah, so from that, yeah, I could see that.

1473
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:38,080
But in essence, humans are not even animals, by the way.

1474
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:38,320
Right?

1475
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,420
I think Seth brought up the point earlier.

1476
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,900
They come with downloads.

1477
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:51,280
Like, for example, I've got some kittens, and they were eating, and after they ate, they all in unison licked their paws and wiped their brow in unison.

1478
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,580
Perfect unison, like the greatest choreographer couldn't do it.

1479
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,720
And I mentioned to someone else nearby, I said, who taught them how to do that?

1480
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,180
Who taught them how to do that?

1481
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:04,160
No one.

1482
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:05,440
Download.

1483
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,640
They came with that download.

1484
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:07,580
Yeah.

1485
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:09,320
You know what I mean?

1486
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:09,940
Right.

1487
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:16,660
So the humans, they don't have a download, or men doesn't have a download very much.

1488
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:22,880
And literally, you ever heard the expression, they don't even know how to wipe their butt?

1489
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,700
Literally, I think that had to be taught.

1490
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:41,380
And if you look at history, by the way, when they divide all the ages, you know, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, they fail to tell you how many a mixture of all those tools they find all the time, aged all the time, right?

1491
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:47,760
It was either a stone society, you know, litho-based, bronze-based, or iron-based.

1492
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:54,620
And I just want to throw this in there, because there's no such thing as a Stone Age or a caveman, you know.

1493
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:57,300
There's no such thing as a Bronze Age or an Iron Age.

1494
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,740
It wasn't either, you know, was it an iron-based society?

1495
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:04,380
Like isn't this called an information-based society now, right?

1496
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:06,820
So what does that mean?

1497
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,780
Is that better than Stone Age?

1498
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:09,260
I don't know.

1499
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:11,400
Right?

1500
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:15,800
So, yeah, this is absurd.

1501
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:25,780
Now, the reason I brought this up is recently reading an article, and they were pushing that they did find iron Egyptian tools during the Bronze Age in Egypt.

1502
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:29,900
But those were very special, because they only made them from meteorites.

1503
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:37,200
So they're starting to find dating that all these things coexisted at the same time, and they give these stupid excuses.

1504
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:45,240
Dates are constantly being pushed back as well, specifically within the last year.

1505
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:59,600
It seems every other week or so, even in the accepted realms of archaeology and things like that, they are accepting the fringes and whatnot.

1506
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:09,720
They are beginning to push back the dates of the different lands being inhabited, levels of technology.

1507
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,960
They push back like older?

1508
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:13,320
Yeah, absolutely.

1509
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:18,680
The same way they do with the age of the earth as they do.

1510
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:22,380
How old is the earth 50 years ago versus how old it is now?

1511
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:25,080
It's aging at 1.2 million years per year now.

1512
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:51,820
We're beginning to see more of that with human artifacts and with the availability of the internet and mass dissemination of information, not without censorship, but with it being easier to divulge lots of information than it is to sequester a small piece of information.

1513
01:59:51,820 --> 02:00:06,820
Recently I've seen an uptick in what would 20 years ago be considered fringe or conspiracy-oriented archaeologists.

1514
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:14,880
A lot of it is being reinforced by current archaeological finds and things like that.

1515
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:17,940
They have to keep their victims unbalanced.

1516
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,780
Get them to believe it's this old and whatever.

1517
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:22,620
I'm just going to step away for a second.

1518
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:23,320
I'll be right back.

1519
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,220
I have to go get something.

1520
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:25,020
Okay.

1521
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:33,780
There was someone brought up in chat asked if there was going to be anything scripturally discussed.

1522
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:36,020
I'm paraphrasing.

1523
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:51,240
One question I had, and it's a very large and succinct all at the same time, I suppose, is possible extrapolation on the commandments listed in Exodus 34.

1524
02:00:51,240 --> 02:01:02,800
I mentioned probably unadvisedly that I found just in reading through the Interlinear, I noted eight different commandments.

1525
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,540
There was a bit of chuckling because it's referred to as the Ten Commandments.

1526
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:22,360
Why it's referred to as the Ten Commandments is because the Disney movie and the religious – that's how it is presented is these Ten Commandments.

1527
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:33,380
The Ten Commandments that are spoken of and commonly colloquially spoken of are not the ones that were actually memorialized in stone.

1528
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:52,560
So clarification on that, and it's very possible that I smashed some commandments together in taking my count because it appeared that a couple of the commandments were actually just clarifying a singular one.

1529
02:01:53,560 --> 02:02:02,120
That in specific being giving the first fruits of the womb and your children to Yahweh.

1530
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:09,260
So any extrapolation you would like to offer, I would greatly.

1531
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:15,920
I haven't looked at it, and stuff like that, I'd like for you guys to come up with it.

1532
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:22,480
And I've in the past given hints maybe in chat on how to come up with good research in scripture.

1533
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:33,800
My focus is going to be on prophecy, on Revelation, the book of Zechariah, the book of Daniel, Genesis.

1534
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:41,280
I don't see, as a matter of fact, on a cursory examination, I see 12 commandments written on the stone.

1535
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:47,560
Can I share the eight, and then you can correct, perhaps?

1536
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,060
It seems rote.

1537
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,320
Which two are missing?

1538
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:53,040
How about that?

1539
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,160
Which two are missing?

1540
02:02:55,500 --> 02:03:09,260
The one involving the breaking of the neck, as I saw that as being an extrapolation or explanation or clarification of the first or his, and don't send them empty-handed.

1541
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:13,640
Ransoming the donkey with a lamb were you to break the donkey's neck, right?

1542
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:14,100
Right.

1543
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,300
That's one commandment.

1544
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,720
It could be two, where you ransom.

1545
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:23,280
In other words, the commandment is you ransom a donkey with a lamb.

1546
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,000
Which donkey and what lamb?

1547
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:37,770
Well, that would be a lot of lamb being given up for a lot of donkeys if Abraham had 4,000-something asses, right?

1548
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:38,690
Right.

1549
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:44,510
That's a lot of lambs being given up for that, for example.

1550
02:03:46,110 --> 02:03:47,790
But it's the first, right?

1551
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:58,090
What I've gone down to explain when it came to work I like to do on that, it doesn't mean that I don't want to do work on it.

1552
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:03,190
Definitely, if I'm asked to do something regarding that and I see that it's necessary, I'll do it.

1553
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:14,550
But what I've always explained to people is what they're told in Exodus 20 as the commandments, because they didn't go up to the mount where Moses was to go up to get the commandments,

1554
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:19,330
the no shoes, no shirt, no service, say don't touch this mountain and do these things,

1555
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:28,050
those are misinterpreted and portrayed as those were written on the stones as you see them memorialized on these things that look like tombstones, right?

1556
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:28,990
Right.

1557
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:43,350
So those were oral commands to a mob or a group of people that resembled basically Mitsriites, because they were not discernible from the Egyptians in terms of those things at that point.

1558
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:48,310
Right, they were brought out of the society that they were a part of.

1559
02:04:48,910 --> 02:04:50,850
Right, and they acted and behaved accordingly.

1560
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:57,530
So if you look at those oral commands in Exodus 20, each one was to counteract something that was part of the culture of Egypt.

1561
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:57,630
Right.
