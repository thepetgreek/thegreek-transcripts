1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,680
Yeah, they were brought out of the society that they were a part of.

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,740
He was holding those things written on stone tablets.

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,860
And I like to tell people, well, he went up to get the stone tablets with another set of commandments.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,740
Those were just directives given at the base of Mount Sinai.

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:59,280
The other thing I like to bring up about those commandments is that if you look at them, in the order that they are and in the sense that they deliver of what the covenant is or what to do, is all prophetic for the coming of the Messiah and the world of the Messiah.

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,060
Right?

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,100
The coming of the Hameshech, as in Yeshua?

8
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah, Yeshua.

9
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,700
Or as in what is yet to come?

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,860
Both.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,620
Okay, so…

12
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,300
What's the difference?

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
Well, there isn't.

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,380
The thing is, it's two.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,140
You know, the Beatles say one plus one is one, right?

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,140
Is that how it goes?

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,240
The thing is, it's…

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
One and one and one is three, right?

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,460
Or that too, yeah.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:53,940
Well, let's just say, if the entire program is laid out prior to it happening, when he was born as a human to show he was the one chosen and most fit to give the proof of what happens after you die, the first to be resurrected, that was his purpose.

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,140
And to manifest that way.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,500
Otherwise, if it was to teach people, his existence wouldn't have been a secret.

23
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,280
It was to teach certain people.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,360
And I assure anyone that reads what they call the New Testament or even the Old Testament, and I've said this publicly before, don't bother.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,820
It has nothing to do with you.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:32,140
What they call the Bible and the understanding of it has only always been for a very, very small group of people, so small that it's, you know, if you've got enough hands and fingers and toes, that's how few, ultimately.

27
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,260
And that's shown in the scripture itself.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,800
But there is going to come a time where it will be for everyone, you see.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
And that is also predestined.

30
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,560
So, none of these things that I've mentioned are in the public eye or in the public view as being so.

31
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:08,660
Then, if we can view this conversation as not in the public, and, I mean, there's, I don't know how many people are listening, but regardless, it's people that choose to.

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,920
Like, this isn't something that is easy to find.

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,060
This is something that those who have heard you speak have sought out.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,320
And that is why they are here.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,660
I don't think there's any argument to be made against that.

36
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,080
I could be wrong.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm often wrong, actually.

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,100
But the eight that I have are do not make covenants with pagans.

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,780
I'm horribly paraphrasing as well.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,480
No, no, go ahead.

41
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,160
It would be do not make covenants with pagans.

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,860
But hold on.

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,520
The one right before that is do not have another Elohim.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,520
Why don't we just read it?

45
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,350
OK.

46
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,090
Before the – so you missed – I think the first one is do not have any other Elohim other than me.

47
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,090
And then do not go into covenant with the pagans.

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:14,050
People, marvels I will do such as not have been done in all the earth, nor in any nation, and shall see all – this is Exodus 34.10. Where does it – Sam's idea is pretty good.

49
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,690
Let's just read it.

50
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,250
Where does he tell them to carve out two stones like the first?

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,110
And is he talking to Moses?

52
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,210
But anyway, that's another thing.

53
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,870
What does it say after that?

54
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,170
And write on them what was written on the first.

55
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,890
And then immediately what does it go into?

56
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,710
Put yourself atop the Mount to me there, and man shall not come up with you.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,350
Neither let any man, neither – I'm reading the inner linear.

58
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,210
So if it seems broken, that's why.

59
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,470
You could read it out of anything.

60
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,430
As a matter of fact, I almost prefer to just read it out of one of the versions because that's what people are going to be accessing.

61
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,350
And then if you read it out of the version, if you know that there's a mistake, go ahead and correct it.

62
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,530
Because let me just throw this out.

63
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,670
This is a rare thing I'll say.

64
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,530
One of the benefits of reading the versions is even though it has a lot of mistakes, if you know what the mistakes are, make the correction.

65
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:23,250
But the benefits of reading the version is that it's structured within the construct, the literal construct, that people of that language are used to listening to.

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,230
And it's easier to remember because that's how they speak, right?

67
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:35,130
Even if you read King James with these and those, just don't use the these and those and use what you know the correction is.

68
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,250
Okay.

69
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:47,060
So this is King James.

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,080
By the way, let me just speak for a few seconds while you're getting it together.

71
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:05,220
One of the things I put in chat a while back was how about making a project of whether you want to look at it as 66 books or 49 books, just whatever's published as the Bible.

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:20,560
Why don't you get 49 people or 66 people, each one grab a book, or two or three people grab a book, split it and whatever, and go through an interlinear and see where the fatal mistakes are and what was left out, what was put in that shouldn't be there.

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,420
And what is mistranslated and make a list.

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,360
You have to know 66 people interested in doing such a thing first.

75
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,140
Yes.

76
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,520
Well, actually, I don't have to know them.

77
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,880
They just have to appear somehow.

78
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,240
But I know what you mean, right?

79
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,420
And just make a glossary.

80
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,440
So let's say someone takes the book of Genesis.

81
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,760
You would say, well, you know, you would do chapter and verse.

82
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,340
Chapter, verse one, this is what should be there.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,400
This word in English should be that.

84
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,720
Go to the next one.

85
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,240
If there isn't a mistake until the next chapter, then just show the chapter and verse.

86
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,960
This is wrong.

87
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,760
Put this in here.

88
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,720
It doesn't make for a big body of work to do.

89
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,160
And I'm not talking about the ultimate fixer-upper.

90
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm just talking about a cursory correction.

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,540
Because if we go through, I think Sam and I have done private conversations, and he'll read something and say, it doesn't say that.

92
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,520
And he'll pick stuff out of the Old Testament or the New Testament.

93
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,800
And just out of memory, I'll say, that's not what it means.

94
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,820
Let's go to the interlinear.

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,660
And when the interlinear, you know, sometimes I'll be off.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,020
It really is what it says.

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,120
And sometimes I'll say, oh, yeah, that word doesn't mean that.

98
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Yeah, right, it doesn't.

99
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,100
So after a while doing this, you commit enough to memory.

100
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,560
But why?

101
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,380
Why not have a glossary of it?

102
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Certainly.

103
00:07:41,960 --> 00:08:00,200
It makes it easier to communicate if you have – especially if you're talking to anyone who is familiar with any religious dogma or the text upon which these dogmas are not based.

104
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:17,140
Well, yeah, it's just strictly the text, the received text, the accepted text, the version, versus what's in the interlinear, without even making it too much of a, let's say, a stretch.

105
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:30,680
Like, for example, I was going to translate the book of Joshua, and I just put it down because it was like, I've read too much scripture to be able to do that because every other verse was a hyperlink to another book.

106
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,620
You know what I mean?

107
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:40,059
So instead of the book of Joshua being 15 or 20 pages, it would have been 500 pages because I wanted to explain it.

108
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,740
So I said, oh, I'm going to put this down.

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:53,920
But while I was looking at it, I was looking at the words that were – could have been translated better with more accuracy, you see, and made a list and all that other stuff put together.

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,860
I was like, hey, this should be done with the whole scripture, but I'm not going to do it.

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,440
There should be people out there interested in doing it if they have that much interest.

112
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,100
OK.

113
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,780
I have the King James brought up here.

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:20,100
It says the first time the stone tablets are mentioned in chapter 34 is …

115
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,700
Verse 3 or 4 or 5, somewhere around there.

116
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, it's 4.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,160
And he hewed two tablets of stone like unto the first.

118
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,820
And Moshe rose up early in the morning and went unto Mount Sinai as Yahweh had commanded him and took in his hand the two tablets of stone.

119
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Yahweh descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.

120
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:52,560
And Yahweh passed by before him and proclaimed Yahweh, Yahweh El or El Yahweh is how they would – how that would be in the Hebrew, El Yahweh.

121
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:03,980
Merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.

122
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:14,220
And that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and fourth generation.

123
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,540
And Moshe made haste and bowed his head towards the earth and worshipped.

124
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,760
And he said, Now I have found grace in thy sight, O Yahweh.

125
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,620
Adonai, actually, is how that would – I have found grace in thy sight, Adonai.

126
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,640
Let Adonai – Adonai is how they would pronounce it actually.

127
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:43,320
I pray thee, go among us, for it is a stiff-necked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance.

128
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,680
And he said, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people.

129
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,880
I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation.

130
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,200
And all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Yahweh, for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.

131
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,780
Observe thou which I command thee this day.

132
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
Okay, that's where I started my list.

133
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,480
Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.

134
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,600
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make covenant with the inhabitants of the land wherever thou goest.

135
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Okay, stop right there for a second.

136
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,480
I just want to – I remember from doing a study on that.

137
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:33,880
When you take the six names, I think, of those countries, those people, make a list of what each one of those names means and read that.

138
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,400
And it ends up being exactly what he just said before that.

139
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:40,900
Indeed.

140
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,940
So go ahead.

141
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,600
In that, I condensed – as I said, I made notations here as I was going through last week.

142
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,980
I mean, it's written on the back of a gas bill.

143
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,120
But it says, do not make covenant with pagans.

144
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,560
That's, as I said, a very abbreviated version of that right there.

145
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,420
So, okay, where was I?

146
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,300
Now art shall see the work of Yahweh, for it is a terrible thing that I do with you.

147
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,220
Observe thou which I command thee this day.

148
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,380
Behold, I drive out the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

149
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.

150
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,560
But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.

151
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,300
For thou shalt worship no other god for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous god.

152
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:50,020
Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice.

153
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,360
And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods, and make their sons go whoring after their gods.

154
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,700
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

155
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:08,860
So I took from that, and like I said, there's two in there, and that's, so I've got nine now.

156
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:21,060
Because yes, it's, there shall be, for thou shalt worship no other god, and, okay, three, if you take the, destroy their altars, their images, and cut down their groves.

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,340
No molten gods, yeah.

158
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,480
And the no molten gods is the second one that I have written down here.

159
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
That's okay, okay.

160
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,720
So you could paraphrase each, we could do like groupings.

161
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,060
So let's say that first grouping is don't go in a covenant with the pagans.

162
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,000
Also group with that one, only worship him and no molten gods, maybe.

163
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,120
So yeah, like the first grouping, let's say.

164
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,540
Yeah, do not make covenants with them, because...

165
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,500
No covenant, no gods, and worship one.

166
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,020
You have me, you have Yahweh.

167
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,140
Yahweh is your god, and so you will make no covenants with them.

168
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:07,960
And by the way, just to interject, when you traveled around the world, even today, they'll say, each country will tell you who their god is, by the way, even today, to a certain extent.

169
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,980
That comes later on, other studies in scripture, where the sons of gods were given to rule and create the nations, but go ahead.

170
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,380
Okay, observe thou, let's see, but ye shall destroy their altars.

171
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,280
I'm catching up with myself here.

172
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,720
Thou shalt worship no other god, for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, lest thou make a covenant.

173
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,500
Jealous, no.

174
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Heeded the sacrifice.

175
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
Thou shalt make no molten gods.

176
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,000
That one is the one that I took as number two.

177
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,520
Do not make covenants with pagans.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,920
Two, do not make molten gods.

179
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay, go ahead to the next one.

180
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,520
The next one, my paraphrase is, keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

181
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,460
We've talked in the past that this is not the only place that is stated.

182
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:05,940
It is stated at least seven times very clearly, given as a commandment, to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

183
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,200
Yeah, even in the New Testament, what they call it.

184
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
Yes, absolutely.

185
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,020
Do this in remembrance of me.

186
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,960
The Feast of Unleavened Bread, I'm reading again here, this is 3418.

187
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,000
Right, and by the way, most people think the Passover is a high, it's not.

188
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,420
It's the first month, it's the week of Unleavened Bread.

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
Okay, I'll just throw in the commentary as we go.

190
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,600
What is known as the Peshach is the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

191
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,200
Peshach is...

192
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,940
Prior to, yeah.

193
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, prior to, it essentially is the beginning of the Feast.

194
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,820
Okay, so the Feast of Unleavened Bread shalt thou keep.

195
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:50,320
Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread as I commanded thee in the time of the month of Abib, the first month.

196
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,100
For in the month of Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

197
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:06,820
And apparently that was made the first month when they came out of Egypt as Abib for the observance of festivals.

198
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,500
It's the first month.

199
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,900
As opposed to the civil, which is determined, what, six months prior.

200
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,260
And here, let me just throw some commentary.

201
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,900
You know, they were not officially out until the second day of the second month.

202
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,880
So that's another thing.

203
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,840
Because, you know, Scripture is not very...

204
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,080
Yeah, Peshach was observed, they were still there.

205
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,820
They were still there when it happened.

206
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,780
You could do, if you do a study, you'll learn that when you do a study on the Temple.

207
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,700
The Temple was started exactly the same day that they were out of Egypt, which was the second day of the second month.

208
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,440
480 years to the day.

209
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
So anyway, I just want to throw out, I can't help it, I have to throw in trivia, right?

210
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
Oh, don't help, please.

211
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,040
Please throw it in.

212
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,820
All that opened the matrix is mine.

213
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:04,700
Matrix is another word for womb.

214
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,520
All that openeth the matrix is mine.

215
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,180
And every firstling among thy...

216
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,200
Okay, so that's the one that I paraphrased as the first are his.

217
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,240
And do not send them empty-handed.

218
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,319
Because it continues on.

219
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,859
All that openeth the matrix.

220
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,940
So the first out of the womb.

221
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,120
And every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

222
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,380
So the first male is his.

223
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,480
But the firstling of an ass shalt thou redeem with a lamb.

224
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,220
And if thou redeem him not, then thou shalt break his neck.

225
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,380
The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem.

226
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,800
And none shall appear before me empty.

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:58,680
So that's like three commandments, as I said, that is simply, at least in my reading of it, just clarification of all that openeth the matrix is mine.

228
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,900
And it says, and every firstling among thy cattle.

229
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,900
So that would be the same with the cattle, regardless whether it's ox or sheep, that is male.

230
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,640
But the firstling of an ass shalt thou redeem with a lamb.

231
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,880
And if thou redeem him not, then thou shalt break his neck.

232
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,740
And all the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou redeem.

233
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,380
And none shall appear before me empty.

234
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:31,680
So that was, I suppose, my first confusion in enumerating them.

235
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,740
Is that I read that as being because all that opened the matrix is mine.

236
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,660
And then the continuation of that thought is all that follows.

237
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,200
And all the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou redeem.

238
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
And none shall appear before me empty.

239
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:59,500
All right, so five is, you know, six days thou shalt work.

240
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400
But on the seventh day thou shalt rest.

241
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
In earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

242
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,060
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks.

243
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,260
This is the, that would be the sixth one.

244
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,980
So fifth, paraphrased, work six days, rest the seventh.

245
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,760
Although in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest as well.

246
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,680
Should certainly be considered in with that one.

247
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:32,380
And then the sixth commandment in Exodus 34 would be.

248
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks.

249
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,000
And the first fruits of wheat harvest.

250
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,240
And the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

251
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
So that's two.

252
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,960
Ingathering is sukkot or tabernacle.

253
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,480
Okay, so if those, if that is two.

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,460
It could be one.

255
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,820
Meaning that he wants to observe these feasts.

256
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,440
But then if we go on there's others as well, observances.

257
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,500
Is that the only commandment dealing with days to observe?

258
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,100
Appointed, those are moed I think.

259
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,040
And also I'm curious just to go back for a study.

260
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,640
My memory doesn't serve me right.

261
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,560
When we were talking about opening the matrix.

262
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,980
I wonder how many times the word Hanuk or Hanukkah comes up.

263
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,880
Which is to dedicate.

264
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,380
So anyway, continue.

265
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,040
Okay, so seventh day shalt thou rest.

266
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,700
In earing time and harvest thou shalt rest.

267
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,340
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks.

268
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,080
Of the first fruits of wheat harvest.

269
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
And of the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

270
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,140
So that seems to me as one commandment.

271
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,880
To observe two different feasts.

272
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,540
Okay, and there's a grouping there of two different feasts.

273
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,500
Okay, go to the next.

274
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,680
And the next is an interesting one.

275
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,960
Because I'm curious as to how.

276
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,360
I suppose.

277
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,720
But thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord God.

278
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,200
This is not just the first born.

279
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,360
But this is all of the children that are masculine.

280
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,280
Shall appear before the Lord God.

281
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,060
The God of Israel.

282
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,360
For I will cast out the nations upon thee.

283
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,060
And enlarge thy borders.

284
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,600
Neither shall any man desire thy land.

285
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,040
When thou goest up to appear before Yahweh.

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,220
Elie thrice in the year.

287
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,820
So the three is the spring, summer, fall festival.

288
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,660
Three times men shall appear before Yahweh.

289
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,260
What does it have in the interlinear for three times?

290
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,340
In the interlinear?

291
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,480
We could put a question mark.

292
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Go to the next one.

293
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,420
Okay.

294
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,160
Might as well go through all of them.

295
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,680
For I will cast out the nations before thee.

296
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
Okay, this is 25.

297
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,840
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven.

298
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,960
Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left unto the morning.

299
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:13,360
That's a reiteration of how Peshach is observed, actually.

300
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,280
But three times a year.

301
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,660
Okay.

302
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,680
So there's another one.

303
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,380
I think I'm actually up to like 13 now with clarification.

304
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,100
Okay.

305
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,800
For I will cast the sacrifice of leaven.

306
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,980
It's very clear in verse 28 that there's only 10.

307
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,740
So we can't just arbitrarily add.

308
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,480
Some of them are combinations.

309
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,260
That's okay.

310
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,200
Let's go through all of them first.

311
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah.

312
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,160
Okay.

313
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,700
Three times a year before Yahweh.

314
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,260
Okay.

315
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,360
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven.

316
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,120
Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of Passover be left unto the morning.

317
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,500
That's another one that I didn't actually enumerate.

318
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,260
That's okay.

319
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,500
The first fruits of thy land shalt thou bring into the house of the Lord thy God.

320
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,120
Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

321
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,280
That's the last one.

322
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Yeah.

323
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,480
Don't boil an animal in the milk of its mother.

324
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,320
Or it could mean don't cook a suckling lamb.

325
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
A lamb that's still suckling?

326
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,720
Yeah, one that is still – okay.

327
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,960
Yeah, absolutely.

328
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:34,300
I can see that one that is still – It's a difficult one to go either way, but that always has spiritual – I understand that.

329
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:43,900
As I've heard it used in literature as young children, youngling of animals even being referred to as still in their milk.

330
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,080
Right.

331
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,540
It's kind of like isn't there something in Leviticus?

332
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,860
If you take a bird, don't take the eggs and the bird.

333
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,400
Take one or the other.

334
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,280
Right.

335
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:03,820
That's interesting that it said thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

336
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,220
It seems relatively specific, although the – Yeah.

337
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:32,780
And a kid could be a goat or a lamb, but it's a – in other words, it's kind of like when you run into somebody who's steeped in tradition they got from their parents, you don't have to really – if they're not open to figuring out the truth about it, making fun of them or trying to convert them.

338
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:42,840
My comprehension of the New Testament is certainly inadequate for my own desires.

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,220
There is no conversion, by the way, in the New Testament.

340
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:58,820
Calling them fools or whatnot would be counterproductive if one is going just by the writings that are available.

341
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:21,810
If the concept of conversion comes up, that was only strictly associated with those that wanted – that accepted the testimony of the Christ being resurrected and also learning the law and the history, the real history behind it.

342
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:22,890
Right.

343
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:38,690
I would like to read just the verse that is directly after that because it says, And Yahweh said unto Moshe, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

344
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:49,650
Just leading more – very obvious that these – the words preceding that phrase right there are what were written in stone.

345
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,670
And does it say word?

346
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,290
It's interesting.

347
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,330
Do a quick look.

348
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,470
Is it d'var or is it another word?

349
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:06,270
Because there's another word that's also used that's translated as word and it means to emanate or project out.

350
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,050
Just real quick, does it use the word d'var?

351
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,150
I'm looking.

352
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,780
I shouldn't be asking.

353
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,760
It's kind of minor, but just out of memory I remember.

354
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,900
No, no, it's – minor clarifications are incredibly useful.

355
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,740
Let's see.

356
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,180
And said Yahweh unto Moshe, Write to you words.

357
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,700
Let's see.

358
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,240
Hadabarim?

359
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,400
Had, had, d'barim.

360
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,780
Okay, so it is d'var, d'barim.

361
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,440
Yeah, the words.

362
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,740
Okay.

363
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,800
So it is literal, the words meaning.

364
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,760
There's no – there's nothing else.

365
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,380
So yeah, strictly like literal.

366
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Like words on a black ink on white paper or something carved in stone.

367
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
So it refers back to that.

368
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,520
Sam, what were you saying about the verse on the ten before?

369
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:01,960
Sorry.

370
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,320
Do you want to – anything you want to bring up, Sam?

371
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,120
No, I was just saying that it's – the total commandments are ten because it says that very clearly in verse 18.

372
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,460
Can you write these ten words down?

373
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,340
Or these ten d'barim?

374
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,660
How do we – got it, right.

375
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,720
Verse 18 of 34?

376
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,440
Yeah, the last verse.

377
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,460
Now here's the interesting part about it.

378
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,260
You know, is anybody here familiar with Linear A or Linear B, which is the old prehistoric Greek writings?

379
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:43,500
You know, Minoan Linear A would be Minoan and Linear B Mycenaean writings where it was like one symbol actually meant an entire phrase.

380
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,220
Are you guys – I think, Sam, you might be familiar with it.

381
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,020
Are you familiar with it?

382
00:27:48,680 --> 00:28:01,820
It's still allegedly not translated today only because they haven't found a Rosetta Stone type thing, but I assure you that once you understand the culture and the culture around it, these things can be presumably, you know, translated.

383
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:13,600
But I would suggest that, you know, as it is today, what is known about it is you would have a symbol and it could mean a word, it could mean a sentence, it could mean an entire concept, you know.

384
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,720
Is this how these people were conveying meaning, the people that saw what was written on the stone?

385
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:38,880
Because, you know, it was put in the Ark of the Covenant, so it was, you know, not just Moses who was able to witness what was on the stone, but nothing is said about it, nothing about language.

386
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,910
Now what we're reading is what Moses was told to write down.

387
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,650
I'm curious.

388
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,690
I'm still curious.

389
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:56,590
I just can't find the 18th – is it Chapter 18?

390
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,270
Sorry, 28.

391
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,990
Sorry, I misread that.

392
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,710
Is it Exodus Chapter 28?

393
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:10,370
No, it's Exodus 34, Chapter 28.

394
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:24,780
That's the one that starts with, and he was there with Yahweh 40 days and 40 nights.

395
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:34,200
Bread not that he eat, and water not that he drink, and he wrote on the tablets the word of the covenant, the 10 commands.

396
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,140
Yes.

397
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,040
So there's 10 of them.

398
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:52,920
Right, but what we just read, what Seth, my point maybe wasn't that clear, what you just read in Exodus 34, what we just went through, is what Moses had written, known as the Book of Exodus.

399
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,880
Shemoth, the words, right?

400
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:03,000
Or Shemoth meaning, you know, the document that Moses penned.

401
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,320
Yeah, on the stone.

402
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
That's what you're talking about, the commandments written on the stone.

403
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,420
No, no.

404
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,860
What Seth was reading was what is in the Book of Exodus that was part of the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses.

405
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,380
How it was written on the stone, we don't know.

406
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,960
We've never seen the stones.

407
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,940
So I suppose that's where my confusion came in.

408
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:38,560
As I said in chat last week, was that I counted eight, and as we went back through them, I found more.

409
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,680
So I suppose it's just the grouping I need to look at a little bit more carefully.

410
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,340
Sorry, I wasn't entirely sure what the Greek was saying.

411
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,400
Let me just say back, when Moses wrote Exodus, in other words, we could find old copies, for example.

412
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,440
You know how the king is supposed to make his own copy of that, right?

413
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,360
Alright, so we have what's called the first five books of Moses.

414
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,280
What we just read was in the first five books of Moses, regarding what was written on the stones.

415
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:23,300
How it was written on the stones is, I'm trying to maybe stretch the imagination in a semi-lawful, rational way, that back then, contemporary, there was something going on, known as Linear A and Linear B, in another part of the world, let's say.

416
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:30,180
Where one symbol can be a word, it could be a sentence, it could be an entire paragraph, phrase, you know?

417
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,880
So this is something that we have been deprived, visually.

418
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,500
So you're talking about the manner in which it was recorded?

419
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:50,880
Right, on the actual, you know, if you want to listen to or observe what's been, you know, like in the last Sonic event, I said, look at everything, you know?

420
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,940
A lot of the, I hate to say it, rabbinical texts talk about it was written on sapphire, right?

421
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,900
Because, you know, supposedly, wherever he goes, there's a sapphire floor, you know?

422
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,240
And it was like sapphire, you know, blue like the sky.

423
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,620
Well, it doesn't say it was written on sapphire.

424
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,860
But, you know, you look at all that stuff, you know, let me just put it this way.

425
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:24,520
The way that we are given what was written as the Ten Commandments, the way Seth read it, clearly there isn't a short laundry list of ten items.

426
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:36,620
There's phraseology in there, there's meaning that we get, because it's, should I say in a loose way, a form of poetry, you know?

427
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,100
That the way you remember these things is when you put them in a poetic form.

428
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,980
But maybe the way it was written physically, if we were to see the stones now, would not resemble what we just read in Hebrew or any language.

429
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,760
It could have been just ten characters resembling something.

430
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,740
We don't know that yet.

431
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,740
Some people want to, in the occult mysticism, say, well, they were using the language of the angels or something, you know?

432
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,620
And there's so many ways you could look at it.

433
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,580
So no one that we know of has seen the stones.

434
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:22,140
We don't have, I don't feel like I have any rock-solid research where I could say, well, this is what the stones look like in the Ark of the Covenant, you know, when they were placed there, you know, for safekeeping, let's say, or memorialization.

435
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,200
We have very little information on that, how it was actually recorded on the stone.

436
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,000
And that aspect is always in conflict with what we just read.

437
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,560
You know, where are the ten?

438
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,160
You know, it's not that clear, but is it supposed to be clear?

439
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,800
We do know that there are ten of them.

440
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,120
As it states, correct, in Exodus, yes.

441
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,060
But as it reads, it reads like an entire soliloquy of a covenant of things to do.

442
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,300
And really how to do them as well.

443
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,070
Certainly.

444
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:14,750
Knowing, I suppose that knowing how to do them is my own motivation for trying to discern.

445
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:29,929
Whether it's censored or not, it's something that I find value in, and finding value in that, I would like to have comprehension of it.

446
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,370
Well, you also have to look at the whole picture, right?

447
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,810
You know, the helicopter point of view of the forest, right?

448
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,230
Instead of the tree that you decide to build your treehouse in and live in.

449
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,969
And let me just sum it up again.

450
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:57,050
You're living in a time period where in the near future, not so near, it's going to seem like a long time, but in historical time you're half a second from midnight, not even a minute.

451
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,730
The inhabitants of the earth are going to be slaughtered at a rate of 90%.

452
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:21,640
And what kind of a setup is required mentally with each, you know, whoever is listening to me, myself, you, Seth, Sam, or anybody, in order for these events to happen where it's acceptable, and comparative to the entire history of, you know, the plan that, you know.

453
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,700
Acceptable to whom?

454
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,680
Oh, it's, in other words, when, quote, unquote, the end, you know how people talk about the end times, right?

455
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,380
What's going to be happening?

456
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,580
I don't see anyone really complaining.

457
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:48,660
I see a group of people being angry at these things happening, but I don't see that there's going to be any allowance for anything other than that, you know, to follow through.

458
00:35:48,860 --> 00:36:01,880
You know, in other words, what you read about man's behavior and what is going to be happening on earth makes it something to be considered when one wants to observe these things personally, right?

459
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,380
Let me just say it another way.

460
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:13,460
Let's say we lived around that time, and you heard, you know, around the time of Moses or so, and you found out about this, right?

461
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:23,280
And you just rocked on over to the border and said, Hey, listen, guys, I heard about your L, and I'm just a pagan.

462
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:29,140
As you can see, I come from these people over here, and I don't want to do it anymore.

463
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:39,980
I want to vow to be, I want your L to be my L, and I'm going to vow to live the way he wants you to live as one of you.

464
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:53,580
They will accept you, just like I think there are several books that state when the stranger or the sojourner comes around your camp and he wants to do these things, you accept him as one of you or as one of yourselves, right?

465
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,450
Yes.

466
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:57,930
Right.

467
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,870
Very different than what people think it is.

468
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:08,750
It's kind of like the way it's done now, let's just say from a loose point of view, with nationalism.

469
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,850
When you want to become a citizen, let's say, of the United States, I'm oversimplifying it.

470
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,030
They make you study a little bit of history and the Constitution, and you swear an oath, don't you, right?

471
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,890
And become nationalized.

472
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,950
Which is unlawful, apparently.

473
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,870
Yeah, well, yeah, because there is no united.

474
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,470
I mean, it's just…

475
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:37,850
No, I mean, as I've stated earlier, my comprehension of the New Testament is lacking.

476
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,330
Oh, the New Testament is something different.

477
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,670
If there are commandments given, that's certainly one of them.

478
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,270
Did the Christ offer any commandments in the New Testament?

479
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:59,870
No, the New Testament is very simple, and it's simple to the point where it really shouldn't have been made public the way that it was.

480
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,070
But it is, so no one is without excuse.

481
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:12,290
The New Testament is for a very specific group of people, which Christ specifically stated in different ways in different times.

482
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,650
It's for the deceased of Israel.

483
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:22,410
Basically, he came to anyone who passed away that knew the Elohim, Yahweh.

484
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,710
What happens after death, knowledge of the resurrection.

485
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,230
He was there to prove that basically Elohim keeps his word.

486
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:32,790
That's all.

487
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,630
It wasn't about starting another religion or anything like that.

488
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:58,610
Regardless of starting a new religion or anything like that, there's what has been shared of what is memorialized, which unfortunately, being a native English speaker, I only have what is available to me to refer to.

489
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:07,610
But even in that, if that was solely his existence, then why the teachings?

490
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,970
There are very plain, easy commandments given there.

491
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,470
One of them being, make no vows.

492
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,430
Take no vows.

493
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,630
Let your yes be yes and your no be no.

494
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,090
That's very basic, straightforward.

495
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,770
But at the same time, it's completely and totally detrimental to the society in which we live.

496
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:36,250
Well, the vow aspect also, you have to realize that there are things in Scripture that counteract cultures of humanity, known as the goyim, the nations.

497
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,050
That word just means the nations, right?

498
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:49,190
Right, but in that same aspect, the way you were to interact with the nations is the same way that you would interact with your brother.

499
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:59,550
As I've stated, and I can't make clear enough, my comprehension of the text is very limited, but it's something that I'm striving for.

500
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,030
And these are very plain words that are given.

501
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,410
Before you answer, Greg, I'm just going to step out because I'm getting kind of tired.

502
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,070
Okay, man, well thanks for coming in.

503
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,370
Yes, thank you, Sam.

504
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,570
It was always good to hear your voice, man.

505
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,710
Thank you, Sam, and good night.

506
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:17,770
Be well.

507
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,230
Talk to you later.

508
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,090
Here's a very simple explanation.

509
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:30,370
If you read in other books like Zechariah and Isaiah and all that, it talks about the entire world being brought into this.

510
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,150
If you read into this knowledge, right?

511
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,070
Not just Israel.

512
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:44,930
Also, if you read other places in Scripture, the sons of gods were to be the Elohim of mankind based on different nations, right?

513
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,330
And they screwed up.

514
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:52,690
They didn't do their job right because they led man astray and various other reasons.

515
00:40:53,350 --> 00:41:04,670
But essentially, if you look at Zechariah, Isaiah, Psalms, the nations, those that are not of Israel, will also acknowledge the Christ.

516
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,230
And I'm not talking about the second time it comes around, the first time.

517
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:17,130
Just to show that this is for the entire world, not just for Israel, because obviously the gods that they have were made by this god.

518
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:34,430
So the simple way to look at it is that, you know how we were discussing with Sam earlier that there's a primacy, that when people are listening to you, it's not because you're such a good whatever orator, it's because it's meant for them to listen to you.

519
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,590
They were brought to you, if it's regarding these matters especially.

520
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,770
The same thing is with Scripture.

521
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:47,250
What was being shown in the New Testament was certain people were being called out

522
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:54,090
of society that were not of Israel, did not know, were not raised in what was lawful,

523
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,510
basically pagan, and they were, through inspiration,

524
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,630
and I'm using that word etymologically, which means divine influence,

525
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,870
acknowledged the resurrection of the Messiah and what happens for sure after you die,

526
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,690
what we are to expect.

527
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,550
But they lacked tremendously on how to live.

528
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,810
They didn't know what was fit and proper.

529
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:22,410
And they didn't know, like if you mentioned Noah, they were like, oh, you mean Dagon, the fish man?

530
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,270
Or Poseidon, the fish, I mean the god of the ocean?

531
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,070
That's not Noah, right?

532
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,010
He's the only person around on the ocean?

533
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,250
No, no, no, no.

534
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:43,390
So they had to go through a retrospective or a retro-training where they get inspired to show that symbolically that the resurrection was for everyone.

535
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:54,150
These people have full faith and credit, as the American money system says, that for sure they understand and believe and know that the Christ proved the resurrection.

536
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,750
But they didn't know anything else.

537
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,690
They were steeped in paganisms.

538
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:08,670
And that's where the quote-unquote conversion, the teaching, the going to congregation was about, to bring them up to speed.

539
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,820
Does that make sense?

540
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
It does.

541
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,060
It absolutely does.

542
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:41,600
But at the same time, I mean, I'm not of, at least unbeknownst to me, I'm certainly not of any particular bloodline or lineage that would have had a specific covenant offered or instructed.

543
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,520
Neither were these people that you read about.

544
00:43:44,520 --> 00:44:09,560
So that's – in reading what was spoken to them by the person of the Hamashiach, the Messiah, the Christ, it seems like these words should have as much weight as any of the words of the prophets before him.

545
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,160
But then it would be redundant.

546
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,300
In other words, if you don't understand – It is absolutely redundant.

547
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,440
Things of import bear repetition.

548
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,820
They bear being repeated.

549
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,520
But what I meant by that is the Christ would say, if you want to know who I am, well, I don't have to tell you.

550
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,680
Go read the prophets and the Psalms.

551
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,400
He did, though.

552
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,640
In private, yeah.

553
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:48,500
There's a big thing about how the things that he spoke – there's a hint, if you read in the Book of John, for example, when he does a blessing, almost like a prayer about these that he taught.

554
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,820
Here's an interesting aspect.

555
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,380
The purpose of the Christ's resurrection was for all mankind, right?

556
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,660
No one goes to hell.

557
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,400
There's a fire of eternal or whatever, and you don't go to heaven plucking a harp and all that other stuff.

558
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,640
This was something that people had been taught, these things.

559
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,040
Ridiculous, torturous, or pleasantries that you get after.

560
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,220
They had no idea of the resurrection and all that.

561
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,860
Once they got an idea of the resurrection, well, they didn't know anything about what came before the Christ.

562
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:32,480
So this is a situation that is beyond your bloodline and who you are.

563
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,480
Certainly.

564
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,660
It's a cognitive one.

565
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:44,640
I would say that that is something that I have recognized in and of itself.

566
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,540
Otherwise, there would be no point to this study at all.

567
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,120
Here's another way.

568
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Here's the antithesis of it.

569
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,820
If you go to your run-of-the-mill Christian and ask him to define the Christ, he can't.

570
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,100
Why would he do that, though?

571
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,420
I know.

572
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:01,700
I know.

573
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,280
But I'm just saying.

574
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,800
And also, they tell you all that stuff doesn't matter, right?

575
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:19,200
So once a Christian can define the Christ, then you have a desire to go define the prophets, the psalms, the laws of Moses, and all that stuff.

576
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,620
And you have a desire to do that.

577
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,280
Now, I'm not saying this to be dogmatic.

578
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:33,880
But, for example, if you ask a run-of-the-mill or even the Pope who the Christ is and all that, they have no definition.

579
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,720
And those are the same people that tell you the Old Testament doesn't matter or they have no concept of it.

580
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,260
And that right there is an interesting spiritual paraphrasing of what's going on.

581
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,680
Right.

582
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,860
But you and I speaking, I'm certainly not of that mindset.

583
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm one who – I want to know.

584
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,000
I want to know.

585
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:55,700
Sure.

586
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:08,520
Not for the sake of being right itself, but because I would like to be as good as I can for the – I have no idea why.

587
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:17,120
It's a desire and a – Well, you want to be as good as you can during the time where mankind is being set up by the gods.

588
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,320
Certainly.

589
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,080
For the worst possible scenario ever.

590
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,240
Yes.

591
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,560
And also you keep that in mind because that also puts a limit.

592
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,220
Also, let's put another example.

593
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,900
Could you imagine living in Europe and wanting to do that?

594
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,440
You'd be burned at the stake.

595
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,240
Well, now you won't be, right?

596
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,140
Because, you know, we're actually discussing sometimes personally and publicly how to be lawful.

597
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,000
And there's people in the chat talk about that.

598
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:57,940
What people don't appreciate, I think, is that if you wanted to live biblically, you were persecuted and put to death, right, in most Western cultures for the past thousand years.

599
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,500
Maybe the last 500 it's eased up, right?

600
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,800
So isn't it interesting and ironic how there's a liberation of that punishment or penalty now?

601
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,020
Certainly.

602
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:25,340
But we're living in a time and place and admittedly, you know, my own experience is what I draw from aside from the scriptures.

603
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:42,060
But at the same time, we're talking about a collection of information that has been systematically and intentionally obscured from those that is presented to.

604
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,620
It's used as a tool of war.

605
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,920
It is used as a tool of subjugation.

606
00:48:50,520 --> 00:49:06,760
It is used as a tool in the temples of Eustacia here in the States where they ask you to place your hand upon this book that in this book specifically states to not idolize material objects.

607
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:22,160
And yet in presenting it in that way, they are asking you not only to place your hand upon this book, but to also make a vow to swear, which is also specifically verboten.

608
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:33,860
But it's specifically verboten in the New Testament where the Christ says to make no vows, to let your yes be yes and your no be no.

609
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:41,580
But at the same time, I want comprehension of what the Christ is saying there.

610
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,540
When he says to make no vow, it's very plain regardless of the language in which I read into it.

611
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,780
It is to make no vow, to make no pledge.

612
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:58,940
And here where I live in my locality, you sign your name for everything.

613
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,100
And in signing that name, it is taken as a vow, it is taken as swearing.

614
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,340
When you join the military, you vow, you swear.

615
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,960
When you join the judiciary, you vow, you swear.

616
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,680
When you join the police, you vow, you swear.

617
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,980
When you join anything…

618
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,520
Whatever…

619
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:20,980
So to one…

620
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,820
But Seth, I'm going to stop you for a moment.

621
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,780
What about appearing as a dove and being wise as a serpent?

622
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,440
Here, I'm going to share a little thing with people I've never shared before publicly.

623
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,720
I might have mentioned this to you.

624
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,900
I'll sign my name every day on anything you ever want me to sign.

625
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,920
People say, don't sign.

626
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,200
I'm like, I'll sign anything.

627
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,320
Well, have you ever seen a doctor's signature?

628
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,580
I'll sign anything void.

629
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,840
And you'll look at it and you'll be like, that looks like a scripture.

630
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,640
That looks like your signature, Greek.

631
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,600
But if I just tell you I just signed that void, you'll see, oh, shit.

632
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,860
I do see the dot over the eye.

633
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,500
Yeah, it is.

634
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,940
Now, why do I sign everything void?

635
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,680
Well, if I sign a traffic ticket void, I'll put in an affidavit.

636
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,940
I said, I signed that void because that is a farce on its face.

637
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,920
It's a legal farce.

638
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,380
There's no legal awful bearing.

639
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Why did you sign it void?

640
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,300
That's why.

641
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,560
And here's an affidavit on how I signed my name.

642
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,700
And here's an affidavit of evidence how I signed void.

643
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,820
And I'm signing all your stuff void because it's illegal.

644
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,160
Even you are in the legal system.

645
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:34,000
This got so bad at one point that people here in the local jurisdiction, whenever someone signed, they started asking, let me see your ID, how you really signed.

646
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,380
I mean, because it got out.

647
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,160
So that's your pure, you know, I'm not going to sign that traffic ticket.

648
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,720
Shit, I'll sign your traffic ticket.

649
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,620
I'll sign my traffic.

650
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,140
I'll sign everybody's traffic ticket.

651
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,040
It don't matter to me.

652
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,640
And everybody walks away happy.

653
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,820
But when it comes down to pouring a pound of flesh and blood, I'm like, oh, you can't, hold on, that's void.

654
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,380
That's been issued void.

655
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,640
Why?

656
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,400
They won't even get into why.

657
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,940
That's all unlawful stuff.

658
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,820
All those mortgages, checks, police tickets, contracts, everything is signed void.

659
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,520
Now, they don't scrutinize that.

660
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,940
You just scribble V-O-I-D, scribble it like a doctor's signature.

661
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,560
It looks like a signature.

662
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,340
I'll give you an example.

663
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:26,880
When the election was going on, I had to sign something, return something at a major store, and she said, you've got to sign for it.

664
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,500
And I just wrote void, of course.

665
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,440
And she looks at it and goes, what kind of signature, what does that say?

666
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,280
I said, it says Donald Trump, because it was a Mexican lady, you know.

667
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,860
A Mexican lady with a Hillary shirt on.

668
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,720
Oh, wow.

669
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
Because Donald Trump is this racist.

670
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,160
I'm not pro either one.

671
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,860
And I said, I'm going to get her in her face.

672
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,440
I said, what does that say?

673
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,780
It says Donald Trump, I told her.

674
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,640
And she was like, oh.

675
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,920
Because she had the Hillary.

676
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,760
I'm voting for Hillary.

677
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,300
So this goes back to what Sam was saying.

678
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,540
What do you say to who and what, right?

679
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,480
I mean, the woman at Home Depot or whatever is asking me, what does that say?

680
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,400
And I see she's got the Hillary shirt on.

681
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,220
I lean over and go, Donald Trump.

682
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,280
And she just jumped back three feet.

683
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,780
She's like, oh.

684
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,920
But if it says void and you're telling her that it says Donald Trump, that's, I mean, you're lying to her.

685
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,660
Yeah, but in a sense, it was she overstepped her bound.

686
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,900
Because nowhere in her instruction manual does it say she has to read signatures and make sure that they're official signatures.

687
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,840
Well, certainly, but someone else overstepping their bounds doesn't, I mean, it's a lie.

688
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:41,520
So did I lie to her, but maybe it was a lie worth telling to give her the shock of her life that day?

689
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,160
I suppose.

690
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,540
And I certainly wasn't lying under oath, right?

691
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:55,300
But anyway, the reason I brought that up is because one of the things for tonight was communication, right?

692
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,060
Certainly.

693
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,760
Absolutely.

694
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,380
Yeah, so will you communicate to what?

695
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,980
Why would you tell anyone you signed to Donald Trump when, well, you had to be there?

696
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,980
It's one of those things you had to be there.

697
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,400
A real cocky Latina woman with a Hillary shirt.

698
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,500
It's around the election.

699
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,560
And she's looking at a little bit beyond what is her pay scale, literally.

700
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,280
And I just had to, you know, I was just like, I just got to give this woman something she's going to remember, you know.

701
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,600
That's understandable.

702
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,120
It's just, what about, you know, not bearing false witness?

703
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,180
Yeah, well, no one asked me, did I witness that being Donald Trump's signature?

704
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,660
Anyway.

705
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,120
You just don't look at it, right?

706
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,260
Obviously, the whole thing was done in humor.

707
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,420
Bruce, I think you got it.

708
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,160
You got a pretty good laugh out of that.

709
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,420
Oh, God, yeah.

710
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,520
Yeah, because you can picture the situation, right?

711
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,940
I laughed as well as soon as you said that you signed void.

712
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,340
That's beautiful.

713
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,120
What about David at the gate?

714
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:03,700
Well, also, she's inquiring, and I'm noticing I'm going to use what she has interest in, which is the election, against her, you know, in a way she will never see it.

715
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,480
And, you know, she probably hasn't gotten a surprise like that ever, publicly like that.

716
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,120
So, but here's my point.

717
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,140
You have to have fun.

718
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,140
And what about David feigning being mad at the gate of the Philistines, right?

719
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,420
That's being as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove, right?

720
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,460
Well, certainly.

721
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:32,420
And I would completely and totally agree with you that on the aspect of signing void as…

722
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,060
Oh, yeah, because all this stuff is not even…

723
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,480
That's beautiful.

724
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,560
It's illegal.

725
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,380
All this stuff they're doing is not only unlawful.

726
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,660
It's illegal, according to their own laws, not because I say so.

727
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,680
According to their own laws, absolutely.

728
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,240
And that in and of itself is important.

729
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,160
Oh, yeah.

730
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,420
They've got it.

731
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,480
Here's the thing.

732
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,200
A lot of people get angry at other people and institutions and all that.

733
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,720
I'm like, if you only knew what they were going to get, you would just sit back quietly and just relish when it happens.

734
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,700
And even if it takes you out, it's okay.

735
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:10,480
Well, it's interesting that that's what you just said, because that's another one of the commandments…

736
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,440
Oh, yeah.

737
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,120
Don't do anything.

738
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:22,600
In the new – what they call the New Testament, given directly by the Christ, not commentary on his teaching or anything like that.

739
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:36,400
But supposedly the record that we have available to us as English speakers as what was written or what was said and then written is – that's another one of the commandments, is do not be angry.

740
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,700
Don't get angry.

741
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,160
Oh, no, no, no.

742
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:49,580
But you are packaged in a physical body that is quite ready to enable endorphins and adrenal glands and things to…

743
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,760
No, absolutely.

744
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:57,180
But it is overcoming that that makes us different than animals.

745
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,560
Well, that's discipline.

746
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,520
Well, it's the discipline of that, which is an interesting thing.

747
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:26,900
Because it's one of the things that I read recently and looked at the text and found that what is preserved in the English is different than even what is preserved in the Greek, is that in that sentence, the don't get angry without cause, the without cause is nonexistent in the Greek.

748
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,660
It's something that was added in by the quote-unquote translators in the English.

749
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:42,660
And what was added in in the Greek was from the Aramaic, which remember the Greek is a translation which is just as bad as what the English…

750
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,480
Is the Aramaic any better though?

751
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,200
Oh, yeah.

752
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,360
What the English does to the Greek is what the Greek did to the Aramaic.

753
00:57:50,360 --> 00:58:01,500
Okay, so the Aramaic being – is that what – because we've spoken before of the New Testament being actually preserved in the Hebrew.

754
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,980
No, it's not preserved that we have access to.

755
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,260
It's preserved that we have access to in the Greek.

756
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,300
In the Greek.

757
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,980
But it was originally written in Aramaic and Hebrew.

758
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,040
The Greek didn't start until the 2nd or 3rd century.

759
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,380
This is another – I'm going to jump topics.

760
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:35,320
I don't get into those kinds of discussions because people are so far removed from anything that even approaches this reality that going that way is like wanting to use a Formula One race car to go to the Walmart.

761
00:58:36,080 --> 00:59:01,340
Here's an interesting point, at least of interest to myself, perhaps to others, is that there is a phrase that even in the King James Version is memorialized in Hebrew that the Christ spoke from what the pagans would refer to as the cross and what I would call the almond tree.

762
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:07,840
And that phrase is Elie, Elie, lama, ha-sabachthani.

763
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,380
Why am I up here so long?

764
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:23,340
It literally would be Elie, Elie, which is my god, my god, lama, which is why even in modern Hebrew it's the same.

765
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:31,800
Elie, Elie, lama, ha-sabachthani, which would be why have you forsaken me?

766
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,560
My god, my god, why have you forsaken me?

767
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
Delayed me.

768
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,140
It's delayed me.

769
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:40,980
Ha-sabachthani.

770
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:56,270
But it's of interest to me because people speak of the Aramaic as being the language that is most likely to have been native to the Christ, Hamashiach, Yeshua.

771
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,870
And also of the area.

772
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,870
It was the language of Syria, Babylon, western India.

773
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,170
Yeah, absolutely.

774
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,730
And there is certainly credence to that.

775
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:32,410
But my question is then why upon his virtual execution by the Sanhedrin, why then would he speak out in Hebrew if the language that he taught in was Aramaic?

776
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:36,300
It was an Aramaic phrase.

777
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,900
Have you gotten it?

778
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,660
How did you glean that it's Hebrew?

779
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,560
Elie, Elie, lama, ha-sabachthani?

780
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:52,520
I gleaned that it's Hebrew because it is preserved in the text as being Hebrew.

781
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,180
Elie, Elie, lama, ha-sabachthani, that's a Hebrew phrase.

782
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,980
There's an interesting aspect.

783
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,500
If you look at it in Aramaic, it means why do you delay me here?

784
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,460
Why so long?

785
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,640
Not forsaken.

786
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,520
Why would it be recorded in Hebrew if it is an Aramaic phrase?

787
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,960
Because it's interesting that it wasn't.

788
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:24,540
What they've done back and forth, there was an aspect of writing it in Hebrew at one point.

789
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:34,520
But what they did in the Greek text, they went back and resolved Hebrew characters and Hebrew words in some of the early Greek texts.

790
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:41,860
And you will see that, I think there's fragments that have been found where you will see the father's name, the YHWH in Hebrew.

791
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:55,000
And any of those phrases that were put in the Greek text were typically lifted off Aramaic text but recorded in Hebrew.

792
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,140
But let's just look at the law for a moment.

793
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,940
He was never forsaken by the father.

794
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,180
Well, yeah, certainly.

795
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,200
What does forsaken mean?

796
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,680
I'll give you another example of how the play works.

797
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,160
When you look at the – what's son in Hebrew?

798
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,320
Ben, right?

799
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:19,840
Yeah.

800
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,740
But why do they use Bar Mitzvah all the time?

801
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,240
Bar is son, like Bar Abbas, son of the father, remember?

802
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,980
It's not Ben Abbas, it's Bar Abbas, you know, the man who was let go?

803
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,420
Yeah.

804
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:42,320
Okay, well, why do they use – see, so then when they switch to Hebrew and you use the Hebrew, it might as well switch to Greek also.

805
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:54,660
Like, for example, there is a mixture, for example, today in the Hebrew culture, they don't have a Ben Mitzvah, they have a Bar Mitzvah.

806
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,320
Why are they retaining Aramaic?

807
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,980
Why don't they say Ben Mitzvah to present, right?

808
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:12,000
So there's this mixture, and there was an idea that when the Greek texts were being put together, if they were to retain any of that, it should be written in Hebrew, in the ones that we see.

809
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:23,680
There are some records, for example, some of the popes wanted an inventory of their oldest texts.

810
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:35,840
This is a whole other study and a whole other four-hour conversation, but I need to dig in and give references so people can look it up if they can on the rectangle.

811
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,860
But whenever any of the popes – actually, there were two popes.

812
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:48,280
Do you know that one of the popes, by the way, just to stay on the subject, do you know that I think it was the fourth pope or the fifth pope of the Roman Catholic Church was a Torah-observing pope?

813
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,000
Did you know that?

814
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,720
He got a lot of crap for that in private.

815
01:03:53,120 --> 01:04:00,400
Admittedly, my knowledge of the history of the Catholic Church is certainly lacking.

816
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,380
Yeah, mine isn't, and I don't talk about it because I find them repugnant, which is disgusting.

817
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,180
I suppose that's why I haven't spent a lot of time studying it.

818
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:19,300
The reason I did is because there was one of the popes in the 1700s that asked a man – he was a scholar.

819
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,800
He was well-versed in Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Latin.

820
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:34,580
You couldn't get a more perfect fellow to go and get an inventory of what was in the Vatican repository and the oldest texts that they had going back as far as possible.

821
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:40,500
And he says, yeah, we've got a bunch of 1st century texts of Matthew and whatever, and they're all in Aramaic.

822
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:50,860
And then all of a sudden it jumps to the 2nd or 3rd century, there's a big gap, and all of a sudden we have some texts that are in Greek with Hebrew.

823
01:04:52,140 --> 01:05:05,760
But wait a second, the oldest ones that were from the 1st century were all Aramaic, and all of a sudden we jump 150 years to the next set, and it's Greek, or 200 years, let's say, and now it's Greek and Hebrew.

824
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,900
So how did it go from Aramaic to Greek and Hebrew?

825
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:10,460
Exactly.

826
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,600
So changing one letter makes a difference, and this is something that could be resolved.

827
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:27,840
If you look at that phrase that the Christ said before he gave up his spirit, right?

828
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:44,580
So the aspect of that in Aramaic, the definition is not forsaken, if you find a word very similar to that.

829
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:52,100
Just like you would find, for example, all of the mistakes in the New Testament by being well-versed in the law.

830
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:58,540
Like we know that Christ was never forsaken, not even a moment of that.

831
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:08,400
We know that he was the most evil, he had to have been resolved as the most evil person that ever lived, but never forsaken.

832
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,240
How do we know he was resolved as the most evil person who ever lived, by the Father?

833
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,060
Because he says he took all the sins of the world on him.

834
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:23,740
So that means that would make him the biggest sinner that ever lived, you see what I mean?

835
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,280
That, you can see, you could rationalize, but him being forsaken cannot be rationalized.

836
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:39,320
It's just like you can't rationalize that Christ was having a supper in the city with a leper, right?

837
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,020
Okay, so what you're saying is that...

838
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,480
There's a lot of things that can't be rationalized.

839
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:56,740
You're suggesting that he didn't say, that what he said was, why has it taken so long?

840
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,860
There's an Aramaic word, I'm not as well-versed as I should be to have this conversation.

841
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:11,800
I have to start looking at notes and splitting hairs and explain why the mistakes are the way they are in the Greek and the Hebrew resolution.

842
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,600
You know what I mean by resolution, how clear something is, versus what we could look at in the law and what was preserved in Aramaic.

843
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:25,820
In Aramaic, you're only going to find the first couple of books, maybe Matthew, Mark, and Luke, maybe.

844
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:31,680
Because Luke, you have to understand, was well-versed in Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic at the time.

845
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:43,740
And one thing that another study can be done, is that all the other books that you see in Scripture, especially around the contemporary writing of Paul, were not until 30 years after.

846
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:54,620
The only thing that was available as known as the New Testament up until the destruction of Jerusalem around mid-60s or so A.D., was the book of Matthew.

847
01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:04,620
And one strong clue of that is when you read, for example, Paul, and he quotes, he says, as it was written, and he's quoting directly from the book of Matthew.

848
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,000
He's not quoting from Mark, he's not quoting from Luke, he's not quoting from John.

849
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:14,760
He's stating as it was written, and he's giving accounts literally from the book of Matthew.

850
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:28,540
So the book of Matthew was the only book that was around for 30, you could stretch 40 years, and the rest of what you read, you know, Mark, Luke, and John, and the writings of Paul, were 30 years later.

851
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,200
So now you're looking at a...

852
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:45,800
Oh, I would say that common, I don't know, historians would say that it's around A.D. 70, that most of what they refer to as the New Testament was...

853
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,899
Sure, I'm being conservative, but that's a long time where you have one...

854
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:51,260
No, certainly, absolutely.

855
01:08:51,859 --> 01:09:05,439
And then all of a sudden, you have a movement that takes place near the end of the first century, that everything is up in the air.

856
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:14,240
Meaning, the very threat of Judaism becoming extinct is very possible, because a lot of people are catching on to what just happened.

857
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:15,760
Right?

858
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:32,060
And you have a lot of competent scribes, people with abilities, even though Jerusalem was destroyed, and they were scattered up until, let's say, the northwest part of the country there, there were still competent scholars and competent scribes to preserve these things.

859
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:48,240
A lot of people got involved, and if I say there were hundreds, if not thousands, of these texts put together, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the writings of Paul, by the end of the first century, mostly in Aramaic, and some Greek was coming out then, right?

860
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,380
And all that.

861
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:58,840
So, that's basically the history of it, but there is a Hebrew and Aramaic primacy to this.

862
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:18,020
I mean, there's so much history, but it's all blurred, because none of it can be confirmed, because what the best confirmation is, is if I tell you, Seth, you go five miles east, and you make a left, you're going to see a white building, there's something physically there, yet you can confirm it.

863
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:24,800
So the only confirmation we can have on these things now, other than what other people have written, is archaeological proof, or physical proof, right?

864
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,260
Certainly.

865
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:36,900
And would older texts being found and made public be considered archaeological proof?

866
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:43,760
Like, how does one study what is actually memorialized, if that's what one wants?

867
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:59,620
Well, what's interesting is, the Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, confirming that the delivered Masoretic text at a rate of about 99.5%, can be confirmed to the 2nd century B.C., is a big deal.

868
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,220
Like the Isaiah scroll.

869
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:03,580
Absolutely.

870
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:16,340
One can presume that if you looked at Genesis, if you found what you see in Hebrew, let's say in Genesis now, if you found a scroll that was 2,000 years old, it would say pretty much the same thing.

871
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,000
That's a very strong presumption.

872
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:28,780
So now, what's lacking in the New Testament is the presumption that how we have what we have is the real thing.

873
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,160
And I'm telling you it's not, other than it's what you've got.

874
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:41,300
But the Greek can almost be as accurate, or loosely accurate, as the King James.

875
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:53,660
You have to go back to the primacy of the Aramaic, and dare I say Hebrew, but not Hebrew put in with the Greek, as you have now in some little spots.

876
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,560
I'll give you another example.

877
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:11,460
There are writings where complete sets of the New Testament, or fairly complete sets of the New Testament, were discovered in the 1.5 centuries A.D., and were destroyed by rabbis because it had the sacred name in there.

878
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:18,820
And if it did not have the YHWH in there, they would have left them alone.

879
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,470
Because they viewed it as something...

880
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:37,060
Oh yeah, there's writings, Talmudic writings and historical, that they would capture these guys to get all their scrolls, and they would burn them, because they had the father's name in there.

881
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:43,480
And when you look in the modern text today, you see Theos in the Greek, you don't have any of that.

882
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:47,610
Yeah, Theos.

883
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:52,150
Yeah, so there's Archidios, which is Zeus.

884
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:59,970
Which just means it's a title like Lord, but to the Greeks, when you said Kidios, that was Zeus.

885
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,470
So, there's many levels to this.

886
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:07,030
What I'm curious about is...

887
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,790
See, what I focus on is prophecy.

888
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:12,090
If anyone's ever listened to Greek speak, I'm into prophecy.

889
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,730
And it's good to focus.

890
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:32,990
In the amount of time that's left, in the amount of lawfulness that has to be instilled or considered by humanity, in order for the kill shots to be lawful, because if the gods came and administered the kill shots, and no one knew what the hell was going on, or who was doing it, it would be unlawful.

891
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,970
You're going to have a bunch of sniveling humans at the resurrection.

892
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,110
Who's law, though?

893
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:42,210
Like lawful to El Shaddai?

894
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,330
Who's doing it?

895
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:45,410
Because remember, when you read...

896
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:45,550
Elohim?

897
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:59,350
Yes, when you read about the, let's say, the destruction of man's society, what they call apocalyptic literature from the Bible, who's doing the destruction?

898
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:02,130
Is it the good guys, the good Elohim, or the bad Elohim?

899
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,850
Is it the evil spirits, or the good spirits?

900
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,510
It's the good spirits that are doing it.

901
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:17,690
It's the good spirits, unless we're talking strictly about Revelation and viewing the horsemen or their equivalent as...

902
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,990
Remember, there's horsemen in Zechariah as well.

903
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,430
Everyone tends to forget those.

904
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:27,310
But their horsemen are always around.

905
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,270
That's another thing.

906
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,050
We should get into all these topics, right?

907
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:49,570
They could be viewed as being good, absolutely, and yet they're put in charge, or their contract is basically to eliminate X amount of humanity.

908
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:50,270
Right.

909
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:56,130
And by the way, the ones that remain are not necessarily special, either.

910
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,670
They're just a representative sample.

911
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,410
It's kind of like when you move horses in a trailer.

912
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:09,130
You don't want to put too many of them in there, because if they panic, they'll hurt each other.

913
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:13,290
So you want to limit their number so you could deal with them.

914
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:18,250
It's not that the gods can't come back now and manage society.

915
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:23,510
It's that there'll be so much of a panic that people will just start killing each other for no reason.

916
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:30,450
So at least if you have a slim, spaced out, minor population, they're easier to manage for their own good.

917
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,570
I mean, they could still be managed now, but anyway, that's a whole other speculation.

918
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:46,790
Yeah, but that's anthropomorphizing the logistical restrictions that we have based upon the physical constraints that we find ourselves in.

919
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:51,690
Subjecting the evolution to that seems absurd.

920
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,210
The gods do consider it.

921
01:15:53,210 --> 01:16:12,910
If they willed to take a trillion versus willing to take a thousand, it seems that they would just address it and do it as they willed as opposed to sticking to the constrictions of the arbitrary physical existence that we find ourselves in.

922
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,530
Sure, but you know what's interesting?

923
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:22,850
When you study the way the Elohim do things, and you study creation, you know, the natural world, they do work in accordance with it, right?

924
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:35,810
Like, for example, when they do things to mankind, why do they need to send a special, you know, how the Greeks would have a spear, an arrow, or a shield of Athena, something that unique to do the damage, why?

925
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,990
Why don't they just use the natural world?

926
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,510
Just send a flood over here.

927
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,490
Just send fire down over here.

928
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:44,390
It makes sense that they would use the natural world.

929
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:48,470
They don't have to send a special envoy or a special unique object.

930
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,950
Certainly, but at times they do.

931
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,810
I mean, there's a lot, right?

932
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:54,430
They send a special envoy, it's a lot.

933
01:16:54,430 --> 01:17:01,790
Oh, no, I mean, like, and also what was used was a natural element, you know, to do it.

934
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,970
It wasn't anything very unique.

935
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:10,910
So once you understand that they work within the physical realm, but here, we've gotten off the subject.

936
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:22,590
The point is, how much of the New Testament, what's known in the New Testament, is going to be revealed to humanity, and it's true, let's say, how its intent, whether its intent intact, right, to humanity.

937
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:32,770
So they lawfully understand who the Christ is, right, because they will, right, for a short time, and then they're going to, you know, turn away from it, right?

938
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:50,490
So that's the main curiosity that I have is how much validation or verification of the true identity of the Messiah or the Christ in typical English-speak colonialism do people have to know about?

939
01:17:50,490 --> 01:18:06,750
Well, I would speculate highly that the current J-E-S-U-S character and religion that's formed under that will have to go away, because it was totally in conflict with the scriptural one, the biblical one, and the historical one, right?

940
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:20,750
So, in other words, at this point, I can only speculate on the events coming in the future that either directly or indirectly are a product of, you know, real knowledge of the New Testament, right?

941
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,590
Right, certainly.

942
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:28,010
I suppose I'm just kind of grasping at what is there.

943
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:43,330
Like I see, you know, a fruit that I would like to partake of, you know, and that's, I suppose, a multi-sided metaphor.

944
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:49,010
Well, the thing like with Sam, do the best with what you've been given, right, first.

945
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:55,010
Right, certainly, but at the same time, it's like if you were given a piece of information,

946
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:04,670
and this piece of information could benefit a number of other people, and you share this information with them,

947
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:10,530
and they shrug it off, you know, that's on them, but what if the information that you were given,

948
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:18,710
that you were sharing with people is wholly inaccurate or completely falsified or, you know,

949
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,010
what's the stuff that's really good for growing flowers?

950
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:22,970
Bullshit.

951
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:23,110
Right.

952
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,710
Well, what if that happens?

953
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:30,090
I mean, that's part of the mix until the time is right.

954
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:41,090
But what I'm suggesting here is there's going to be a time where there will only be accurate, precise information, and only enough where then mankind can be lawfully considered to go to the next level.

955
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:57,950
No, absolutely, and not only do I comprehend that, I understand it, but at the same time, if at the same time we're not in that time currently, then grasping – are we grasping at straws here?

956
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:02,890
It's like I try to observe the beast, I try to observe the time of day.

957
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:30,550
If you ask a random person on the street what day is it, you know, like, but at the same time, so if everything that is being shared is false, and all of humanity is under a delusion, being intentionally deceived, I would say that we are, to one aspect or another, everyone is shared – there is false information shared so profusely at this point in time.

958
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:32,970
But it's nothing different.

959
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:40,670
This is what is the fulfillment of the Gentiles, the nations, you know, all the various sons of gods and all the deities is still around.

960
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:53,490
But what I'm suggesting, and I have for the past few years, is starting in 2018 in the spring, in the next seven years, is the precursor to the formation of the final power structure of mankind on Earth.

961
01:20:54,010 --> 01:21:07,810
And within this next seven years is also the precursor and the introduction to the lawfulness that's required for mankind to know, just like when the Christ said, this will be preached and then I will return, that time has not yet come.

962
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:34,510
But the deception, what you see now, actually, I think, what I see is the very fact that things that people held true, in many ways, is starting to either be sloughed off as not important, or starting to be rejected by a few, is just laying the groundwork for more things to be rejected and more things to be considered untrue.

963
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:44,450
And then there will be an amount of lawfulness accepted and acknowledged by people, and then it's all going to swing the other way, right?

964
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:50,790
Then the major deception, because when you read scripture, it's not about you, it's about the gods.

965
01:21:51,290 --> 01:22:01,510
So when they tell you there's a deception, it's not, you know, you're being deceived by the taxing authorities, or your mom, or the doctor, it's being deceived regarding what subject?

966
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,170
Regarding the gods.

967
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,730
Certainly.

968
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:09,850
I would say that if you were reading scripture, that it does pertain to you.

969
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:30,210
I mean, if you have access to this information, be it, you know, if it's set in front of you, or if it's shoved down your throat when you're younger, having access to this information, having access to any information incurs a responsibility.

970
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:39,350
Even if that responsibility is simply choosing to accept or reject that information, you know?

971
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:41,410
Water is good for you, okay.

972
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,670
Water is good for you, or water is bad for you, you know?

973
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:51,050
I mean, that's a choice, but what it seems, and I suppose something that I struggle with personally,

974
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:58,970
is that if all of the information that is being presented is false, or based upon false information one way or the other,

975
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:08,470
then the idea of choice, the idea of responsibility, both of those ideas, things that make us what we are,

976
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:15,810
as opposed to just another animal on this planet, very, very, they're lessened.

977
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:34,210
And there is inquiry, but if the inquiry is answered with half-truths, or information that is based upon false things, then there is no choice between right and wrong, unless you pull that back to the instinct.

978
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:40,910
And if it's all simply instinct, then we are no different than the animals, but we have eyes.

979
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:45,110
A simple way to say it is, you've been underwater.

980
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,510
Okay, that's fine.

981
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,590
I've been underwater.

982
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,950
You ever try reading a book or inquiring on information and studying underwater?

983
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:56,010
You'd be like, you know, dude, that sounds kind of like arduous.

984
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:58,710
Let's go up to the surface and dry off.

985
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:02,290
You're living in the age of the Piscean, the fish.

986
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,790
You're underwater.

987
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,010
You might as well, everyone might as well have gills.

988
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,450
The deluge seems to be of information currently.

989
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,750
But it's no, well, yes, but it's not information about the gods yet.

990
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:20,370
It is a little bit, I've been saying for years, there'll be more attention in that direction.

991
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,830
It won't be any accuracy or precision, but at least you're being set up.

992
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:32,730
Just like with 9-11, everyone was set up for 30 years that the Arabs are terrorists, even though there were no Arabs involved, unless they just happened to be around, right?

993
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:36,910
Oh, yeah, way back when Arafat was in the news and things like that.

994
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:39,870
I grew up with that image in my mind.

995
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:44,790
And they created Al-Qaeda in 1996 with the Khobar Towers being nuked and all that.

996
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,290
But here's the thing.

997
01:24:47,050 --> 01:25:06,010
Right now, from video games all the way to the man on the street to anything, there's talk about just the very fact that there being a caliphate-based army, ISIS or whatever that's religious-based, is enough to get people focusing on what's called spirituality.

998
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:32,350
And that focus then, once the entire category is established where people no longer balk at, well, they're doing that for religious purposes, when that becomes normal, then the other stuff starts to get injected in, which is going to lead the next seven years, basically, to watch.

999
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:50,830
But the interesting thing, okay, let me just sum up what I have to say, I think, based on the intent or the sentiment of what you're trying to bring forward, is the reason why there's so much deception and all this other stuff are several.

1000
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:53,350
And many of them are obvious, many of them are not.

1001
01:25:53,450 --> 01:26:08,530
So the ones that are not obvious is that in classical human education, when you deal with a master, the master will deliberately deceive you to see if you've learned the lesson.

1002
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:13,470
This is done in martial arts, for example, with samurai training and things like that, right?

1003
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:31,970
So what's going on right now is there's never been a time where, like I was mentioning earlier, if you were out in public a thousand years ago saying that you want to observe biblical feasts anywhere in the world, pretty much, you would be killed for that, as a witch or as a heretic, right?

1004
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:35,650
Especially in the Western European society.

1005
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,630
So now that's not true.

1006
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:44,070
But you've got really poor quality versions, but you know what?

1007
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:52,070
How difficult is it to grab an interlinear with inquiry and start getting a pretty firm handle on this?

1008
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:54,310
It's not that difficult, really.

1009
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:58,050
So the intent here is, yeah, is there deception?

1010
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:58,870
But so what?

1011
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:01,810
That just means the master is getting closer and closer.

1012
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,290
And here's the other thing.

1013
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:13,010
The malevolent spirits, even the great adversary, is still doing marching orders from the Most High.

1014
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,410
I know it's kind of hard for people to believe that.

1015
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:19,070
No, that's a very important point to make, actually.

1016
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,430
Something I've asked you in passing.

1017
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,010
It's been quite a while.

1018
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:28,310
There's time that has passed.

1019
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:46,150
But is that our – everything, everyone is a servant of the Most High, whether they are doing it willingly, unwillingly, think that they are – what do they call themselves currently?

1020
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:47,730
The Satanists?

1021
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:50,430
The secular humanists and things like that?

1022
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:59,630
Everyone, all things, all time, all occurrence, everything is a servant of the Most High.

1023
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:01,270
I wouldn't say direct.

1024
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:12,090
When you read scripture, by the way, that is a more direct, poignant – that is focused on a certain group of people.

1025
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:23,170
So when you understand that the scriptures are focused on a certain group of people, and then within there, there's a servant mentioned, that would be more like a servant in someone's house.

1026
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:27,490
Just like the metaphor of a house is given consistently in scripture, right?

1027
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:33,610
But what I'm suggesting is that entire creation is under the control of the Creator.

1028
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:39,340
There is no rogue spirit running around that is all-powerful.

1029
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:50,330
There are rogue spirits running around, yes, but they're not all-powerful, and they could be shut down in a nanosecond if the Creator wanted to.

1030
01:28:50,330 --> 01:29:04,990
But their ability to interfere with the Creator – and I mean interfere as in to get in the way of or to change the direction of something – that doesn't exist.

1031
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,350
No, it doesn't exist.

1032
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:06,790
That's right.

1033
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:17,370
So anything that they do or anything that they can cause to happen by rote would be the will of the Creator.

1034
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:18,090
By allowance.

1035
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:26,770
Well, it doesn't even have to be direct allowance, but He already knows what's going to happen, so you could loosely say by will.

1036
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:28,210
And I do.

1037
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:34,230
I'm certainly using the term loosely, but I don't know if it's important.

1038
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:55,610
It's an interesting thing to me to realize or to have that lightbulb, that euphemistic lightbulb, that if the El Shaddai, if the Most High, is omnipresent or – what is the word they use?

1039
01:29:58,370 --> 01:29:59,090
Omnipotent.

1040
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,150
Omnipotent is all-powerful.

1041
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,650
Omniscient is all-knowing.

1042
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:03,250
Omnipresent, everywhere.

1043
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,610
That's why when you read Scripture, it's the only…

1044
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:06,750
Go ahead.

1045
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:07,190
I'm sorry.

1046
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:10,470
It's the only thing you could read where the author is always present, right?

1047
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,210
Right.

1048
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:12,470
Yes.

1049
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:30,470
If that is the case, then we as a people are missing the concreteness, the heaviness, the weight that there is to that point, and that being that all are serving whether they are acknowledging it or not.

1050
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:33,670
Yeah, but there's different levels too of servants, right?

1051
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,650
Certainly.

1052
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:43,770
Well, and within that, I don't mean to remove free will or choice from the equation, because that is our experience.

1053
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:48,110
That is – we have our will, and we are able to live up to it.

1054
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:54,810
But thinking that that will is outside of what is possible through the Creator would be false.

1055
01:30:54,810 --> 01:31:01,310
Well, a simple way to say it is that for people that think that it's all free will, it's not.

1056
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:02,890
They're going to be in surprise.

1057
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:09,030
And for people that think that there is no free will, well, they're going to be in surprise in how much free will they actually had.

1058
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:09,770
Right.

1059
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:21,990
You see, so there's a middle – it's just like when I come out and I say about creation and evolution, both what you hear about creation is wrong, and what you hear about evolution is wrong, so there is no side.

1060
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:23,050
Right.

1061
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:28,990
So I'm kind of one of these oxymoronic – that's why they're morons and then they're oxymorons, right?

1062
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,730
– about all this stuff that's going on.

1063
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,730
I see the moot point.

1064
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,230
Another thing is economics.

1065
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:41,330
It's echo comics, because there is no money.

1066
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:42,230
What are they talking about?

1067
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:42,730
What economy?

1068
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:43,730
It's all credit, right?

1069
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,610
So it's echo comics, not economics.

1070
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,290
There's nothing new to address.

1071
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,550
People say, what do you think of cryptocurrency or the economy?

1072
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,030
What economy?

1073
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:50,750
It's credit, man.

1074
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:54,250
You've got these creatures called attorneys and government agencies.

1075
01:31:54,810 --> 01:32:01,790
They were all in a panic earlier today, just following what little news there is.

1076
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:08,570
They were all in a panic today, and then they were not, and it was echo comical to watch.

1077
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:09,890
Echo comical, yeah.

1078
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:14,110
It's all ridiculous, and the thing is set apart.

1079
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:16,090
It's a planet full of assholes.

1080
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:20,570
Sorry to use that physically, not to derogatory that part of the body that preserves…

1081
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,310
It's useful.

1082
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,350
It has a very natural function.

1083
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:33,990
If anybody is listening to this somehow and they're cruising in their star cruiser, just go hang out at Saturn or Mars or the Moon.

1084
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:35,550
Don't even bother.

1085
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,130
There's nothing going on here.

1086
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,990
Not until later.

1087
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:43,450
Certainly.

1088
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:51,570
On the back of the Moon, yeah, turn around is your last chance before you go into oxymorons and oxymorons.

1089
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:52,310
That's all you got.

1090
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:56,290
And it's shameful.

1091
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:58,830
I say I'm ashamed to be called human.

1092
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:05,490
That's because you've observed what humans do.

1093
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:09,010
All of them, with very little exception.

1094
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:13,250
I mean, the exceptions are so small that statistically it's irrelevant.

1095
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:20,090
And by the way, if anyone's hearing this and you have problems in your life, it's not you.

1096
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,770
It's the people around you.

1097
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:22,130
Sorry.

1098
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:32,550
And I'm taking a presumption that you're inquiring on what's right and what's wrong, which is, you know, it's pretty safe not to just be a contraire, but it's the opposite.

1099
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:40,430
I would almost proffer my own experience as adding to the credence of what you just said.

1100
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:48,210
Yeah, and all these, it's funny because they have these life coaches and gurus and psychologists and spiritualists telling you, oh, it's you.

1101
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,510
It's your outlook.

1102
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:50,790
No, it's sorry.

1103
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,170
You'll find out.

1104
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,750
You'll be surprised about that later.

1105
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,290
So, just hold tight.

1106
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:58,130
Again, can you read underwater?

1107
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:59,670
You're underwater.

1108
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:02,330
It's not a good thing.

1109
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:03,410
But you know what is good?

1110
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:09,190
Getting up in the middle of the night to go get a drink of water and not stubbing your toe on the chair.

1111
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,330
That's good.

1112
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,150
Dogs, man.

1113
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:14,210
Dogs are good.

1114
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:22,170
I really enjoy the company of dogs, be it mine or any that I run into on the street.

1115
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:26,790
Well, the animal intelligence is something that I appreciate by the minute.

1116
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:30,610
It grows every minute for the past two decades or decade and a half.

1117
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:36,550
The more I inquire about reality, the more I appreciate the animal intelligence.

1118
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:47,630
Well, it appears that at one time, that's what we experienced ourselves.

1119
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:52,350
Well, here, this is again the salient point.

1120
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:56,410
We're open almost 100% input, we have to be told.

1121
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:59,530
But the animals, where do they get their spirit?

1122
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:04,170
So they're getting some kind of quote-unquote divine download.

1123
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:10,430
If you want to witness how the divinity works when they work directly through something, look at an animal.

1124
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,210
Well, who taught a bird its song?

1125
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:29,950
Well, there's a lot of equation throughout the equation and equivalence to gods represented in the animal form.

1126
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:38,550
Not just in places like Egypt, but throughout the Greeks.

1127
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:49,270
Well, what you're witnessing is what I mean by download is who taught them how to do what they do.

1128
01:35:50,210 --> 01:36:02,430
It's download, so it's like getting the computer with the operating system and all that and the program already pre-downloaded without you interfering, without the human question enabling it, you see.

1129
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:03,970
Yeah, certainly.

1130
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:11,150
So if you really want to see what the gods are up to, go see, be a little Dr. Dolittle if you want.

1131
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:15,150
Check out the animals and who taught them what they do.

1132
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:18,970
I mean, I know there's a school of fish, but there's…

1133
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:28,590
There was a contentious moment in chat earlier actually where we were talking about there being mean dogs.

1134
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:31,370
I was saying that there are not mean dogs.

1135
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:33,410
There are dogs that have been taught to be mean.

1136
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:35,610
And insecure.

1137
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:37,430
There are feral dogs.

1138
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:51,830
There are wild dogs that are acting purely on instinct, but there are also domesticated dogs that have been taught that if you show me a domesticated dog that is mean, I will show you a person that should probably not be allowed to have in their possession dogs.

1139
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:53,230
Sure.

1140
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:57,430
Yeah, improper use of a tool, let's say, if the dog is mean.

1141
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:01,130
Yeah, and also maybe that dog feels like he's unemployed.

1142
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,630
Dogs always have to feel like they're doing something.

1143
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:04,690
They're a pack animal.

1144
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:11,290
So anyway, I think we've been burning up the bits and the bites and all that enough for tonight.

1145
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:17,170
I don't know how much can be gleaned off of all these hours of talk.

1146
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,510
Hopefully something.

1147
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:25,130
Well, I apologize if I got into my own personal pursuits and whatnot.

1148
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:25,910
That's fine.

1149
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,010
There's others similar.

1150
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:33,010
Save it for a time where there didn't seem to be a particular subject being discussed.

1151
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,350
But yeah, thanks for your time, Greg.

1152
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,150
I appreciate it.

1153
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:37,970
No sweat.

1154
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,030
And thanks, Bruce, and anyone who cares to listen to this.

1155
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:44,830
I don't think any of it should be listened to by anyone.

1156
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:48,370
So listen to this stuff at your own risk.

1157
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:53,210
And I guess that's the only disclaimer I could come up with at the moment.

1158
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:59,230
Well, I want to thank you both and Sam also.

1159
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,230
And we had 27 listeners on the stream tonight at peak.

1160
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:06,370
And so the word is getting out there.

1161
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:08,710
Oh, yeah.

1162
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:09,010
Okay.

1163
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:12,630
If we talk about politics and Bitcoin, maybe we'll get 5,000, right?

1164
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:15,570
The dummy load, right?

1165
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:17,090
Yeah.

1166
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:17,650
Yeah.

1167
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,290
It's just bizarre.

1168
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:19,850
Yeah.

1169
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:20,610
Okay.

1170
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:22,750
Interesting subjects as all.

1171
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:27,790
Yeah, there's so little.

1172
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:35,670
Here's the interesting thing about tearing down and building and all that other stuff that is part of the reality.

1173
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:37,990
I don't think there's anything.

1174
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:41,730
To me, I see no value in building or breaking down or whatever.

1175
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:49,970
If I just skate through till my last breath, I'll be totally successful because there's nothing else to do.

1176
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:52,050
I'm just watching this madness.

1177
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:58,770
So anyway, just guys, be safe and whatever.

1178
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:00,250
Thanks again.

1179
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:01,750
Well, again, thanks for your time.

1180
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:02,930
I appreciate it.

1181
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:06,410
Thanks for letting me come on and join into the conversation.

1182
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:06,890
Sure.

1183
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:08,350
And I've gotten lots of private messages.

1184
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,950
People were interested in having you on again.

1185
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:12,190
So thank you for doing that.

1186
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:13,690
All right.

1187
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:14,370
Well, good night.

1188
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:15,110
Good night, Bruce.

1189
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:15,730
Good night, Seth.

1190
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:16,490
Good night, everyone else.

1191
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,210
Good night, both of you.

1192
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:17,710
Be well.

1193
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:19,550
And good night, folks.

1194
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:21,990
And be well, all of you.
