1
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,410
And tonight we got myself and Greek.

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,170
Hey man.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,530
All right.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,670
And how are you doing tonight sir?

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,050
Oh doing okay actually I'm trying to get set up here so we can do the sonic event.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,190
Really need some coffee and some smokes and kind of get it ready and talk about whatever.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,070
See if anyone's got any questions and you know this is becoming an unregular regular thing.

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:36,670
Right.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,870
So I don't know what are you writing.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,370
It's good to know that we can that we can do this on the fly anytime we want.

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,630
And yeah that's good for that.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:58,190
There's no rigorous scheduling and all that kind of stuff and if people want it you can always grab it off the server.

13
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,010
Right if it's how's that working by the way for everyone so far?

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:16,810
It seems to be going good no negative feedback other than that I mislabeled a couple of files so they weren't available but we remedied that straight away.

15
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,330
Okay.

16
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,950
Other than that nothing negative a lot of positive you know thankfulness and such which is always welcomed.

17
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,810
So that was a positive thing.

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:31,730
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,390
Yeah.

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,450
Okay good.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,230
So what's on anybody's mind?

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,650
Anybody got anything they want to mull around or just do a little bit of Greek speak?

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,370
Seems that we just started and we got that 20 second or so delay.

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,570
Nothing yet appearing but whatever is on your mind is always welcomed.

25
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,170
Hmm.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,070
I'll just start off with I had a

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,290
conversation with someone recently on a telephone bringing up a few things and

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,450
and it was like a little conference call and I got a little overheated about what

29
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,910
I was saying and they pretty much said well you're attacking our whole society

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,270
I'm like well I don't think that society is worth attacking you know I'm just

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,090
saying like what's what's wrong you know you people are always complaining you

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,950
know the typical human garbage you know that they talk about and I said well

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,630
look you don't even know how to keep time you don't know how the body works

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,630
you know you actually millions of you every day go sit down and get blood

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,210
pressure taken and none of you are the wiser to see that it's a prank right and

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:41,010
you're being pranked with told that your body absorbs oh your body absorbs stuff

37
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,970
and on and on and on you know how the money system works you know if everybody

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,610
says oh money's based on nothing so when they transfer money when you write

39
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,430
a check and it goes from one account to other how's it done what's really going

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,830
on I don't care I don't want to know one guy said it's really funny he says

41
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,250
basically thinks we're all just a bunch of animals I said well yeah pretty much

42
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,650
yeah and expect that they were thinking I was gonna defend that you know yeah

43
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,630
but you know that then that speaks poorly of the animals it's a very

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,450
strange animal and humans by the way or man kind womankind are not animals

45
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,630
that's another interesting thing that can be gone over it's something that

46
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,410
requires some thought not a lot of thought to see what what I just said is

47
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,630
true the other thing is that this is this environment meaning the the social

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,490
environment humanity at large there's no such thing as atheistic or secular

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,670
everything is based on some kind of deific model or archetype or really quick

50
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,810
you know for example you know if you have a secular which means not religious

51
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,790
and by the way all religions in the world bar none are pagan or atheist based you

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,450
know what there's no no real God there because they can't identify it right now

53
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,970
the ones that can identify gods are steeped in pagan ritual so this is the

54
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,430
almost without exception in terms of it from an organizational reality what is

55
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,090
going on on this planet and you combine that these various archetypal realities

56
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,769
that exist with the basic piss-poor human character that you see and that's a

57
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:22,170
cocktail for slow-moving disaster right but nonetheless when you go back to

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,710
nothing being secular like for example a scientist you know half the

59
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,350
terms that they use come from mythological gods or you know gods that

60
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,010
are dead you know if you heard like electron right that's you know or

61
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,310
volcano from the god Vulcan yeah so you know or what about the my favorite is

62
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,370
the idiots in the legal society the justice system that is the revived

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,530
goddess religion they don't know anything about law I don't wanna bring

64
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,590
this up is really funny someone was recently offering a law book collection

65
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,690
and says was my grandfather's law books and he practiced for almost 50 years and

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,050
they're all in perfect condition I said well of course they would be in perfect

67
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,390
condition because he never opened any of them he doesn't need to know what's in

68
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,250
there to practice law as an attorney all he needs to do is know how to accuse

69
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,430
people right anyway he's kind of a bad joke but it's true it's true yeah I dare

70
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,610
any you go to any doctor's office or law lawyer's office or attorney's office

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,030
and they have all these books you know I just take one off the shelf it's like

72
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:37,490
super crisp and clean they don't need those days of school and even then even

73
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,950
in school they don't they only touch the textbooks yeah which are whatever they

74
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,570
did your garbage now I was thinking by the way at one point of doing a

75
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,230
discussion which is somewhat of a loose study on how you're being pranked by the

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,210
medical system by looking at what instructions they give in their

77
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,450
universities like Harvard Med School and downstate medical not some local

78
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,190
community college I'm talking about I'm talking about you know the pinnacle and

79
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,670
also showing how you're being pranked by the legal society by going to you know

80
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,170
Yale Law School and all that in Princeton law and showing you their

81
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,330
curriculums very simple I was like yeah why am I doing this because all I do

82
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,170
with this is you know bring up a medical school university curriculum from

83
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,110
undergraduate to graduate just it just lists all the courses and it gives

84
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,230
course descriptions and the same with the medical the same with the scientists the

85
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,250
same with the physicists and you just look at all this and keep in the back

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,830
of your mind does what there is what they're giving in their curriculum as

87
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,370
part of the instruction institutional instruction to get what's called a

88
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,150
degree have any bearing on the field itself as we consider the field to be

89
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:53,910
and the answer to that is no no it doesn't so and it's very simple I mean

90
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,390
you know the common moron will say oh yes it is that's what you do and but I

91
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,950
said well look at it look what they're teaching this has nothing to do with the

92
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,430
human body live that's alive it's you know it's interesting to bounce around

93
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,010
to the medical idiots when you look at their curriculums and more on the

94
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,810
graduate level it's all cadaver dissection oh that's fine if you're

95
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,950
going to be working on cadavers your rest your life where you're not you get

96
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,110
and you're getting alive but you know this is it's a bad joke you know

97
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,550
somewhere in scripture it says it was a just to really hasten the quote here

98
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,510
it's let the dead bury the dead so just because we're walking around doesn't

99
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,390
really mean they're really alive and the medical community is trying to tell

100
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,010
you that and the same with the legal perfection of the profession the same

101
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,410
with most of the professions that people aspire to as being professional and what

102
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:50,390
does this surmise everything down to various levels of pranking and so that's

103
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,730
the that's the interesting part but the other interesting part is there's

104
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,570
nothing really secular what I mean by that is you know everything that you

105
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,830
look at in any language when you start going into the let's see what they call

106
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,610
the professional aspects or the sciences or the various disciplines you will see

107
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,010
the terms that are being used and the metaphors and and even the names are

108
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,470
based on ancient gods throughout you know and so how are they saying well I'm

109
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,010
secular and you know and I'm not religious well it's kind of like that's

110
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:36,049
the schizophrenic part that comes in when you're creating a so morticians mm-hmm

111
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:45,030
guys that guys that don't know shit and can alter your life within a second you

112
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:52,950
know with or without their stupidity and it just goes on worse yeah but

113
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,210
ultimately it'll be like no one put a gun to your head to go to them exactly

114
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,810
exactly yeah yeah but they put a gun to your head if you try to do what they

115
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,410
resemble you know if you give me an example if law wasn't let's just look at

116
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,750
it this way let's just side bend the secular there's no such thing as any

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,630
secular it's all really some kind of spiritual deific behind it we sidetracked

118
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,790
that for a second if the society let's say the authorities of any society were

119
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,670
concerned about being lawful wouldn't they teach law to everyone like in

120
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,790
scripture isn't there I think I don't know if it's an exodus or numbers or

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,890
Deuteronomy where they're told to put up some large pillars of stone and

122
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,470
plaster them and write the name the words of the law on it so as the people pass

123
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,110
through they all are aware of it because you know they're promoted right well

124
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,830
they used to know how much proclamations and oh that's a that's a long ritual yes

125
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,310
and now the the morons that are supposedly in the legislative body say

126
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,490
they don't even read it and why because it doesn't matter no you don't have to

127
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,610
read it you just have to know what they're telling you is going on on

128
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,610
television you know like you know a bunch of 19 Arab hijackers with box

129
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,110
cutters made the World Trade Center turn into dust right so I mean that's all you

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,110
need to know so I mean it's ridiculous so and then you go to the if there if

131
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,970
they wanted you to know about health or how the body works they would be

132
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,690
teaching that you would have buildings designed for that yeah yeah more than

133
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,170
the ones that are there to take care of you being sick you think that the

134
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,090
opposite would be true and they wouldn't be poisoning you through food

135
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:39,530
yeah right I think that's a whole different sector there the agricultural

136
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:47,950
community which has been inundated by corporations and all sorts of stuff was

137
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,930
that you beeping I go ahead and say something Bruce I'm saying I'm talking

138
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,550
one two three one two three four you got there we go there we go yep I got a copy

139
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,030
cuz I'm wireless so let's see if I figure better oh that was cute little

140
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,910
tones and it sounded like radar or echo did it okay

141
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,190
yeah thanks actually I'm doing a little bit of weather work and it tends to

142
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:27,660
really put a bubble around the area oh my oh you just you just want away there

143
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,320
yeah you all right how's that I'm much better

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,620
okay let's you know sudden one dead air and a couple little beeps and you're

145
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:49,920
gone that should be better okay yeah so these are the various basic basics of

146
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,480
examining a society you don't need to contemplate much on this earth right

147
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,880
now well even a slight meditation on the subject boy what an eye-opener after you

148
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,320
start really really taking a look around and just refreshing yourself on the

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,220
words and things boy what an eye-opener mm-hmm now here's another thing I want

150
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,920
to bring out which I haven't I think it'd be good to start speaking even more

151
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,520
plainly because you know the five or ten people listen to this already got

152
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,780
or I should say have established some foundation on on things so when I say

153
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,620
you know they're it's pranking they know what I'm referring to and things

154
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,080
like that so most of people listening this established a foundation on the

155
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,400
real reality versus the reality that people are told over and over which

156
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,220
doesn't exist so and from that point of view you see the contradictions you

157
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,200
know the and you know from being mild contradictions to just major lies that

158
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,440
are ridiculous because they're so in your face and no one really sees them

159
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,800
that it makes it just a ridiculous situation so now you have to manage how

160
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,440
you are going to think amongst the spiritual turmoil right this mind

161
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,620
turmoil right and let me just throw this in again you know the spirit is the mind

162
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,660
usually when you use the word mind it's what you're mindful I like to use the

163
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,920
word spirit which is the actual in the component of you but when I say mine

164
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,300
sometimes I mean that is what you're just focusing on at the moment like

165
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,380
being mindful of something right never see like I got to go mind this mind the

166
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,840
dog mind whatever so so it's still part of the spirit but the best way to be

167
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,320
mindful about you know how you're going to interact with all this stuff I have

168
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,760
found out and personally in the past decade believe it or not I'm gonna say

169
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,620
this it's gonna sound strange in the beginning and it might just but it might

170
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,660
if you let it sink in you'll see how it works okay are you still there Bruce yes

171
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,500
I was muted I was listening oh that's fine we're still on okay so how do you

172
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,780
make sense of all this craziness because you know it's not some let me just put

173
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,540
it again in perspective reassessing who was around you constantly you know

174
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,940
whether it's people at work pedestrians family members friends you know it

175
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,820
doesn't matter they they're you'll see that when you start operating on a core

176
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,180
level people are pretty much all the same whether they're related to you or

177
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,220
not and it went into what we're discussing here is when you grab a

178
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,900
foundation on what's really going on you'll see the turmoil and then you're

179
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,740
like how do I manage this you know and in my mind or spirit right and what

180
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,120
again just to repeat myself I'm going to just say this is how it's done and how

181
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,420
I've had great success with it very simple you must understand prophecy why

182
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,580
like in other words you must understand what comes next in all of this why

183
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,680
because if you're steeped in all of this ridiculousness and then you throw in

184
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,660
without even thinking about it you know it exists but you don't think about it

185
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,420
the the the possibility and probabilities of all the randomness you

186
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,480
know how many times you hear well you don't know you might just walk outside

187
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,540
and an asteroid hits you in the head or you might trip and fall you know you

188
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,500
right so yeah so when you when you factor in how ridiculous everyone is and

189
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,580
the randomness of everything you know it's very difficult to maintain peace

190
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,640
and harmony actually you have to work on it more than anything you know it's kind

191
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,200
of like a tightrope now between the insanity and non insanity so the easiest

192
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,160
way to manage that is to use to have a handle on what's coming in the future so

193
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,900
now when you see for example something in the news or what people are talking

194
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,040
about you knew it was coming already right you see so it's no big deal so you

195
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,320
start minimizing the randomness like for example if you lay out a whole bunch of

196
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,520
an ingredients and just mouth off you know profiteroles you know roast

197
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,540
potatoes and whatever whatever a whole bunch of dishes to an expert chef he's

198
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,220
like all right I'm gone all right I got it you know let's do it and he's pretty

199
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,520
much gonna enjoy it but if you go to like a common American whatever that you

200
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,460
used to microwaving food you put all the ingredients in your mouth off a bunch of

201
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,140
dishes to make that person is in extreme panic they don't know where to start

202
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,820
they don't even know basically how to turn the fire the heat on and so I mean

203
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,640
yes yeah they're gonna be they have no because it's totally outside of their

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,040
scope and and in both cases it's very similar the total clueless person who

205
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,340
can't prepare basically you know hard-boiled egg has to create a

206
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,000
knowledge base and even with the knowledge base they don't know how it's

207
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,900
going to turn out where the the skilled chef he's done it before and he sees

208
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,600
the you know if he they know that they have a sensibility and sensitivity on

209
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,120
their actions whatever they do will affect the outcome you see so and there's

210
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,720
an even flow to their way of doing it it's it's more graceful and finesse

211
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,240
it's like Tai Chi right they're not stressed they're happy about it versus

212
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,660
this guy that's just punching a bag or some such you know yeah oh exactly so to

213
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,880
just kind of sum things up what people will be seeing in the near future and

214
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,900
future is there's going to be a greater grasp of reality by the morons on this

215
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,380
planet and what I mean by that a greater grasp meaning of course like going back

216
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,560
to what we said earlier about nothing is secular right you go to a secular

217
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,280
scientist you could show him that 40 to 70 percent of all the terms and things

218
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,120
that he uses come out of old religious texts right and same with the attorneys

219
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
and doctors and all this other stuff so there's nothing secular there's a divine

220
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,260
aspect to us when I say about learning about more things and people will get a

221
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,560
grasp on this reality that means they're going to get a grasp of what the gods

222
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,940
are and their effect on humanity and all this in the real history of the gods

223
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,940
right so what that when and you know and then the next level after that is the

224
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:10,620
manifestation of man's final power base in the Middle East so now that sounds

225
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,420
like what Greek that's so general you know what does it have to do with me you

226
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,500
know going out and you know raising chickens or going to work as in the

227
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,240
warehouse or flying an airplane what does it have to do with that well it's

228
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,640
all interconnected and it's all and because the end results of this

229
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,440
particular society are going to be so compressed and rapid for rapid events

230
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,140
one after the other that you know you will see that everything and everyone no

231
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,020
matter what field or we're part of the world you're you know what field of

232
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,100
interest you have or work in or even just interested in or what part of the

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,860
world you're in or your nationality or religion or language you are all going

234
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,960
to begin to grasp a reasonable sense of your history your real history which you

235
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,160
cannot separate from those of the history of the gods right that's why

236
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,720
again there's nothing secular the gods have influenced and it's just people

237
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,500
denying it now you can take any particular vocation or condition that

238
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,840
anyone might have you know it doesn't matter what their sex is or their job

239
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,820
let's say or what part of the world they live they will all experience a

240
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,700
resurgence and a rediscovery and a discovery of the society of the gods and

241
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,240
how it affected this mankind you see no now they say that are you meaning this

242
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,780
in a point where to be kind of like more common around the water cooler kind of

243
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:41,680
thing or every no yes yes not exclusive or not necessarily just inclusive or

244
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,100
exclusive of anything outside the water cooler no I mean in the word on the

245
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,460
street the at the dinner table in the newspapers on the internet in the

246
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,780
movies somebody just a few days back sit down down where they were they were

247
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,260
starting to notice this a little more on their radio which I kind of found

248
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,640
interesting I was like hmm interesting tidbit there yeah no years years ago and

249
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,600
I used to do roundtables with Seth this is years ago all years four years ago or

250
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,700
so maybe more of a five or four roughly like around with 13 of 12 13 I was

251
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,500
saying there's gonna be more increase of the gods you know let's say the biblical

252
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,600
text in most of the audience being you know the Western Convention the

253
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,500
biblical text is you know pretty much what they consider to be you know when

254
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,820
you think of God thing right there's gonna be an increased discussion

255
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,120
increased looking in that direction not only in the subject matter well all of

256
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,400
the subject matter but also that the the the influence that it has on society

257
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,420
which hasn't started yet right because right now it's just like oh that's

258
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,940
religion put it aside you know we got to go to work right right so it's got

259
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,880
nothing to do with this so but none of it's going to be accurate is what I said

260
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,720
in the beginning very little accuracy but it doesn't matter you're looking in

261
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,440
that direction you see so this what's exciting about it is starting in the

262
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,080
next few months you're going to see that starting in earnest I mean you know

263
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,940
where it'll be whatever movement you see will be deep-rooted it won't be a fad or

264
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:26,760
a fashion that this is happening you see now now the the other thing is like I

265
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,560
said there's not going to be much accuracy let's just take it for example

266
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,220
or I'm reckoning around the 23rd of the 10th month if anyone's with me on that

267
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,900
I think roughly 23rd of the 10th month till noon and what they call this is the

268
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,020
pagan holiday of Christmas roughly for most of the world and it's a second

269
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,400
people say well you know it's secular really you know or religious this is a

270
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,460
time when the lines get blurred notice because so why are banks closed on it

271
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,940
you know what are they religious stuff you know it's not it's not Saturday in

272
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,540
Jerusalem because you know the Jews the Jews think Saturday is the Sabbath you

273
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:10,680
know consistently oh they've been for now and so so what's so it's just like for

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,720
example when it comes to elections the government all of a sudden says we have

275
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,120
to be lawful so for one day we'll try to follow the Constitution right you get it

276
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
you know when they do elections in government bring it right yeah any other

277
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,580
time you approach them so no no we don't go by those laws oh no no it's not

278
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,520
what it means but on the election day they say oh yeah yeah we're doing this

279
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,320
because it's constitutional one day right you know they try to be lawful yeah

280
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,140
I mean it's just you know it's just this is not a critique on any society now

281
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,640
what when you critique the earth right now is like a really bad greasy spoon at

282
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,780
the end of town if anyone greasy spoon just means like a place to go to eat like

283
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,820
a cafe or a diner and the food's not good yeah the reason why it's in

284
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,560
business is because of its location and you have no other choice right sorry

285
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,980
they're so hungry you're eat there so you know the whole place is bad but like

286
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,400
you know someone will say well did you have the pancakes there oh they're

287
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,360
terrible they're dry they have no flavor but did you have the meatloaf oh the

288
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,920
meatloaf is really bad right you know so you know you know that it's like how's

289
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,100
the coffee oh the coffee is horrendous it's even worse than the meatloaf it

290
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,380
should be you see so the place generally is bad and then within the place what's

291
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,040
on the menu there's various levels of disgust within it you see what I mean

292
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,180
right but but people still order it this is the society and planet earth so you

293
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,860
could say well yeah you know the earth is really bad you know like the

294
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,320
Americans oh yeah they're really like they're really off the rock like the

295
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,560
most ignorant crazy people in the world easy to say that and then runner-up

296
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,740
would probably be Canadians Australians and British in that order right but it

297
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,080
doesn't mean that that's perpetual or it's always has to be that way just

298
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,180
happens to be like the meatloaf right and then you could say well you know

299
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,340
this place is like this it's just this is like the you know Hitchhiker's Guide to

300
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,560
the Galaxy the restaurant at the end of the galaxy this is the greasy spoon

301
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,240
right now it is the nasty you know it's like where the suit the chicken soup and

302
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,960
the mop pot are on the floor next to each other you know I mean this is

303
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,480
planet earth so what do you do so the easiest to you know the thing is you

304
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,620
can't tell anyone what to do without knowing enough specifics right so I give

305
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,900
you an example of that you know like street sweeping sounds real basic but a

306
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,480
professional street sweeper has there are a lot of secrets to doing it well

307
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,780
give you an example like I knew someone who didn't maintenance contract to do

308
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,240
the casinos in Las Vegas and he had about 200 employees I mean he was making like

309
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,080
10 million 15 million a year just cleat maintaining parking lots you know

310
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,020
if there's a grease stain you steam clean it off you know and all this stuff

311
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,840
so I went out with there with these guys one night and just screwing around look

312
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,060
as oh yeah what are you doing you know his crew shows up and I said give me a

313
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,440
broom and he's like no no no you're doing it wrong you see this this parking

314
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,220
lot was roll when they rolled the asphalt they rolled it this way right front to

315
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,840
back here so you want to sweep along the line that they rolled the asphalt in

316
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,360
and I'm like what did you say I would have never thought of that no right no

317
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,240
you see I mean so it's like don't you know so most people say it's the green

318
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,340
yeah sort of like or go with the green yeah so so it's like even these guys

319
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,020
have their science and their expertise but when you say street sweeper even I

320
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,540
use it as an analogy of someone in the bottom you see so there's what how can

321
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,060
you say you know Greek what should I do well I don't know only you know what

322
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,220
you're doing so you know what you should do based on a certain foundation of

323
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,000
principles in other words if you know that you're being pranked right all

324
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,380
around you everyone around you is subject to it and you don't want to be

325
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,600
subject to it what do you do well easy you just figure out where it wins the

326
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,380
next time they're gonna offer you a chair with a thumbtack simple right and

327
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,480
but the thing is now when you're dealing with most of let's say established

328
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,540
institutions they offer you a chair let's say the legal society when they offer you

329
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,960
a chair you know this thumbtack and you're like oh I don't want to say they

330
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,240
pull out a gun and put it to your head and said sit on it so now it's the gun or

331
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,540
the thumbtack right so now you have to go higher than that you have to go to that

332
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,480
you have to understand why they're doing them how they're doing that and let's

333
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,100
say legal society medical society the politicians even even you know on

334
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,160
various car mechanics various fields you unfortunately have to know when

335
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,220
you're going to get involved in you have your everyday daily life and what you do

336
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,240
your regimen and then you need one of these morons you know one of these

337
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,800
specialists unfortunately you have to know what you want them to do so when

338
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,240
you go to a legal person or a medical person or a mechanical person

339
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,500
unfortunately or fortunately actually you know it's really fortunate when you

340
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,280
experience it and you do it you have to know what you want them to do and they're

341
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,120
simply just performing it you're that they're just the hands you're give on

342
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,420
the task yeah they're just doing the task and you're able to you know enough

343
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,740
about what you'd like for them to do that you can mentally manage it and

344
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,020
discuss it to the point where they can't get over on you or you know nothing

345
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:29,480
more nothing less just do this and get it done that's right and you right now

346
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:38,180
forthright about it or otherwise you'll don't eat you up really yes and I see

347
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,860
so-called intelligent people all around that I went to the doctor and you know

348
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,380
like oh really you know and then you watch them after two years and they're

349
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,900
being destroyed by negligence and whatever and even when they get in the

350
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,880
same attorneys or the mechanics or the contractors or whatever so so the point

351
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,420
is what the reason why society hasn't completely fall into shambles and by the

352
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,320
way if you don't think that it's possible for civilization or society

353
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,540
from the shambles you don't know any history but the reason why it hasn't at

354
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,660
this point is one reason is the gods are propping it up and also it's a

355
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,840
testament to the robustness of the human you know or the the spirit of people and

356
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,320
their ability to bounce back from you know bad situations and I'll give an

357
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,340
example again just to bounce around there was a study that was done by

358
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,600
someone years ago on socialist countries that have socialized medicine and when

359
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,500
the doctors would go on strike right doctors would actually go on strike the

360
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,060
hospitals would be essentially shut down and the morgues would be empty people

361
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:46,680
stop down yeah and the hospitals open up again and I say well it doesn't make any

362
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,780
sense of course it makes sense what you know just because the hospitals closed

363
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,440
no one's in the morgue what there aren't any car accidents yeah there aren't any

364
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,860
murder there aren't murders there aren't poison there aren't dying of old

365
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,060
age Judy's just suddenly stopped people stop dying exactly it's like if there

366
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,020
were no attorneys there would be no hardly anyone in prison right I mean

367
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,300
think about that it's the same thing you know if you didn't have mechanics cars

368
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,040
wouldn't break down why because they would build them so they didn't yep

369
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,560
right that's another situation I'm quite well versed and I do work with the

370
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,540
automotive quote-unquote people or the engine type people and what a bunch of

371
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,080
morons throughout I mean I mean you die but they're not any more moronic than

372
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,540
the medical community or the legal community or whatever

373
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,180
toilet paper certificates you know mm-hmm that's it they were trained to

374
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:51,480
do a task they did it well they picked they've got it score and by the way

375
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,200
click your chat on so you can kind of see some of this stuff you get some

376
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,920
interesting questions going through there oh do I okay let's see and by the

377
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:14,560
way the venue man went and gave a good analogy a gun tack when you were talking

378
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,540
about the thumbtack on the chair oh yeah that's right that's rather clever I just

379
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:30,110
see that it's open it okay great I see the day's questions hmm any truth to

380
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,730
monthly astrology signs and if so they start with the new moons astrology has

381
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:41,990
been kind of destroyed it's shifted between East and West and astrology right

382
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:49,590
now is like imagine taking a circuit board apart and what's the difference

383
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:55,050
between a tube amp and in a solid state well I see this analogy I'm getting is a

384
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,990
little different but don't take take the all the parts off a circuit board on

385
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,070
solder and put them in a bag and then just randomly dump the bag out and

386
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:10,950
solder everything back on do you expect it to work it could it might make smoke

387
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,430
and light maybe you don't know right so a little but there's a there's a cycle

388
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:22,770
it's been custom tailored now to sound plausible in you know when you go and

389
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:28,470
study let's say psychology 101 one of the things they do about horoscopes is

390
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,170
they write a horoscope and they hand it out they put everyone's name on it so

391
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,590
you think it's specifically done for you and then you know and they ask

392
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,390
everyone in the class to raise your hand if you feel it applies to you and just

393
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,030
about everyone raises their hand right and says well this is a custom-made you

394
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,490
know one for you others is that's why right and I say well I just want you to

395
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,530
look to the person behind you or next to you and just exchange the paper and it's

396
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,590
the same thing yeah everyone got the same horoscope it's a it's a legalized

397
00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:03,010
you know thing back in the day and I'm talking way back the the accuracy of

398
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:07,690
these people back then where it was astounding they were articulate they

399
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:16,010
yes they were like Tai Chi they flowed and understood and now it's like you'd

400
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,890
say it's it's commercialized it's corrupted by God knows what

401
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,830
but well it is well wouldn't say God the gods are ready to you know do their

402
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:34,350
thing so but here's the other thing about astrology it just means basically

403
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:42,430
knowledge or words about where astronomy no most means the laws of the stars so

404
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,910
one is you know they've kind of shifted in between the purpose of prophecy I've

405
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:54,170
been saying this for a long time is to tell you the anomalies of thing you

406
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,230
know things that are anomalous things that are going to be happening outside

407
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,210
of the normal natural clockwork that you see in the skies in the earth and all

408
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:09,090
that you see so you could learn and many points in history you'll see that

409
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,530
there are astronomical references of course even now it should be used it is

410
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:18,450
the only lawful way to keep time right and because it's you know it's it's

411
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,290
lawful it's the anyone you know there's no use your patience do you see a

412
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:29,190
correlation between the prophecy and you know let's say stars and no different

413
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,150
no no because hear me I'm gonna say it again the purpose of prophecy is to

414
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:39,590
show you the anomalies that are not shown in the sky in the normal clockwork okay

415
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,610
let me give you a profit okay this is another metaphor it's a really easy way

416
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,930
let's say the sky and the sky movements moon Sun stars is like a clock on the

417
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,090
wall okay very reliable right just as it is now mechanically fixed to a certain

418
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,990
point mm-hmm and I tell you tomorrow you know that thing everyone says well we've

419
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,450
been counting on it for a really long time it'll probably work for a really

420
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,730
long time but I'm gonna say to you there's here's a prophecy tomorrow

421
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,750
someone's gonna walk in and shoot that clock well now what are you gonna keep

422
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:16,630
time with it's gonna be you know shrapnel right that's probably that's

423
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,850
the difference between prophecy and clockwork so what's the way it's way

424
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,690
outside the scope of anything that we often make up the normal mechanical

425
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:30,510
movements that you're used to like you rely on hmm and meditate on it I just

426
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,090
said something that I've been saying for over a decade and it just passes over

427
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,350
people's head and sometimes I'll say things that seem very minor and

428
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,449
insignificant those are the key points to Greek speak and no one comes back on

429
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:46,389
them you know and the reason why is because maybe it's so simple that I'll

430
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,929
say it again the purpose of prophecy is to impart the anomalies that will be

431
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:57,370
coming and the reason why they're anomalous is because they don't fit

432
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,570
within the normal day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month clockwork

433
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,230
that you're used to that you rely on give me an example like you're used to

434
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,490
planting and growing and sewing you know spring summer fall used to those

435
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,310
seasonal things that happen right you know you take out you put the snow

436
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,650
shovel away in the summer and you take it out in the fall or the winter right

437
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:24,270
this is normal you know you don't know big deal is normal stuff but what if I

438
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,570
were to tell you you're gonna have to take your snow shovel out in June

439
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,930
because it's gonna have snow up to the top of the door well it sounds pretty

440
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:37,810
ridiculous doesn't it right that sounds outside of the clockwork right right so

441
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:44,670
so the purpose of prophecy initially in other words initially what I mean is its

442
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,110
placement within a body of knowledge is to show you the anomalies and give it a

443
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,050
few examples of that like one example is when the the old man and the old woman

444
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,450
went to the temple in the New Testament for example to greet the Christ when

445
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,690
his parents brought him there for circumcision on being eight days old

446
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,190
right well how did they know to be there at that time and nobody's what there's

447
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:14,130
like millions of people going in and out of Jerusalem every day or that part of

448
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,410
the world because it was concentrated like New York City what no one else knew

449
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,550
no they didn't why those two people understood prophecy only two out of all

450
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:30,230
those millions of people at that time and just to recap I put it in the chat

451
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,890
recently if any I'm not going to give verses and all that because I'm not

452
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,130
into you know mouthing off the actual specifics in the text just like when you

453
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,030
discuss a film you don't say oh did you see the movie at one hour 42 minutes and

454
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,190
33 seconds no you either saw the movie and you know it or not you know well

455
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,530
what's interesting he was born when the parents were in transit right there were

456
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,230
moving around and the ones that witnessed that were shepherds only

457
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:11,550
shepherds and then there's an exodus to Egypt for two years I would say that go

458
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,450
back and check the text but these Magi which is a pretty accurate term by the

459
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:22,210
way but Easterners they didn't come and greet Christ until two years after he was

460
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:28,670
born in a house you know a house meaning like a quote-unquote residency

461
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:36,830
you know wasn't like a hotel or a motel or right right and then you know when

462
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:42,310
they came in a town to do this I mean they had the place was in you know it's

463
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,350
like the Bilderbergers coming into a town you know how they would shut it

464
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,970
down you know right people don't understand the the power of these guys

465
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,250
so and it's completely completely understated and erroneous just like for

466
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,070
example I say well wouldn't they tell you about the Christ the Christians or

467
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,250
that what do they show you what's the third their prominent symbols until you

468
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:10,070
meant until you mentioned that I never ever ever heard anything come close to

469
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:20,730
that and I think well so you know that was astounding it is yeah it was pretty

470
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,010
major and the thing is it doesn't have to go over and over because the purpose

471
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,530
of these accounts was to just put down on paper the facts have you ever read

472
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,610
for have you ever read for example or if anyone can consider reading what's

473
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,870
called an affidavit of evidence to be entered into a court case you know no

474
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,410
matter it's just like the few words that you were there at this time at this day

475
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:50,810
you saw this and you swear to it that's it it's not that it shocked you and you

476
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,930
couldn't sleep for a week or you didn't like the color sweatshirt he was wearing

477
00:38:54,930 --> 00:39:00,570
or any you know I mean right the details are sparse if not none it you know sort

478
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:06,870
of time so yeah right detailed that's it open shut close now with with Seth

479
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,290
back in the day on the roundtable I did a two-hour explanation of what was going

480
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,690
on back then based on the entire you know what could be gleaned off of history

481
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,750
and understanding scripture understanding sociology at the time the

482
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,590
laws at the time and all that and then you know at this point I'd like to do

483
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,750
that again sometime in the future not tonight but I could just throw these

484
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:31,490
little tidbits in another tidbit is why were it why were they all in transit it

485
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,750
wasn't just his parents that were in transit it was the whole area was

486
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,590
transient or in transit for some reason when does this happen when does that

487
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,070
happen that happens during the Jubilee year doesn't it

488
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,890
right right because you give back property and you go and debts are

489
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,090
forgiven well you know when you know this period is coming up and when is it

490
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,650
done during the time of in-gathering when is the time of in-gathering so

491
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:04,310
seventh month and there was a lot of customs that went along with that oh yeah

492
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,310
yeah that are not reiterated that are not that are not in that what's called the

493
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:15,410
New Testament and because people are not aware of them there's no you know in

494
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,370
other words they could pull the wool over your eyes and say anything that's

495
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,590
what I was gonna say earlier the when you say the symbol of Christianity is a

496
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,150
guy nailed to a Roman cross with long hair wearing a diaper right that's that's

497
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,210
the symbol and that is completely non-biblical I was having a discussion

498
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:39,650
with someone recently if I were to do an archaeological dig I would go opposite

499
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:45,750
the Gihon Spring towards the east and then go vertically and you will find

500
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,590
there is a stone formation there which our house is built right now if you go

501
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:54,050
to Google you'll see there's like a in this when they did the Google Earth

502
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,630
photo there's a like apartments there like you know one single-story duplex

503
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,730
type stuff and there's like a rug and laundry hanging there you know it's

504
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,510
almost never when you put that picture up I think I still have that somewhere

505
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,850
if you if you zoom in you'll see there's like the current picture might have been

506
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,210
taken out of months ago there's laundry hanging in a laundry but someone's got a

507
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,710
rug drying that you know hanging there and all this other stuff that location

508
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,510
right there if you dug it up and you started understanding like alluvium and

509
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,550
how things you know you know over time how they were you want to take down how

510
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,490
they move and how things are buried over time or moved but you will do it that

511
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,470
basic geology if you keep digging down you'll come to a point where you will see

512
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:42,590
a tree stump basically or an area you see even when the tree totally decomposes

513
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,710
the soil there is slightly different right right it becomes clay in a vein

514
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,150
formation there might even be petrification what you will find in that

515
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:56,750
area is the base of an almond tree just the base and a lot of carbonization a

516
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,610
black layer and within that carbonization you'll probably find bone

517
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,870
fragments carbonized human bone fragments and other effects personal

518
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:11,110
effects burned probably burned leather satchels burned clothing bird sandals

519
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:17,490
burned personal effects maybe even some coinage maybe melted because what

520
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:24,010
happened was intensity yeah yeah yeah well in order to burn a tree and bodies

521
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,890
it usually it's a minimum to a two to four hour burn it was springtime so so

522
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,290
what you will find there is evidence of a tree that was burned with two people

523
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,530
that were burned on it the third was not burned he was put into a tomb right

524
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,740
that's gonna be one hell of an event by the way no one is discussing this type

525
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,840
of archaeology not at all but if I had unlimited time I would do it and funding

526
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,720
I would go and do that you know the way you do that is you you you go to the

527
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,640
properties there now you make them an offer they can't refuse so you can dig

528
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,400
underneath and get the permits and you'll find that I assure you and that

529
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,200
would have been the execution location of the Christ but not him he was because

530
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,380
he he was spared that burning right because they were like oh you know they

531
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,580
ran in haste to take the body down it was all in haste

532
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,580
oh yeah because you know as after they were declared dead the people started you

533
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,560
know doing all piling up all the stuff underneath personal belongings of the

534
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,800
two the robber and the thief and all that were with them right and and you know

535
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,660
starting a fire it doesn't happen immediately to take over an hour it

536
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:35,040
takes time yes preparation so this can be discovered now there's a focus on

537
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,520
archaeology that I would consider there's a focus on considering doing a

538
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,820
scriptural study someone I see T Bender put in what about the book of Daniel

539
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,840
being understood soon yes absolutely that is a one of the promises and if we are

540
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,540
in that time you will see an understanding in there and I've know

541
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,380
I've noticed personally the understanding of that book increasing

542
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:05,500
day-by-day for me I'd like to do a discussion on that I had once even though

543
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,120
I'm when I was doing the solo event someone called in a wonderful lady who's

544
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,620
been listening to Greek speak and actually been applying it and it helped

545
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,040
her out with some dream states and things like that quite well and she kept

546
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,080
asking about the book of Daniel and I gave I dropped a couple of tidbits on

547
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,400
some more understanding on the book of Daniel there and then I said that it

548
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,560
will be more soon and soon and soon meaning as time progresses not you know

549
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:36,140
one point now we understand it right it'll just keep opening up so and that

550
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,120
might I would say I would be right now I could do I mean that right now in this

551
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,720
sonic event but in the future I could easily do a four-hour explanation of the

552
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,200
book of Daniel but I would prefer to do something like that in a year or two or

553
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,060
three hmm because I think that'll be even more you know less gray area at

554
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,900
that point you know right now it's still before it was a blur now it's

555
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,920
pixelated but I got the image I'd like for it to be high it's not it's it's 240

556
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,160
P it's not 1080 you know right right no gotcha

557
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,520
or it's a charity clarity and sharpness focus yeah and I would suggest to anyone

558
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,300
unfortunately unless well of course there's a lot of good corn out there but

559
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:22,820
it's embedded with poo right or it's embedded in poo and unfortunately still

560
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,560
I tell people the best way to study scripture is don't bring anything from

561
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,760
the outside into it just pick it up and look at it but you really really have to

562
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,980
wring it out because there are things that are being given there that are so

563
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,440
simple I used to always say just because a statement is really short doesn't mean

564
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,280
it's not important right like someone falls off of a ship and screams help I'm

565
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,100
drowning what did he say that wasn't important it just two words it can't be

566
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:57,240
important right so and I'm not talking about doing it with desperation or you

567
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,260
know panic or or anything like that but yeah that is the book of Daniel for sure

568
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,580
I mean the the book of here's another one that I haven't brought up and

569
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,080
discussed much at all you ready this is a first I think or sort of a first at

570
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,720
least for the people listening book of Daniel yes here's another book you're

571
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,560
ready if you could wrap your mind around the book of Zechariah Zechariah's I've

572
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,820
discussed that book to some extent now that is really actually there's a couple

573
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,220
of key points major points in the book of Zechariah that are going to be

574
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,860
happening now soon next few years or so and those that's open for discussion

575
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,640
there's a lot of clarity on that national actually the analysis of that

576
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,140
is really good also I'm gonna mute um if you want to just entertain everyone

577
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,000
just for about three minutes I'll be right back I just have to run and do

578
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,820
something and I can't do it while I'm on okay gotcha be right back

579
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:07,920
all righty well that's interesting the upcoming tell you I'm curious just as

580
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,000
we're sitting here waiting I'm gonna throw some tunes in and be right with

581
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:22,640
you already and okay we're back there we go yeah it wasn't so bad so okay so so

582
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,320
yeah these things are of interest to me personally because I've been looking at

583
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:36,320
the prophetic aspect of this only because dividing any any information into

584
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,880
category right like this is a body of knowledge doesn't matter what it is

585
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,520
this is about this this is about that you know like a car manual you know this is

586
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,440
about the electrical system this is the engine this is the interior right all

587
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,000
right so when I started looking at the all of the ancient texts they all had

588
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,480
divisions they had history geography prophecy so on and so forth but the what

589
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,860
separates the scripture what's called the Bible and I don't mean and the

590
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,700
reason I use the Bible is because the audience understands what I mean by

591
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,100
that you know it hasn't been given all the caveats and the and the footnotes on

592
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,900
that already when you do a study on that what you will discover it is first-class

593
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:23,320
information but it is also timed temporal in many places it tells you

594
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,480
when you get to a certain time period then you know there'll be more

595
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,540
understanding on these matters so what's exciting about this time period is that

596
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:38,780
we are in that time period where these matters were to be understood so I think

597
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,980
there's much work to be done on that at least sonically in the near future but

598
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:49,240
at the same time here's the thing and I and I always tell people this there's an

599
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,740
old ghetto term yo how you living you know I mean like when someone's doing

600
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,820
something real crappy oh how you living you know you got a big tear in your couch

601
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,620
and your hole in your shoes and you don't know how to eat you know what I

602
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:03,600
mean how you know how can you live like that so how are you here's the here's the

603
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,400
thing I give the analogy if you're gonna go approach a king or something and

604
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,280
there's someone knocks on the door say Bruce we're gonna go see let's say the

605
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,800
president of a country and you're standing there in a holy t-shirt sweat

606
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,520
pants and flip-flops like oh let's go no you're probably like well we have to put

607
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,240
on you know our best definitely our cleanest dirty shirt or something right

608
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,340
our best clothing so if you're going to approach a body of information that

609
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,920
comes from the supreme being of the universe you think you're just gonna

610
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,000
eat whatever sleep whatever think whatever act whatever and you're gonna

611
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,860
get it nope I'm gonna have to put your discipline your whole you have to your

612
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:49,820
whole beam has to be within that has to and there's no margin of error and some

613
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,620
people will be able to achieve more than you know a higher quality of it but the

614
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,780
thing is are you striving to make it the best with what he's giving you what

615
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,520
you have is the point you see it's like when you go to McDonald's I remember

616
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,060
traveling the only thing was fast food and all that well the thing is you don't

617
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:11,620
eat what their places are known for you try to make the best possible choice you

618
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,220
know after a while I'd go and order let's say a particular sandwich and I

619
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,800
say we'll hold the meat patty just leave the lettuce the onions tomato and mayo

620
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,680
you're right and they're like no we can't do that we can't do that we don't

621
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,380
yeah so like I will just give me the patty and I toss it out you know if I

622
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,340
feel like someone's got a dog you know at the window I'll just give him a mask

623
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,260
and I keep the dog and he's like oh yeah you know or it's like the old Jack

624
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,840
Nicholson movies I want toast we don't serve toast so let me give me a tuna

625
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,480
fish sandwich on toast we can do that and he says but hold the tuna fish what

626
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,320
do you want me to do waitress right so but the waitress says well what do you

627
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,800
want me to do with the tuna fish and she goes put it between your legs I don't

628
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,920
care Jack Nicholson way you know that old Jersey psychopathic look that he

629
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:05,320
gives so yeah so there's many aspects to this make your best choices I mean

630
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,300
there's past couple of days I've been hitting up the chat with food choices

631
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,520
and all that that yeah I think would be a good schedule event I was thinking of

632
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,200
taking some notes and going down through that I'm not gonna do I think I'm just

633
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:22,440
going to ad-lib it or just go what runs off the top of the mind to a fine art

634
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,400
oh yeah I believe I do a certain point the best way to do it is to do a

635
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,480
syllabus sit down and say okay for you know for these few hours we're going to

636
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,400
talk about you know food selection you know based on season market

637
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,000
availability and basic preparation and you know basic recipes and then get into

638
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,500
more of the cultural aspect of food preparation which is actual recipes

639
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,460
themselves you know like hummus for example you know or hummus like they say

640
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,140
right what is that well it's mashed chickpeas lemon juice garlic and you

641
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,960
know sesame butter or tahina right tahini it's a delicious dip you know or

642
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,760
many many other that's just giving that one specific example or how to make

643
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,520
basic bread or how to do you know and and then focus around the find the best

644
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,960
of each culture right mm-hmm and and then why you know how to do proper slow

645
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,480
pot cooking how to really fry how to really and then that's another part of

646
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,800
it those are the more final detail you're celebrating a culture's history of fine

647
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,300
preparation of their delicacies yeah or their way of life you know like for

648
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,520
example yes you know what's interesting every culture has a handheld food what

649
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,500
we call a sandwich type thing yes like a roll or a piece you know you know

650
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,060
what's what's a hot dog or a hamburger or sandwich it's a roll with yeah you

651
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:52,200
know every culture has some kind of product around it yeah every culture has

652
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,860
something like that you know every culture has some kind of a hot pot soup

653
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:02,960
stew every culture has you see everyone's got some kind of you know your

654
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,140
way of preparing a certain type of genre of food you know bring that when

655
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,340
you bring that up I remember this Hmong lady who lived downstairs downstairs

656
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:21,900
for me and she made this it was like a dip and it had carrots and all and I'm

657
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,300
telling you you you would have died you're the taste buds were dancing with

658
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,060
the light it's the best way that I can I can I can put a minute well there's a

659
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:37,680
dip in certain a Punjab cultures and other cultures they make a dip a very

660
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,080
sweet pistachio I believe and carrot it's mostly sugar and you'll see it in

661
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,020
the middle of this of the plate so if you eat food that's too hot you take a

662
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,780
piece of that and it calms the heat down you know meaning not in temperature hot

663
00:53:51,780 --> 00:54:00,700
but spicy hot spring oh I'm just thinking about it brings a joyful smile

664
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,860
well here's the irony of again which country in the world is known for having

665
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,580
20 feet of topsoil for thousands if not millions of acres the u.s. which country

666
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:16,520
has by hands down the most unhealthy and worst fed population in the world u.s.

667
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,920
most ill-prepared food I told you I was out in parts like New Mexico Colorado

668
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,640
Texas even Iowa place that I was sick staying with people eating what just for

669
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,880
two days what they ate I'm like you got to be joking

670
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,740
stream beans out of a can you know I mean everything was either canned or

671
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,740
frozen or just overcooked or cooked with a timer and there was no love in the

672
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:46,000
food and I don't mean everyone but everyone I stayed with for sure but

673
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,100
not even that it was you know that they have a saying in America like grandma

674
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,820
used to make I've been to many people's homes grandma's cooking tonight she's

675
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:05,120
cooking all day the food was crap not once but twice but every time as a Greek

676
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:11,380
get you pick yeah I like Greek you're too picky and I'm like yeah I mean like

677
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:17,620
I'd rather pick my nose and eat your food and it was it was yeah so that's

678
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,520
why I always tell people I always preferred living by the East Coast or

679
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,920
the West Coast because you had a good influx of Mediterranean and Asian

680
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,300
cultures you know if you go like in New York mass you know you have European

681
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,960
you know the immigrants you know great in California but once you go Midwest

682
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,800
forget it I mean yeah you go to places like in Kansas State of Kansas and I

683
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,000
would have great steaks you know and they love you know unclean foods but

684
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,660
that's it I mean so what and they're not mindful so the Americans are screwed that

685
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,980
way it's an interesting thing again about Americans I was discussing something you

686
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,140
know there's always a lot of you think there's some kind of God over the

687
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:01,900
agricultural market in this oh yeah but this is what it is you think you could

688
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,140
wipe out nearly an entire race of people and go unscathed you let you know

689
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,440
that so what I mean by that is I was talking about the someone's about the

690
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,040
controversy about the Holocaust and the Holocaust Museum with the Jews in

691
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,600
Europe no but I said well the Native Americans got it worse than them and

692
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,120
where's their Holocaust Museum right right much worse I think what is it only

693
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:31,540
one percent cruel oh yeah only one or the status around one or two percent of

694
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:37,220
surviving in Native Americans are pure blood yeah they're all mixed so they're

695
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,020
really been eliminated either from anyway so where's their Holocaust Museum

696
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:47,220
you know their their language is declining more and more every time so

697
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,180
yeah and this is just a point I mean you know I'm not focused on that whether

698
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,660
they get one or not at this point it doesn't matter it's all they have to

699
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,440
speak up for it yeah no big can be mature but what I mean is is the

700
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,420
Americans have said that yeah that's fine but no because it could materialize

701
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,720
is what I mean by that I mean it's sarcastic your con right I mean they're

702
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,360
trying to build that large what is it crazy horse monument you know it's good

703
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:21,000
twice yeah much more Dakotas so mm-hmm yeah but there's a yeah this is not a

704
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,480
rent this is pretty accurate Americans have the worst food and the worst

705
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,860
mindset on food generally speaking than anyone else in the world

706
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,500
we're not close to the British they are so but you know the British here's the

707
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,180
thing they're smaller and they have been overrun by foreigners for so many

708
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,760
years you know what is the if you go to England right now or foodie magazines

709
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,520
what is the national dish of England chicken tiki marcella you know some

710
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,120
chickens in my culture yeah so at least they put yeah but there you know they're

711
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,940
terrible also from an extent where you let's say you go to a place like New

712
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,300
York or California looking around for restaurants we're gonna see an English

713
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,960
food restaurant very rare yeah maybe maybe they'll do like a mock-up of an

714
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,060
English pub or something but you know heaven help you if you have to eat what

715
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:19,630
they eat you know you're eating fish and chips and well the minute you try to

716
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:27,690
make it mass anything it's already moving into some form of death yeah and

717
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:32,170
here's the thing also just to cover it myself again not really but cover but

718
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,950
I've always been saying that's white people food and no one ever has come

719
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:39,730
back to say that sounds racist because they know what I mean by that right it's

720
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:42,770
not racist you know I mean that could be could be any registry white people food

721
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:48,510
is white people food is the if you ever watched what they did to the food in

722
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,370
America from the 1930s on and it peaked around the 1970s all the convenience

723
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:58,550
foods you know you know what I mean right yeah it peaked around the 70s and

724
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,270
in the 80s it got more elaborate meaning in the 80s and they started freezing

725
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:06,970
croissants and things like that you know do you remember the corner do you

726
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:12,730
remember the corner stores mm-hmm yeah there well what stores now yeah right

727
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:19,230
and but the corner stores always had beautiful fresh everything you know you

728
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:23,750
know but here's the point and product coming in here and there but here's the

729
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,350
point even back then no matter how good the ingredients were these people didn't

730
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:32,070
know how to prepare it well at all I'm sorry right oh yeah I mean I've actually

731
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:37,370
won I was in a suburban place years ago I was doing an excursion staying with

732
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:41,910
some people I actually won an apple pie contest against a bunch of grandmas in

733
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:48,390
town Oh got the blue ribbon yeah oh and I'm not I'm not a baker so so so much

734
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,170
how grandma used to make you tell me grandma's cooking I'm going the other

735
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,290
way I'd rather eat at McDonald's because she don't know I mean unless she's from

736
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:02,890
Asia or Europe I'm sorry I mean I sound a little harsh and yeah so I mean now

737
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,990
you're getting into great-grandma territory and seeing if you can run

738
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:11,750
against them which were truly from the other side someone put in here ever

739
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,450
notice how people who eat a lot of fast-food start smelling like the food

740
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:20,110
you actually smell like all the food that you eat for example I've spoken to

741
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:24,570
military people when they go to places like Korea they can't stand being the

742
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:29,990
public spaces because they smell this fishy garlic smell and they can't they

743
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,530
can't smell stand the smell of the Americans because they have this bovine

744
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,730
fecal smell now what happens is when they stay there after a while and they

745
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,790
come here to America their family complains that they smell like garlic and

746
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:45,150
fish through their coming through their skin for a couple of weeks in our days

747
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:52,570
you see right so yeah gotta go somewhere

748
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:02,320
interesting that we would give it off you know it as we induce it into

749
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:10,440
ourselves and then it's just kind of lightly eliminated in a oxygen or sweat

750
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:19,620
or whatever oh yeah yeah 20 feet of topsoil yeah that's that's in initially

751
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,040
when they started doing the westward movement anymore you know the way we're

752
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,040
no no it was established to be around that much because they went out they

753
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,620
were doing the westward movement and they needed shelters you know they said

754
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,280
we're gonna settle here make a farm so they kept digging down looking for mud

755
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,940
to make clay brick and stuff and I couldn't find it so that's why when you

756
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:45,780
look at the old prairie dwellings are made of peat they had to make their

757
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,660
dwellings out of peat because they they kept digging and digging and digging and

758
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,620
digging and all they found was peat and topsoil so like shit we got to build our

759
01:01:53,620 --> 01:02:00,420
abode out of that and he'd go look online peat houses as in moss right in

760
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,700
the Midwest back in the 19th century until they had a no you know established

761
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,600
enough of an area found maybe a an area where they could get some building

762
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:21,800
materials you know mm-hmm so yeah we covered just a few things and I just want

763
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:27,400
to say there's nothing secular you know you've heard the term don't listen to

764
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:34,340
what they say watch what they do you know right so ask people's experiences

765
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:40,940
but the thing is people are so dumbed up and so removed from reality even when

766
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,120
they're being tortured by a legal someone in the legal society or the

767
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,940
medical society they still think it's for their own good right so it's a single

768
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:54,380
masochist yeah they think it's fine you know I've seen been on this planet for

769
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,180
more than half a century now and I've seen Oh several dozen people deliberately

770
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:04,720
killed by doctors right yeah I mean deliberately on both sides and you know

771
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,160
and I watch it and it's a sick form of entertainment because I can't take it

772
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,340
seriously because you can't get involved it's like a pimp eating a pimp

773
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:18,280
beating up his girl you can't get involved in that fight because they're

774
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:24,400
both gonna turn up and I've seen that no so it's a really really sad thing you

775
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,160
when I hear about people going to the medical technicians or things it's a

776
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:35,440
snuff film in slow motion the same with the legal people so boy there was a

777
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:44,220
vision mm-hmm yeah yeah but anyway that's just this is believe it or not

778
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,440
with all this this crap that's going on now it's going to be viewed in a better

779
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,120
perspective much later when the gods put set things straight but the thing I

780
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,480
wanted to say about don't listen to what they say watch what they do and someone

781
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,700
put you will know them by their fruits one of the things that I've always tried

782
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,600
to do whenever especially I have a longer presence than just passing

783
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,660
through discussing things I always like to certain tidbits on how people can

784
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,040
make their lives better their brain whether it's just simple water

785
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:19,340
preparation or how to prepare a meal or ask a particular thing that might lead

786
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:25,620
to a better result or a better thought you see so so you actually have

787
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:32,360
something usable I like to be a sonic Swiss Army knife you know yes yes yeah

788
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:42,180
and at least leave people not just empty words development certainly gives you a

789
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:49,020
new perspective on things well it's it's it's good to read it on many of the

790
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:56,140
things I've noticed that it's it's a I think it's a renewed perspective yeah

791
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,460
because I started things I like to bring up give you an example we used to do

792
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,660
these Skype calls you know I used to have 10-15 people years ago and we used to be

793
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,940
on for hours sometimes we'd leave it on for 14 hours as a matter of fact there

794
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:12,600
was one that's left on perpetually right all you need is a one all you need is

795
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,900
the host to have a microphone and a camera or whatever hooked on to a

796
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,640
computer and he could go to you leave and leave it on anyone that's brought in

797
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:29,320
can be on so anyway used to be this guy coming on and he was dealing with you

798
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,540
know like venture capitalists inventors new ideas and things like that he would

799
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:39,460
come on and pontificate for minutes or half hour about this new thing and and

800
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,620
I'm like well wait a second here comes this guy again telling us about like a

801
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,020
new invention or a new appliance or new not appliance house appliance but

802
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,720
something that's going to you know make things easier or it's you know an

803
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,880
invention you know a doohickey or a gimmick or is something useful and I

804
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,800
said wait a second you know I've been listening to you for a while now and

805
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,160
everything that you're saying I'm gonna ask you can I go get that like oh no no

806
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,200
you can't get it it's only done by the government it's very expensive only this

807
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:12,100
one so what good is it what good is it if I can't yeah if I can't just go down to

808
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,920
the hardware store like 50 bucks get all the parts go out in the backyard

809
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,160
beat on it and make it in an hour or two or a day I don't want to know what why

810
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,740
are you telling me you know it sounds like it sounds like a mild pranking you

811
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:28,520
know just tell me what I can go and build right now and do whether it's the

812
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,440
best is stuff you have access to in your own immediate surroundings or even in

813
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,620
the bin you know yeah you know but none of this stuff so it's like ah and this

814
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,500
is what you're getting in your science by the way you know when you look at

815
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:47,920
science articles on the internet nanotechnology nothing behind it yeah

816
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,580
nothing you could do anything and you know it's interesting it shows you how

817
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:55,320
much pranking and how stupid people are they'll do these I've hyped up articles

818
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:00,360
and it's come this comes as new technological advancement it comes out

819
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,740
MIT and they show you like these 18 year olds in MIT doing it it's a prank you

820
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:12,180
never gonna that's not even real you know so it's it's it's just yeah it's

821
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:17,440
just bizarre so here's the thing if you're listening to my voice and you are

822
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,500
on this planet I really feel sorry for you as I do for anyone that's ever

823
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,740
passed through here but that's on a big cosmic level so it doesn't mean you need

824
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:31,040
to be leave live a sorry ass life and pathetic aspect of what is going around

825
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,180
you you can I wouldn't say rise above it because the last thing you want to do is

826
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,700
experience tall poppy syndrome in other words that means the nail that

827
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:44,400
sticks out gets hammered down right just like people say you got to stand up for

828
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,420
your rights I said that's fine but when they're fixing on busting people it

829
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,460
might be best for you to just sit down that day right I want to get out of the

830
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:56,100
way yeah mm-hmm so what does everyone have in common other you know they all

831
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,180
want I could use the different words here lasciviously or whatever but you

832
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:05,160
eat sleep you know go to the bathroom wash you know you make you know all

833
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:11,460
kinds of things during the day that might be part of your vocation or or what

834
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:15,819
you like to do and how do you make each one you know everyone shares those

835
01:08:15,819 --> 01:08:19,680
things in common right unless you're you know paraplegic that's that's a very

836
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,200
small you know you have no functions yeah then that's a very small I'm

837
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,439
addressing those that are mobile and active what what do you have access to

838
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:32,319
and keep that in in perspective that you know you can make that immediately

839
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:39,160
better you know I used to for example discuss even what they call driving you

840
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,840
know I used to on Skype I told people listen when you're driving you on a

841
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,540
curved road do this when you adjust the seat you put make sure it's in this

842
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,720
position when you're accelerating and through it when you're going through a

843
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,560
turn this is how you do it and I've had everyone that was active in that come

844
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,880
back to me and say Greek I didn't think I'd get driving lessons over Skype but

845
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,359
all the techniques that you told me worked you see very simple because they

846
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,399
already had a car they were gonna drive anyway right right so and I learned this

847
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:09,840
from you know taking you know official or formal instructions on doing race car

848
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,800
driving and other things so and which is very scary because when I experienced

849
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,840
that I said wait a second these things that you're learning here should be

850
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,700
taught to everyone and these people out here driving don't know any of this that

851
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,220
makes them potentially very dangerous so I said well let me just try to impart

852
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:27,560
these skills to anyone just verbally you know so anything that's just an

853
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,479
example just sharing so you can make it a little bit better and of course find

854
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:36,620
your opiate you know the thing that numbs you out from all the

855
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,760
ridiculousness that's going on because I think some people have gotten fair

856
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,899
response that they've tried to approach others in any field and they don't want

857
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:49,920
to hear it that's the common thing and it's a very very very very very very to

858
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,320
the 10th power rare bird to find someone that is willing to listen and

859
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,360
it's even rarer for them to understand it and it's even more rare for them to

860
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:06,580
apply it yes and it's all very simple and whether I'm the only one saying

861
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,660
things the way they am right now I appear it appears that I am but I'd like

862
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:18,640
to see this type of more of this type of mindset being available to more people

863
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,260
just so you know the experience on this rock right now is just a little bit

864
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,560
better right better shoes make better walking right so that's pretty much it

865
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,380
and yeah so I mean that's uh I mean there's much much more to go and much

866
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:41,180
more to say we've been on for about an hour what do you think over 13 at the

867
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:44,640
moment okay so they got a little maybe they got

868
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,480
something a little bit more on the sonic mm-hmm yes so with some repetition so

869
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:56,760
let's just keep this unscheduled regular irregularity we'll see how things go

870
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:02,380
maybe yeah maybe in the near future there will be some investment on the

871
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:06,760
uncommon site and maybe something more formal but this seems to be trudging

872
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,560
along I did a little bit just to share some personal thoughts with everyone I

873
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,580
did a little bit of thinking that's it well you know stop being such a lazy

874
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,420
ass go ahead spend a couple of days on the uncommon site start you know some

875
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:23,360
more formal scheduling do you know various you know ways where people can

876
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,440
access maybe do videos you know bill I was building all this in my head and I'm

877
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:30,320
like what there's only like five people listen to this and apply it right

878
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:36,920
successfully right so it's not necessary I mean if you look on the internet you

879
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,400
know that you it's it's actually occasionally I'll do that I don't mean

880
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,560
need to mention names but in the alternative media and in the mainstream

881
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,060
media you have the big mainstream concerns right that you you know you look

882
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,860
up you know what right news or and the alternative and and and what's more

883
01:11:53,860 --> 01:12:00,420
pathetic is the alternative feature yes and they're just as dumb and wasteful and

884
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:06,000
ignorant and just you just I listened to this past couple of weeks a little by

885
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,620
little I just leave it on the back while I'm beating on stuff and making

886
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,960
spark plugs and things I'm actually making a set of spark plugs I'm going to

887
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,040
be sending as a prototype for someone to work they're working there's silver

888
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:24,800
material in them so so I'm listening to the stuff on the internet and I'm like

889
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,960
you know I listened to this particular show for an hour you know someone did a

890
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:35,180
production and what did I get out of it nothing if you know what it well how

891
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:40,720
does it help me how can you know nothing I mean well oh yeah right you

892
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,140
know okay so this person said this but in you know I'm like what is wrong with

893
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:49,560
you people you know well I know it's about the same as the food you eat it and

894
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,640
you're still filled with emptiness you have no nutrition God knows what it does to

895
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:02,800
your God knows what it's doing otherwise internally can't be pretty I'm trying to

896
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,100
keep the criticism anonymous because I could start naming names of this guy

897
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:11,060
that guy that girl whatever certainly but it doesn't matter because it's all

898
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,840
of them they're all like that I'm not gonna sit and rain 25 million or 1

899
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:20,280
billion things on the internet it's all junk out there and there's a lot of good

900
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:27,360
corn but it's it's it's inside of poop and when is there going to be a more

901
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,920
sequestered you know just good corn somewhere so I don't know I don't think

902
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,600
that's ever really going to happen believe it or not but I think that I

903
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,760
think that when you when anyone does get the opportunity to be able to convey and

904
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:47,500
impart something that makes what someone is doing better immediately with what

905
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:53,480
they have available to them that's the ticket so with that set up you guys got

906
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,960
at least the nickels worth this time again and thanks thank you yes you're

907
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,280
welcome thanks for archiving this and we'll do it again soon

908
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:09,600
yes maybe just to let everyone know according to Sam his schedule is he's

909
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,680
off on what they call Tuesdays somewhere in Europe so maybe we'll get a lot of

910
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,880
good feedback because he's able to sit there like a little brat even though you

911
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,380
know he's pretty good guy and he's very well I call him a brat because a brat

912
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:30,020
gets focused on one thing and in it in it it doesn't seem like there's a lot of

913
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:36,180
leeway and that's good he's a good gent I like the fella yeah he brings a lot to

914
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,920
the table that's right that's right and it's in a brat like way which is

915
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:45,720
necessary because when you focus like that like he likes to focus on a theme

916
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:52,860
in a subject it gets it gets a lot done on that subject where it's in yes right

917
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:57,240
where myself you know I'm able to do this parallel thinking of so many things

918
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,300
at the same time and see the interconnectedness of these things and I

919
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,900
can't say everything at the same time so a lot you know so it's good to just

920
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:09,140
abandon most of the things that I the way I personally work and focus on the

921
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:13,080
way someone else would like things focused on and that's where Sam comes in

922
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:17,160
on that yes so that would be in what they call Tuesdays so if that could and

923
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:22,040
that happens to be the same day this is just conveniently placed for me that I'm

924
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:30,340
I'm well and can do such thing during the work week and so that's all good

925
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,860
that's all good yeah we'll see so that was just a real reference on these

926
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,240
irregular regular irregularities that happen exactly Sonic events correct so

927
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,400
okay so with that said hope you guys got at least a nickel's worth whatever the

928
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,220
exchange rate is wherever and oh by the way some people have been asking me

929
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:51,860
about a cryptocurrency anything like that and you know that's within this

930
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,040
sphere of Greek speak there's no reason to ask what I think of cryptocurrency

931
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,260
simply because the question to ask the person who's asking that question is

932
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:06,760
what is it lawful money and the answer to that is well it's right it's not so

933
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,600
it doesn't matter so it doesn't matter if it's dog poo or pig poo or cow poo

934
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:17,900
guess what it's still poo and believe it or not a certain amount of pig well

935
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,560
yeah and certain poo does fetch on the market you know for compost but others is

936
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:31,460
reviled and yeah so yeah just stuff to think about mindset folks all right well

937
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,240
be well thanks again Bruce yes you take care yes we will you take care now
