1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:15,540
Here we go, we can go on, man.

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,440
Just the Greek.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,620
And greeting folks, and we're live with the Greek.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,120
And good evening.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,500
Greetings.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,420
How are you doing?

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,320
Doing okay.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,000
Excellent.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,600
And we're streaming.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,220
This is the other, this is the backyard outhouse streams or whatever that Bruce has been running.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:53,580
And I don't know if we've got, we have a new chat, so I would like mentioning that because people do ask, you know, I didn't know there was a new chat because they somehow bookmarked the Sonic events, right?

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,300
And they don't know there's another chat unless they hear me say it.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,800
And the reason we left, eventually there was just a couple of trolls and one 40-year-old that lives at home with his mom just decided to hang around for a week and make everyone's life miserable.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,260
So we started a new chat.

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,540
So if you're interested in that new chat, you email UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,760
It's a numeric one and we'll tell you where it is.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,340
So we normally, people come in and listen to these streams and we get quite a few, right Bruce?

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Based on the server, based on- Yep.

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,940
Based on the server and activities, and it's been going strong and steady since that last event by the way.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:45,500
And it has not let up, you know, you have your low areas like right, you know, in your very early morning hours, but after that it picks right up and it's been going since.

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
So that's good.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,180
That means there's people paying attention.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:02:01,120
And I'll give you a little highlight, Greg, I had a fellow over here last night for doing a repair on his laptop, he had a Windows 10, was locked out of it basically.

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:09,240
And I started talking to him about some of your stuff and I says, who was first black or who was the first president in the United States?

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,560
And this is a black gentleman by the way.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,820
And I told him here, I got your laptop fixed, go ahead and type that in on Google.

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,940
And you know how they do those double takes?

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,400
This boy did a triple.

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,660
And you guys probably can't hear me yet.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,640
I hear you just fine, how are you doing?

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,380
Okay, there we go.

32
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah, something, just a glitch on my end.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:45,900
So we've mentioned in the chat we have someone else with us tonight and we'll bring them on if anyone else is familiar with Greek speak, you probably heard the early days with Ocelli and the Greek and no drum roll necessary, no applaud necessary.

34
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,740
Welcome, here comes Jersey in the house, Chuck Ocelli.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Chuck, how are you, man?

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,800
Oh, well, I'm about as well as can be expected.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,260
My friend, yeah, I do have the Jersey accent, that's for sure.

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,740
I'll just pick it out, yeah.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
No, it's okay.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,560
Look, I bring it out of you too.

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,880
So we sound a little bit similar now and then.

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,180
Not at all.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
Anyway, sorry.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,140
Here I am.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,980
Yes, indeed.

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,520
And good to be with you tonight.

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,340
Yeah, cool.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:23,260
This is just like a set of, just imagine Skype calls that Bruce happens to put up on a server and whoever goes into chat accesses them and they've been getting out far and wide.

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,500
So the reason I brought you on might as well.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,620
So you messaged tonight that you're doing some stuff.

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,440
You want to just tell everybody what you're doing.

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,700
I mean, you got, you're producing now on your own and you're doing the Ocelli effect, right?

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,260
It's still called the Ocelli effect, right?

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,480
So yeah.

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,160
Sure is.

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,920
Well, yeah, I was just letting you know.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,780
But hey, we might as well let everybody who is listening know that, yeah, I'm now self-produced over there.

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:56,160
I have the 24-7 stream as well with, you know, things that I decide to load into it, which are generally just my shows.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,080
But a bit of music as well.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,240
I get stuff from independent artists who are not necessarily part of the corporate structure of things out there that I appreciate.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,400
Friends of mine, things like that, play their music a little.

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,660
But mostly it's for my shows and I do my live events over there.

63
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,839
And now I'm actually handling, you know, the mixing, the board, everything independently, fully.

64
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,480
So it is a fully functional network.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,920
I think of that scene in Star Wars.

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
This is a fully operational battle station.

67
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,220
So ocelli.com has now become exactly that.

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,500
So yeah, I'm really glad about it.

69
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:36,940
Thank you.

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,760
And hopefully you'll crest the tide of all the sewage of the independent media.

71
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,440
Need a good surfboard and ride away or ride on top of it.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,380
Don't fall into it.

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,880
Yes, I do give advice.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,100
But yeah, so how do people get to it?

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
The simplest way.

76
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,140
Simplest way?

77
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:04,380
Well, if you have one of those, what they allegedly call a smartphone, you can easily get it through one of those radio apps like TuneIn and you just look for Ocelli.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,100
Pretty simple.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,960
But if you wanted to go directly to my website, it's ocelli.com, spelled O-C-H-E-L-L-I, dot com, obviously.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,620
Then you just go to listen live and like I said, the stream is there.

81
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:26,300
And according to that wind up toy they call a clock, at 8 p.m. on the eastern coast of the United States, guess what?

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:38,000
Every weekday, according to the Pope's work schedule, Monday through Friday, you can get me for two hours live and like I said, the stream does it the rest of the time.

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,220
So there you go.

84
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,220
Always believe it.

85
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,240
Get all the important stuff out as fast as possible in case life gets that short, right?

86
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,260
Exactly.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,740
So okay, cool.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,880
And basically, just a message, we don't really speak much and socialize and all that but

89
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:06,360
we did spend a lot of hours and not prenuptially either, meaning there was nothing there other

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,160
than we were showing up and doing it for two hours, and that's not the civiest, but showing

91
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,620
up and doing the audio stuff over at AFR and wherever else and for, I don't know, a combination

92
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,820
of at least 80 hours or 40 hours, more than that, let's see, 18 and 12, yeah, roughly

93
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,720
60 hours of stuff.

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,740
Easily.

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,480
Yeah, so 60 hours we did that we put out into this insanity known as the, I call it the internet or the stupid rectangle, right?

96
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,200
And believe it or not, a lot of people still use it as reference material for Greek-speak, you know what I mean?

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,340
So on that end, you did a lot of good work with me on that.

98
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,800
Thank you.

99
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,360
I use it as an introductory to help people get briefed on where to go and all this stuff.

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:09,920
And all those sonic events from back then are a very good stepping stone for people to get introduced to, have you ever really seen this?

101
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,160
Have you ever questioned it?

102
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,960
And it works very well.

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:26,100
Yeah, I find that it certainly has proven to be one of those things that I've done that causes people to begin to question a great many things.

104
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,620
You know, again, what did we start with?

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,040
The thing that is a constant concern, well, what day is it, you know?

106
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,100
And you notice, I still mention, by the way, at the top of every single show, I always say allegedly according to the calendar, this is what date it is, that thing we call a calendar.

107
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,700
And that is a reference to that, as a matter of fact.

108
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,280
How many people come back and say, what do you mean by that, Charles?

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Or Chuck?

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm sorry about the Charles thing, but Chuck, yeah?

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,540
No, very few.

112
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,840
Very, very few.

113
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,780
Yeah.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,300
No one's paying attention.

115
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:10,140
Well, that's the interesting thing, is that over and over again, we find that people are not paying attention to, well, anything, it seems like.

116
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,520
Anything of substance, I should say.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
And it doesn't matter what area of interest it is.

118
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,080
It doesn't matter if it's, you know, food, you did a lot of things with Seth about food and stuff like that, which was really great.

119
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,440
I mean, we did a little bit on that.

120
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:33,960
We also did a really excellent event on water that, you know, is another thing that people don't pay very much attention to.

121
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:45,300
Speaking of that, you know, one of the things I'm going to be doing this coming week, allegedly, is that a focus on Flint, Michigan still.

122
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,720
Why?

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Because this has dropped out of the mainstream and alternative stream, if you will.

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,300
And that is an ongoing issue for people.

125
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,660
You know, what's interesting about that, I had that come across the desk here, let's say, right?

126
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:10,280
The proverbial, you know, when something comes in front of you, about seven or eight years ago, really six years ago, let's see, what's 2011, what they call, yeah, so it's about right.

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,000
Right.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And not for them, but in that area, we did a demo and they sent us some sample water and we sent the water back and they said, this is great.

129
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,000
And when we showed them how it was done, they all went silent because there was nothing to buy.

130
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,180
I mean, you buy something to clean up the water, but you don't have to buy it again.

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,660
Once you buy it, it's done, right?

132
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:45,280
And it uses a media, you know, a media, the water has to pass over certain different types of materials, but those materials don't ever deplete themselves, you know, like, you know, people have to throw away the water filter and get a new one after a period of time.

133
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,280
So it freaked them out and went away.

134
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,620
And I had predicted all of this when I was asked to do some water samples for that area, not Flint, Michigan.

135
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:03,740
And here's the thing that, you know, or that area of Michigan gets all the play, but there's a lot of other places nearby that have different constituents in the water.

136
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,320
Maybe not as bad, but just as bad generally, right?

137
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
You wouldn't want to drink it, meaning, right?

138
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,780
It's not drinkable.

139
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:26,020
Well, in fact, if people are really paying attention and they were actually checking the contents of the water, there is anywhere from 300 to 3000 communities that are probably in the same shape as Flint, if not worse, depending on how it is you want to put it on the scale.

140
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,380
So truthfully, there's a lot of areas where water needs to be improved.

141
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,380
If people are going to consume it, certainly it would be advisable for a lot of things to be gotten out of it.

142
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:49,940
I mean, and we're not even discussing the nuclear waste issue or, you know, the chemical contaminants that have been leached into the ground via this, that, the third thing.

143
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,100
I mean, literally speaking, there are water systems all over the place that because of their, what should we call it?

144
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,260
Let's say, lack of management.

145
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:02,800
Yeah.

146
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,840
Well, I think it's management.

147
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah.

148
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,780
And decomposition, right?

149
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,580
Well, it's like a sick body.

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,780
If you keep doing what you're doing, you're going to stay sick.

151
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,880
So the easiest way to heal something is just change your behavior.

152
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:22,680
No doctor is going to tell you what your behavior is because they only know you for the short visit or whatever history you put down on what looks like a government form.

153
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:33,380
So, but in essence at this point, and from a remedial point of view, the water can be cleaned up instantly, and they just don't want it.

154
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
It just goes across the board.

155
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,240
It's not just the water, it's all around, right?

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Informationally, I think the biggest problem is the way the mind or the spirit is guided, right?

157
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,200
You know, you guide that with words and thoughts and sentiments, right?

158
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,300
So, but here's the thing.

159
00:11:52,460 --> 00:12:01,520
If you've got bad water in the physical world, everything else in the physicality of that world falls apart, believe it or not.

160
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,060
Whether you're drinking it or not, your food quality goes down and the actual environment becomes toxic, just like if you go near a swamp, how it stinks.

161
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,100
So yeah, it's not for this society.

162
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,420
But give another example, and this is sort of bragging rights.

163
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Could you imagine going to a petrochemical company, and you know how they skim off all the water on the oil that goes to the top, and they skim it off, and it's still constituents in the water?

164
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:36,300
Could you imagine assembling a device where they run the oily water, which smells like rotten eggs, the SO2, sulfur hydroxide, and all that stuff?

165
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,400
Could you imagine sending the oil to the bottom, and on top you have crystal clear drinkable water?

166
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Could you imagine what happens to the engineers when they see that?

167
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh my.

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,220
Because oil always goes to the top, right?

169
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,660
Yeah, well, I mean, again, you know a little bit of my background.

170
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:01,140
I've actually worked in that industry, and that would be one of those things that they would not believe if they saw it happen.

171
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Yeah, they have, yeah.

172
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,320
And we used to do that, actually.

173
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:17,300
There's a quote-unquote secret website around, it's in Asia, and they have all the samples and the stuff, because this was going to be used, you know, the largest petrochemical processing companies in the world are in China.

174
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,300
People would say, well, it doesn't sound right, because we never heard about it, right?

175
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,180
So anyway.

176
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:33,860
Yeah, but then again, I dare anyone to understand that there's a great many things happening in China that they've never heard about, you know, so.

177
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:43,740
Yeah, well, let's give a quick history, because I used to communicate with this guy who was an Air Force guy, I wouldn't say all the way up, but high colonel, you know, whatever.

178
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,540
And whenever you bring up China, he says, oh, no, that's America's mortal enemy, and I always just have to give them the five-minute history lesson, and anyone could look this up.

179
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,680
What happened during the early FDR administration, they were promoting communism, yes, you heard me say it.

180
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:13,620
And what they went in there is they promoted, they went through various false flag operations and subversion operations to meddle with the affairs of the Chinese and the Japanese in the 30s, who were basically at war in various capacities, right?

181
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:23,320
So FDR went there, and he set up the communist government, no, it's not that the communist governments got together and FDR supported it, no, FDR set it up.

182
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:42,780
And if anyone wants to go and look at old World War II posters or 1930s posters, you'll see a cartoon of FDR and a government poster shaking, you know, someone in a communist, the party, socialist party uniform, that we have to create this to fight Japan, right?

183
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,180
This is in the 1930s now.

184
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,500
Everyone thinks fighting Japan started in 41.

185
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:54,640
So they ousted the monarchy in China to the island of Formosa, Taiwan, which was given to them from Japan, right?

186
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:04,300
And China was completely started, as it is today, by FDR. That's why even today they have what's called the one China policy.

187
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,140
There is no official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, right?

188
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:19,220
When you say, when the Americans diplomatically deal with that part of the world known as China, they include Taiwan, but they don't have any direct diplomatic official recognition.

189
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:30,900
So when people say they, because the Chinese are communists, this, that, and the other, its entire inception started in what's called Washington DC in the FDR administration.

190
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,300
It sounds kind of bizarre, I know.

191
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,780
But if you start looking at history from the 1930s, you'll find that.

192
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:48,660
So I just wanted to throw that in there because, you know, the mentality is schizophrenic when you say China, well, they're communists, we're not, so we're enemies, or how can we be working so closely together?

193
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,080
So I just want to throw that in there.

194
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,440
Anyway, is everybody still here?

195
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,410
Yeah, I am.

196
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,410
I just, I had to call them and Skype wouldn't allow me to get out of it there for a second.

197
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,090
So that's fine.

198
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,310
Sorry about that.

199
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:13,290
But the Middle East is really where it's going to happen, but it's going to happen in a way that you're, you know, it'll have to be normal, right?

200
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:26,270
Well, I'd like to step back on something you just said a moment ago, because here's, here's where, you know, you and I can converge a bit and maybe roll this one around because it's about awareness as far as I'm concerned.

201
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:54,030
The Roosevelt family, indeed, have been very curiously linked to a lot of the establishments of various governments, the overthrow of various governments, a hugely significant family that is not often brought up when people start discussing all of their conspiracy theories and things about those who actually run the world.

202
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,570
You know, somebody might say, well, that sounds a little bit out of line, Greek.

203
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,670
That can't be true because, you know, the Roosevelt's fine.

204
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:11,329
You have these two here that were president at one time and this and that, and maybe, you know, somebody's grandson went and did something, this kind of thing.

205
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:22,310
But the truth is that if you start to really take a look at the genealogical family tree there, they, for a very long time, played a significant role.

206
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,970
Now, I don't know what that really means, why it is in particular that family line did that.

207
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,650
I haven't gotten that far in my studies.

208
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:30,650
The Delanos.

209
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:38,170
Look at the Delano, not the Roosevelt name, more, and you'll see the Delano stretches into various, you know, the tree, you know what I mean?

210
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:38,810
Right.

211
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,310
Okay, so you knew that, right?

212
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,350
But essentially, yeah, instead of looking for Roosevelt, you'll see who else had Delano family in them.

213
00:17:46,350 --> 00:18:01,190
But the interesting thing is what the hypocrisy within the moderation of moderncy, being modern, contemporary, you know how I say that, you know, the world, everyone says the world's going to end in a week, and when it doesn't, you ask them why, you know, I said that was last week, it doesn't matter.

214
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,310
But they were freaking out at the time.

215
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:13,570
To put the Roosevelt's, well, the entire hypocrisy of the independent alternative media assess pool is this, in a nutshell.

216
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,950
They're all complaining.

217
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:28,990
I shouldn't say all, but typically in the political side of the conspiratology, alternative and independent media, that you're always going to hear what being brought up, the Bushes and the Clintons.

218
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:42,170
And I am telling you, based on the facts, that the Bushes and the Clinton families and dynasties are Cub Scouts, not even Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts compared to what FDR had going on in the 1930s.

219
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,690
No, absolutely true.

220
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,990
That's why I always find it laughable.

221
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:57,730
Certainly they're worthy of mention because they are relatable figures that people have seen images of and know who they are, but they're not the real big players.

222
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:08,010
And I've tried to explain this over and over again, and quite honestly, people are way too satisfied with their easily repeatable nonsense.

223
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:15,970
And again, this is why I refuse the label alternative entirely now.

224
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,370
I've even removed the idea of being the alternatives alternative from my website and things.

225
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,430
Literally now, the slogan is the revelation through conversation.

226
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,310
Well, the alternatives alternative was good while it lasted though.

227
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:39,950
Well, I thought it was fair enough, but then when I started thinking about it, I don't even want to be the alternative to that nonsense, because as you said, what is the alternative to a cesspool?

228
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,150
Well, it might be a leach field, and it still stinks.

229
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,290
So not digging it.

230
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,670
Yeah, but the bottom line, that's humanity.

231
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,330
That's what they want, you see?

232
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,050
You know, that's the sad thing.

233
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,710
That's the sad lesson, right?

234
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:06,930
Is that when taking a look at these things, and if I started to really dig into and went into the entire genealogy and went in the direction, which by the way, you know you've just bought me another week's worth of research, right?

235
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,010
By telling me to look at the Delano name instead of Roosevelt.

236
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:18,290
But the thing is, you try and tell people this, and they dismiss it because it doesn't sound like the crap they're used to.

237
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:43,690
You know, it's just, people become accustomed to anything, even if it is toxic, even if it is poisonous, and again, back to the water, well, it makes entirely good sense that people want to drink poisoned water, actually, because that would be one of the most essential elements there is in life, most misunderstood, and you don't get to continue on very many days without it.

238
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,810
A lot of other things you can live without outside of that, and it is so essential.

239
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,070
Of course, people are going to ignore exactly how it's delivered, where it comes from.

240
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:23,450
All they want to know is that they can twist a spigot and something that appears to be right is given to them, and this is one of those things that I've always understood, in a way, but quite honestly, it's through discussions with you that they become so blatantly obvious to me that this is not exactly the planet I wish to be on, considering who seems to be in charge.

241
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,430
Well, the thing is, who's in charge is fitting.

242
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,250
I have no problem with the people in charge.

243
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,570
I have a problem with the gods that the people worship.

244
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,930
Let me say that again.

245
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,110
This sounds convoluted.

246
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,830
This is not plus or minus, this is like quadratics, right?

247
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:55,690
You got order of operations, you know, you can't just attack the math problem straight on, you have to look at the order of operations, multiplication and division first, right?

248
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,770
So it literally meant that way.

249
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,790
The gods that the people have brought into their lives, literally, what rules their lives

250
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:10,330
from the calendrical system to their holidays, to their houses of worship, to their laws

251
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:17,570
is the problem, because now they become hostage to that, and if anyone thinks that a spiritual

252
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,590
being cannot take control of someone else's mind, even in plural, a group of people's

253
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,570
mind is totally ignorant of that realm, right?

254
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:36,090
So once that happens, it's obvious that the leadership is going to be extracted from that group.

255
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:57,030
Now, if you had a leader, let's say, that came from another planet, like, you know, the aliens invade from another planet in the sci-fi movies and you have an alien king or whatever, yeah, that, you know, then I would say the leader is the problem, but essentially the function here is the gods that the people have chosen are the problem.

256
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:06,370
And because of that, there might, you see, so, but that's a tall statement for most people, because you're talking about something they know what?

257
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,770
Nothing about.

258
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,050
And that's on top of other problems.

259
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:18,310
You have Satan, which is on top of them, gods that they're bringing into their lives.

260
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,310
So you're, you're convoluting the problem.

261
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,630
Well, here's a simple way to do it.

262
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,270
Imagine you saw, you had spiritual eye, right?

263
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:35,290
You know how people can see auras and, you know, I'm not going to say it, but let's just say there are people that could see things on people like a parasite.

264
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:45,430
Like imagine, imagine an 18 inch tall anthropomorphic figure on someone's shoulder all the time, but no one else could see it, but you can see it in the room, right?

265
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,650
Kind of freaky.

266
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,130
But anyway, yes, a parasite hanging on, right?

267
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,090
Okay.

268
00:23:51,310 --> 00:24:00,350
But so if that's what, that's what you have on the people, but the planet itself now from a spiritual point of view, from let's say a super fantasy point of view, right?

269
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,430
Release your mind from what you're used to seeing.

270
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,710
Imagine each planet that could be habitable, meaning some form of terraforma has a throne over it.

271
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,550
And just like, what is it?

272
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,210
What is it?

273
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,290
The Knights of, was it King Arthur, whoever, whoever can pull the sword out of the rock has the power, right?

274
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,830
Or whatever.

275
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,530
Well, whoever physically occupies that throne is now king of that planet.

276
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,110
That's how the game works.

277
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:36,290
You remember our children, you know, you know, you have to make it to home base, whoever touches it first or musical chairs, it's not whether you have the authority or not at this point.

278
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,570
So the earth has a throne.

279
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,510
I know this sounds Greek.

280
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,690
You need some, you know, you know, you have whatever vivid imagination, right?

281
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,830
That's what most people are going to say.

282
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,730
The earth has a throne and guess who sits in that throne is the adversary.

283
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,370
Now what is given to the nations are the sons of gods, lesser gods or different rank.

284
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:04,350
And their job is to create the borders and the boundaries and the nationalities of the people.

285
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:16,290
You know, like if you removed all the borders in Europe, you know, obviously Europe is very different than Asia or Africa, but within Europe you have specific borders of all the various countries.

286
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,410
There's a God over that does that.

287
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:24,070
People look at geographic maps and they think it's just, you know, ink squirt on paper or pixels on a screen now, right?

288
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,590
I'm telling you there is an entity behind that.

289
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:35,330
So that's something that is not for this audience, only for the well-studied one, not the religious ones, by the way.

290
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,350
So I just wanted to bring that up.

291
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:49,570
So because when Bruce, you interjected, you know, Satan or the adversary, and when you say Satan, hopefully it doesn't bring any kind of a Hollywood vision or meme in mind, because that's all false.

292
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,750
Yeah.

293
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,130
Yeah.

294
00:25:51,130 --> 00:26:05,870
He's actually, if you were to encounter a being known as the adversary, he would be the most attractive being to you, but you would find him being contrary to almost everything that you said.

295
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,110
You said up, he'd say down.

296
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,270
You say pretty, he says ugly.

297
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,150
You say hot, he says cold, and indirectly.

298
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,330
So and then you have the nation.

299
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,730
So when you have like the United States or Canada or all the various, what is it, 300,

300
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,810
185 countries officially, and it's really like 300 or 200 and something countries, that's

301
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:30,730
right there as several hundred other minor entities, which we know historically of the

302
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,290
future, there's some place in some ancient writ that talks about the entire world will

303
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,030
come under this goddess religion that has principles and morals and ethics that came

304
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,630
out of Babylon, let's say, right?

305
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,810
And you see that personified in law.

306
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,410
So anyway, that's the visuals of that.

307
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,770
Oh, of course.

308
00:26:50,090 --> 00:27:11,070
You know, with that in mind, I have something that I'd like to bring up here, which is a topic I'm beginning to wrestle with during some of my discussions, and to be quite honest with you, very few people want to engage on it, because they only go so far with the discussion.

309
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:19,810
They don't get into the esoteric aspects of it so much as I would like them to, because I'd like to hear some ideas about it.

310
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:47,690
I've been looking at artificial intelligence in general, and this concept that there are individuals who are, through their work, bringing this to fruition or have brought it to fruition or are still bringing it to fruition, depending on how it is you look at it, quite honestly, who have stated quite boldly and publicly that they do not believe in a god, but they are creating it.

311
00:27:49,210 --> 00:28:07,970
On the one hand, I figure this is, you know, hubris, but on the other hand, I also find it to be logical, and here's a hint, by the way, anything which seems to have an order, whether you understand it or not, generally does have some entity tied to it.

312
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:19,670
So, there's a quick hint, by the way, when looking at a map and you say, well, there's some kind of order here, it doesn't really make sense, it seems to be a bit chaotic, whatever, as far as the borders being drawn.

313
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,490
No, there's an order to it, it's just not in your language, it's in theirs.

314
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:36,030
So here's the thing, when people talk about this and the ethereal aspects of it, they don't want to go very far.

315
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,170
Some people just want to deal with it as, I'm either scared of it or I'm not, I think it's a great thing.

316
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:54,890
Okay, let me interject something in here, which might direct, because eventually when you bring up AI, what's the second thing that comes up once the conversation starts to get more on the basis of what AI is based on?

317
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,990
What's the second thing, and I'll say it, it's what's called quantum computing, right?

318
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,570
You've heard of that?

319
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:00,910
Okay.

320
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,290
Yes.

321
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,710
And there's no one that can explain what that is, just like derivatives.

322
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,630
I can explain it, but I'm not at this point, it's so simple, it's ridiculous.

323
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:16,890
But if you're going to get into what quantum is overall, you hear that term, quantum physics and all this, right?

324
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:17,610
Right.

325
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,770
That's quackery.

326
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:24,070
So what you're experiencing, let me just go back now with the AI, it's just computers.

327
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:32,530
Now the difference between that is this, there's a mindset behind it, and this is why I keep speaking.

328
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:39,050
There's plenty of places you can get information if you know how to sort it, but the problem is the mindset, and that's what I like to discuss.

329
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,790
Where is your mind?

330
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,330
Does it get your mind out of the gutter?

331
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,410
That means you're insidious, let's say, you don't have to say it, but there's a mindset.

332
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,350
Okay, the mindset is very, very simple.

333
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,450
Let's put AI on the side, we'll go back to it in 30 seconds.

334
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,070
Other than AI, about a couple of years ago with all these false flags, what was the big discussion?

335
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,790
Second Amendment firearms, right?

336
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,010
Guns, this and that, right?

337
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,610
Sure.

338
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,750
Okay, now let's just stop for a second, and what is a gun?

339
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:13,070
Isn't it launching a high-speed projectile previously done with tension, like a catapult or an arrow, bow and arrow?

340
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,390
Slingshot, sure.

341
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,370
Yeah, right.

342
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,090
And then that form of mechanical tension got replaced with what?

343
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,530
High-speed chemistry.

344
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:30,990
You have a chemical compound, then it goes into a reaction, but instead of slow, it happens in so fast that it creates the shockwave to move the projectile.

345
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,690
Early projectiles were what?

346
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:43,690
You want to get into the ball and powder, and then you got into the cartridge bullet, and then you got into multiple firing machine guns to Gatling guns.

347
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,090
That's what's going on with computers.

348
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:53,310
What they're doing is sidestepping you with the idea of quantum physics, like for example, you know the double slit experiment they always talk about?

349
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,130
And they say, well, that's quantum.

350
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,490
If you're watching the experiment, the result is one way, but if you're not watching it, it's another way.

351
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,250
It shows your consciousness is affecting it.

352
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,950
It has a complete scam.

353
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,930
Yeah, I went into a box recently, and I had that experiment.

354
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,610
It doesn't happen.

355
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,910
That's a scam.

356
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,210
No one can reproduce that.

357
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,990
It's a lie.

358
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,850
That's why they only show you computer renderings of it.

359
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:23,390
You can do it yourself, and everyone buys into it, like 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters turn the World Trade Center into dust, and they buy into it.

360
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:30,790
But if you show them, it's the same thing with the prism that you see on the Pink Floyd album breaking up the...

361
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,570
That's not what happens when you put white light.

362
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,730
The spectrum doesn't break up like that at all.

363
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:46,970
You get a dark band and a white band, a dark band and a white band, and right where the black band meets the white band, you have a very narrow fringe of the spectrum happening, and I've gotten to what light is before that.

364
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,230
Okay, so quantum.

365
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,210
Whenever you hear, by the way, I'm harsh, and I don't mince words because life is short.

366
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,350
We don't go 400 or 500 years.

367
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,750
The mark of an idiot is when you see quantum coming out of their mouth serious.

368
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,370
Now I'm not saying they're going to die an idiot.

369
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,570
Chances are they will.

370
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,650
But at that moment, up until that point in their life, they were a moron.

371
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,010
I've met some people that used to push the quantum bullshit, and then I showed it to them, and some of them said, oh man.

372
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:23,890
So they were an idiot up until that point, not because I say so, but objectively, because if you believe in something as a science, and it's utterly a show, a magic show, you're a moron.

373
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:24,970
You're right?

374
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,270
Okay.

375
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:32,530
So what they're doing, now you got the quantum part is out, so what are they really doing with these computers?

376
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,690
Well, what are they really doing with a Gatling gun versus a ball and powder?

377
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,030
You see, it's highly efficient.

378
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:45,730
It's mechanized for force multiplication through mechanization.

379
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,510
That's all it is.

380
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:54,630
Now what happens, though, but you can't take a bunch of rifles and spin a Gatling gun because it's going to get too hot, and they're going to melt and blow up on you like the early World War I ones.

381
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,210
So you have to now redesign the barrel, and you need better metallurgy, you need better timing devices, right?

382
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,750
Speedwell made the timing devices.

383
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,870
You remember, I worked with a guy that was an engineer at Speedwell.

384
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,730
Do you remember the machine guns used to shoot right through the propeller, the single prop planes, right?

385
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,510
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:12,850
Right.

387
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,470
Yeah, and it didn't blow the prop off.

388
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,530
You see that, right?

389
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:23,350
Well, there's a timing device there, and that timing device better not wear out because you'll shear your own propeller off, right?

390
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,430
Okay, that was designed by Speedwell.

391
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:36,030
So it's not that simple, but what I'm telling you, what's going on with this now, let's just say, why are they pushing the quantum quackery with the computers and all this?

392
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:41,870
Because they've reached a height where they don't know how to go any further.

393
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:51,970
So because for so many years, everyone has been looking at, oh, we're getting advancements technology every 18 months or six months doubling, they've reached a stale point, okay?

394
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,670
So now they're like, oh, we have to make stuff up.

395
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,870
And here's an example of where this happened.

396
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:09,969
Now prior to the automobile, the bus and the airplane, you had the two modes of transportation were steam liner, ocean liners, and on land, it was locomotive or railroad, right?

397
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:17,290
And if you even, unless you were totally broke and you couldn't afford that, because they even there had third class if you were totally steerage.

398
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:29,770
Okay, right before they, when they knew with the development of the automobile and the petrochemicals and all this, and they changed the, they knew the convention was going to change, what did they do with the railroad cars right before they went out?

399
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,510
What happened to them?

400
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,929
They became over-opulent.

401
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,570
Go look at, of course they did, yeah, they, they, they made them extremely comfortable.

402
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,409
They added extensive dining cars, sleeping areas.

403
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:49,510
You can practically live in the things, embellished, yeah, over-embellished, okay.

404
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,750
So what you're seeing with the computing now, and, and because I'm, I'm just getting a little deeper now.

405
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,070
You said you, people don't want to go under that quantum bullshit's always going to be coming up.

406
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,470
Whenever you hear that, it's, we lie and you're going to swear to it, right?

407
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,070
Okay, so what's really- They're just trying to get as much profit out of it as they can.

408
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,910
Keep the hype going.

409
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,530
Well, it's all about, okay, why does a stock, you ever watch, you ever hear about how stock prices work?

410
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,590
If the president says coal is bad, it's public opinion, right, within the media control.

411
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,730
What happens to coal stock?

412
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,390
It goes down.

413
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:24,830
Yeah.

414
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:30,110
If the president says coal is good and we have a good way to do it now, what happens to coal stock?

415
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,610
It goes up.

416
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,310
So it's stock.

417
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,630
Everybody's like, I've got stock in him because he speaks well, for example.

418
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,590
So they don't want their stocks coming down.

419
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:47,970
What they're doing is they're miniaturizing, and I have firsthand experience of this because recently from, well, anyway, I work with certain design work sometimes with audio equipment, let's say.

420
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:54,330
And I recently, we came up with a, we found out a little problem was too, we didn't know why this part of the board was burning out.

421
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,190
So I looked into it and with the help of someone else, it was an overheating problem.

422
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:05,230
And he said that this is a diode and a resistor in one, and it is smaller.

423
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,150
I couldn't see it with the naked eye.

424
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:20,870
Now typically the value, yeah, the value of this diode and the value of this resistor, minimum that I had seen it even two years ago was at least each the size of a grain of rice.

425
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:22,310
Yeah.

426
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:28,470
And right now they're a hundred times smaller and you're supposed to remove it from the board with a soldering iron.

427
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,190
I'm like, what's soldering iron?

428
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,070
This is, this is what's called weight.

429
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,770
They use wave solder.

430
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,630
It's called wave soldering machines, right?

431
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,730
It's like a microwave laser type that you can't, it's not serviceable.

432
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:45,810
So it's the same technology that if you busted open a circuit board 80 years ago, same stuff.

433
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:57,630
It is, it is 10,000 times smaller because I think you could fit 10,000 of these duplex devices inside of a device, you know, that would normally go to RadioShack and buy a diode and a resistor.

434
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,250
Yeah.

435
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,510
Okay.

436
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:13,970
So what they're doing is they're able to miniaturize this stuff now and, and you know what's kicking the AI also is the robotics aspect of it with that latest anthropomorphic Susie, Sarah Sue, whatever.

437
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:19,030
Sophia, Sophia actually, which has an interesting connotation to it alone, but go ahead.

438
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:19,790
Okay.

439
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:27,930
But here, how much more evolved is this AI or that robot than let's say the brand new LG or Samsung cell phone?

440
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,730
Not much.

441
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,090
The same.

442
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,450
You can talk to the cell phone.

443
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,970
You could, you see what I mean?

444
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:32,790
Yeah.

445
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,670
It'll answer back.

446
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,110
Or how much more evolved is that Sophia thing than that Curie?

447
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,130
What's that thing that Amazon, you talk to it and it talks back to you, Alexa, Alexa.

448
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,690
Okay.

449
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,110
Yeah.

450
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,850
Curie's Apple.

451
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,150
Sorry.

452
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,730
Yeah.

453
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,070
Right.

454
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,370
How much more evolved, it's the same stuff.

455
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,110
Now let's go back.

456
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:58,710
When this AI stuff comes up, I did, I saw in chat and other places, people talking about AI said, okay, these morons are, there's something in the news about AI, I better go look at it.

457
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,450
And lo and behold, there's all these, that's the, that's the story this week, right?

458
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,030
Not the missing airplane and not the corrupt politician, right?

459
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,690
It's the AI.

460
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,710
Okay.

461
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,930
And just to bring people back to earth, right?

462
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,150
I mean, well, actually you want to get away from earth, but to come back to reality, because

463
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,150
what's going on, but what I'm saying is to bring, you know what I did, Chuck, when they

464
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,970
brought the, I dropped in a couple of links on references and how the Greeks had robots

465
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:30,330
2000 years ago, albeit crude, they use steam, pulleys, weights, water pouring from one

466
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,510
side to the other to displace the center of gravity.

467
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,150
So it appeared to be a fluid motion, no pun intended.

468
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,750
You know what I mean?

469
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,450
Right.

470
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,870
Because weight has water, right?

471
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:46,070
If you lean, if you have a hollow statue with different geometric cavities, if you move the water from one side to the other, the arm will go up on one side and down on the other.

472
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:46,510
You know what I mean?

473
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,990
So what they were doing, the reason I brought this up is because the early churches in the

474
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,550
second, third, fourth century in Europe, you know, when the Romans got a hold of them,

475
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,490
they got all the crowds because they would have a throne and like someone that would

476
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:07,710
be like a robot or a wooden statue of a bishop with a crown would sit on the throne and

477
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,010
stand up and sit down and people would put money to see this.

478
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,170
This is a thousand years, well, 1800 years ago they were doing this, right?

479
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,870
So what's the difference right now?

480
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,370
Well, the difference right now is you're getting it with the nine or 12 year old mentality that you see.

481
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,170
So not much going on over there with the AI stuff.

482
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,370
And you know how I know?

483
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:41,910
Start looking into the paperwork that the people that make the AI are writing, not what the reporters are saying about it.

484
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:43,850
You get it?

485
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:44,610
Right.

486
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,070
Well, you know, the reporters aren't what concerned me.

487
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:57,390
Here's the correlation that I drew, and it's going to sound rather reminiscent of something that you say all the time.

488
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,390
What are human beings subject to at all times?

489
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,690
What is it that exterior input?

490
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,030
Something like this.

491
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,430
Okay.

492
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,470
Your own mind.

493
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,570
It's your everything's happening on a cloud anyway.

494
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,570
They're mimicking that.

495
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:33,190
Well, but that's the thing here is that in reality, then, if we are only subject to external delivered information, how real different is an AI automaton that is created this way from the guy standing next to you at the grocery store, really?

496
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:38,110
It could evolve, meaning unfold, if they keep developing it to that point.

497
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:43,310
Like the Blade Runner, was it P-Dick or whoever wrote that, where you had the skin jobs, right?

498
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,090
They looked like an invention.

499
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,330
But here's the thing.

500
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:52,470
If they can do it in a decade and a half, which is possible, they don't have a lot of time to do that.

501
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,270
The whole thing is going to switch.

502
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,150
Let me give you an example.

503
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,350
You know how we mentioned how the over embellishment opulence of the railroad came in at the end of its usefulness?

504
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,270
Sure.

505
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:11,190
If you asked anyone back then, how much longer is the railroad going to be used in preference like this, they're going to say forever.

506
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,830
They didn't know that it was going to be gone in a few years.

507
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:23,010
Just like, for example, if you had a discussion in 1989, when is the Soviet Union going to collapse?

508
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,610
They'd say maybe 50 or 100 years.

509
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,190
You'd say, well, how about in like three months?

510
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,790
You know, because it didn't subtract, right?

511
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,310
Right.

512
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,750
There's no way.

513
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,130
That's never going to happen, Greg.

514
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,150
You know, you see?

515
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,450
So I'm telling you, these things are going to have an influence.

516
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,170
The only reason these things exist is to distract the people.

517
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,290
Distract people from the reality of it.

518
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,430
And once you get into the reality of it, what is it?

519
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,730
Okay, let's just say it this way, Chuck.

520
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,170
And this sounds both objective and conformist.

521
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,350
You ready?

522
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,210
Okay.

523
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,110
If someone brings up AI being a problem in a good or a negative way, what's the easiest thing to say?

524
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,270
They're just machines.

525
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:02,870
Well, certainly.

526
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,610
Now, let's go to the next level.

527
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,950
Let's say you have one that almost looks identical to a human, right?

528
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,390
Like in the Blade Runner.

529
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:16,730
Let's say, which was synthesized biological, by the way, if you looked at what he wrote about it.

530
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,930
They were not just machines.

531
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,670
Well, and that's the thing, too, is that that technology is being developed.

532
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:30,630
It's not necessarily available on a mass scale, but it is happening and probably is feasible right now.

533
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:42,270
As you well know, most technology that, you know, ends up in the public's hands is stuff that is generations behind, where, you know, the people that are actually on the cutting edge are actually at.

534
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:58,030
So, you know, my assumption, based on past experiences here, is that, of course, they're already at a point where the biological and the synthetic elements that would be required are all fully operational again.

535
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,030
Well, here's another thing to consider.

536
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,130
Their entire system, overtly, is based on death.

537
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:13,710
So when you go to get prescription medicine or whatever, and they say it's been tested, and if you look at the study on it, they tested it on dead cells, right?

538
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,450
They don't know anything about how living things.

539
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,870
They can give you descriptions, but they can't explain what life is, right?

540
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,710
They tell you, even if you ask anyone what life is, they give you an explanation.

541
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,410
Well, you have muscles and circulation, but they're not explaining anything.

542
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,830
What I've studied, I stopped studying this almost a decade ago, and I know how to look for it, and I look at it now, and not much has changed.

543
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:42,750
They know how to put together various cultures, you know, like skin and certain basic body parts, and then put them on people.

544
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,110
You've heard of that, like grafting.

545
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,890
They have synthetic blood.

546
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,510
You've heard of that.

547
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,410
It's used in the military now and all that, right?

548
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,090
Sure.

549
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:50,490
Yeah.

550
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,050
Okay.

551
00:43:51,570 --> 00:44:00,490
They can develop fragments that still require a living host, but they do not know how to form a living host on their own, unlike the sci-fi.

552
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,690
They are not aware of that.

553
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,470
And how do I know they're not aware of it?

554
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,230
It's pretty obvious.

555
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:13,390
Well, and if they are aware of it, it is so secret that there's not even an inkling of it in the language at all.

556
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,130
Yeah.

557
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:15,930
Yeah.

558
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,110
Let me just ask you this.

559
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,890
The very people that are going to be working on it, aren't they going to be extracted from the current society and the current training?

560
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,050
Yes.

561
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,830
And they're devoid of what life is.

562
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,230
So, that's okay.

563
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,070
And here's the thing.

564
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,610
Let me just put a bragging right.

565
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,890
So far, I've been 100% correct of everything that I've put out in the past decade or so, in terms of what's coming and all this, right?

566
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,770
So, this is not a fear of whatever.

567
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,070
In essence, it's just a machine.

568
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,070
So, yeah, made by stupid people, all the best.

569
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,590
Oh, I understand that, but it's still pretty sophisticated.

570
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:08,090
And again, on the other hand, if we are, again, very much, it's just a lesser creation, obviously, but it doesn't mean that it could not be in some way.

571
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:08,650
Okay.

572
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,170
Hold on.

573
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,730
Let me just give a short thing here.

574
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,270
It might help you.

575
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,230
If you can remember this, it'll be very useful when you're speaking to the people that are out there.

576
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:17,750
You ready?

577
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:18,070
Okay.

578
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,910
Please.

579
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:36,970
You hear that word creation all the time, and they try to tie it back to them having a, quote-unquote, spiritual conversation or a higher-level conversation, because when we go back to the convention of religion and what the holy writs are, there's the concept of creation, right?

580
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,810
And you hear co-creation and all this other stuff, and that's our creation.

581
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:53,970
But what people fail to realize, when you look at the ancient writs, let's just use Genesis, because this is the Western convention, let's say, you see created, created, created, and throughout Genesis, first few chapters, created, created, created, right?

582
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,210
Well, if you go back to the original language, it doesn't say that at all.

583
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:04,090
It says created, formed, formed, formed, formed, created, formed, formed, formed, formed, formed, formed, and formed.

584
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,630
There's a big difference between creating and forming.

585
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:18,010
In other words, if I just baked some chocolate chip cookies in common vernacular in a very easy way of conversation, you'd say, look what the Greek created, these delicious cookies.

586
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:30,450
But in reality, if we were to just spend another few seconds and be a little bit more operating on a slightly different level, it would be very easy to say, look at these cookies that I formed from this egg, flour, butter, milk, chocolate.

587
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,290
You get it?

588
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:31,790
Yeah.

589
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,690
I didn't create those cookies.

590
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:33,330
You formed them.

591
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,290
I reformed it.

592
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,890
So you reformed the pre-existing things to form the new thing, right?

593
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,310
So man cannot create a god at all.

594
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,610
Man, as a matter of fact, can create very little, if not anything.

595
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,490
He can reform things.

596
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,430
Right.

597
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,310
I'll give you another story.

598
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,250
Maybe you heard this before.

599
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:00,970
I like eating vegetarian food or vegan food when it's delicious, not when people are vegetarian because they don't know how to cook.

600
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,450
And when people eat their cooking, it's terrible, and they say, well, it's vegetarian.

601
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,290
That's why it tastes bad.

602
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:04,730
No, no, no.

603
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,070
So there's a temple around here, and it's called Govindas.

604
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,310
And one day a week, it's all you can eat.

605
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,250
This is delicious, high-quality food.

606
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,250
And it's an annex building next to a temple.

607
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,430
And there was a religious person with us once, quote-unquote.

608
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,990
He thought that he'd come and talk to the Greek and learn more about the Bible.

609
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:24,670
Ha-ha, right?

610
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,870
But got imploded instead.

611
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,770
But he said, I'm going here.

612
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,710
He says, no, I can't go there.

613
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,230
It's a temple.

614
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,790
I'm like, we're not going in the temple.

615
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,370
We're sitting in the building next to it.

616
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,730
So anyway, he didn't want to go.

617
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,710
So he sat in there anyway.

618
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:43,390
And the monk is walking around, and they have all these gods formed, like Ganesh and all these other ones.

619
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,870
And he's going to the patrons.

620
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,650
They're eating and explaining what these gods are.

621
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,990
And everybody, all the white people are nodding their heads up and down.

622
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,450
This is so cool, right?

624
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,690
It's better than Santa Claus, right?

625
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:53,530
Sure.

626
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,490
So anyway, he gets up to me, and I listen to him.

627
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,130
And I said, well, he says, all right, you tell me about that god.

628
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,030
Let me tell you about my god.

629
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,930
Well, my god made the wood that you made your god out of.

630
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,840
You get it?

631
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:14,260
So anyway, because how ridiculous.

632
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,180
Have you ever seen children playing with toys?

633
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,900
You see this when you have a young child.

634
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:25,680
You bring them to first grade, and it's a very well-furnished one, and they've got all the toys there.

635
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,200
And they run for each one.

636
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,840
They run to all the different toys, right?

637
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,000
And it's not time to play yet.

638
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,860
But you know that when it's time to play, right away to play, they just have to reach over and grab it.

639
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,100
I saw it first, right?

640
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,100
I saw it first.

641
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,740
Sure.

642
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,960
Yeah, carry that mentality over to all the conversations that you have in the world regarding AI and all these other subjects that are going to be coming.

643
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,080
They're not creating anything.

644
00:48:51,220 --> 00:49:00,860
Now, if you want to take that to another level, a rational, educated person, I mean educated in a proper sense, understands transmutation takes place.

645
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,260
So you can transmute things.

646
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,380
Actually, you know the story about turning lead into gold?

647
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,540
That's very difficult to do.

648
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,480
That's a high energy.

649
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,740
But there are low energy transmutations.

650
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,680
You turn silver to gold.

651
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,140
You can turn copper to gold.

652
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,680
Low energy.

653
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,820
That's not that hard to do.

654
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,740
I mean it's simple to do, but it can be difficult if you want to get into an elaborate setup, right?

655
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,500
So transmutation is happening in your body right now, right?

656
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,400
Simple transmutation would be put a seed in the ground, give it water in the soil.

657
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:40,960
It doesn't consume any of the soil and really the water because most of the water is evaporated, and it produces a tree, which is now all this cellulose material, bark, and leaves that didn't exist before.

658
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,840
That's plants are transmutation.

659
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,780
Are you guys familiar?

660
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,660
There's a guy in England who's been publishing stuff now for over 40 years, and no one listens to him.

661
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,500
You can look him up.

662
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,640
He took – he did one of these terrariums in a big bottle, like a liter jug bottle, like let's say a 30-liter bottle or a five, six-gallon bottle.

663
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,260
And he put stuff in it, and he stuck it under a staircase, and he comes out 10 years later.

664
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,940
It's still growing.

665
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,580
He hasn't added any water or anything.

666
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,620
It's been going on for 40 years now, and it's still growing.

667
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,220
And you know what?

668
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,840
Nothing ever has gone in or out of it.

669
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,780
It's completely sealed.

670
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,220
And you know what's happening?

671
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,800
The weight is increasing.

672
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,380
Oh.

673
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,660
So if nothing goes in and out of it, how does the weight keep increasing?

674
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,740
What's happening?

675
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,500
You see?

676
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,300
Well, with that concept in mind…

677
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,820
So that's stuff people can't address.

678
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,720
What's that?

679
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:39,060
Well, see, with that in mind, that's the thing when it comes to this concept of AI and creating these automatons and things like that.

680
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,000
I mean isn't it possible that some transmutation could take place here?

681
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:53,160
Isn't it possible, indeed, that some entity, in fact, could decide to occupy this…

682
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,840
Only then.

683
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,880
In other words, if they grab – see, we know that they're too stupid to understand how nature works.

684
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,620
That's a fact.

685
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:00,820
Generally.

686
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,680
I mean, you know.

687
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:10,480
The second level is that there are some people that got more than – years ago, you know, how good of an engineer you were considered, how many sharpened pencils you had in your pocket, right?

688
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,540
The more sharpened pencils, the smarter – people don't even know what a pencil is, right?

689
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,520
Anyway, if you grew up – yeah.

690
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,660
Okay.

691
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,040
Anyway.

692
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:31,600
So what will happen, if it would, is there's the old Talmudic folklore of the golem, you know, where they take a – a demon goes into a statue and the statue animates, right?

693
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,500
You've heard of the concept, you know, of the occult, right?

694
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,560
I think it's called a golem or a golan.

695
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,940
Right, a golem, yeah.

696
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,800
Golem, yeah.

697
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,160
Okay.

698
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Well, yeah, in that case – but here's the other interesting point.

699
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,220
You're entering into a time period.

700
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:54,340
This is the last seven-year period of what's called normalcy, but the interesting thing is when you get out of the seven-year period and the shit is just total buckwild, people are still going to think it's normal, right?

701
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,320
So anyway.

702
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,740
Of course.

703
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,660
Whatever is is the normal.

704
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,440
Yeah, I got you.

705
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,080
It's going to change very quickly, but it's going to be okay.

706
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:15,400
So after this, by the mid-2020s, there is going to be some hyper-fascinating and ultra-fascinating downright miraculous supernatural shit going on everywhere.

707
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,400
Right.

708
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,980
So the thing is to ask yourself what – if you bring that up now, it sounds ridiculous.

709
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,260
So what kind of a mindset is going to have to change, you know, the people's mind to accept that?

710
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,060
That's what I'm looking at.

711
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,860
You see.

712
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,080
But the other aspect – but go ahead.

713
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:52,720
Well, but you see, that's the thing is that if one looks at this and thinks about it with some context, and we only go back in the past 100 years, considering, say, if we were to take someone from 1918 and drop them here with no explanation in this time period, things would look quite insane to them.

714
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,440
Well, for about an hour.

715
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:03,960
And then after an hour, they'll try to figure – it depends on how – if they're full of fear, which is weak-spirited and lack of skill, they could go insane.

716
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,100
Right.

717
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,620
If they survive it.

718
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,700
Yeah.

719
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,560
If they survive the initial – After a few days, it would be normal.

720
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:10,660
Yeah.

721
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,340
But that's the interesting thing, right?

722
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,780
But even still – even still, listen to me.

723
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:25,640
Even with that in mind, right, and the concept that things have changed in smaller increments because things are accelerating.

724
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:33,540
We've talked about that before, and certainly the quality of things has gone downhill all the way around because they're not meant to last.

725
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,300
They don't need to.

726
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:46,660
But this element to me is interesting because it seems as though – look, in a conventional sense, the things that most people are afraid of with it, this is not the thing to fear.

727
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:57,400
For me, it's the idea that a new vessel is being created that wasn't there before, that wasn't as sophisticated, that couldn't be quite as dangerous.

728
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:05,300
I mean, listen, if a demon invaded a – a demon of sorts invaded a teddy bear, we're not worried about it.

729
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:13,460
Well, the key word there is the vessel that might be controlled by what we call ultra-natural or supernatural forces.

730
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,100
There you go.

731
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,860
But mankind can't create it at all.

732
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,460
He's going to form – he's going to create the conditions for this to invite this thing in.

733
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,240
Can that be done?

734
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,720
That's been going on since time immemorial.

735
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:43,820
Well, right, and that's why I think that in context this is part of that story, and it's going to have some interesting results again because those steam-powered automatons that you were talking about from ancient history and the interesting mechanized things that were designed to do one –

736
00:54:44,660 --> 00:55:01,860
We've all seen the robotics, allegedly, of hundreds and hundreds of years ago where they have a sophisticated set of gears and everything and a person sits there, a person-like sculpture sits there and literally creates a drawing.

737
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,340
You know what I'm talking about, right?

738
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,960
Well, how about the revival of Pharaoh's serpents?

739
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,580
Yeah, well – Now, this has nothing to do with belief.

740
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:18,960
The text states that in the initial encounters, Moses was told by the angel whose fire did not burn the bush.

741
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,660
You notice I didn't say burning bush, right?

742
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:30,300
He was told, drop your staff down, and it turned to a snake at that initial encounter with that angelic being who said, who should I say sent me?

743
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,880
He says, I am who I am, right?

744
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,840
And then he says, pick up the snake.

745
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,860
And Moses is like, okay, and he grabs the snake and it turns back into a staff.

746
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:48,720
And then he presents this quote-unquote power or magic trick or however you want to view it in your modern language to Pharaoh, and what did Pharaoh say?

747
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,400
Oh, we could do that too.

748
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,600
Now, what's interesting about the scripture, people say, well, you're not supposed to take it literally.

749
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,260
Well, there's mechanisms that tell you if it's literal or not.

750
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,940
So what kind of a technology was known and bestowed as being something unique?

751
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,400
And now it's unknown.

752
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,660
You see my point?

753
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,680
Because the religious people say, well, God, you know how they say God all the time, right?

754
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,760
Wants it to be a snake or staff, he could do that.

755
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,740
Yeah, yeah, but listen, idiot, the Pharaohs could do it too without that God.

756
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,460
You see?

757
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,320
You see?

758
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,400
So was it a different God that allowed someone to turn a staff to a snake and back to a staff?

759
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:26,900
Yes.

760
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,720
Right?

761
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,080
Because it's not the same God.

762
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:48,280
You see how this conversation sounds like it's going to run amok because people, you know, they don't know enough about their history or even their own culture to use a metaphor, whether they believe in it or not, to see how it would be possible today.

763
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:59,540
So, for example, in one time in human history, if it was possible to turn a staff into a snake, let's say forget it's biblical, let's just say that, would it be possible to do it again in human history?

764
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,220
Of course.

765
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:08,380
Would it be possible to have, for mankind to make an anthropomorphic statue and then it become alive like the golem, right, all that?

766
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,100
Yes, of course.

767
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,660
That's possible.

768
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,240
But what I've been addressing in this past little rant that I had about AI is the perspective that people have on it.

769
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,880
The possibility, if you could think it, it's possible.

770
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:29,220
But you know how the secret societies have a credo that before they victimize you, they have to tell you what they're going to do, whether you recognize it or not, is your problem, right?

771
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,060
Right.

772
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,760
The gods do the same thing.

773
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,940
The gods are telling you that they can animate anything.

774
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:50,640
So I don't see anything directly coming in the future in the ancient writs that tell us that a statue will be animated or anthropomorphic form or watch out for these robots, you know what I mean?

775
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,040
Or AI.

776
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,100
I don't see that.

777
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,140
Okay.

778
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,320
So what you're saying is, yeah, I understand.

779
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah.

780
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,780
There's three things on the conversation.

781
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,860
One, it's a dummy load.

782
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:13,540
Two is what's really going on based on what the actual field is producing, not what people are saying, by looking at the people who work on AI, what they put out there.

783
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,000
And they put out more than you can imagine.

784
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:23,540
And then the other aspect is the realm of the overall possibility, if you have to know what's coming in the future, and is that brought up as a major concern?

785
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,380
And the answer is no.

786
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,900
But is it a concern?

787
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,280
It is.

788
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,640
Because, look, you know what is a concern for a lot of people?

789
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,600
There was a competition.

790
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,780
You know with just basic surveillance, facial recognition, right?

791
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:35,660
Right.

792
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:48,540
Well, that's evolved to the point now where you can have a place like Penn Station or Times Square or whatever, where it's just an amalgamation of faces, and they can identify everyone in like 0.8 seconds in the crowd.

793
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,240
Right.

794
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,680
Where, let's say 10 years ago, it took maybe a half hour.

795
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,580
Right.

796
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,640
You know what I mean?

797
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,000
You know what I'm talking about, facial recognition technology, right?

798
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:58,440
Okay.

799
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,160
Well, right.

800
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,360
Like I said, it's the acceleration of the, again, force multiplier.

801
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,160
That's what we're talking about here, I think, in general.

802
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:18,180
And what you're saying is that it's really no more relevant than the thing that they miniaturized already.

803
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,640
It's no better or worse.

804
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:26,500
It's the same technology still, just looks a little more sophisticated because they've shrunk it down a bit.

805
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,640
I mean is that about right?

806
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:35,060
Well, in essence, if I were to not say anything about the subject again, and I would put this subject within the categories, it's part of the setup.

807
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,760
You're being set up.

808
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,100
And the outcome is not going to be what you think it is.

809
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,680
But it doesn't mean you should brush it under the rug but don't get caught up.

810
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:53,120
People tend to view things in a really kind of silly or stupid pointed way of viewing it when you go on the internet.

811
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh, yeah.

812
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,060
It doesn't mean it should be discounted or discarded.

813
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,140
Oh, no.

814
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,680
Under no circumstances would I say that it should be ignored.

815
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:15,020
But I find it really interesting the way that you've just broken it down because it makes a lot more sense than the majority of the nonsense out there.

816
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,500
But then again, that's kind of what happens here, isn't it?

817
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,520
Man.

818
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:29,440
The difference between you probably is what really is going on and what people think is going on is so different that the two have almost nothing to do with each other.

819
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,340
Right.

820
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,880
It's the idea.

821
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:37,140
I went into the bookstore and they said, well, listen, all these JFK conspiracy books are 50 percent off.

822
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,760
I said, oh, really?

823
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,200
I bet they're off by a lot more than 50 percent.

824
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:41,240
Anyway.

825
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,340
That's – yeah.

826
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:51,480
The last time I think we were together would have been just before I went to Dallas, too, by the way.

827
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:56,180
So that was an interesting trip, by the way.

828
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,240
I found it rather fascinating.

829
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,760
And also just to – I want to throw something in there that works with that, too.

830
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:07,060
Like a lot of people tell stories and whether it's any story, but the JFK, you hear this.

831
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:13,020
If you spend more than a day's research on the JFK, the concept of a lie detector test comes up somewhere.

832
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,840
You're going to come across that often, right, with testimonials and things, right?

833
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:17,700
Quite often.

834
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:23,440
Are you aware of bioacoustic technology now that is very different and almost 100 percent accurate?

835
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,440
When I say 100, it's 100 times more accurate or 10 times more accurate than – you cannot be fooled.

836
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:35,020
Like the standard lie detector tests that have been 50 years old now or 80 years old or however they are.

837
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,060
It's a bioacoustic method, and you just have to speak.

838
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,460
They just have to get a voice pattern.

839
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,560
It doesn't matter what you're saying.

840
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,440
Jack and Jill run up a hill or you could – whatever you're saying.

841
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:48,140
It could even – you have to speak intentional words.

842
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,580
It doesn't work if you're snoring, right, because you're unconscious.

843
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,080
But it doesn't matter what you're saying.

844
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:59,220
Well, it works best if you say what you're going to say, and it's almost infallible, by the way.

845
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,200
And the reason why it's infallible is technically explained.

846
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,000
Are you familiar with that?

847
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,400
And the person pioneering it is a woman called Sherry Edwards, and Sherry is with an S-H-A-R-R-Y.

848
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:15,960
And I don't endorse her work overall, but that aspect of it is spot on.

849
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,760
Have you ever heard of this, by the way?

850
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:24,920
Well, it would have to be based on some of the previous technology, which was earlier described as voice stress analysis.

851
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,700
Hold on.

852
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,280
It's different.

853
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,300
It's different.

854
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,060
It works on – not on voice.

855
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:36,620
It works on which note you're peaking on and which key.

856
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,480
Yeah, yeah.

857
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,000
And the interesting – now here's the interesting thing.

858
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,360
You ready?

859
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,800
In order to get someone in a lie detector test, you actually strap them in or whatever.

860
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,900
People think it's clinical.

861
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:49,980
This is not clinical.

862
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,360
You can actually just have a recording of the person's voice.

863
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,620
It should be better than what it sounds over a regular telephone.

864
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,040
OK, and then you just play it through a program.

865
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,640
And I'll – I have it.

866
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,960
I used to have the early part of the program on a computer.

867
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,600
I don't anymore.

868
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,080
But if – it's a bioacoustic technology.

869
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,240
It scares the living daylights out of people, and she's catching a lot of flack from it.

870
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:21,520
But at the same time, they want demonstrations, and when she demonstrates it for government agencies, they outwardly steal it from her.

871
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,180
In other words, like demonstrate it for us, and then it's like, no, we don't want it.

872
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,200
But part of the demonstration is for them to download it.

873
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:29,660
You get it?

874
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,240
Oh, yeah.

875
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,860
So you get to rip them off.

876
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,020
Well, it's kind of like the weather work.

877
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:34,940
I'll make rain here.

878
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm like, can you give us a demonstration?

879
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:36,700
And I did.

880
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,420
I'm like, wait a second.

881
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,840
Now you don't need to hire me to make rain anymore because I just demonstrate.

882
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,320
You see?

883
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:40,880
So anyway.

884
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:52,600
Well, VSA is similar though because you don't require any of the clinical settings or test questions or comparisons or any of that stuff.

885
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:00,200
There's just different ways of measurement, and I'm familiar with people trying to work that out.

886
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:06,040
I wasn't aware that somebody's actually created a facility to use it.

887
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,500
I'm very interested in that.

888
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,060
Well, I gave you the info.

889
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,060
Also, you can use it, for example, someone's voice.

890
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:18,840
They can tell you what you have a deficiency in, and also they could use sound to heal that, right?

891
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,120
Like someone could be diagnosed with diabetes, for example, and it's not diabetes at all.

892
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,080
They have a particular toxin in their body.

893
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,220
This is really advanced acoustic stuff.

894
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,780
Yeah, there's a lot of applications for what you're talking about.

895
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,660
I wasn't aware that anybody had found a way to utilize that like what I'm talking about.

896
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:49,520
Like what I was saying before, voice stress analysis has existed for a long time, but it was kind of a tedious process, let's call it.

897
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:08,520
Well, this analysis, not only can they tell you if you're lying or not, but the depth and the emotional depth in the story and what you're saying, whether you're lying happily or you're being stressed or you're being coerced, and at the same time they could tell you if your liver is dysfunctioning or you're going to have a kidney ailment in 10 years or something like that.

898
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,320
Oh, my God.

899
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,280
It's pretty wild stuff.

900
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,760
I'm not endorsing her stuff because she's a breakfast cereal type, fruit, nut, and flake.

901
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,240
Great.

902
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,080
New agey crap.

903
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,580
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you discount the entire thing.

904
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,960
It's basically edible corn in a pile of poop, so I'm not endorsing it.

905
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,100
Oh, my.

906
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,740
Yeah, so you want to just – you know what I mean by getting edible corn in a pile of poop?

907
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:31,840
Yeah.

908
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,200
Oh, yeah.

909
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,820
You don't want to eat the poo.

910
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,900
You just want the corn, right?

911
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,860
Just get that corn.

912
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,440
It's been in shit.

913
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,800
It's been in poop, so it's very hard to find clean corn anywhere anymore.

914
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:41,460
Yeah.

915
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:48,920
So there's people out there still doing good work, but if you read in the ancient writ it talks about the kingdom is fractured or divided.

916
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,020
Right.

917
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,800
So you have everything you need.

918
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,940
You just have to go find it.

919
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,580
It's in pieces everywhere, and it's not going to come together.

920
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:02,300
We had a question about can you speak about how cancer can be cured?

921
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,400
Well, there's various types of cancer.

922
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:17,660
There's one that's too much of something, then there's another type of cancer that's too little of something, and then the other type of cancer is something gone amok, right?

923
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,300
You've heard of malignancies?

924
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,180
Mm-hmm.

925
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:38,420
So I can't speak on it because 90 percent of the stuff that's diagnosed as cancer is not, but the stuff that is diagnosed as cancer that is definitely cancer are these malignant things where they remove it and it comes back worse or they treat it and it gets worse, you know what I mean?

926
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,360
Yeah, and that's all frequency-based as well.

927
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,560
Look, let me put it this way.

928
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,000
This is a simple thing.

929
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,980
I was having a chat the other day.

930
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,800
You know what food is basically, right, when you take food?

931
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,480
All it is, it's condensed sunlight.

932
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,180
Think about it.

933
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,720
It's sunlight that's condensed down.

934
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,880
What does condensation mean?

935
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:01,820
Concentrated, right?

936
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,920
So the quality of that sunlight will determine the quality of that food.

937
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,640
So if you have bad quality sunlight, you can have a perfectly looking piece of broccoli.

938
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,540
You eat that broccoli, what happens to your body?

939
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,780
You get cancer.

940
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,440
Oh.

941
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:20,520
So you have to know how to – that's why I call it, you know, if you're eating too many greasy solar rays, you know.

942
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,460
Anyway.

943
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:29,400
Didn't you mention something about that thin layer at the top of the atmosphere and how the light is changed?

944
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,700
Yeah, transmutation.

945
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,660
There's no ozone layer.

946
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,380
That's where the nitrogen gets converted to oxygen.

947
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:43,420
And their spectrography measures it as an O3O4, which is ozone, versus O or O2 in their chemical.

948
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,280
And they say it's an ozone layer.

949
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:47,540
No.

950
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,900
It's like walking into a kitchen and there's a big pot of beans.

951
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,720
I'll say, well, that's the bean part of the kitchen.

952
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,580
So does that play a part in the food's development then too?

953
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

954
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,340
So everything is based on – yeah, and you know what the kicker is?

955
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,700
This is the kicker and the nuts.

956
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,020
You ready?

957
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:06,660
Or whatever.

958
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:07,340
Okay, sure.

959
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,160
If you – there is no sun.

960
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,180
I mean, yeah, you do see it through the atmosphere.

961
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,280
But if you go beyond the atmosphere, you don't see anything.

962
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:14,760
Right.

963
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,640
You only see the sun through the atmosphere, yeah.

964
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,939
And no one knows that yet.

965
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,479
I mean there are some people talking about it now, and astronauts don't talk about it.

966
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:26,640
And, yeah, you can only see the sun through the atmosphere.

967
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:34,800
Yeah, I tried to explain to you because of the strangeness of my vision that that makes the most sense about what it is I'm seeing.

968
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,060
Because that's the way it's always appeared to me.

969
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:46,500
As though there is something which is delivered to this area very much like electricity is delivered to a fluorescent light bulb.

970
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,160
In that sort of equation, I mean that is pretty much like the sun's relationship to the earth.

971
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:55,319
The earth is effectively the fluorescent light bulb.

972
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,920
So there's no light being sent through space.

973
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:58,260
Right.

974
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,120
It's just being transmitted.

975
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,720
The energy for that light is being transmitted.

976
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:11,649
And then the components within this field around this planet are agitated.

977
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,399
Are agitated, yeah.

978
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:18,399
Are agitated to create the condition of light based on the fact that they've been excited in a particular area.

979
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,380
And that's what I visually interpret.

980
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:26,880
You know how I teach this to children is very simple.

981
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:33,500
The way you're being taught the sun is when you've got a stove top and you see the burner lit, you know, gas, and you put the pot on there.

982
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,020
And now you just, you know, the further away the pot is from the actual fire, you know, it's not so hot.

983
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,420
Now that's why that's the earth and the sun.

984
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:40,660
No.

985
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,420
A better analogy is the microwave.

986
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,180
You put the water in the microwave.

987
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,319
You don't see anything.

988
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:48,340
And all of a sudden the water starts to heat up, right?

989
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:49,240
Right.

990
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:50,180
Yeah.

991
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:53,520
So what they're teaching everyone is the fire analogy.

992
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,080
There's this big, great ball in space far away.

993
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,300
And if you go out there, you'll see it.

994
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,160
No, no, there's nothing there.

995
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,980
It's like the microwave.

996
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,240
You don't see anything, but the thing heats up.

997
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,420
When you're in space, you don't see the sun or the stars, but you see the earth lit up, right?

998
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:05,360
Right.

999
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,520
And it's just like the microwave.

1000
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,640
If you the denser the material, the hotter it gets.

1001
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,680
Just like on a hot day, the air is hot.

1002
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,720
But when you sit on the park bench, it's hotter.

1003
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,260
You know why?

1004
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,280
Because it's denser.

1005
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:22,740
And if you're in the southwest and you have some tools out, it'll burn your hand.

1006
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,940
You've heard of cooking an egg on the sidewalk.

1007
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:26,780
It's so hot.

1008
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,860
Yeah, I remember that.

1009
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,760
Well, you can't cook an egg on a tree.

1010
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,200
Why?

1011
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,220
Because the sidewalk is denser than the tree.

1012
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,900
So the denser the material, the more the absorption.

1013
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:37,000
You see?

1014
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,180
That's all.

1015
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:38,840
It's very simple.

1016
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,540
Very simple.

1017
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,820
But also space has a different quality to it.

1018
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,700
But, you know, here's the hypocrisy.

1019
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,400
I don't like to discuss a lot about what's happening out there for several reasons.

1020
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,920
And the first is I haven't been there.

1021
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,580
And if you base everything on a thought experiment, that's not good.

1022
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,140
But the other thing is the hypocrisy.

1023
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,220
People don't even know what the hell is going on five feet from them.

1024
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,000
And how are you going to talk about what's happening all the way out there?

1025
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,260
You know, that's the truth.

1026
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:06,840
Yes.

1027
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:07,780
Yeah.

1028
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,900
So that's what I have to say with that.

1029
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:14,080
And with that, I'm just out of curiosity, even though it's not a good curiosity.

1030
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,480
What do you think of, I'm sure, have you heard of James Sutton or James Files?

1031
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,880
He's been interviewed a while back.

1032
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,900
Several times he claims to have shot, done the kill shot with a Remington through the fence.

1033
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:31,560
What do you think of that in terms of the testimony on that, by the way?

1034
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,800
Well, it's not provable.

1035
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,260
No, I know that.

1036
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,180
That's testimony.

1037
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:47,140
Yeah, it's testimony, but all I have is dispositive evidence, you know, in a lot of ways of his testimony, let's call it.

1038
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,880
Of course, he's been released from prison, by the way.

1039
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,680
Oh, it must have happened recently, right?

1040
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,860
Yeah, a few months back.

1041
01:11:54,580 --> 01:12:01,100
And, you know, it seems to me as though there is not enough evidence for anybody to really work with it.

1042
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:07,060
It's just one of these games that people play with information, quite honestly.

1043
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,640
You know, there's other characters out there that do this as well.

1044
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:17,600
But, yeah, no, this person for the uninitiated claims to be the shooter from the grassy knoll.

1045
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:30,420
The problem is that, first of all, there is no physical evidence on the record anywhere that shows that a shot from the grassy knoll actually landed.

1046
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:38,140
And by the way, in case somebody thinks, oh, this is just one of those people who doesn't believe that there was something other than the government's explanation.

1047
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:39,760
You're wrong.

1048
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:52,440
The thing is that, quite honestly, there's evidence for shots other than the alleged Oswald character would have taken, but not for this guy's story.

1049
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:52,840
Right.

1050
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,220
They're predominantly from front and behind, almost in line, but not quite 30, 40 degrees off.

1051
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,420
Yeah, correct.

1052
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,500
Exactly correct.

1053
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:06,040
Which is funny because you haven't even, I don't think you've taken a long time to study these things.

1054
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:14,760
But in short order, you can find out if you know what you're looking at that, yeah, yes, indeed, you're exactly correct.

1055
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:21,180
I've had people try and look at things for 20 years that just cannot wrap their minds around what you just said.

1056
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,760
That is what the evidence shows thus far.

1057
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:32,800
But this guy's story, it's just one of those things that's out there, much like Judy Baker.

1058
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:46,980
I was Lee Harvey Oswald's girlfriend, and I was also a CIA asset, and I was also a master scientist who was out there creating a cancer weapon and all this other whatever else it is she wants to make up this week.

1059
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,520
Chuck, do you think he was a plant?

1060
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:53,690
A plant.

1061
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:58,810
Well, I could make a joke here and say I don't believe he would be bearing fruit any time.

1062
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,310
Or like a conspiracy patsy.

1063
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:05,790
You got the patsy for the public and the patsy for the conspiracy theorists.

1064
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,950
There's something just thrown in there.

1065
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:33,470
I think the simplest explanation is this, that he was really a guy who was in prison, who did rub up against a few interesting characters in his lifetime, who just exaggerated stories into, well, he went in this area because this was something that would get him attention, would get him a bit of money to help out the people that weren't in prison at the time.

1066
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,830
I really think that's what it comes down to.

1067
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:43,570
And when you take a look at the guy who financed the book about him and the videos about him and all that stuff.

1068
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,010
I found that odd, yeah.

1069
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,450
Yeah, that part is.

1070
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,810
But what about his actual testimony, though?

1071
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:50,130
Right.

1072
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,130
Does he make that all add up?

1073
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,030
You see, that's the interesting part.

1074
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:55,310
You got to start from somewhere.

1075
01:14:55,310 --> 01:15:13,050
Yeah, his testimony is really based on some information that had become available in previous decades, some bad assumptions made by some authors who didn't have the access to a lot of things that we have access to today.

1076
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:32,170
And these assumptions would have sounded great to somebody who, say, wasn't aware that there was five million documents released after that information or whatever, that there was- Yeah, but all that stuff aside, though, in other words, can you tell when someone is lying or not is the basic thing.

1077
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:39,110
Not you, but I mean, is this guy, in other words, if you put this guy's feet to the fire, would his story change?

1078
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:39,530
You know what I mean?

1079
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,250
I mean, literally.

1080
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:50,930
In other words, if you tortured him, right, I mean, I'm talking like serious rendition, would he change his story and fess up, or would he take that story to his grave?

1081
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,850
You see, that's what real testimony is about.

1082
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:57,890
You know, an interesting one there, Greek, is put him up against that speech analysis thing.

1083
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:02,410
Well, you know, that's the thing I was thinking of, actually.

1084
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:11,210
I put someone on that already, and they said that the audio that they got from him right now must have gone through something like Skype at some point.

1085
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:16,630
Yeah, I have a lot of- I've done enough research that I'm satisfied.

1086
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:30,790
The shortfall of the speech analysis thing is certain things like Skype and certain other- there was one other, I don't remember if it's Obscure or not, but let's just say Skype, will flatten out what you're saying, even though it does sound like- So you're changing the voice.

1087
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,090
The compression.

1088
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,450
Yeah, the compression.

1089
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,950
It could be- it's beyond the compression, though.

1090
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:39,690
They do this funky- yeah, it is- in other words, you're correct, yeah.

1091
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:46,830
In other words, the compression analog that they use, yeah, the- what do you call the formula for something in computers?

1092
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:52,050
The type of compression they use on Skype, yes.

1093
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,010
Right, right.

1094
01:16:54,650 --> 01:17:04,950
AA3 or, you know, some- with a needle, you know, mechanically moving in a vinyl groove, that will carry it.

1095
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,230
Or magnetic tape.

1096
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,650
Right, right.

1097
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:13,310
But a telephone will carry it too, but will filter most of it out, not compress it.

1098
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:21,650
Well, look at the difference between the old carbon elements that they use in the telephone and the new little tiny electrics that they use in the cell phone.

1099
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:31,990
I mean, there's- they're- the technology- Yeah, so anyway, Chuck, just to finalize on that, what would the evidence- it's funny, the evidence, right?

1100
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:44,130
Whenever you hear that word, I cringe, but in order to get- we need to get- if you want to run his voice through that, I haven't- nothing has been found on the internet right now that shows the quality that we're looking for.

1101
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:46,150
I say we, I mean, that can be done.

1102
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:51,730
So, like, when you said he's out right now, all you got to do is run up to him and do a 30-second interview.

1103
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,870
Just say, you know, it doesn't matter what he says, just say, you know, I shot Kennedy this week.

1104
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:59,290
Say what you- give us your testimony in 30 seconds, that's more than enough.

1105
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:01,390
But not record it on Skype, something else.

1106
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:04,670
Well, what would you recommend for good recording then?

1107
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:06,670
Grammar?

1108
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,930
Yeah, no, the best is- no, digital will work.

1109
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:14,350
Like, you know the Olympus handheld audio things that still sell for $100?

1110
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:15,010
Oh, sure, sure.

1111
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,410
Those are the industry standard now for handheld recording devices.

1112
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,230
Got the little two microphones that pop up.

1113
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:20,810
Right.

1114
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,750
Interesting.

1115
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:28,610
Where if you had a- let's say you had a computer or a cell phone on record mode, that's good enough.

1116
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:32,590
But once you run it through Skype, it screws it up.

1117
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,430
Okay, so not the compression on the phone?

1118
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:41,010
Because the phone digitizes in compressions, and that's why I asked that question.

1119
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,750
No, the phone recordings seem to be fine.

1120
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:44,930
Okay.

1121
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:54,050
A phone has a more dynamic- it's basically got a better dynamic range of sound than- Skype is very- Yeah, it's narrow.

1122
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,190
It's very narrow, yeah.

1123
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:05,150
You know, I could get a video recording, and if you put it into a WAV format instead of an MP4- Correct.

1124
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:05,730
That would work.

1125
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:13,310
It will contain a lot more, and I could probably actually get that for you any time.

1126
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:14,070
Right.

1127
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:19,430
In other words, if he had- yeah, the old VHS days, running through a regular TV is more than enough.

1128
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,330
More than good enough.

1129
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:20,870
Oh, cool.

1130
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,290
Hey, Chuck, if you ever need help with that, I'll help you.

1131
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:29,750
I can turn any audio into any format that you need.

1132
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:31,390
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,110
I do some of that work myself.

1134
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:35,390
Okay, good, good.

1135
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:45,390
But I was just saying, I mean, if you wanted to provide this to somebody who could run it through an analyzer, I would love to have not only him, but also that woman I just mentioned, Judy Baker.

1136
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,190
I'd love to have her run through there as well.

1137
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,170
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1138
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,650
Okay, you know what?

1139
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:54,210
You know, you've heard of, you know, people are spoken of publicly.

1140
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,070
You know, don't be starstruck or whatever.

1141
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:00,610
If you look up Sherry Edwards or Bioacoustics, she comes up.

1142
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:01,430
She has a website.

1143
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,130
Right.

1144
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,270
She's very easy.

1145
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,850
I mean, I have her phone numbers.

1146
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:12,030
You know, I have all her numbers and all that, but what I mean is if you go to the website, there's a phone number there, and she's in Ohio or something.

1147
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:12,670
You call there.

1148
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,710
You'll get a receptionist.

1149
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,210
She will get back to you.

1150
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:20,010
The best way, because she's busy, is to send her an email, and she will get back to you.

1151
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:30,470
So you can bypass me and go directly, and this way, if there's any questions back and forth, it doesn't have to go through me or someone else that I know.

1152
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,110
You can go to her directly.

1153
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:33,130
Just look up Sherry.

1154
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:38,370
That's with an S-H-A, Sherry Edwards, Bioacoustics, and you go to the website.

1155
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:43,470
She has about three or four different websites based on, you know, ones for the public, ones that are more clinical.

1156
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:53,690
I'd say two websites, really, and you can get in touch with her, and I think if you – let's say you had the audio in your hand right now, Chuck, in a WAVE file or somehow.

1157
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:59,950
I think it wouldn't take more than a week from getting in touch with her and having the results.

1158
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:09,110
Oh, I could email those things to her if she's willing to accept the files, and you could have it in a matter of moments.

1159
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:16,330
Why don't you get in touch with her on your – this way, just for the ease of, you know, just look her up.

1160
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,070
She's very easy.

1161
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:19,870
That would be an interesting answer to a question.

1162
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:24,430
I certainly would love to do that.

1163
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:28,530
I've just made a note, and I'm going to see what I can find, my friend.

1164
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,730
Let me give you a little story, and you'll hear it.

1165
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:34,450
Remember the Jerry Sandusky thing that went on with the football coach?

1166
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,970
Sandusky and then his son, yeah.

1167
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:53,330
Okay, well, what they did was the prosecution and some other government came to her with audio files before the trial, and she didn't talk about this until after the trial, but she analyzed just like 10 seconds of his voice when he was in the testimony that he gave, right?

1168
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,090
Right.

1169
01:21:55,090 --> 01:22:01,190
And she said what – he did what he did, but he didn't think it was the wrong thing to do.

1170
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,430
He thought it was just a form of horseplay.

1171
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:14,830
Even though he did molest them sexually, you know, legally gets you in big trouble, in his – he didn't think he was doing the wrong thing, but he's guilty.

1172
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,890
He did do those things.

1173
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:21,570
But the reason why he did them was he thought it was just a form of horseplay, and they filed that away.

1174
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,190
That's great.

1175
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:33,070
That's a level of sophistication that quite honestly no previous technique has ever shown promise for because they could never give you that.

1176
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:42,530
Like in other words, even with voice stress analysis, right, I could tell you that somebody – and I've been through this a bit, so I understand that.

1177
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:46,330
I could tell you that this person believes what they're saying.

1178
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:47,130
Correct.

1179
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:51,950
Certainly, and yes, that is exactly what – Why they're saying they believe it.

1180
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,410
Why they believe it.

1181
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:56,770
Is it actually true is another issue.

1182
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,150
Quite honestly, that's a misnomer about that.

1183
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:08,870
Right, and then at the same time she could say, well, by the way, you have a gallstone that's going to make – give you a problem in about two or three years.

1184
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:11,130
Holy smokes.

1185
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:16,170
Right, so then he goes and gets a sonogram, and there's this tiny, tiny, tiny thing in his gallbladder.

1186
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:19,350
It looks like the size of a grain of sand that is growing.

1187
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:26,590
It's like – and it wouldn't show – you would – any radiologist or whatever just wouldn't even notice it, right?

1188
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:35,530
So anyway, it's really – I think the pinnacle of – when you talk about technology, it's all good.

1189
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:39,390
Any technology is only as good or as bad as how it's being used, right?

1190
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:44,690
So she's got – when it comes to the bioacoustic stuff, she's got that down.

1191
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:50,750
The other stuff she talks about is just – you just got to – it's like give me some milk, a bowl of milk and a spoon.

1192
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,970
But anyway.

1193
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,490
I hear you there.

1194
01:23:53,490 --> 01:24:04,930
But it is also another thing to keep in mind that sound in and of itself is one of those things that is highly misunderstood by most people.

1195
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:22,330
There are a lot of things contained within the spoken word that may not be self-evident to the majority of those listening because they're not entirely listening, and your ears are not the best devices, quite honestly, to interpret sound.

1196
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:32,330
This is one of those things you and I have talked about too, and I think that's an interesting thing to keep in mind here that – you know what?

1197
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:38,630
That information is contained within some of these utterances, and there is a great deal more information.

1198
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:46,790
This again is only as far as the technology has taken people, even this woman who is apparently on the cutting edge of it.

1199
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,790
But let's be honest.

1200
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:56,510
There's a lot more contained within those sounds than one might be able to gather at first listen.

1201
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:01,650
Well, my interaction – let's just say without – just objectively.

1202
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:07,930
What I've been saying for a very long time is there's – like you just said people cannot discern what's in the sound, right?

1203
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:09,250
That's fine.

1204
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,070
They can't discern it.

1205
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,950
But another thing they cannot discern at all – you ready for this?

1206
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:19,490
– is that their ears are giving off a sound, and your eye is giving off light.

1207
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:22,030
And there's a guy, a psychiatrist named Ross in the 1920s.

1208
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:23,990
He says, man, the light gives off eye.

1209
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:28,030
The eye gives off light, and he set up a dark box, pitch black.

1210
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:34,410
Someone would put their head in, and he had a photoelectric relay on the end, and they would always trigger it when he told them to look forward in the middle of the box.

1211
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:44,770
That's why when you're out in the street or out and sometimes you feel like this feeling on the back of your head and you turn around, it sounds like a tingling, and you see someone staring at you, right?

1212
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:46,650
The eye gives off a beam.

1213
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:49,610
Now, your ear gives off a sound.

1214
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:55,790
Like, for example, I'm not talking about tinnitus now, but you get ringing in the ears and occasional ringing of the ears.

1215
01:25:56,290 --> 01:26:03,910
For example, in some Kundalini and even Sufi practices, they say when you reach a level of meditation, you hear this ring, this tone, right?

1216
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:14,490
Well, what's interesting, if you have a reasonably healthy person who doesn't have this constant ringing, in other words, it's not a ringing because a nerve is pinched or something mechanically.

1217
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,950
If you hear the ringing, do me a favor.

1218
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:27,870
If any one of you folks ever have a ringing in one ear, especially if it's loud, if there's someone else in the room, tell them to put their ear against your ear that is ringing.

1219
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:33,910
It's usually one or the other, and ask them if they hear a ringing also coming out.

1220
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:37,970
So sometimes that ringing that is in the ear is not just in the brain.

1221
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,030
It is actually like a tiny speaker giving off a literal ringing.

1222
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:44,910
Do you get what I'm saying?

1223
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:46,070
Yeah.

1224
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:50,990
Just like a light that triggers off someone's stare.

1225
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:52,890
I'm done.

1226
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,790
I've been done for a long time.

1227
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:55,750
Stick a fork in me.

1228
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:00,390
What's your take on reverse speech?

1229
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,190
That opens yourself.

1230
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,050
That's the same thing.

1231
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,550
What's your take on Ouija boards?

1232
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,540
What's your take on seances?

1233
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,470
What you're doing there is what?

1234
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:16,170
In simple terms, you're inviting something else.

1235
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,030
Okay.

1236
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:18,070
Gotcha.

1237
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,870
It's not like radiology.

1238
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,350
You ever see an x-ray?

1239
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,370
You ever been in the hospital?

1240
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:27,370
You go and they got the x-rays.

1241
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:30,610
There's five doctors, their arms in their pockets waiting and waiting.

1242
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,730
I said, wait, we're waiting for a radiologist.

1243
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:33,910
What, you guys can't read that?

1244
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:35,030
No.

1245
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,470
You see, it's a specialty, right?

1246
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:38,690
We're not talking about that.

1247
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,370
Most people think that reverse speech is a specialty.

1248
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:43,010
It's not.

1249
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,690
You're actually inviting something else there.

1250
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:45,430
Okay.

1251
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:51,230
But on the other hand, I would say that, yeah, you're correct.

1252
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:56,050
But there's additional bit of information here that needs to be understood.

1253
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:04,310
You know, when something is spoken, there is other intent in it as well.

1254
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,530
There's a lot of other information in it as well.

1255
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:13,630
And it's not to say that there can't be information gathered from the interpretation of something in reverse.

1256
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:20,850
The idea that people are actually, you know, speaking in reverse at the same time they're speaking forward is a little bit.

1257
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,710
Because you're giving off.

1258
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:26,370
Yeah, it's like the animals can hear stuff that you can't hear.

1259
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,970
We also give off those sounds, and those sounds still approach us.

1260
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:41,910
Okay, let me just, without retracting what I just said, but let's just say from an objective point of view, if you have a prerecorded piece of material, which, by the way, most of them are, and then you analyze it reverse speech, that would be more objective.

1261
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:48,670
But if you have someone going around saying, let me record this so I could reverse it and see what they say, now you're inviting something.

1262
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,710
Right.

1263
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:58,870
See, a lot of people that do this kind of stuff and discuss this topic usually take something which is prerecorded, and then they interpret it.

1264
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:02,030
They say, okay, listen to this part of the speech, now listen to it reversed.

1265
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:06,130
This is part of, obviously, what is in their consciousness as well.

1266
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,650
Well, then it's more objectified, yeah.

1267
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,290
Yeah.

1268
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,590
So, no, that was the thing I wanted to add there.

1269
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:15,950
Yeah, that would be more formal because lately I've, not lately, well, I've heard of it.

1270
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:20,810
There was actually a specialist in that field that pioneered that field 30 years ago.

1271
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,450
Lives here in town, by the way.

1272
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,890
It's a woman.

1273
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:32,370
And she used to have a TV show on public access, and I was like, no, no, no, no, this is a little, I could see how it could be viable, but the way they're pushing it is a little too far.

1274
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:35,290
It loses its objectivity now, right?

1275
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,830
Well, there's a lot of hands in there too.

1276
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:48,390
In other words, if you have a prerecorded thing and you can objectify it, there's information being given in reverse, that, there's, yeah, I would say that's about objective as you can get, right?

1277
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:53,790
But if you're creating it for the purpose of that, you're inviting something else, right?

1278
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,350
No, absolutely true.

1279
01:29:55,410 --> 01:30:08,130
But, you know, generally when people reference this, I mean, again, you know that on occasion I go and try and sample the alternative media stuff, and usually it just ends in dismay and I throw up my hands after a little bit.

1280
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,390
But when I do that, I do memorialize in my own mind some of the things I encounter.

1281
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,790
And quite honestly, what was it?

1282
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:30,630
Jeff Rents used to have a guy on a few years back rather regularly that would take, say, you know, bits of speeches from Barack Obama and play them backwards and say, this is what I think is also on his mind while he's saying this.

1283
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:37,850
You know, and quite honestly, it was usually there to show contradictory ideas when you reversed it.

1284
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:43,170
But then again, when you change the pitch, you change the speed, you can do a lot of things with this.

1285
01:30:43,350 --> 01:31:02,790
And, I mean, I've taken live broadcasts of totally unrelated things and played with it enough and created, you know, somebody saying something in a different way just by changing, again, the pitch and the tone just a bit, and it indeed sounds like it.

1286
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:10,170
But then it comes down to are you manipulating something in order to create something, or are you objectively examining it?

1287
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:14,810
Again, these two things are very different, and I'm glad you made that point.

1288
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:15,730
Yeah.

1289
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,070
Oh, yeah.

1290
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:16,870
Yeah.

1291
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:21,850
Overall, what I always say is who are you doing it for and why are you doing it?

1292
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:22,850
That's all.

1293
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:26,210
Yeah, which is always something good to consider when you say it.

1294
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:26,970
Good point.

1295
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,510
So there you go.

1296
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:31,530
I think you got the lady's name, right?

1297
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:35,430
Bioacoustics, she'll come up, and you're off on your own.

1298
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,810
And, you know, there's no specialization here.

1299
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,730
She's very easy to get in touch with.

1300
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:53,150
I would say based on experience from many different ways, I'd say that if you got a recording to her now, you'd probably have an answer in a week or two maximum.

1301
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:54,670
Excellent.

1302
01:31:54,670 --> 01:32:03,290
In other words, her group and herself are very responsive, and she'll tell you if she can't do it right away.

1303
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:04,970
So there you go.

1304
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:12,790
Again, how many times have we – you remember when the VHS tapes came out, it was like, oh, wow, we're at the pinnacle of technology, right?

1305
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:15,730
Well, this is an ongoing thing.

1306
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:20,490
It's impressive at the moment, and it's not just impressive at the moment.

1307
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:28,410
I'm sure it will evolve even more as time goes on if they keep working on it, but it's enough to do the job, you know, right now.

1308
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,630
Oh, right, and that's the thing.

1309
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,630
That's why I pointed out that there has been a bit of an evolution.

1310
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:38,570
I mean the polygraph has its place, you know, but, again, it is very clinical.

1311
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:53,090
You have to utilize very specific protocols in order for this thing to even be remotely successful when it comes to the typical lie detector test, right, the one where they strap the different sensors onto you and all that.

1312
01:32:54,370 --> 01:33:00,450
It's a spectrum analysis, and you almost need like a radiologist to read it eventually to confirm it.

1313
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,810
Right, and, of course, those things have evolved too.

1314
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:15,470
I mean literally testing the skin's temperature, right, the level of perspiration, the amount of tension in certain areas of the body.

1315
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:30,750
I mean all these things literally do communicate something, but, again, you know, you might be able to break up a piece of steak with a hammer, but it is not the preferred tool to get the job done adequately when you're trying to eat.

1316
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:34,890
Right, and it also depends on the person's level of discipline or training.

1317
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:41,590
Like if you put a Taoist master on a lie detector, and if he wanted to, he could do it either way.

1318
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:54,230
You know, if you say the sky is purple, or I mean actually the sky can turn any color, but, you know, say that elephants can fly, it would show that he's telling the truth because he has extreme control over his body, right?

1319
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:54,810
Right.

1320
01:33:55,430 --> 01:34:03,370
Do you know like the story of the oracle in Delphi, you know, this woman in a chemical trance,

1321
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:06,530
and she would prophesy and tell people the future and things,

1322
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:11,890
and a guy wanted to prove that it was false and it was a hoax,

1323
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:16,790
and he had a bird in his hand, and he was going to ask the oracle is the bird dead or alive,

1324
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:25,250
and if she said it was alive, he'd kill it, and if she said it was dead, then, you know,

1325
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:26,750
he would just do the opposite, right?

1326
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:27,430
Right.

1327
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,670
So if he asked was the bird alive, you know, either way.

1328
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,150
Right.

1329
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:35,130
So basically when he asked the oracle is the bird dead or alive, she goes it's whichever one you wish.

1330
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:36,850
Right.

1331
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:38,890
So it kind of leaves them hanging.

1332
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:42,670
In other words, you could leave a lie detector test hanging as well.

1333
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:50,730
Well, right, and that's why some people would do things like, you know, insert something into their shoe so that they could cause pain.

1334
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:53,210
Right, so it's calibrated.

1335
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:53,510
Yeah.

1336
01:34:53,830 --> 01:35:05,510
So the calibration is incorrect, and therefore the readings are all over the place because you're randomly inserting pain into the equation where, given the controlled circumstances, this should not be the case.

1337
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,950
So there you go.

1338
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:14,570
It does have a lot to do with the participant, the discipline, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

1339
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:20,450
But speech, on the other hand, once it's been loosed, I mean, again, this is why I find this fascinating.

1340
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:27,690
There are certain things that are contained within it that most people do not have the ability to control.

1341
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:39,070
Right, because they're not aware also that when you hear things that your ear is actually giving off sound, and that puts a bias on it.

1342
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:40,190
Of course it does.

1343
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:46,890
Have you ever heard of like someone who has a negative outlook or whatever, no matter what they hear, they're always skeptical of it.

1344
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:57,010
They can't be objectified because they've never objected of what they're hearing or seeing because they've never gotten over the subjectivity of what their own body is emitting.

1345
01:35:58,270 --> 01:35:58,830
Mm-hmm.

1346
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:11,330
So it's kind of like in the Asian arts, the Taoist healing arts, a master could see, you know how they talk about auras, you know, different colors, and different colors were different diseases and state of health, right?

1347
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:21,630
Like someone could walk into a room, and if they had like a greenish muddy, you know, they could tell them, oh, this person is sick here or whatever, you know, because they have already objectified sight.

1348
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:25,970
That's an interesting thing just to ponder for anyone that's listening.

1349
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:29,810
Can you objectify your own vision and can you objectify your own hearing?

1350
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:36,910
And it sounds kind of cliché, but it's the first step to becoming aware of what the senses are really doing.

1351
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,930
Oh, right, right, absolutely.

1352
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:52,190
And again, you know, someone's vision and their interpretation, there's a lot of steps in between before you turn around and spit it back out of your mouth to give an observation.

1353
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:57,370
So, you know, there are many different qualities that could be had there, right?

1354
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:03,290
I mean, one quality in an ear does not necessarily make the great interpretation.

1355
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:10,590
You need to have each one of these steps of the utmost quality, which is what the pursuit of these things is about.

1356
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,450
So that's something to consider as well, right?

1357
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:22,050
Yeah, it is, but what you have to consider ultimately is who you're going to tell this to, because you're living in a society where no amount of evidence on certain subjects means anything.

1358
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:29,970
Isn't that the really terrifying thing for some people?

1359
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,170
You never have a second chance at a first impression.

1360
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:37,050
And the first impression for most people is not just an impression.

1361
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:40,510
Well, it's actually carving it in stone for them, you see.

1362
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:44,450
And you could still erase that even though something's carved in stone.

1363
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,910
You could chisel away at it and whatever, but why bother?

1364
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:50,050
Because in this case, you know, they trivialize it.

1365
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:53,510
But essentially you're living in a society where evidence doesn't matter.

1366
01:37:53,510 --> 01:38:00,630
And it seems like that has led to all the absurdities that are going on, believe it or not.

1367
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:01,010
Yeah.

1368
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:01,430
And you know what?

1369
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:06,010
And that's because they're subject to the cosmic censorship, which you've talked about before.

1370
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,070
All true.

1371
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:08,990
All true.

1372
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,930
So, you know, I'm not even sure.

1373
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:15,590
Is this titled as something?

1374
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:18,430
Does this end up becoming an MP3?

1375
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:19,610
Yes.

1376
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:20,510
Yes, it does.

1377
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:22,430
Yeah, tell them how it works, Bruce.

1378
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,590
It becomes an MP3.

1379
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:26,290
We can call it whatever we like.

1380
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:31,910
We can name it The Greek and Chuck Wachelli and then put the date next to it.

1381
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:37,150
Put the word new next to it so that they know that's the one, you know.

1382
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:38,910
That's about it.

1383
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:41,870
You could write maybe Wachelli and The Greek semi-loaded.

1384
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,430
Yeah, okay, we'll do that.

1385
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:46,030
We'll do that.

1386
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:47,730
Wonderful.

1387
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:49,730
Okay, excellent.

1388
01:38:49,730 --> 01:39:03,850
You know, and I didn't expect to do this, but this is always, always great exercise for my psychology to have a conversation with you, I've got to tell you, and I appreciate it.

1389
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:05,730
Yes, yes, likewise.

1390
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:06,590
All right, that makes one of us.

1391
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:07,250
Likewise.

1392
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:08,490
That's all right.

1393
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:08,930
That's two.

1394
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:12,130
The whole thing, it's really bad out there.

1395
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:27,690
You know, after a while, you know, when you have young children and you love them more than anything you can imagine, you didn't know what really love was until you have these little small people around you, right?

1396
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:36,630
And the first thing that you think about is, oh, no, eventually, even now, I'm going to have to subject them to all the crap in the world, right?

1397
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:37,990
It's a scary thought.

1398
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:38,610
Yes, yes.

1399
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:46,490
Yeah, well, that's what's going on constantly when I think about things, and I'm like, who am I going to go talk to?

1400
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:52,990
Because if you bring up the subject, because no matter what you want to discuss, it could be placed in a subject matter, right?

1401
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:57,490
And then you look at what's being discussed on that subject matter, and you're like, oh, shit.

1402
01:39:58,370 --> 01:40:00,570
You can't say, well, who are you going to tell this to?

1403
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:01,210
Right.

1404
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:11,430
And the reason I bring that up is I've had discussions with captains of industry and Supreme Court judges, and I bring up the truth of certain things, and they look at me, and they're like, yeah, that's true what you're saying, but who are you going to tell that to?

1405
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:13,570
Meaning we got everybody by the balls.

1406
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,010
You know, no one's going to believe it.

1407
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:20,830
Well, it's not just those who have everybody by the balls that think that.

1408
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:38,950
I got to be honest with you that a lot of the conversations that I have with a very few people, by the way, in my personal life often end with, yeah, this is all true, but what am I supposed to do with this particular piece of information?

1409
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,690
Nobody wants to hear it.

1410
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:50,590
And so occasionally I'll speak about these things and slip those little nuggets, those little pieces of reality into my discussions.

1411
01:40:51,170 --> 01:41:04,870
Quite honestly, I'm well aware of the fact that very, very few people will ever actually hear them, regardless of how many people allegedly heard the discussion or allegedly heard the information.

1412
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:21,250
And what's funny is that that is the one thing that you actually taught me, is that that would be the reality ever after, for my ever after anyway, and you were right.

1413
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,030
You were quite right about that.

1414
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:32,430
Well, essentially, look, everyone wants to do what they're good at doing, and they want to live well from it and profit from it.

1415
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:37,170
Profit meaning right scales and measures by earning it the right way.

1416
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:51,690
But when you focus and you find – let's say you find out what kind of a shithole this society has been for 6,000 years up until now, and for the reason why it's like that, your main focus is food, clothing and shelter and to get through it, just like doing your time.

1417
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:58,250
And then everything else that you do, you remember that it's not just for now.

1418
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:09,130
Later on, if you're confronted, you can't – no one can tell you, hey, I found out you knew the facts and the truth about this, and you didn't say anything.

1419
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:20,430
But if you say it, and no strings and no expectations, no need for approval, later on, no one can come to you and say, hey, Chuck, you knew this and you said it.

1420
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,450
We're the ones that screwed up.

1421
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:25,830
Well, that is for certain.

1422
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:47,090
If there were a grand cosmic court that was convened to judge me about you knowing knowledge and not sharing the reality, the danger, the strangeness that you observed, that is one thing that I could not be accused of.

1423
01:42:48,590 --> 01:42:50,690
And I'm happy to do that.

1424
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:55,250
I realize that I'm not quite as dummy load free as what it is you do.

1425
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:04,570
But quite honestly, I do the best I can given the – again, the atmosphere of censorship.

1426
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:17,870
But it did help me adjust my attitude quite a bit about being frustrated over the idea that, look, I've said this 100 times and nobody hears it.

1427
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:23,930
It just – it got me to understand that's the way it's supposed to be right now.

1428
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:24,710
Right now.

1429
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:25,190
That's right.

1430
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:25,830
It's temporal.

1431
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:30,290
That's why I've been speaking publicly for almost a decade or so.

1432
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:34,690
Actually, more than that, even in person, just to live audiences and things.

1433
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:38,530
And very often I'd say it's not time yet.

1434
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:42,130
So there's – again, if you go back to all the ancient writs, there's – what is it?

1435
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:43,690
Patience is a virtue or something.

1436
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:45,730
So, right?

1437
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:53,890
When you look on what's called the alternative media and all that other stuff, all those guys are shooting their load and telling you everything they know, and it's bullshit.

1438
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:01,130
So there's – if you know the time isn't right, say it anyway in most cases or some cases.

1439
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:06,670
But you know that the reaction will be null because it's not time yet.

1440
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,370
So now you have to read the times, right?

1441
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:11,690
You have to know the times, and that's where patience comes in.

1442
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:17,290
But ultimately, like you mentioned, the great judgment thing, let's just not air religious or whatever.

1443
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:20,950
There will be a time where there will be an equalization of the spirits, I call it.

1444
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:21,990
You know what I mean?

1445
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:28,670
And there will be an equal footing of the minds, and things will be sorted out.

1446
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,150
And that time would actually be more rewarding than now.

1447
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:42,050
Well, yeah, and that's why I tried to leave it in as secular sort of situation as I could, likening it to a courtroom.

1448
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:47,350
Although we know that those things are not anything secular in any way, shape or form.

1449
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,770
But best descriptor I had for it.

1450
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:52,310
So there you go.

1451
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:59,390
We know that those things are all religiously based, and again, all you have to do is look at the symbols.

1452
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:04,930
And they tell you exactly which goddess they're talking about, don't they?

1453
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:09,050
Or at least sort of one way or another, right?

1454
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:14,430
Yeah, and it's – the other thing is the waste of time that people spend on thinking things are going to get better.

1455
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:20,510
You just live it through, live your life, figure out what's coming, and live the best you can.

1456
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:23,710
And go on from there.

1457
01:45:23,770 --> 01:45:25,210
None of this stuff is going to be fixed.

1458
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:29,650
It's going to be done away with, but it has to reach its peak like a boil first.

1459
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:32,950
So that's pretty much the aspect of it.

1460
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:37,010
Yeah, got to fill up with pus until it bursts.

1461
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:41,950
And that's a pretty good descriptor for the rock I happen to be standing on anymore.

1462
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,130
So there you go.

1463
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:50,070
Yeah, and at least the lifespans are 70, 80, 90 or whatever.

1464
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:51,630
They're not 5, 6, 700.

1465
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:53,370
Yeah.

1466
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:54,890
Yeah, absolutely.

1467
01:45:55,230 --> 01:46:05,190
If they were in the high level like that, oh, yeah, they would have to be physical – there would have to be a physical change.

1468
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:12,850
In other words, it would have to be beyond what the civil rights movement was, let's say, and women's suffrage and prohibition and all that.

1469
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:23,450
It would have to be very – and if you actually study the times, actually there's very little of ancient days that people did – were more physical in making changes instead of sitting back and saying, hey, it's just the way it is.

1470
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:28,190
So anyway, but now it's just like – it's just a movie show.

1471
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:30,070
Right.

1472
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:31,790
Right.

1473
01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:32,310
All right, guys.

1474
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,530
End credits.

1475
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:36,390
Yeah, I've been through all that before.

1476
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,230
Here's the thing.

1477
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:46,350
If I had a basic Greek-speak script and just said that every time, it would come out a little different every time, but I have gotten some feedback.

1478
01:46:46,570 --> 01:47:00,670
It's all the same basic stuff, and sometimes I'm like, yeah, it is the basic stuff, but I scratch my head and I say, well, even if I spoke typical Greek-speak stuff for four hours over and over and over, the only place you're going to hear it is at Greek-speak unfortunately.

1479
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:07,410
So the thing is, that's why we do these streams, to relax and do the thoughts of the week or whatever informally.

1480
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:17,970
I've mentioned to people that I put on the page to put out for donations for the very simple reason that that's how people vote.

1481
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:23,870
So, for example, I've been putting out this Greek-speak stuff simply because no one else has.

1482
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:29,030
If there's a topic that's really good and I don't have the information someone else does, it can be objectified.

1483
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:31,350
I just send them there, very simple.

1484
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:35,590
But because I like to speak on things, I hear just deaf.

1485
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:38,250
It's just a silence on that need to be spoken.

1486
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:47,430
I asked for donations, so I figured, well, you never know what kind of world this is, and if it's time, you go to the mailbox and there's $100,000 a month there.

1487
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:51,890
And if that happens, you're like, oh crap, it's time.

1488
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:54,190
Hire people and get this thing moved.

1489
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,490
It's time on the planet, right?

1490
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,490
That's why I did it.

1491
01:47:57,610 --> 01:48:06,970
So the way you know, another way that you know if it's time yet is the way that people, what they're willing to reciprocate with, you see.

1492
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:14,170
Now, most of the people that are successful, quote-unquote, in the media are because they're selling you stuff, you see.

1493
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:20,350
And then on the other, so there's the religious side, you know, the big megachurches grow.

1494
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:21,790
You ever see some of these megachurches?

1495
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:23,770
Man, those are like $20 million buildings, right?

1496
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,910
It's like, how did they fund that, you know?

1497
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:31,670
Well, because that preset religious mindset has been around for 1,000 plus years.

1498
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:39,130
The stuff that I'm talking about or maybe the subject matter, never been talked about in public that I could see at all, ever.

1499
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:42,210
So it's not time yet for that.

1500
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:43,930
I don't know.

1501
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:49,790
It's just one of those instances where I would say Greek-speak is an anomaly.

1502
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:53,270
It should have never happened, and it shouldn't be, but it is.

1503
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:56,490
Well, there you go.

1504
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:57,110
And you know what?

1505
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:59,190
You say they only can hear it here.

1506
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:08,090
I would like to take this one and put it on the live stream over at my website, too, just for a little while and expose people to this discussion, if you don't mind.

1507
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,310
No, not at all.

1508
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:10,790
You're more than welcome, Chuck.

1509
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:11,390
Yes.

1510
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:24,550
And I don't utilize the—I have a portion of my website devoted to Ocelli and the Greek, but this would be just something that I would put out on the live stream, and if they hear it, they hear it.

1511
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:35,590
I think it's—but definitely a valuable discussion, and certainly I like to give those things away myself as often as I can.

1512
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:36,950
Very good.

1513
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:37,250
So there you go.

1514
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,010
Very good, yes.

1515
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:39,770
Yeah, yeah.

1516
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:42,830
They call that in the Ocelli—I noticed they call that content.

1517
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:47,370
So do whatever you want with it.

1518
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,090
Yeah, man, great.

1519
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:48,710
All the better.

1520
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,770
If it helps, all the better.

1521
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:52,110
If it hinders, then you know it's hindering.

1522
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:55,970
So either way, and whoever is listening to it, yeah, sure, whatever.

1523
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:57,490
Enjoy it.

1524
01:49:58,070 --> 01:49:58,430
Absolutely.

1525
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:05,660
And by the way, you could pick it up at the chat anyway.

1526
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:14,280
Bruce is pretty diligent about posting the two servers, server A and server B, on the Greek— Chat Django.

1527
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:20,200
And you just pick it up based on the menu there.

1528
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,980
Don't be your heart's content.

1529
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:26,440
Which is a semi—it's a semi-public forum, I would say.

1530
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:29,880
Semi-public, you know, it's not linked.

1531
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,960
Oh, you know, that leads me to a question I had at the beginning of the program, and it's just a technical question.

1532
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:45,740
You were talking about—because I have a Chat Django room also at my website, which I think is just the Ocelli Effect chat room, if you look it up.

1533
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,500
Anyway, if you go to ocelli.com, it's easy.

1534
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:50,040
You go to listen live and chat.

1535
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,440
You press a button, you're there.

1536
01:50:51,440 --> 01:51:01,940
But the thing is that if you're the owner of the chat room, you have the ability to throw somebody out who's making somebody's life miserable.

1537
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:03,080
You can ban them.

1538
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:03,500
Oh, yeah.

1539
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,180
Remove them.

1540
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:11,420
That's a good point, but the earlier chat was set up by others, and those others are—I don't know where they are.

1541
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,500
I've had no response either.

1542
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:15,940
No response.

1543
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,620
You might actually be—you know who it is.

1544
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:18,680
I'm not going to mention her name.

1545
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,060
Yeah, right.

1546
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:19,520
Exactly.

1547
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:20,720
Very gracious lady.

1548
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:22,540
Yeah, starts with an R.

1549
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:23,880
Right, right, right.

1550
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:26,620
Yeah, and I haven't been able—I reached out, but no response.

1551
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,360
I don't know if she's still in this world.

1552
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:28,680
Maybe.

1553
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:29,200
I hope.

1554
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,040
She was always quite pleasant.

1555
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,600
And she's the one who set it up and various other things.

1556
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:39,920
So when things got a little awry, we could have just let it go, but we have zero tolerance for stupidity.

1557
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:50,160
We don't mind debating or contrary views, but when it's just outright gutter talk, I think it's time to abandon that ship and let the insurance company take care of it.

1558
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:50,620
You know what I mean?

1559
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,220
Right.

1560
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:52,440
Oh, I hear you there.

1561
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:56,180
Somebody might have been an administrator over there maybe.

1562
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,860
No, that one was no administrator.

1563
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,360
But this new one has the administrator.

1564
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,680
I have administrative capability, and so does Bruce.

1565
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,660
So we can filter it out.

1566
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:12,380
But also we noticed there's a subtle benefit to keeping it semi-private where someone sends an email first right now at this point.

1567
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:17,700
But now if we do have, like, the character that came around before, we could easily sanitize them.

1568
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:18,300
Okay.

1569
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,460
Thank you for bringing that up.

1570
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:26,580
Yeah, from a cognizant point of view, this was a learning—this was just the way things happened to be, you know.

1571
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,100
Because I've never— You showed them a lot of one side of life.

1572
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,380
Yeah, I've never set anything up.

1573
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:38,920
You know, people early on when I used to speak, people say, you know, what about this one?

1574
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,440
I said, go ahead.

1575
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:39,920
Go do it.

1576
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,520
I'll support it.

1577
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:40,940
You do it.

1578
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:41,540
I'm not going to do it.

1579
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:41,940
You do it.

1580
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,500
You want to set this up, set it up.

1581
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,260
I'll be there.

1582
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:48,580
And the only thing I did was the website because it was easy to do a website.

1583
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,660
It seems to be like a calling card.

1584
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:56,540
These days if you don't have a website, it's like years ago not having a business card, you know.

1585
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,760
You look unprepared.

1586
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:58,560
Right.

1587
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,440
The website is just for show.

1588
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:01,160
Remember years ago?

1589
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:01,700
I said, what do you do?

1590
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:02,360
I do Carpenter.

1591
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:02,900
You got a card?

1592
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,140
No.

1593
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,580
Well, you sound unprepared.

1594
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:08,000
If you tell someone you've got some stuff on the internet, what's your website?

1595
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:09,000
Boom, there's the website.

1596
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:09,840
That's all.

1597
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,140
It's just prepared.

1598
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,940
But there's nothing really—there's no need to put anything on it.

1599
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:20,260
And I don't think there's a need to write treatises and write articles and all of that because it's way past that point.

1600
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:29,840
If we're talking about how the body works, health, conspiracy conclusions or anything else, all that information, believe it or not, is already there.

1601
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,920
Can you objectify it?

1602
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,020
Why rewrite it again?

1603
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:37,780
I mean I recently dropped a link in about blood pressure.

1604
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:41,460
You could look up the definition of blood pressure, and there is no definition.

1605
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:42,780
It's just a magic cuff.

1606
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,740
They put it on you.

1607
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,740
They tell you you've got blood pressure.

1608
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:45,440
It doesn't exist.

1609
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,040
It even says there is no successive information on it.

1610
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:48,440
That's all.

1611
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,480
Remember, I think, Bruce, remember that definition of blood pressure?

1612
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,120
It's all it is.

1613
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,320
There's no purpose for it.

1614
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,060
It's to get younger.

1615
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:57,340
Yeah.

1616
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,000
So, I mean, why do I need to write an article?

1617
01:53:59,100 --> 01:53:59,820
There's no blood pressure.

1618
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:00,840
What if you define it?

1619
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,740
It's already out there.

1620
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,980
They tell you there's no purpose for it.

1621
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:05,980
So, what is it?

1622
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,140
It's a show.

1623
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,340
It's stupid.

1624
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,660
It doesn't exist.

1625
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:15,600
I think it's to make you feel comfortable when you sit down and get ready to be pranked and sit on your thumbtack.

1626
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,440
Yeah.

1627
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,600
All of these health things I don't write about because they're already out there.

1628
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,980
But, you know, there is a point.

1629
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:31,920
For example, I look through notes and things that I've written years ago, and I said, oh, man, this should be put up because why?

1630
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,020
Why?

1631
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:35,760
I look it up, and guess what?

1632
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:38,940
I don't see it on the Internet, and I could give references to it.

1633
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:46,460
Years ago, I mentioned things, and a few minutes later on a chat or a forum, someone would say, come on, Greek man, that sounds interesting, but I can't find it on the Internet.

1634
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,380
So, no link.

1635
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:47,900
You stink.

1636
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,560
And I'm like, you know, it's not on the Internet.

1637
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:51,320
The Internet is subject to human input.

1638
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,840
And lack thereof.

1639
01:54:55,480 --> 01:55:00,240
So from that perspective, there's a lot of stuff that I've come across through the years that could be inputted.

1640
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:03,580
I think it should be done at some point.

1641
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:05,600
But you have so much to sift through now.

1642
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,660
Now, the last thing you want is more.

1643
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:15,760
And people are so used to looking at eating corn out of poop that if you throw down some really clean corn, it's totally foreign, you see.

1644
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:18,640
So there's no reason to write anything right now.

1645
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,280
No, absolutely.

1646
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:32,900
Anyway, with that, I think I'm going to depart because we've gone a little while here, and other things are needing my attention at the moment.

1647
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,580
All right, well, thanks for coming by.

1648
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,500
I do appreciate it.

1649
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:46,700
And, again, you know, it's been a really interesting journey of exploration for me over the past couple of years, and you've certainly been part of it.

1650
01:55:46,700 --> 01:56:09,480
I just want to thank you again for all of your advice and the experience of going through this stuff with you, man.

1651
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,600
I really appreciate it.

1652
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,460
Oh, you're welcome.

1653
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,820
And there's more to come, hopefully.

1654
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:14,800
Okay.

1655
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:16,400
All right, Bruce, I think it's a wrap.

1656
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,700
And feel free to put it on ocelli.com, folks.

1657
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:20,640
That's where you find Chuck.

1658
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:21,940
Thank you.

1659
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,500
All right, guys, thanks.

1660
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:25,920
You have a good night, folks.

1661
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:29,240
And thank you again, Chuck, for coming by.

1662
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:31,580
Absolutely, Bruce.

1663
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:32,000
Thank you.

1664
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:32,320
Bye.

1665
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,780
Okay, good night there, and be well, folks.
