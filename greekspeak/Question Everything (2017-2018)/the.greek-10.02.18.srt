1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,600
Greetings folks, we're live with the Greek.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,420
And how are you doing tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,780
Greetings.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,820
Okay, pretty good, I guess.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,440
Good, good.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,040
We were just talking about a hurricane remediation,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
I think, before we started the stream.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,840
People in the southwest are wondering, and I

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,520
said, well, I just popped a translator in

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,259
a tree, which is basically, it's a four

11
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,160
-foot plastic tube with a double mirror on

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,380
the end, which is, you know, two compact

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,260
mirrors, you know, the mirrors women use in

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,340
their makeup cases.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:40,880
Sure.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,660
You just put the mirrors back to back,

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,020
so, you know, you look at the mirror

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,200
and you flip it and it's another mirror.

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,700
That goes on the end, because that tends

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,660
to periodically and sort of momentarily reflect the

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:54,960
ether.

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:55,980
Yes.

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,240
Outside of time, you can't put a time

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,120
function on it.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,200
Right, right.

26
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,000
And inside the four-foot plastic tube, which

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
is about three inches in diameter, there is

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,120
a galvanized metal tube that's about a foot

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,180
and a half long, and there's an air

30
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,000
gap of a quarter inch between the metal

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,400
tube and the plastic tube, and that's filled

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,180
with silk.

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,980
And that's it, that's a basic translator.

34
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,600
And that was enough to sort of jar

35
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,420
things and stop the, you know, the jet

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,800
stream and whatever, and just pause it a

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,640
little, drop it from a four to a

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
two, which I don't know if it really

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,220
did.

40
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,940
But I was going to break it.

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,120
I have two large guns.

42
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,100
I call them the intercontinental guns, and they're

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,540
three pieces and they kind of go together.

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,680
And I took them out.

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,260
I was cleaning them.

46
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,380
I was like, ah, that's a lot of

47
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,820
work, man.

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,520
And by the time I set up the

49
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,240
ground and it's like, do I really?

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
And when you set it up, you have

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,140
to man them because everything is moving constantly.

52
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,460
And if you focus on an area for

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,260
more than 20 minutes, it gets ignored.

54
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,000
I've never discussed the blind points.

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,520
So it's like, why?

56
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,520
I mean, I've done so many, and it's

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
like there's no reason to do it.

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,940
It's not like anybody is in danger, and

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,240
if they were, that's okay too, I guess.

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,080
I mean, there's danger all the time.

61
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,060
There's worse danger.

62
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,200
So I don't know.

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,320
But I think the big hurricane mitigation days

64
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,800
are over.

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I think it can be done as a

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,540
real project where funding comes in and it's

67
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,820
used for whatever to develop it.

68
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,860
But that's not going to happen.

69
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,340
It's not going to happen in this society.

70
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,020
Yeah.

71
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,440
All right.

72
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,560
So it's what they call seven days since

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,580
the last time we were around.

74
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm reckoning it's the first run to the

75
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,460
‑‑ I lost the day count, but I

76
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,900
know the full moon was about less than

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,500
a week ago.

78
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,300
I've got the ‑‑ I'm keeping track of

79
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,720
this here.

80
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,040
Yeah, it's the first, I think it actually

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,080
is the first Sabbath.

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,580
Ninth day of the eighth month, yeah.

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah, roughly, yeah, we just had a day

84
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:12,800
off.

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,500
Yeah, yeah, that's what I got, yeah, roughly.

86
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,520
You can feel it even if you don't,

87
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,480
you know, are aware of it.

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
People tend to ignore how they feel about

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,840
things, and I don't mean about emotionally and

90
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,260
what crap goes into their minds.

91
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm talking about the body relation, you know,

92
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,140
gauging the body.

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,060
But, again, that's kind of difficult because if

94
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,080
you eat what most people eat, your body

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,340
feels like crap all the time.

96
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
You just get used to it.

97
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,400
But you do feel a little slowing down

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
around these times every seven days, you know,

99
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,400
count the eighth day after the full moon

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,820
or whatever.

101
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,240
All right, I'm looking at the chat.

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,500
I see go back, there's not much to

103
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,320
‑‑ I just opened the email, there's not

104
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,520
much.

105
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,940
I want to thank someone from Alabama.

106
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,320
I got your envelope.

107
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,840
Thank you.

108
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,560
And there's a question, or let's actually have

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,760
you notice ‑‑ you want to read that?

110
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm going to go to the kitchen and

111
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,840
get some coffee.

112
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay.

113
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Having you notice posted something about a coroner,

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,680
I read it earlier, about someone admitting an

115
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,820
official off record capacity that the brain is

116
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
under a vacuum, but, you know, it just

117
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,500
happens to escape them after that, right?

118
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,300
Right.

119
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,300
So, yeah.

120
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
You know, that was interesting.

121
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,280
I was having a conversation, medical, what's called

122
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,700
medical.

123
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,020
He said what could be done, I mean,

124
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,340
you can't fix this society.

125
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,220
It's not possible.

126
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,940
I mean, the way you fix it is

127
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,880
by, you know, redoing it completely.

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,700
You have to scrap everything that's here and

129
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,260
start all over.

130
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,320
But the approach would be, if you had

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,600
to fix it, is you'd get like every

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
‑‑ out of all the millions of people

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,700
that work in the, quote, unquote, health industry,

134
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,640
you get two or three per million, or

135
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,200
it might be maybe less than .001%

136
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,700
that you can work with, you know?

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,380
Right.

138
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
And train them.

139
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,480
And they will admit what you, in other

140
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,420
words, when you, all you do is train

141
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,840
them to accommodate the body, the vacuum in

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,700
the body, now you have a proper perspective

143
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,420
on how to approach medical treatment or, you

144
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,760
know, any form of treatment to the human

145
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,780
body, and then put them back into the

146
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,200
system, right?

147
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,400
Right.

148
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,960
And then let them, you know, teach others.

149
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
And it's not like you're teaching something new.

150
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,280
You're basically just explaining why things happen.

151
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,040
It's already ‑‑ everyone already knows.

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
Anyone who has any training in anatomy or

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,620
the medical whatever already knows.

154
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,740
In other words, they've already observed the reactions

155
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,960
or the vacuum condition, right?

156
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,100
Like when something heals properly, it gets sucked

157
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
into the body.

158
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:51,780
Right.

159
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,120
Right?

160
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,620
You know, there's ‑‑ and when something is

161
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
infected, it's pushed away.

162
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,200
There's swelling, right, and heat.

163
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,480
Right.

164
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,800
So when something heals well, it gets sucked

165
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,200
in, and it's cool, right, relative to the

166
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,540
surroundings.

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,420
So, yeah, it's quite interesting how there's not

168
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,020
much training.

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,460
It's just admission and acknowledgement.

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,940
You know, like when I used to speak

171
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,120
to doctors, they used to walk out, and

172
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,760
I'd say, well, I'd see them later.

173
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,540
I'd say, why'd you walk out?

174
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,280
Well, I can't acknowledge what you're saying.

175
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,860
They didn't say what I was saying wasn't

176
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,340
correct.

177
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,920
They just said I can't acknowledge it, and

178
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,740
I understand why.

179
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,240
Right.

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,620
It's a fraud.

181
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,720
You know, like recently I was at an

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,260
auto parts store, and I was telling the

183
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,120
guy, you know, the whole society is based

184
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,000
on constructive fraud, meaning it's constantly being repaired

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,380
and built up.

186
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,160
You know, more fraud is being built up,

187
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,340
right?

188
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,540
And he didn't understand it.

189
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,920
I said, well, everybody is doing that.

190
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
I said, it doesn't matter.

191
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,020
I didn't say ‑‑ I didn't give a

192
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,540
quantity.

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
I gave a quality.

194
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,420
It doesn't matter if one person in society

195
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,820
is living a fraudulent life, or all of

196
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,980
them are.

197
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,480
The fact is that there's constructive fraud eminent

198
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,460
throughout the entire society in everything.

199
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:04,820
Oh, God, yeah.

200
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Most people, like, they like to hide behind

201
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,140
the plausibility.

202
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,200
Well, everybody does it, so I'll do it

203
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,760
too, right?

204
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,020
Well, that's not the point.

205
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,820
That's not why facts are stated, you know,

206
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,760
unless they're quantitative facts, you know, giving a

207
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,120
statistic of how many people, right?

208
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,460
But once you get into the plausibility aspect,

209
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,740
then you don't have to do that because

210
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,560
everyone does it.

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,740
So there you go.

212
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,300
So there's that.

213
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,530
And that's my story, and I'm sticking to

214
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:33,750
it.

215
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,130
Right.

216
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:34,590
Right.

217
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,270
You know, when you were talking about one

218
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,510
person teaching another in that profession, you know,

219
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,750
you start, well, then they're caught in a

220
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,510
nasty position where, you know, they're looking at

221
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,090
the legal system, the administrations, and all that

222
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,490
kind of stuff, and they have to make

223
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,350
a decision whether they want to carry on

224
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,390
with the fraud or move on.

225
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,890
What an awful, rude awakening.

226
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,690
It is because you're on your own when

227
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,410
that happens because everyone around you is supporting

228
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,710
you in that scheme, right?

229
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,170
And then when you want to break out,

230
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,690
you have to, your friend's family, well, you

231
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,450
want to explain why you're leaving, but you

232
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,870
can't, so you just give a couple of

233
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,370
pat answers.

234
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:23,830
No, you can't.

235
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,550
I feel I can accredit myself to having

236
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,590
a couple of attorneys and doctors quit their

237
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,210
professions from after having discussions with them.

238
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,770
Not because I say this.

239
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,210
They came back and said, listen, I heard

240
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,250
you, and I considered it.

241
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,590
It took me a couple of years, but

242
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,650
I did it, and I'm glad I'm out

243
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:39,970
of there.

244
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,190
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,370
And I feel that's like a really good

246
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,010
accomplishment.

247
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,750
It is.

248
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,490
They got lawyers and doctors and stuff to

249
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,590
quit their profession.

250
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,270
It's not going to make much of a

251
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,250
difference, but you get one or two to

252
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,350
quit.

253
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,510
To them personally, yes.

254
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,290
A start would be like most of them

255
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,210
quit and put on a barge and sunk,

256
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,450
but that would be a good start, but

257
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,230
that's not going to happen.

258
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,450
The reason why you put them on a

259
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,670
barge and sink it is because they're unrehabilitatable.

260
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,910
They won't be able to fit in again.

261
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,510
So either way, that's just the way this

262
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:17,830
is.

263
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,610
Exiled in their own mind.

264
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,150
Well, the thing is, the benefits of this

265
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,150
is of understanding what's going on is you

266
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,570
still have the air is relatively sweet, and

267
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,330
so is the water.

268
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,910
In other words, when you breathe the air,

269
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,770
it's not accurate, and you have to wear

270
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,430
a gas mask, and the water is still

271
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,570
relatively okay.

272
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,470
I mean, not drinking tap water.

273
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,270
They deliberately keep the tap water in bad

274
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,310
shape, and even if they didn't, you've got

275
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,170
straight pipes, so it's going to diminish in

276
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,530
quality.

277
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,090
But you generally can still seek out things

278
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,870
that are pleasant, generally, not all the time.

279
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,590
You still can seek out pleasantries and things

280
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,490
that are affirming to why life should go

281
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:02,870
on.

282
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,350
But the majority of the systems and things

283
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,350
that are put in place by man and

284
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,730
also nature's catching up are leading towards utter

285
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,310
destruction.

286
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,510
And I don't mean that generally.

287
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,470
I could be specific.

288
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,530
In other words, nature is going to also

289
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,610
start showing why this can't go on, which

290
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,670
is okay.

291
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,190
Because it just can't go on.

292
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,670
It's like pulling off a band-aid.

293
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,910
You can't just leave it on.

294
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,290
It has to come off.

295
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,230
It has to come off sometime.

296
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,270
Yep.

297
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,690
So, yeah.

298
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,590
And the thing is, one thing I was

299
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,750
having a discussion with someone recently is why

300
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,370
isn't there, like, one specific place?

301
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,490
You know, I think they somehow found out

302
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,430
a way to get over to the servers

303
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,830
you've got going on there.

304
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,410
Oh, okay.

305
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,770
And it was like, well, there's not one

306
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,350
introductory.

307
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,590
Actually, the question is, you know, why isn't

308
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,230
there an introductory Greek speak going over all

309
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,230
the points in the beginning?

310
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,070
Whoa.

311
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,370
Yeah, it's a lot because it's everything, a

312
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:05,790
little bit of everything.

313
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,210
How do you purpose something like this?

314
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,230
Well, it's a mindset.

315
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,730
Just be objective and look at what things

316
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,070
are based on and try to find the

317
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,810
history of that thing.

318
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,270
That's it.

319
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:16,770
Right.

320
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,010
Yeah.

321
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,610
Some of the best way to find that

322
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,570
is if you find, like, an initial interview.

323
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,510
If I have done an initial interview with

324
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,030
someone, I usually start off with a recap

325
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,210
of some very obvious points.

326
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,110
Oh, by the way, great job with Chuck

327
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,210
this last time.

328
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,130
You packed a lot of information in there

329
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,390
again.

330
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,330
Yeah, Chuck is pretty harmless.

331
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,650
And the thing is I did someone left

332
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:42,970
a comment.

333
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,550
He didn't really throw up too many roadblocks

334
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,390
or easy to get around because, you know,

335
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,630
Chuck is very mainstream.

336
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,690
Yes, he is.

337
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,330
He doesn't think he is, but he is

338
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,550
very mainstream.

339
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,890
So I don't find great joy in discussing

340
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,650
these things that way.

341
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,650
Like, I have to start from the base.

342
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:02,370
Yeah.

343
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,670
But even if you want to be more

344
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,610
elaborate, you still have to refer to basic

345
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,110
things.

346
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,730
And also, you know, I got to send

347
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,170
appreciation or thanks because he put up with

348
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,170
me doing the Ocelli and the Greek, and

349
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,930
that put out some really good stuff for

350
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,970
quite a few people.

351
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,090
Quite a few could be anywhere between one

352
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,690
to 20 that kind of get it and

353
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,610
can move on with, you know, the mindset.

354
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,670
So, but yeah, you said good job, I

355
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,910
guess.

356
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,030
Why was it a good?

357
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,450
Let me just ask you when people say,

358
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,870
when I ask people, how was this?

359
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,190
It's good.

360
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,150
So why is it good?

361
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,830
You captured a lot of different subjects with

362
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,870
history involved.

363
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,530
You moved through it very, very flawlessly.

364
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,270
You hit many, many topics that I think

365
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,490
were necessary.

366
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,210
Okay.

367
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,590
In that respect, it was in general, I

368
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,750
guess I want to say, as a complete

369
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,330
package.

370
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,850
It was good to hear.

371
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,230
And I think it will do, hopefully it

372
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,210
will do somebody well.

373
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,610
Well, there may be.

374
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,570
But to see that, see, first I started

375
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,430
calling people unaware and then I call them

376
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,990
morons and idiots and then space heaters.

377
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,470
And now they're livestock.

378
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,790
And most people just possibly focus on that.

379
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:28,990
Right.

380
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,750
So there's an evolution in terms there as

381
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,970
well.

382
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,090
Yeah, there's an evolution in terms that I'm

383
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,430
using.

384
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,490
But eventually we'll go back to unaware and

385
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,950
moron.

386
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,110
And here's the thing.

387
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,370
You can't, at this point, it's a little

388
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,630
way, I should say, way past the line

389
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,870
where plausibility can be used.

390
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,110
Meaning where you can say, well, they don't

391
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,470
know.

392
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,750
They were misled.

393
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,550
That's total bullshit at this point.

394
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,690
Because they have access.

395
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,410
They can see it.

396
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,970
They use it.

397
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,030
They speak it.

398
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,110
So they can't be that blinded by this

399
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,670
authority.

400
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,370
You know, what they consider authority, you know,

401
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,650
government, university, doctors, priests, rabbis.

402
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,330
They can't be that blind, are they?

403
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,030
I would have to say yes.

404
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,810
I mean, looking back where I was a

405
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,330
way long time before ever coming across any

406
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,910
of this, there was no reason to look

407
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,390
at history.

408
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,850
There was no reason to move on past

409
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,830
what was thrown at me throughout my life.

410
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,210
And I guess that's what, I guess, really

411
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,710
bugged me when I first started looking into

412
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,250
history.

413
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,750
I was like, how in the hell did

414
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,290
I never get any of this?

415
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,910
Where was it?

416
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,130
Well, it's false as well, the history that

417
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,730
they put up.

418
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,270
But even with the false history, let's say,

419
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,090
take JFK with the magic bullet.

420
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:56,870
Sure.

421
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,030
I mean, at one point they say, you

422
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,450
know, there's no such thing as a magic

423
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:00,790
bullet.

424
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,930
So then you could say, wow, they're just

425
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,190
basically, they think so little of the public

426
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,130
that they're putting out bullshit and getting away

427
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,570
with it.

428
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,570
So that's part of that.

429
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,530
The bullshit is part of the history.

430
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,250
I mean, like 9-11 or any of

431
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,270
the events, Pearl Harbor.

432
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,250
You can actually include what's called the official

433
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,610
story or the plausibility as part of the

434
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,470
history to show how ridiculous the people and

435
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,370
the authorities really are, both sides.

436
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,590
So even the false history is part of

437
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,050
the history.

438
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,270
Right, right.

439
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,030
And it's really, really pushed and it's absorbed

440
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,790
by everybody and changes their way.

441
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,050
It's amazing.

442
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,230
I deal with that every day.

443
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,850
And I just walk away by just shaking

444
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,070
my head and just, oh, well, you know,

445
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,810
sorry to see that.

446
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,010
Well, it is.

447
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,090
It's even worse than sorry that we're here.

448
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,750
You know, if you do realize these things,

449
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,310
if you read ancient writs, it's like you

450
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,630
should be sorry that you're here.

451
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,570
I mean, it tells you not to worry.

452
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,830
It tells you don't, you know, don't get

453
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,750
mixed up with them.

454
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,890
Set yourself apart.

455
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,710
Don't, you know, there's no reason to get

456
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,970
anything organized to change anything because it ain't

457
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,550
going to happen.

458
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,110
Changes will happen, but you have to, and,

459
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,710
you know, it's interesting, ancient writs kind of,

460
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,130
you do catch up on the changes quickly.

461
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,510
They tell you, you know, what the changes

462
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,490
will be in society.

463
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,830
And if you understand how to keep time

464
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,290
or put them in proper placement, you'll know

465
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,870
whether it's in your lifetime or not.

466
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,090
And other than that, it's lamenting that you

467
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,230
were born here is actually one of the

468
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,870
greatest realizations anyone can have.

469
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,910
There's no reason to find any joy or

470
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,370
happiness in being born here, you see.

471
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,590
Once you realize that sad aspect that you

472
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,350
were brought into this world, then you seek

473
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,609
joy and happiness because you're here.

474
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,510
But being born here and coming here is

475
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,790
actually a terrible thing for a spirit and

476
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,130
a soul, you know, to be a spirit

477
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,170
with a soul and a body.

478
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,450
Not initially, but now it is, and it

479
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,730
has been for thousands of years.

480
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,310
So once you find yourself in that calamity,

481
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,950
just being born here, you can then seek

482
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,109
joy and happiness best you can, you see.

483
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,870
But the people do the opposite.

484
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,650
They find joy and happiness in being born.

485
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,950
That's a sad thing.

486
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,090
But now that you're here, make the best

487
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,630
of it, right?

488
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,470
So it's kind of backwards.

489
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,450
Yeah, but it works.

490
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,350
If you can make it work, yeah.

491
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,290
Keep it simple.

492
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,910
Don't complicate yourself.

493
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,030
If you start learning things and you can

494
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,050
prove them out, there's no reason to jump

495
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,790
in there with both feet, eyes closed again.

496
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,490
You might have to enter those situations or

497
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,830
those institutions or people or societies or whatever,

498
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,210
but you keep yourself guarded.

499
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,010
Yes, yes.

500
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,370
And you actually appreciate being in a minimalist

501
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:19,210
setting, a social setting, meaning a minimalist social

502
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,630
setting.

503
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,750
You know, there was a study.

504
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,150
I used to look a lot at the

505
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,190
psychology and psychiatry stuff they put out.

506
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,490
And you could find, because they spend their

507
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,690
lives researching this, you could find some good

508
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,750
statistical stuff, whether it's been adjusted or played

509
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,290
with or not.

510
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,990
You'll have to look at the supporting evidence.

511
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,610
And if the evidence looks bunk, it's probably

512
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,090
made up.

513
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,810
But what's interesting is no matter one of

514
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,790
the things I got out of studying this

515
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,550
is one of actually quite a few, just

516
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,810
for comparative analysis, quantitatively, is no matter whether

517
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,050
you grew up in a small town or

518
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,550
a big city or went to a big

519
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,510
college or a small college or exposed to

520
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,610
a lot of people or a few people,

521
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,870
your own personal group is still roughly the

522
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,890
same number of people.

523
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,030
So someone growing up in a small town

524
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,450
in Ohio will probably have the same number

525
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,490
of acquaintances and friends in their small social

526
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,770
group as someone who grew up in New

527
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,290
York City.

528
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,210
Let me see.

529
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:17,610
OK.

530
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,370
Yeah.

531
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,130
So there's no – in other words, you

532
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,450
make the – well, in other words, even

533
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,930
when people aren't deciding, there tends to be

534
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,390
a gravitational field that attracts X amount of

535
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,390
people on average and that's it, right?

536
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,930
So in a small town, you might have

537
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,070
four or five acquaintances and two or three

538
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,690
friends, the same as if you're in New

539
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,130
York City.

540
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,570
And we're not talking about passerbys that you're

541
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,770
familiar with and all that.

542
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,390
But even then, passerbys – I remember living

543
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,830
in big cities and the passerbys that you

544
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,870
greeted were still about the same as if

545
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,850
when I was in a small city based

546
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,390
on occurrence.

547
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,950
If you're in a small city and it's

548
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,350
an empty road and there's no one there,

549
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,230
well, of course not.

550
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,910
But I mean when people were around.

551
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,740
So – and someone put 97.25%

552
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,980
of statistical data is bullshit.

553
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,640
That's right.

554
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,820
It is.

555
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,080
That's why you've got – when they give

556
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,240
you statistics, they've got to show you how

557
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,840
they came across it and the evidence.

558
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,500
And that's what you study.

559
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,160
See, the statistics is bullshit usually because they

560
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,720
– that's why they've developed that system to

561
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,040
hide the bullshit or pass it through.

562
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,300
So you look at how they came across

563
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,800
it, right?

564
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,500
I mean I use statistics typically if I'm,

565
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,880
let's say, working on certain things and it's

566
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,080
repetitive statistically.

567
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,620
You know, when I do a – when

568
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,580
I apply a procedure to something and it

569
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,320
has to be repeated, I see that if

570
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
I repeat that procedure, do I get the

571
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
exact same results?

572
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,680
And what are the variables?

573
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,600
Right.

574
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
And then I could develop a statistic saying,

575
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,400
well, maybe I need to either accept the

576
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,100
variable, the inconsistencies, or do I change my

577
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,400
procedure, you see, to – Right, right.

578
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,300
In other words, does the variable affect the

579
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,980
outcome?

580
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,060
Right.

581
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,380
I mean actually scripture is statistical, believe it

582
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,700
or not.

583
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,080
Let's see what that word means.

584
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,380
I'll look it up real quick.

585
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,560
Do I even have etymology?

586
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,880
I got – by the way, it's a

587
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,460
minor inconvenience and I like it when it

588
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,840
happens.

589
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,720
I somehow accepted a Maxthon, which is a

590
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,300
browser I use, M-A-X-T-H

591
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,300
-O-N, upgrade and it wiped the bookmarks.

592
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,320
Oh no.

593
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
So it's kind of like going on someone

594
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,620
– you know, just a library computer.

595
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,380
Sure.

596
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
So I've got to do everything longhand.

597
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,860
That's why sometimes I might ask you for

598
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,480
a link or someone else, you know, on

599
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,620
Skype, just drop, do you have a link

600
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,000
for this?

601
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,380
Please drop it in, you know, or whatever.

602
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,300
Right.

603
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,220
Like this chat, I had to do a

604
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
longhand search for it.

605
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,760
Oh my goodness.

606
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,400
Oh, that's pretty – can you uninstall and

607
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
get your stuff back or are you pretty

608
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,140
much poached?

609
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,060
Yeah, it's up on a cloud somewhere.

610
00:21:59,600 --> 00:21:59,700
Oh.

611
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,920
It's a cloud server.

612
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,660
Sure.

613
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
And you have to log in and it

614
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,180
somehow wants me to log in using something

615
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm not familiar with, so.

616
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:06,820
Oh.

617
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah.

618
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,560
And also – I see a statistic, one

619
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,880
numeral statistic from 1939.

620
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,480
Etymology.

621
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,920
Yeah, in reference to a person considered as

622
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,500
nothing more than an example of something measured

623
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,300
quantity.

624
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,540
Right, it's quantitative.

625
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,500
Statistics, let's do it here.

626
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,340
It was just statistics.

627
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,560
Science dealing with data about condition, state, or

628
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,100
community.

629
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
From German, Statistik, popularized and perhaps coined by

630
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,380
German.

631
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,460
The science of Gottfried Aschenwald.

632
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,240
Okay, statistician, statistical from statistics.

633
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,920
Oh, click on it.

634
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,620
Oh, that goes back a ways there, holy

635
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:48,980
smokes.

636
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,300
Oh yeah.

637
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,380
1719, wow.

638
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,560
Well, that's pre-Victorian.

639
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,380
Yeah.

640
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,280
I think I discussed – there's many things

641
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,880
to discuss.

642
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,380
You know, I've been going through some notes

643
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,340
I've had for over a decade and I

644
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,760
found – I did some study on the

645
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,640
Victorian era, which was quite interesting because she

646
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,300
was like a queen and an anti-queen

647
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,240
at the same time, right?

648
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,100
Right, right.

649
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,160
I don't want to discuss things that people

650
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,460
are not familiar with because I've asked so

651
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,880
many people, are you familiar with the Victorian

652
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,200
era?

653
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,980
And they say, well, I've heard of it,

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,940
but I don't know anything about it.

655
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,460
And if you ask like a hundred people

656
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,960
over a year and no one knows anything

657
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,720
about it, you know you're not going to

658
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,000
– it's not a popular water cooler topic

659
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,740
or Skype topic.

660
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:26,980
Right, right.

661
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,000
So I don't discuss it.

662
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,280
But it's an interesting time period because that's

663
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,200
when a lot of the changes that you

664
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,980
see today have been – were made firm.

665
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,220
Right.

666
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,560
The 1880s was a big experimentation time on

667
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,600
human society.

668
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,940
So let's see.

669
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,280
Yeah, basically it is math.

670
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,620
Well, they're accrediting it more to certain people

671
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,380
that elevated it to, you know, whatever it's

672
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,880
known today, more than the use of the

673
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,620
word in general terms.

674
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,500
So it's basically bean counting, bookkeeping.

675
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,580
Yep.

676
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,920
I enjoy it because it's objective.

677
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
You know, when you're talking about – It

678
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,220
improves on more things, yep.

679
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,060
Yeah, because you can just – and most

680
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,040
of the Greek-speak stuff is not quantitative.

681
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,640
It's qualitative, I'd say.

682
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,080
Right.

683
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,480
The purpose of focusing on qualitative aspects is

684
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,260
because they've been abandoned generally.

685
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,860
So, I mean, you know, like people look

686
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,300
at – for years, movies, when they report

687
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,780
a new movie, it's how much it earned

688
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,440
that weekend.

689
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
That's what makes it a good movie, right?

690
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,000
Or a bad movie.

691
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,300
Right.

692
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,420
So I started noticing early on in life

693
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,460
how it didn't matter.

694
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,300
The quantities were a joke in terms of

695
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,380
what can be perceived.

696
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,360
It's – you're being pranked, basically.

697
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,340
That's another – Well, even if you get

698
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,160
a million dollar doll hairs to come and

699
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,320
watch some poor movie, and based on that

700
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,500
they say it's good, you know, the movies

701
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,480
still suck, you know.

702
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,680
Oh, and the entertainment industry is just crap.

703
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, God, yes.

704
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,140
And I have a right to say it.

705
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,280
I know people in there.

706
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,980
I mean, I have – I won't say

707
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,100
it.

708
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,860
A relative was the CEO of a major

709
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,280
– two major movie houses.

710
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,580
And I know people in the – years

711
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,980
ago, especially, in the – and I've met

712
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,940
actors and directors and people and personal acquaintance

713
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,140
of people I don't want to mention.

714
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,920
They are pretty stupid.

715
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,140
And I mean that in a neutral sense,

716
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,780
not as a put-down, not as a

717
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,140
pejorative.

718
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,320
They're not smart people, none of them.

719
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,200
That's such a strange world.

720
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,820
And when you talk about them generally, so

721
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,400
what do you do?

722
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,080
I mean, what are you doing?

723
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,480
This stuff is kind of – well, we're

724
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,460
just telling stories.

725
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,440
That's what they all – there's a spirit,

726
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,000
by the way.

727
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,720
There's a spirit behind it.

728
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,100
If you get to know like a –

729
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,400
let's not mention a movie studio like Paramount

730
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,700
Pictures.

731
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,500
If you get to know the CEO and

732
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,060
you basically have a sort of not even

733
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,080
a Greek-speak conversation with him but something

734
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,260
bordering on it, they'll just kind of roll

735
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,480
their eyes and like, yeah, we're just telling

736
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,080
stories.

737
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,560
So if you run into an actor like

738
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,640
someone who's in a major movie like The

739
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,920
Matrix, we're not going to mention anybody.

740
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,720
They'll say, oh, yeah, it's just a story.

741
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,600
I say, this is really dumb.

742
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,920
Well, that's just a story.

743
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,280
Or if you run into another, let's say,

744
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,820
an actress and say, well, this is –

745
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,560
why is it so superficial?

746
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,780
Oh, we're just telling stories.

747
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,080
It's like these people who don't know of

748
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,180
each other say the same thing.

749
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,880
We're just telling a story.

750
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,320
So this is like the Christians.

751
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,060
Yeah, it's a hive mentality.

752
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,060
That's their line.

753
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,720
Like the Christians, if you ask them, is

754
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,320
Christianity biblical?

755
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, yeah.

756
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,200
And they say, what about this, this and

757
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,380
that?

758
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,200
Well, we don't really do that.

759
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,160
Well, what about this, this and that?

760
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,920
Well, you see, it's based on tradition.

761
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,200
And then if you say, what about this,

762
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,200
this and that in the scripture?

763
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,660
Then they'll say, well, who wrote that anyway?

764
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,900
I don't need that to believe.

765
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,600
So then they end up discrediting it if

766
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,260
you push for more than 30 seconds.

767
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,220
So they have a hive mentality.

768
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,900
The Muslims have a hive mentality.

769
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,000
If you push them, they say, well, that

770
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,080
can't be true because the Koran was written

771
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,340
to be simple, and what you're saying is

772
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,940
not simple, so it can't be true.

773
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,740
That's their hive.

774
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,780
So they all have their hive mentality, right?

775
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,360
Yeah.

776
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,040
Usually politicians and high-end attorneys, which are

777
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,340
low-end, usually say, are you trying to

778
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,700
say we don't have a right to exist?

779
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,100
I've heard that from several political people and

780
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,860
legal people.

781
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,720
Yeah.

782
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,760
I'll tell you, the doctors, their famous line

783
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,620
that they all say is, well, that's what

784
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,780
they tell us to do.

785
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,720
They all say that.

786
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,600
You know, when you start criticizing blood pressure

787
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,560
and everything, they say, well, that's what they

788
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,140
tell us.

789
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,820
Like, what do you mean they?

790
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,460
You're the teacher.

791
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,140
You're the doctor educating doctors.

792
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,080
Oh, well, that's what's in the manual.

793
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,780
Okay, but you wrote the manual.

794
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,420
Yeah, I know.

795
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,160
Yeah.

796
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,600
So you notice these, when I talk about

797
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,200
the cosmic censorship and your mind, your thoughts

798
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,860
are not your own, that is one of

799
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,480
the quote-unquote statistical things that I put

800
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
together to come up with such a claim.

801
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:05,960
Right.

802
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,700
So when I make a claim like there's

803
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,920
cosmic censorship and your thoughts are not happening

804
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,760
in your head, I had seen repetitive repeating

805
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
statements from people unbeknownst to each other in

806
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
different times, in different settings, and they all

807
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,160
seem to say the same thing.

808
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,180
There has to be something behind that, etheric,

809
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,200
you know, spiritual, right, the guidance.

810
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,940
And, yeah, so once you're aware of it

811
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,740
and you have to guard, one thing you

812
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,680
find in scripture is you constantly have to

813
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,500
guard yourself.

814
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,300
And people say, well, I can't do that.

815
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,540
I don't want to be, you know, that'll

816
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,780
make me worry or whatever.

817
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,760
What's the old saying?

818
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,860
Worry is the interest you pay when you

819
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,960
borrow trouble, right?

820
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,720
Right.

821
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,240
That's an old saying.

822
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,640
So, you know, the thing is most people

823
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,620
are like, oh, I don't want to constantly

824
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:55,980
be a thing.

825
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,040
Well, you are anyway.

826
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,260
About dumb shit.

827
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:58,940
Right.

828
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,380
If you've ever been around people who have

829
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,780
specialized training like, you know, let's talk about

830
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,740
the weaponized morons like military people.

831
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,380
Someone who is, let's say, trained for that

832
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,300
as a special ops type person, they're always

833
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,100
on guard and they're relaxed about it.

834
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,400
Actually, if they weren't on guard, they wouldn't

835
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,200
be relaxed.

836
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,880
Right.

837
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Because they need that.

838
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,900
In other words, these people are trained to

839
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,760
have a higher sense of greater input.

840
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,060
Another example would be musicians.

841
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,580
How many times have, well, let's just say

842
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,880
you walk into a room and you hear

843
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,400
someone playing.

844
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,980
You're like, oh, that instrument's out of tune.

845
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,160
And they're like, really?

846
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm like, yeah, it's out of tune.

847
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,620
You better stop playing and tune that.

848
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,440
Right?

849
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,080
Right.

850
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,060
If it's a wind instrument, you know, the

851
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,920
reed needs to be tightened or replaced.

852
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,820
The string instrument, obviously, the tensions need to

853
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,420
be adjusted.

854
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,560
You know, I remember, not recently, but fairly

855
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,740
recently, I walked into a place, a piano

856
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,040
man was playing.

857
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,580
I said, that soundboard sounds cracked.

858
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,500
This piano is out of tune.

859
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,220
No, we just tuned it.

860
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,840
See, there's a crack in the soundboard.

861
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,360
You know, the soundboard is where all the,

862
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,700
right?

863
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,100
Right.

864
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,020
You open the top, right?

865
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,380
Okay.

866
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,560
Right.

867
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,240
And then later on, I discovered, I said,

868
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,840
let me look in there.

869
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,900
And I said, there's a crack in the

870
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,260
soundboard.

871
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,220
Well, how can I hear that?

872
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,340
You know, I mean, most people don't hear

873
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,620
that.

874
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Right.

875
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,660
Because I know what, I had heard a

876
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,360
piano with a cracked soundboard, and I knew

877
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,540
it.

878
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,840
And you remember.

879
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,420
And it's not, okay, some people say, well,

880
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
that's too much detail.

881
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,380
I'm not interested in that.

882
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,960
Well, that's fine.

883
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,820
You're just a, you know, whatever.

884
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,580
I know the feeling about when you walk

885
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,180
into a room and something's out of tune,

886
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,020
you know, immediately.

887
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,140
Yeah.

888
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,480
And years ago in the mining, working with

889
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,980
mines and stuff, there was a couple of

890
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,760
people that were around.

891
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,280
There were ex, high level, I should say,

892
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,380
intelligence people that were, got kind of, they

893
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,640
stole enough money or whatever from, and they

894
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,180
left, and they were semi-retired, and they

895
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,420
hung around the mines and stuff.

896
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,080
And, you know, we're in the car one

897
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,040
day, and a guy says, you know, we're

898
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,580
being followed.

899
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,340
And I said, what do you mean?

900
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,140
He says, well, I don't, well, no, not

901
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,520
the car behind us, and not the car

902
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,560
behind that, but two cars behind that.

903
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,240
You know, you see that yellow pickup?

904
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,180
That's been following us for the past few

905
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,560
hours.

906
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,700
You know, and I'm like, wow, I didn't

907
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,300
notice that.

908
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,900
You know, you don't follow someone like the

909
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,660
movies, you know.

910
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,380
Right.

911
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,020
Directly behind them, you follow from a distance.

912
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,160
In other words, if they're in your sight,

913
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
you're being, well, you're following someone, they're in

914
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,280
your sight, whether it's a mile or half

915
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,460
a mile, you know, whatever.

916
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,760
It could be a couple of miles.

917
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,180
As long as you know where they are,

918
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,460
that's following them.

919
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,340
Right?

920
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,280
So, and we put that to a test.

921
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,760
You know, we pulled off a highway, went

922
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,440
into shops or whatever, and that car, again,

923
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,220
came off.

924
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,460
Yep.

925
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
It didn't go where we were going, but

926
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,820
we were in line of sight.

927
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,060
And I was like, holy shit, this guy

928
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,340
is right.

929
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,620
How the hell did he pick up on

930
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:41,820
that?

931
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
In other words, our field of view was

932
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,320
the immediate car or the immediate surroundings.

933
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,060
This guy's field of view, he was trained

934
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,800
to be as far as the eye can

935
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,080
see.

936
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:50,800
Right.

937
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,260
You know, in perspective, right?

938
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah.

939
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,520
And recognize.

940
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,860
So, I learned right there.

941
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
I said, wow, this is a good idea

942
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,660
or a good mindset to have.

943
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,580
You know, when you're going to take in

944
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,500
a field of view or a field of

945
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,640
perception, use it.

946
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,600
Don't say, well, that's further away than this,

947
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,020
so I don't need to pay attention to

948
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,200
it.

949
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,880
No, you actually should look at everything.

950
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,080
But, again.

951
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,280
You have to exercise it.

952
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,460
You have to.

953
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,280
Yeah.

954
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,100
Keep it aligned.

955
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,860
Yeah, just like the gym.

956
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,220
If you go into the gym the first

957
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,840
couple of days, you won't be able to

958
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,660
use everything there.

959
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
You'll be really sore.

960
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,260
If you keep going to the gym like

961
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,740
everyone else, after a year or two, you'll

962
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,200
benefit.

963
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,480
So, again, these are things not for most

964
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,840
people.

965
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,240
But I think anyone with an earshot can

966
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,960
use it.

967
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,800
So, there we go.

968
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,080
If there's nothing going on, let's see.

969
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,900
The New Greek Speak chat, I see nine

970
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,340
people.

971
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,140
Any questions?

972
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,140
Nothing, really?

973
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,700
Inbox?

974
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,100
Nothing?

975
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,540
Yeah, we can make it a short one,

976
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,420
unless someone wants to call in or say

977
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,920
something.

978
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,540
Right.

979
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
Or do something.

980
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,740
You have many ways to call in, folks.

981
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,640
The contact information, of course, is Greek's email

982
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,320
address, theuncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com.

983
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,820
Or you can call into live, colon, question

984
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,860
everything, colon.

985
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,740
Okay, cool.

986
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,320
We'll let that mosey on down the stream.

987
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,400
Takes a little bit to get to everybody.

988
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,920
So, you can get a telephone number by

989
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,820
using the browser of Google or Skype or

990
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,060
whatever.

991
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,040
I think through a fee.

992
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,340
Yeah, you don't have to call the telephone

993
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,360
company anymore, right?

994
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,520
No, no.

995
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,620
Okay, good.

996
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,060
There's many, many ways.

997
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,280
Right, and there are apps, I know, for

998
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,980
cell phones.

999
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:38,940
Okay.

1000
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,640
So, that entire convention has happened to stay

1001
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,300
within the realm.

1002
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,600
Really, really break along and got away from

1003
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,460
Mobile in a lot of ways.

1004
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,080
Right, but it doesn't work the same way,

1005
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,400
right?

1006
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,140
No, no.

1007
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,400
So, do you hear the background music?

1008
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,280
I'm going to turn this down.

1009
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,380
Yes, I do.

1010
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,720
It's a lovely music.

1011
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,360
Yeah, okay.

1012
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,100
I'm going to turn that down.

1013
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,560
So, I'm pretty much wired for sound here.

1014
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,800
Okay, I guess if there isn't much, is

1015
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,219
there anything else on your mind, Bruce?

1016
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,280
Let's see.

1017
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,900
What else?

1018
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,880
You know, I was thinking about trusses, the

1019
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,420
things that people tie them.

1020
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,880
You know, I notice more and more.

1021
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,020
Trusses as in what, structural?

1022
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,840
Belts, things that people tighten themselves down with

1023
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,739
in order to keep their garments on and

1024
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,120
everything.

1025
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,940
So many people just walk around with these

1026
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,679
things so bloody tight on themselves.

1027
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,840
It's like, how in the hell?

1028
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,840
And then you notice how they always have

1029
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,000
these different irritabilities with themselves and abdominal problems.

1030
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,340
Well, girding oneself is good if you do

1031
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,960
it evenly.

1032
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:49,900
Right.

1033
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,320
Yeah, but not as a point source like

1034
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,860
a strap.

1035
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah.

1036
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,420
That would be annoying.

1037
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,880
If you go to the ghetto, it's the

1038
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,240
opposite.

1039
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,420
They don't have belts.

1040
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,460
Right.

1041
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,220
It's a matter of letting everything fall.

1042
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,740
Yeah, there's plenty of that around.

1043
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,500
Well, yeah.

1044
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,040
I was telling someone the New World Order

1045
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,960
is not what you think.

1046
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,220
It's about getting everyone to wear sneakers with

1047
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,300
no shoelaces, their pants hanging down, their baseball

1048
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,860
hat tilted to the side.

1049
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,940
Improper use of language.

1050
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,000
You know, this ghetto, the black American ghetto.

1051
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:23,900
Ebonics.

1052
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah, ebonics, being into the culture.

1053
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,920
That's your New World Order, one of the

1054
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,400
implements.

1055
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,060
It's not this, yeah, dystopian.

1056
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,780
Yeah, exactly.

1057
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,540
It's working.

1058
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,420
It's one of the tools.

1059
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,320
And they don't even know.

1060
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
That's one of the tools that's been used

1061
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,620
for a while.

1062
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,840
You know, you had me thinking ever since

1063
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,380
you mentioned about the subtle effects and everything.

1064
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,520
Boy, that's left me thinking for weeks on

1065
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,860
that and looking around.

1066
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,520
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,260
There's an interesting, someone sent me a link

1068
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,520
to a YouTube recently.

1069
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,800
I think it's 54 Minutes Media and 9

1070
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,920
-11, like hints in the media from 9

1071
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,140
-11.

1072
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,240
It's 54 Minutes.

1073
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,920
Okay.

1074
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,400
I don't think I bookmarked it.

1075
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,580
It was something about clues to 9-11

1076
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,320
in the media.

1077
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,620
It's around 50 some odd minutes.

1078
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,700
And it goes back to the 70s where

1079
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,120
they showed jet airplanes going into the Twin

1080
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,060
Towers, like a G.I. Joe cartoon.

1081
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,920
Right, yeah.

1082
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,860
And it's just, some of them you kind

1083
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,240
of have to, it's kind of like pushing

1084
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,740
it a little.

1085
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,080
But most of them were just direct.

1086
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,140
I mean, just really direct.

1087
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,940
Oh, my.

1088
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,020
You know, hundreds of examples of the Twin

1089
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,360
Towers coming down, even like in wrestling with

1090
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Hulkmania.

1091
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,100
It's like, look, those Twin Towers are going

1092
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,180
to be knocked down.

1093
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,680
You know, they keep saying that.

1094
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,720
No matter how strong they are, they're going

1095
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:51,920
to be.

1096
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,860
So, I mean, at that time, from the

1097
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:58,960
70s.

1098
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,640
Well, how did you say it?

1099
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,760
They're telling a story.

1100
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,700
Yeah.

1101
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,440
And even when they did come down, they

1102
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,240
told you a story.

1103
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,180
That's not how they came down at all.

1104
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,960
Right.

1105
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,480
If they were on fire on September 11,

1106
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,620
2001, still burning, they would still be burning

1107
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,700
and be just fine.

1108
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,960
You know, they would still be standing if

1109
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,320
the fires were burning that long.

1110
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,780
This is how things really are.

1111
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,260
But in a sense, what are you being

1112
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,620
shown right now that you don't see?

1113
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,660
Well, here's a personal, I mean, direct, firsthand

1114
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,120
experience.

1115
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,620
What I was doing, July, August of 2001,

1116
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,640
I was telling people, watch this Osama bin

1117
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,260
Laden guy.

1118
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,200
Kind of like later on, I heard a

1119
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,260
Bill Cooper say that.

1120
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,680
Bill Cooper, a few months before, and I

1121
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,720
was just, they're going to blame it on

1122
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,680
Osama bin Laden.

1123
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,880
And I didn't know about Bill Cooper.

1124
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,560
I think it was Seth who turned me

1125
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,820
on to Bill Cooper by talking about him.

1126
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,560
I was telling people, I remember I was

1127
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
with a mining engineer in 2001.

1128
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,720
I was doing some mural work and saying,

1129
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,200
this Osama bin Laden guy is in the

1130
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,820
news a lot lately.

1131
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,320
They're going to do something with this guy.

1132
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,840
Just watch it.

1133
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,520
Ah, no, no, that will never happen.

1134
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,180
No, no, our security forces got everything under

1135
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,480
control.

1136
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,160
I said, I don't know.

1137
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,800
And I saw him after 9-11.

1138
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,060
I said, I told you that they were

1139
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,300
going to do something with Osama bin Laden.

1140
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,400
He was just quiet.

1141
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,660
And someone else I knew, it was the

1142
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,960
beginning of what they call September.

1143
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
He says, this is an interesting month to

1144
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,520
watch.

1145
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,300
Remember 9-11?

1146
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,640
This is the 9-11 month.

1147
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,180
I was like, really?

1148
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,260
And before that, someone approached me.

1149
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:42,780
He was in insurance.

1150
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,640
He was like, how's your credit score?

1151
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,160
I'm like, well.

1152
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,780
He says, well, you better have a good

1153
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,200
credit score because the world is going to

1154
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,520
go into a security business.

1155
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,260
And it's going to be people with good

1156
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,680
credit scores are going to get good positions

1157
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,800
in the security business.

1158
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,600
So if you want to get it.

1159
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,300
I'm like, what do you mean security business?

1160
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,780
He says, well, your security business is going

1161
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,320
to boom.

1162
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,800
Watch.

1163
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,360
And it's good to get your stuff in

1164
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,600
order now before it comes out.

1165
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,080
I was like, what did this guy know?

1166
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,600
So there you go.

1167
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,140
Very subtle.

1168
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,560
But you just go through with it.

1169
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,600
Right now, all the subtleties are how quiet

1170
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,120
it is.

1171
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,380
You might say that a lot of the

1172
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,080
things were put in place prior past few

1173
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,220
years in the situation, whether it's American politics

1174
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
or international geopolitics.

1175
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,160
Many of the things that you still see

1176
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,020
transpiring were put in place weeks, months, years

1177
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,440
before.

1178
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,780
But the thing is that you're not getting

1179
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,380
new little jabs of attention seeking stories like

1180
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,480
they call them stories.

1181
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,860
So that means that they're trying to figure

1182
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,000
out how they're going to do it.

1183
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,180
And I think these things are going to

1184
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,600
stick.

1185
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,780
Because, see, for example, I keep bringing this

1186
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,220
up, the next biological, what do you call

1187
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,620
them when they have flu epidemics and things

1188
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,000
like that?

1189
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,220
The epidemics.

1190
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,280
It's not going to be like the past

1191
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,700
ones.

1192
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,180
If you've ever seen videos of the WHO,

1193
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,560
the World Health Organization, they laugh about it.

1194
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,160
Yeah, we told people it was an epidemic

1195
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,640
and they all cried for vaccines.

1196
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,300
We told them they all wanted it and

1197
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,860
they were laughing.

1198
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,280
Well, when you're going to start getting the

1199
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,780
next epidemic, it's going to stick.

1200
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,940
In other words, it's not going to go

1201
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,260
away.

1202
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,880
In other words, whether it is an epidemic

1203
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,460
or not, it's going to be made more

1204
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,220
so you have to comply to some bizarre

1205
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,020
demand.

1206
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,840
I don't call them laws.

1207
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,820
They're demands.

1208
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,700
And that's why I was telling someone who

1209
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,860
was going to court recently, I said, well,

1210
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,620
I said I broke this law.

1211
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,780
No, that's a demand because that law is

1212
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,760
not being used right because by definition, it

1213
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,580
doesn't apply to you.

1214
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,240
So if you go in there, don't say

1215
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,420
the word law.

1216
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,280
Say demand.

1217
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,360
You get it?

1218
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,220
Anyway, when they tell you you can't smoke

1219
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,460
pot on the public bus, no, that's not

1220
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:52,740
a law.

1221
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,420
That's a demand.

1222
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,080
They demand that you don't smoke pot on

1223
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,580
the local bus.

1224
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,740
How do they demand it?

1225
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,920
Well, there's a guy going to come in

1226
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,080
a uniform, a Leo, and he's going to

1227
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,820
hit you over the head.

1228
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,020
That's how they enforce it.

1229
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,840
They're not laws.

1230
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,420
They're demands.

1231
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,420
Even though Charlie brought up this public policy,

1232
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
not public policy, they're demands.

1233
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,880
I don't get so stern about it because

1234
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,640
once a topic is brought up and I'm

1235
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,040
enthusiastic about it, an hour will shoot by.

1236
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
So what you'll see is things that are,

1237
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,440
they'll be reintroduced into the mindset and they're

1238
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,180
going to stick a little bit more, stick

1239
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,280
around, I should say.

1240
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,540
But it is rather quiet, but I don't

1241
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,660
see it as being quiet.

1242
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,780
One of the things that I see is

1243
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,380
the further reaching of what they call Iranian

1244
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,420
politics or Persia.

1245
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
They're trying to reach out further, and they

1246
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,980
are, because they're a superpower.

1247
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,160
They've always been, I should say, well, since

1248
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,640
the French and the English got out of

1249
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:51,880
there.

1250
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,760
Well, I say definitely from the late 70s,

1251
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,820
80s until now, they are a superpower in

1252
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,860
the Middle East just as Israel is.

1253
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,400
And I wouldn't say they're competing because wherever

1254
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,360
you see the Israeli Mossad, you see the

1255
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,160
Persian mob.

1256
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,780
If that makes any sense.

1257
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm not going to get into that detail

1258
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,780
because if I start getting into details of

1259
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,000
that, it's going to sound like I know

1260
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,640
more than I should be talking about.

1261
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,700
But let's just put it this way.

1262
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,120
There are central places where there are Israeli

1263
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,740
Mossad.

1264
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,920
And believe it or not, Tokyo is one

1265
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,720
of the largest populations and places in Asia

1266
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,300
where you have Mossad.

1267
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,300
And who works with them side by side

1268
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,380
is the Persian mob.

1269
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,020
And the Persian mob are involved in things

1270
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,440
that are pretty unusual in itself, mostly financial,

1271
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,020
by the way.

1272
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,500
Not as nefarious as most people would say,

1273
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,560
like, you know, the drugs, human trafficking and

1274
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,240
assassinations and these types of things.

1275
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,920
Not as much as that as actually just

1276
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,240
purely financial stuff.

1277
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,060
And they do manage to get in a

1278
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,360
lot of different areas that you're not a

1279
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,020
common to see in them.

1280
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,600
The Persian mob, yeah.

1281
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,300
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,340
They have several factions.

1283
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,920
So either way, watch Iran as a superpower,

1284
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,400
not going away as a superpower.

1285
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,000
As a matter of fact, in the future,

1286
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,760
what you call Iran, well, they're going to

1287
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,780
rework politically because they're, again, puppets like the

1288
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,220
rest of most governments.

1289
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,200
But they're going to be reworked and reunified

1290
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,160
in a way where they will actually be

1291
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,580
allies with Israel in a sense like financial

1292
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,960
and supportive allies versus the public opposition and

1293
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,420
adversarialness that you see now.

1294
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,380
So, yeah.

1295
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,620
I noticed Russia is fading away finally.

1296
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,240
Not as much.

1297
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,200
In terms of American politics.

1298
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:54,900
Right.

1299
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,940
They are Russia, China, Malaysia, Indonesia.

1300
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,940
You know, like what about Malaysia, Indonesia?

1301
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,740
Those places have huge populations, by the way,

1302
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,080
workforces.

1303
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,760
And if you go anywhere, like from Malta

1304
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,580
all the way to Saudi Arabia, all the

1305
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,300
way, you know, the island of Malta, all

1306
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,780
the way across that whole rim down even

1307
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,520
to India.

1308
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,860
Most of the workers come from Malaysia, Indonesia.

1309
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,700
The people do the labor.

1310
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,980
So, because they work.

1311
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,700
You think Mexicans work for cheap?

1312
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,440
They really work for cheap, you know.

1313
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,340
And I would say that that whole region

1314
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,400
is going to start harmonizing and working together.

1315
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,180
You know, they're going to be the satellite

1316
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
forces around the Middle East.

1317
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,520
I mean, it is right now.

1318
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,020
If you go to places like Kuwait, everyone

1319
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,340
in the service industry is, they're not Kuwaiti.

1320
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,140
They are from that Pacific Rim, usually in

1321
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,500
India.

1322
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,860
So, yeah.

1323
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,260
But again, this is a condition, like, you

1324
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,740
know, bring back what Dimitri, I think he

1325
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,260
put it together really well in those short

1326
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,640
videos.

1327
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,140
The concept of a sovereign state is what

1328
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,720
you see running on the world right now.

1329
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,880
That is the new world order.

1330
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,200
And this was assembled during the Victorian times.

1331
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,980
You know, and America, of course, is used

1332
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,060
as an example of the sovereign state.

1333
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:23,980
Right.

1334
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,760
You know, because it has a little bit

1335
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,200
of everything.

1336
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeah, yeah.

1337
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,400
And the real world leaders, the ones you

1338
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,060
hear about them spiritually, are the sons of

1339
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,220
gods and the people behind, you know, behind

1340
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,300
the sovereign state.

1341
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,480
We don't know who they are.

1342
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,060
They have a very good apparatus or apparati,

1343
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,460
is that the plural, to maintaining secrecy.

1344
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,520
It doesn't mean that they have disclosed who

1345
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,860
they are, but not as the owners of

1346
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,320
the states known as the world countries.

1347
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,780
You know, the hundred and whatever, 80 countries

1348
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,820
on the UN, those are all sovereign states.

1349
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,940
So anybody on the UN, those are all

1350
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,180
the same thing.

1351
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,440
So the rhetoric that you hear there is

1352
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,640
just that, you know.

1353
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,060
So you're pretty much finished.

1354
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,360
But you don't know that you are, so

1355
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,380
that's the best part about it, you know,

1356
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,620
in terms of being under global and viewed

1357
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,240
as property.

1358
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,960
In other words, you are in the worst

1359
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,380
possible political, lawful, legal state you can be.

1360
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,880
Everyone on the planet is right now.

1361
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,020
But it's not as bad as it's going

1362
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,560
to be in the future.

1363
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,740
But you are in the worst possible.

1364
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,500
In other words, if it got overtly, if

1365
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,180
people knew really what was going on, there

1366
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,120
would be less order than there is now.

1367
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,680
That's why it's the worst possible.

1368
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,060
And it would be for the wrong reasons.

1369
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,500
If you ask them why they're rioting, they

1370
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:53,960
don't know.

1371
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,280
It's like the cartoon boondocks.

1372
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,820
You just throw a chair, a folding chair,

1373
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,180
and a riot starts, and no one knows

1374
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,900
why they're rioting.

1375
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,980
Just someone threw a chair.

1376
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,560
Gustav would get in there, and somebody would

1377
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,480
take hold, and everybody would be following.

1378
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,880
It's rather organized and predictive.

1379
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,360
All right, if there isn't anything else, let's

1380
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,240
just call it.

1381
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,220
I don't see anything in there either.

1382
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,400
No calls or nothing.

1383
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,740
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

1384
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,140
All right, we'll do it again next week.

1385
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,040
Okay, well, you take care, Greg, and thank

1386
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,700
you very much.

1387
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,020
You're welcome.

1388
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,600
I'll see you again.

1389
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,060
Yes, you have a good night now.

1390
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,240
Bye.

1391
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,040
Bye.
