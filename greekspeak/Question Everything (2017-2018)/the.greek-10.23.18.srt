1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,910
And good evening there folks and we're live

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,010
with the Greek and how you doing tonight

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,210
Greek Hey, well, I'm doing maybe we'll be

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,710
doing Good good another week.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,570
Yeah another sonic.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,670
Yeah, it's uh, we have somebody that wants

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,230
to call has been trying and I told

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,730
him hold off and It's another week not

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,190
much to report on other than the usual

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,650
mess on this planet The orderly mess there's

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,470
a lot to do Always if you know

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,490
what you're doing Even if you don't know

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,770
what you're doing, it seems like the people

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,270
that don't know what they're doing are doing

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,470
the most so Yeah, we were talking a

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,310
little bit about the weather and yeah, there's

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,910
still somebody putting a strong influence on the

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,050
equator a diagonal and the the storms keep

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,430
Rebounding Downstream and that's something that whoever is

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,010
doing that has to do something about it

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,490
and have them a little more focused is

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,590
all I'm going to say so let's see,

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,670
let's just start off with someone who wants

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,290
to come in and I'll just bring them

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,450
in right now Let's see how that works,

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,670
let's see I should be able to do

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,050
this.

28
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,910
Let's see.

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:27,690
There we go And we're We're just standing

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,190
by so I'm Bruce you're doing well sure

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,150
and here we go.

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,970
He's on greetings Greetings, how's it going?

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,690
Okay, it's going it's going even more with

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,070
you here.

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,630
So what's on your mind greetings?

36
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,490
Oh, we got a lot going a lot

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,110
going on.

38
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,690
Let's see.

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,490
I guess we'll start by last time.

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,330
I just reported back Talking about the guy

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,470
at the water store and he was like

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,230
he was using a filtration process process.

43
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,430
He's using silica and magnesium But he's not

44
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,470
filtering it, right?

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,670
He's doing everything wrong And then the only

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,910
reason why I brought it up was kind

47
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,330
of the guy was kind of taking me

48
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,690
off because you know he's making all this

49
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,430
money off of credits Selling water and people

50
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,770
look at him like he's some type of

51
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:11,990
guru.

52
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,130
That's perfect.

53
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,610
That's what people are inherently stupid and They

54
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,010
resonate with stupidity.

55
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,930
So if you don't give them something that's

56
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,510
stupid, they don't resonate with it You know,

57
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,650
you've heard them say well, it doesn't resonate

58
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,470
with me, right?

59
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,410
You know, it's dissonant but but nonetheless we

60
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,050
can get into a couple of questions about

61
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,490
it One thing is like when he's using

62
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,970
magnesium and silica, there's various types of that

63
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,590
Like I'm sure it's not magnesium as such

64
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,470
elemental.

65
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,910
I'm sure it's an oxide It probably looks

66
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,490
like a white pellet or a white powder,

67
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,810
right?

68
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,850
Yeah, yeah, all right, so it's an oxide

69
00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:02,790
it's inert that has a catalytic property Actually,

70
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,410
I migrated too far without the base unit

71
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,770
But then the silica, you know, it goes

72
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,250
all the way from various Forms of silica

73
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,650
all the way to a silica gel, which

74
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,610
is those desiccant packs you see, you know

75
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,610
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,770
So again, you know, I would give the

77
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,530
guy a headache or anyone should give him

78
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,610
a headache if he's doing something like that

79
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,850
But anything you do to water is it's

80
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,210
like a form of art, right?

81
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,290
It's your way of doing it So does

82
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,390
he have a right to do it by

83
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,250
all means, right?

84
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,850
Is are you ending up with a high

85
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,650
quality water?

86
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,130
I could tell you not really is it

87
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,130
better than Or different than most waters.

88
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,010
It'll be dead If you Mark you're popping

89
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,990
in and out there Greek.

90
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,150
Oh I I shouldn't be how about now?

91
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,110
Actually, I'm gonna mute for a moment and

92
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,410
just make an adjustment.

93
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,390
I'll be right back Okay Hey, it's going

94
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,330
good, how's yourself?

95
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,650
You're doing well Yeah, beautiful day out here

96
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,030
Thank you for all your your hard work

97
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,090
out here putting the servers keeping the momentum

98
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,670
going.

99
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,010
Oh, it's my lover My pleasure.

100
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,710
How's the Tai Chi?

101
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,630
Going well every morning every night Sounds good.

102
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,410
It sounds good.

103
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,950
What else what else is new out there?

104
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,230
Oh, let's see.

105
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,330
I've Just went to my grandson's concert last

106
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,530
night he plays the viola and Informs me

107
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,590
that he has mastered the device and wants

108
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,090
to move on to something bigger So I'm

109
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,030
gonna invite him over to grandpa's house this

110
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,910
weekend and we're gonna sit back and jam

111
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,130
and take that myth away from him You're

112
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,950
gonna prove to him that he's not a

113
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,570
master I heard I don't know if this

114
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,270
is true or not But the law of

115
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,090
mastery you have to do something for 10

116
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,310
,000 hours to be considered a master not

117
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,350
anymore No, I think the 10,000 hours

118
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,670
thing was just to keep people discouraged about

119
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,670
it Yeah, I mean there's people that haven't

120
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,470
been alive for 10,000 hours that have

121
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,970
mastered things, you know, I mean I would

122
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,430
suggest You've heard of the term like people

123
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,150
that are normal or well adjusted if society's

124
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,550
really fucked up You have to be pretty

125
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,570
fucked up to be normal or well adjusted,

126
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:24,890
right?

127
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,530
So Yeah, but anyhow we started off like

128
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,530
gangbusters out of the door about the water

129
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,130
And I just wanted to suggest that there

130
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,250
are still people discovering Greek speak and Applying

131
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,410
it.

132
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,210
I just got an email today about someone

133
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,650
applying What I discussed about the water the

134
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,290
basic principles and they've noticed a tremendous Quality

135
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,170
and change and all that and I just

136
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,470
want to put out a rhetorical statement slash

137
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,850
question If there's just a small handful of

138
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,970
basic principles regarding anything whether it's water food

139
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,790
Economics spirituality, you know me religions and the

140
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,190
mind and all that there.

141
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,710
I think I've covered them In terms of

142
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,370
basic form and I just well I've said

143
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,530
this before anyone has license to take this

144
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,570
stuff and and develop it write a book

145
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,130
Do a website or and and no one

146
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,810
has by the way, so that's why I

147
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,230
constantly that I know about Who's that audio

148
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,570
boy?

149
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,790
He was in the process.

150
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,410
I think he's still he's trying.

151
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,290
Yeah, he's trying You know, but you know,

152
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:39,090
but still to develop Just the the locusts,

153
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,070
you know The center point of the principle

154
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,310
of all the things that have been covered

155
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,090
through Greek speak not because it's my stuff.

156
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,310
It's just stuff and you know Right, but

157
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,250
the thing is it goes back to the

158
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,630
reference I'm just visiting this planet taking notes

159
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,590
and so far the report is very bad

160
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,910
very poor right so so in essence If

161
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,990
anyone wants to pick up and develop it,

162
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,670
you know But again, you know what I

163
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,230
mean by I'm implying it's you know on

164
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,370
a media form But on the non-media

165
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,970
form, I think there's a lot of people

166
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,010
that have it is they're using it quote

167
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,490
-unquote in their personal lives You know Yes,

168
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,890
well, I can get more done.

169
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,850
I'm not really big on the media.

170
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,190
I mean But I can get more Voice

171
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,630
heard more with people and stuff So this

172
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,730
is one of the reasons why I'm calling

173
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,250
in I feel like you know the information

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,890
the groin the reason the Greek speeches, you

175
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,750
know, you cover every subject and it's awesome

176
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,370
It's great.

177
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,190
There's no place else like this online No,

178
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,890
or offline, you know Well offline would be

179
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,770
like a very old a really good university

180
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,810
library Not to be confused with what they

181
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,930
teach in the university or their textbooks You

182
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,070
know, this is like all archived, you know

183
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,350
Annals of things that can be done by

184
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,450
humans that are not But you said you

185
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,850
could what you could do it more directly

186
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,750
with people in in person, right?

187
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,270
Yeah, so, you know Listening to you and

188
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,090
I just take up an art school when

189
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,950
I took up an art school or a

190
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,770
Martial art or discipline and I had an

191
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,170
injury.

192
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,810
So I didn't want to do full-life

193
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,890
jiu-jitsu or Any combat really so I

194
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,410
was like, oh, it's just do yoga Flexible

195
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,270
did it was doing it started teaching it

196
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,090
Trying saying Greek speak and everyone's just loving

197
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,549
it, right?

198
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,049
So now there's this holy yoga thing coming

199
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,250
out and then they asked me To talk

200
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,270
about the holy the holy yoga and if

201
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,970
I can be the class and I was

202
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,150
like, oh my gosh Well, this is all

203
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,770
mmm.

204
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,870
I mean, it's gonna be all Christians in

205
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,630
there and everything So-called Christians.

206
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,430
Yeah, but there's a way that I can

207
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,070
I think I can Kind of maybe do

208
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,410
it, but I'm gonna have to say like,

209
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,150
you know, tell them like hey I'm not

210
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,790
trying to be a guru or a priest

211
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,230
or anything like that I mean I just

212
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,570
want to tell you guys if you guys

213
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,250
are gonna go look at the scripture and

214
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,370
everything Like what to be done and I

215
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,350
might just I don't know, but I don't

216
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,830
know what I'm really gonna say I'm kind

217
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,270
of just avoid it, you know Here's the

218
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,110
here's a simple thing If you know you're

219
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,170
gonna be thrown in or saturated with a

220
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,410
certain group thing because you know There's really

221
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,090
no such thing as a Christian Christianity is

222
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,410
what someone thinks or does not what they

223
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,690
are and So it's based on how they

224
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,930
think and they do so what your class

225
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,670
is what you're imparting is how people can

226
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,190
think or do also right yoga is First

227
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,010
a state of mind and then the actual

228
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,850
movement, right?

229
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,250
And if you know any of the yoga

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,150
master teachings, you know, they have this very

231
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,090
little on them But basically the cardinal principle

232
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,090
of the yoga mastership teaching was do it

233
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,690
in it.

234
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,370
So it's comfortable, right?

235
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,610
You don't want to strain yourself.

236
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,090
I always hear about people recently someone in

237
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,230
the yoga class and They they started turning

238
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,090
red and they couldn't breathe in the posture,

239
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,410
right?

240
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,450
That's against that's against The core principle which

241
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,530
is to do it comfortably, right?

242
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,810
I have what that's what I've learned about

243
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,850
it I don't know what it's morphed into

244
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,930
or you're actually, you know Imparting but this

245
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,790
is what my I've gotten from the master,

246
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,930
you know writings about yoga.

247
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,550
So No, yeah, you always want to do

248
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,990
it comfortably.

249
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,050
This is this is hot yoga and Yeah,

250
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,990
I don't know there's a lot of weird

251
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,490
stuff go well the hot yoga yeah Berkram

252
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,870
or something is it like that?

253
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,490
Yeah Yeah, yeah He's like that whole me

254
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,290
too movement thing.

255
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,690
We got caught in but not so they

256
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,430
all like his name, but this is a

257
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,050
Kind of a hybrid of Bikram and of

258
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,410
the nausea flow, but I did it to

259
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,330
my own music And it's like that's fast

260
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,930
-paced and then that's also a body school.

261
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,730
So like you do have the weights in

262
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,390
and then Body conditioning or body school.

263
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,830
Yeah, cuz it I Don't know stretching is

264
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,870
so overlooked in modern athletics and no one

265
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,690
stretches anymore So, you know you get all

266
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,570
these big half of all players come in

267
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,910
and they can even get their biceps to

268
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,230
their to their ears And it's just yeah,

269
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,950
it's just kind of You know just stretching

270
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,110
that's what I like to think of it

271
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,250
just, you know breath to movement and stretching

272
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,250
Mm-hmm Yeah, so I don't know I'm

273
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,830
trying to board that class or I don't

274
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,850
know what's gonna go on with that but

275
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,610
I Don't know.

276
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,050
Yeah Talk to me objectively Yeah, if you're

277
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,770
interested in any ladies in the class Make

278
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,850
sure they do goddess pose and happy baby

279
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,750
to keep them limber in the midsection but

280
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,790
anyway No, it's it's an interesting thing but

281
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,870
back again to the Christians It's their mindset

282
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,910
there in here's one thing.

283
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,250
I define anybody that is religious even if

284
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,070
you go to the Orthodox side of Where

285
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,390
you know, they're even more rigid It's the

286
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,410
same whether they're liberal or Orthodox.

287
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,630
They're ignorant Right because there's no way humanly

288
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,270
possible And I mean humanly meaning you can

289
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,010
see you can hear you can smell you

290
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,670
can read you can study You can you

291
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,490
know take in information and do comparative analysis

292
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,030
on things, right?

293
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,030
Like two people telling you two different stories

294
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,750
only one can be true or both are

295
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,350
wrong, right?

296
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,590
Yeah, there's no one in any religion on

297
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,970
the planet anywhere and any level that can

298
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,490
say that they belong to any organized religion

299
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,810
and not be ignorant You get it because

300
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,750
if you pick any religion Anything, you know,

301
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,710
there's thousands of them and I'll show you

302
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,170
anyone even that it's what they believe is

303
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,830
false just by going to what the the

304
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,310
writ Says about what they should be doing.

305
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,410
It doesn't matter whether it's east-west north

306
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,150
-south religion.

307
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,650
It doesn't matter So So right away when

308
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,550
you have the brand of religion come in

309
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,530
regardless of its Christian Jew Muslim, whatever Mormon

310
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,470
anything, by the way, you know, you've heard

311
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,090
me say the Muslims are the Mormons of

312
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,130
the Middle East, right?

313
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,010
Yeah, Mormon isn't just stupid.

314
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,630
Yeah, so Anything anyone you know, here's the

315
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,290
thing, you know how they say science is

316
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,130
a religion, right?

317
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,030
Same thing you can go and look at

318
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,610
if you're an electrical engineer or a physicist

319
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,390
You go look at like the granddaddies or

320
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,230
the gods of that field of people who

321
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,090
started it and everything that they're telling People

322
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,210
that's in their textbooks now or in university

323
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,030
class is contrary to how the field was

324
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,910
originated, right?

325
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,510
Like there's you know, like electricity is no

326
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,250
electron or anything like that, right?

327
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,230
So so this is a condition.

328
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,930
So when you again when you're dealing with

329
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,050
the Christians, it's a human condition thing It

330
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,930
it would to when you said you you

331
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,210
had the Christians coming and you don't know

332
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,110
what to do to me It's the same

333
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,710
thing saying hey, I'm teaching yoga And I

334
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,350
have a bunch of physicists coming and I

335
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,110
don't know what to do because they're idiots

336
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,430
No, the you know to say you're a

337
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,550
physicist is Embarrassing if you study what physics

338
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,270
is about, you know, yeah, right or let's

339
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,650
say, you know A whole bunch of heart

340
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,630
surgeons embarrassing to you know, so it's the

341
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,990
same thing any group think You see it

342
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,990
doesn't have to be bad.

343
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,610
It just happens to be bad It's a

344
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,230
group think is not bad because let's say

345
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,870
you had a society that was compassionate Sympathetic

346
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,850
and lawful and as part of their group

347
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,430
think right?

348
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,890
Is that is that a bad thing?

349
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,650
No, that's actually quite wonderful.

350
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,630
And that's how it's going to be in

351
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,110
the future It's just that this type of

352
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,190
group think that humans are experiencing is not

353
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,970
good for sure.

354
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,690
So anyway, good You know, yeah, I was

355
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,630
just gonna I was gonna tell them instead

356
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,770
You know, maybe that one time not to

357
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,930
have I've been listening to a lot of

358
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,930
a lot of Greek speak Like a lot

359
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,590
a lot and you know Like there's only

360
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,590
two people on this planet right now that

361
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,690
can even get down some solid information about

362
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,330
Scripture And that's you and Sam So, I

363
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,530
don't know.

364
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,130
Maybe I can motivate these people to go

365
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,630
look or something I don't know.

366
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,110
I want to get something going on because

367
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,830
I know that all I think what has

368
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,470
to be done is a whole new thing

369
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,570
has to be done because this is like

370
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,530
In other words, you know a real conspiracy

371
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,710
has to be formed Meaning a conspiracy where

372
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,390
you know people come together that word is

373
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,430
you've been used improperly in other words Okay,

374
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:31,130
you know when You certain products they you

375
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,930
buy like let's say like I know the

376
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,130
guy who started the 24-hour computer Helpline

377
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,590
like if you remember back in the early

378
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,610
90s if you bought a computer and you

379
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,170
needed help you had to wait for business

380
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,150
Hours and this guy said nearly 90s.

381
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,410
Why don't we why don't we do a

382
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,810
24-hour computer helpline?

383
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,770
So technical service, so if you buy an

384
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,670
Apple, you know, whatever anybody could call any

385
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,910
time of day What a great idea and

386
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,710
that really boosted the product, right?

387
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,810
yeah, so in other words if you're going

388
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,570
to put out solid information you have to

389
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,010
form a group or Some kind of thing

390
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,890
where people can go anytime anywhere, you know,

391
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,350
especially online and and and get You know

392
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,790
what they need right and that I don't

393
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,530
think that exists because let's say Sam and

394
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,150
I are discussing Scripture you have to go

395
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,970
through three hours.

396
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,710
There's no out, you know of audio and

397
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,570
maybe you'll get it It needs to you

398
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,950
know, you need to create an outline it

399
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,530
has to be in written form you have

400
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,430
to write about it, you know still and

401
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,410
You can do an introduction or synopsis.

402
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,430
These things need to be formed in a

403
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,690
conspiratorial form I think your idea before with

404
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,090
the YouTube where you had the hyperlinks embedded

405
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,670
in video So that they can write and

406
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,190
move it on which I'm capable of doing

407
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,450
and we'll put my services available any time

408
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,030
for that Right and I've been looking at

409
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,470
several by the way when you say about

410
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,250
scripture there's a couple of sources, you know

411
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,070
Of course, there's the anyone who's a realist,

412
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,510
you know, I mean by realist, you know,

413
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,369
you don't make stuff up It is good.

414
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,829
But the thing is they spin off like

415
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,869
I mentioned a few like there's Ernest L

416
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,650
Martin and the David C loss and the

417
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,030
Michael Heizer's and all that but they always

418
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,589
spin off into into la la fiction lands

419
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,970
Are you getting it's what I call Sifting

420
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,970
through poop to get edible corn.

421
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,510
No one is serving fresh corn on the

422
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,450
cob with warm butter, you know You know,

423
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,050
it's it's right when they get to that

424
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,910
point that they go to la la land

425
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,690
It's all because of wanting to raise revenue

426
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,990
for themselves That's right.

427
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,010
All right, and also they trust in in

428
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,510
the scripture or the creator or the creator

429
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,810
All right, right.

430
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,290
He says I'll take care of you.

431
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,850
So Yeah, so they give a lot of

432
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,350
lip service and then they go back Because

433
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,390
I've spoken to the people I've even had

434
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,810
correspondence with well, I've had corresponds a little

435
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,810
people I've mentioned except for Ernest L Martin

436
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,050
because he died before I got into this

437
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,250
but they basically won't touch the the the

438
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,090
reality the the real reality that It's a

439
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,090
non-religious issue and the reason why they

440
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,070
don't do that is because They can't see

441
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,110
how they're gonna grab get enough people to

442
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,750
support themselves financially Twitter boils down to so

443
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,110
yeah, well, yeah, and what's even sadder is

444
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,650
Putting out the real information will will will

445
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,670
you know Well, let's say okay.

446
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,250
Let's say you were well-endowed Let's say

447
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,970
you had a lot of financial backing and

448
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,030
all of a sudden you put out real

449
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,590
information.

450
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,450
You'll be bankrupted Right So thinking that you

451
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,070
will put out real information and grow it

452
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,730
financially is stupid not on this planet.

453
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,810
It won't happen ever There's a lot of

454
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,170
people out there saying they have the truth

455
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,390
and you listen to know like they just

456
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,690
left out like 99% of what's critical

457
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,490
to Foundationally to what they're saying so forget

458
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,310
it Yeah, so the thing is how patient

459
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,070
are you right?

460
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,950
Yeah, trying to get Not right not too

461
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,350
patient right now, but I'm working on learn

462
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,630
patience Learn patience.

463
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,170
That's why I mean, that's why I say

464
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,950
why bother Yeah, why bother teaches you patience,

465
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,230
right?

466
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,670
Because you're gonna bother you're going to do

467
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,430
like you're going to do something You're gonna

468
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,450
learn tolerance patience Many of the other Actions

469
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,190
that would come along with that Right, and

470
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,330
you're not here's the other point.

471
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,170
You're not being patient for them You're being

472
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,590
patient for yourself until you you have to

473
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,810
be patient until you run out of heartbeats

474
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,770
You go into sleep mode literally And then

475
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,070
you wake up Brought back.

476
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,090
That's the patience.

477
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,870
I'm talking about because here's the thing and

478
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,470
I've said this before I should just do

479
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,130
a talk on it alone, but If you

480
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,830
are Full of altruism and hope in this

481
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,550
the way in this setting that you're in

482
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,950
right now born into this world There's gonna

483
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,670
come a time in the near future where

484
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,350
everything's gonna look real rosy and you're gonna

485
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,630
fall for it right Right, that's the big

486
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,110
deception.

487
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,290
Are you gonna fall for this perfection and

488
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,670
everyone listening don't fall for that either You

489
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,490
still have to be more cautious, right?

490
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,350
So so that's why I mean there's nothing

491
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,670
in this incarnation at all you have to

492
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,970
wait for the gods to because To rule

493
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,210
in other words, no matter how good it

494
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,690
gets here You're still going to be ruled

495
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,210
covertly by the gods and overtly by evil

496
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,530
men.

497
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,110
Have you ever heard that?

498
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,530
saying that absolute power corrupts Absolutely.

499
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,810
Absolutely, right?

500
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,270
They never finished that and the whole thing

501
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,730
is absolute power corrupts Absolutely, and all great

502
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,430
men are evil men or I mean meaning

503
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,570
as powerful men, right?

504
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,710
right, so What I mean by why bother

505
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,490
and be patient means until you're done not

506
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,850
till the situation changes so in the meantime

507
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,270
You're doing yoga and you have a bunch

508
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,510
of people coming and Yeah, okay, you know

509
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,790
what Life's not bad go to the beach

510
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,990
Can't well, it's not good either.

511
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,870
I mean, it's it just is it is

512
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,610
what it is But here's the thing what

513
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,130
you could do is just focus on one

514
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,110
thing You know how people they give advice

515
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,950
that when they're going to speak publicly and

516
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,630
they're nervous or perform they just focus on

517
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,950
if you speak to like an Actor and

518
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,270
ask them.

519
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,290
Well, how were you when you first started

520
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,970
performing like I was really nervous So I

521
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,190
just found that when I got up on

522
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,130
stage, I focused on one person's blouse or

523
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,050
an empty chair through the whole show That's

524
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,830
all I focused on so I wouldn't be

525
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,630
nervous, right?

526
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,110
Yeah, so Yeah, I don't think I think

527
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,470
Greek speak is an antidote to stupidity.

528
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,690
So if Christian equals stupid No matter how

529
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,230
smart they sound It's it's not good.

530
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,790
It's like Star Trek where the The matter

531
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,750
was a Scotty Oh captain, it's the matter

532
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,510
and time matter pod, you know when they

533
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,810
matter and antimatter come together they explode Right,

534
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,110
yeah, it's not gonna work.

535
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,070
Yeah.

536
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,730
No, there are some exceptions.

537
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,250
I'm just giving you the rules, right?

538
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,650
Yeah And don't be yeah and don't be

539
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,190
hopeful or altruistic because with whether they're Christian

540
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,530
Jewish Muslim or whatever Mm-hmm stupid people

541
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,810
are dangerous not because stupid people are dangerous

542
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,710
is because they're inherently evil Think about that

543
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,790
for a moment They're not good people Yeah,

544
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,690
you don't know about Stalin right having a

545
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,830
surrounding himself with stupid Yeah, yeah, you can't

546
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,290
fix them.

547
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,470
It's it's part of the cosmic censorship.

548
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:12,630
It's That it goes and deeply akin to

549
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,030
the earth as well But It's just the

550
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,650
state of being but in essence These are

551
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,030
the rules that I'm discussing and and a

552
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,270
lot of general generalities are based on a

553
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,370
rule based mindset But there's always an exception,

554
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,010
right?

555
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,630
so Yeah, if you fill a group with

556
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,830
if you fill a group of a room

557
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,030
with a group of people You're not going

558
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,710
to be thinking about the exceptions you think

559
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,630
about the group, right?

560
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,110
So yeah, go ahead Yeah, you have to

561
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,190
look at the I mean a crowd assessment

562
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,470
to who you're speaking to But I wanted

563
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,850
to talk about World War two You know

564
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,290
there because he was to this guy was

565
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,230
telling me about his past life and everything

566
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,710
and no such thing I know.

567
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,890
Yeah, that's what I was telling you So

568
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,330
I was looking at him like I didn't

569
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,250
tell him that that I was listening to

570
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,510
story not in my head You know trying

571
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,830
to be polite and then so I brought

572
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,290
World War two and he's like Do you

573
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,890
really want to know the truth about World

574
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,270
War two?

575
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,370
Do you really want to know?

576
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,550
There was this guy gonna tell me right

577
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,890
now and then he comes to take me

578
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,910
to like the sidebar and he's like it

579
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,790
was A false flag.

580
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,570
They put false flags over it all around

581
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:14,890
it.

582
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,190
Yeah, sure a lie and I was like,

583
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,270
okay So that's what it pretty much what

584
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,870
it was Yeah, of course.

585
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,010
Yeah, all wars are that way the last

586
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,110
real wars were I think of maybe 500

587
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,270
BC there hasn't been any real In other

588
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,050
words, what is the purpose of war?

589
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,770
I mean that there's a spirit behind it

590
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,070
But I would say that like if you're

591
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,030
familiar with the sovereign state principle and The

592
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,190
Westphalia principle of sovereign nations and all that

593
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,110
ever since all that, you know I would

594
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,430
say since the middle medieval ages the earth

595
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,010
is in pretty much lockdown by a Say

596
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,070
a few thousand people run the whole planet,

597
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,490
right?

598
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,490
They're King.

599
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,470
They're King makers.

600
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,790
They're president makers They set up countries they

601
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,910
break up countries and those are the people

602
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,450
or the groups that control all that World

603
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,990
War one and World War two were just

604
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,230
cullings Yeah, you know culling is you know,

605
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,890
you've ever live in a You know a

606
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,390
rural area and there's too many, you know,

607
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,230
people can't use the roads because there's deer

608
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,250
too many deer Well, they just you put

609
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,630
a thing in the paper You know the

610
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,150
next two weeks everybody's got to go out

611
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,710
and shoot deer because we got too many

612
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,450
deer Right Ritual type deal, you know, just

613
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,770
because there's too many of them.

614
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,750
Yeah, right and not too many because of

615
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,090
the earth No The earth can handle right

616
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,910
now as everything is the earth can handle

617
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,430
ten times more people gonna roughly 70 billion

618
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,990
people as things are Not mentally, but you

619
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,710
know physically just with the infrastructure and all

620
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,990
that It could handle ten times.

621
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,170
So no it too many people in terms

622
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,950
of mindset Like let me give you another

623
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,850
thing about World War two and maybe before

624
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,890
I do that, let me give you When

625
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,090
people say that they have a past life

626
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,650
and it could be as real to them

627
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,850
as anything else is real to anyone else

628
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,270
that is a spirit that comes around and

629
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,010
Convince because they could put thoughts in your

630
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,090
mind That that you were there that you

631
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,170
were right and they could be very accurate

632
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,850
because those spirits are were there So if

633
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,730
you run into someone let's say non hypothetically

634
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,870
because this is something that happened and They

635
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,310
can evidence to others that they did have

636
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,570
a past life because of XYZ or ABC

637
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,970
all the way to Z There's a spirit

638
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,450
that is giving them that information But it's

639
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,410
these spirits.

640
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,070
They they like to be covert They don't

641
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,710
want they want you to remain ignorant of

642
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,050
the spiritual world, right?

643
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,250
like like Intelligence agencies, right if you've ever

644
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,170
been around people that are in the intelligence

645
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,890
agencies Oh, even their own parents and family

646
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,110
members don't know sometimes I remember the movie

647
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,910
true lies, right?

648
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,690
They the wife husband wife lie to each

649
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,630
other that they were in intelligence agencies, right?

650
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,390
Yeah Okay, these spirits don't want you They'll

651
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,770
do it and go to any length to

652
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,310
prevent you from understanding the spiritual world and

653
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,130
they'll go to every length to convince you

654
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,490
Of what popular norm keeps you away from

655
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,010
understanding the spiritual world city these people if

656
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,310
you put a gun to their head And

657
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,510
say I'll pull the trigger if you don't,

658
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,330
you know, tell if you don't admit that

659
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,510
it you don't have a past life They'll

660
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,730
say pull the trigger because they did that's

661
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,870
how convincing they are to humans Because now

662
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,990
what spirit is telling this guy that when

663
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,650
I'm talking to him, so what makes yeah,

664
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:36,890
yeah.

665
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,130
Yeah.

666
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,510
Well, it's watching And they and they have

667
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,470
a hive mentality.

668
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,210
They could well that spirit could be watching

669
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,470
you says I don't know anything about this

670
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,190
guy Is there anyone out here that does

671
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,470
you know?

672
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,590
And they like they put it up on

673
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,530
the net like on a chat board and

674
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,830
all the other spirits look at is yeah

675
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,230
I know something about I'll be right there,

676
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,630
you know, and they do it instantly, right?

677
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,770
Yeah, that's why that's so convincing and But

678
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,510
by the way There are repercussions if you

679
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,570
spill the beans too much on how the

680
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,690
spiritual world works You can you can you

681
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,670
can invite some calamity to yourself because it's

682
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,690
like let's say you've had a list of

683
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,350
CIA agents in In in Iraq and you

684
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,190
printed it online You don't think you're gonna

685
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,990
get any repercussions like you got a knock

686
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,510
on your door within two days or three

687
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,710
days Right.

688
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah, if you just have same thing or

689
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,450
let's say in your local neighborhood You had

690
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,230
a list of all the undercover detectives and

691
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,730
you printed it out I mean, you'll have

692
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,870
a knock on your door soon.

693
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,970
So it's the same thing with a spiritual

694
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,490
world if you give up too much You'll

695
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,110
get a knock on your door knock on

696
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,230
your head or something And I don't want

697
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,530
to get into personal stuff, but I first

698
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,450
had knowledge of that Greek I got a

699
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:42,790
question.

700
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,690
Well, so what is the balance on something

701
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,810
like that when presenting information?

702
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,050
I mean, there's got to be a general

703
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,790
yeah, so General but but it but it

704
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,370
works it works It works really a general

705
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,190
is enough to get most of the work

706
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,230
that people will ever have to do done

707
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,750
Let's say you run into a posthumous tribal

708
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,050
member that lives in the snow-capped mountains

709
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,330
of Afghanistan, right?

710
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,310
He's never seen a tiled bathroom or a

711
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,230
toilet or a shower before you invite him

712
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,070
over He walked he he walks into the

713
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,030
room and he's like, I don't know.

714
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,050
What the hell is this, you know, and

715
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,190
He wants to wash his his clothes in

716
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,010
the toilet He doesn't know and you tell

717
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,950
him real quick generally you see this right

718
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,090
here.

719
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,730
This is the bathtub That's the drain on

720
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,110
the floor if you turn these two valves

721
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,990
This is hot water.

722
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,090
This one is cold water and you pull

723
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,870
this you'll get the water coming from here

724
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,050
That's enough information for him to literally take

725
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,450
a shower and the toilet on you sit

726
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,590
down on it You do your your stuff

727
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,150
liquid or soft and then pull the handle

728
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,490
that is so simple But that's all anybody

729
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,590
needs to know about using a bathroom.

730
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,590
How many people three, right?

731
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,770
We'll see that the bathroom is more complicated

732
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,750
than that none I mean, I mean, yes,

733
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,910
if you're going to design one build one

734
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,770
or get into something on a different level

735
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,990
Absolutely, you have to know more about how

736
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,950
it works Okay, so so that's what I

737
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,330
get into, you know, you've never seen a

738
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,990
bathroom before.

739
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,050
Okay, this handles the hot water This is

740
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,570
the cold water uses the soap.

741
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,130
That's it.

742
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,690
You're finished.

743
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,090
Okay.

744
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,670
No, it's actually not finished, but it's enough

745
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,850
It's so utilitarian.

746
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,330
So that's what I get into.

747
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,890
Basically.

748
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,730
There's a spiritual, you know, it's it's not

749
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,970
another dimension Like many people like to say

750
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,190
it's just unseen And that's one thing people

751
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,530
have a hard time where they get caught

752
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,990
up in what I call the dummy load

753
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,170
or what's you know There's only one demand.

754
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,770
Everything is happening at the same place.

755
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,630
It's just that you can't perceive it.

756
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,850
Just like for example It's like these you

757
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,690
can't see that but it's well even less

758
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,590
You can even bring it closer.

759
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,830
Sometimes you go in in homes or public

760
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,530
spaces, especially public spaces You see like a

761
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,150
white fixture with grill cover on a very

762
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,130
small and that's a co2 Or see a

763
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,970
carbon monoxide mom, right?

764
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,850
Right, right.

765
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,970
You've heard of carbon monoxide monitors It's like

766
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,230
why do you need a monitor effect?

767
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,990
Well, because it's tasteless odorless and colorless.

768
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,230
It'll kill you.

769
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,170
You can't smell it You can't taste it

770
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,150
Actually, you can't taste it.

771
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,230
It's a metallic If you get a lot

772
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,190
of it, it's a metallic flavor on the

773
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,710
top of your palate, but it's so subtle

774
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,490
You wouldn't you wouldn't react, you know, right

775
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,190
so but anyway You know, there's so many

776
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,790
colorless think of gas the the gaseous realm,

777
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,570
right?

778
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,270
How many gaps how many gases are colorless

779
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,010
odorless and tasteless that can a be beneficial

780
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,870
to you like oxygen or B?

781
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,430
Well nitrogen also and or carbon monoxide, which

782
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,870
is a compound you see Spiritual world is

783
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,170
just like that It's unseen but it's there

784
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,070
real but it's counter spatial.

785
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,470
I put in some links in the chat

786
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,170
yesterday about hyperbolic geometry I seen that a

787
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,870
very very tasty stuff there.

788
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,510
Yes Because that's how I read from talk.

789
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,270
Oh I didn't know that was she a

790
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,690
TED talk.

791
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,930
Was that a TED talk video?

792
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,170
That's all in the middle of the page

793
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,670
if you went.

794
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,570
Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, she had a Ted

795
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,390
talk is a fascinating woman and who would

796
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,010
have thought you know Yeah, TED talk is

797
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,170
part of the Trilateral Commission the technocrats but

798
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,470
But anything educational like that is but yeah,

799
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm not that it's all bad.

800
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,010
But yeah, I wasn't aware of it it's

801
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,590
discreetly that it was that but So anyway,

802
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,290
this is the spiritual stuff very simple there's

803
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,210
nothing to do what you believe in what's

804
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,690
important is that you've heard it You know

805
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,010
And then take it from there Yeah, whether

806
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,350
they believe it or not or like it

807
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,990
or not as irrelevant You know, that's why

808
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,090
like when I I appreciate Like when I

809
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,690
did the Ocelli and the Greek stuff, you

810
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,270
got to really Thank Ocelli for that because

811
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,130
this that really stretched him out far.

812
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,290
Oh, yeah, because He's just used to not

813
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,370
just singling him out, but anyone out there

814
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:07,530
there.

815
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,830
He's used to agreement You know, like if

816
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,070
if enough people agree on something it's true

817
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,090
and real, right?

818
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,090
I'm trying to show him as that's that's

819
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,030
the that's not true.

820
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,990
Like the majority is always wrong Show me

821
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,550
once when the majority was, right?

822
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,070
Speaking of the majority I want to go

823
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,790
back to World War two what people are

824
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,250
not familiar with You might have heard of

825
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,610
all the protests on television during the Vietnam

826
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,990
War Right and in Europe there were protests

827
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,750
about the Iraqi war right and all that

828
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,250
well, you don't hear anything about the riots

829
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,450
and Protesting about the u.s. Going into

830
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,310
World War two After the Pearl Harbor.

831
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,730
No, you don't know look it up It's

832
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,010
really hard because it it's the new the

833
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,290
newspaper it took the newspapers to get the

834
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,270
people to do it because you know and

835
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,390
the Frank Capra why we fight made movies

836
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,810
about the bad Japanese and all that so

837
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,190
it was a very Being propagandized now World

838
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,290
War two was the heaviest propaganda campaign since

839
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,850
the Civil War There wasn't much of a

840
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,810
propaganda Unleashing during World War one because it

841
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,750
was only a year long for the u

842
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,350
.s Only went in there most people think

843
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,290
it lasted years even an old lady.

844
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,429
I ran into recently I Did some furniture

845
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,690
for her and she says Oh World War

846
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,370
one was pretty long.

847
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,150
Why is it knows a year?

848
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,770
She goes no, it's not I'm like I'm

849
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,650
not gonna argue with her.

850
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,770
I'm not gonna even go tell her look

851
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,969
it up You know, it's only one year

852
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,010
so The Civil War in America is the

853
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,989
largest propaganda that you ever see now in

854
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,310
America I think I mentioned this on last

855
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,630
Sonic people hang their flags what they call

856
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,170
the u.s Flag, you know with the

857
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,030
50 stars and the stripes or 13 Mean

858
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,290
evil spirited people What's that?

859
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,030
They're kind of mean?

860
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,810
Yeah, they are Well, they're they're patriots they're

861
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,430
they're sick so anyway That didn't that ritual

862
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,110
didn't start until the Civil War because the

863
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,270
north The feds sent a bunch of people

864
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,950
in the north telling people to put these

865
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,690
flags on their buildings They're like no, that's

866
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,450
the u.s. Flag.

867
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,130
That's garbage And and they're like you better

868
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,790
put it and they started beating people up

869
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,370
or paying others off to do it.

870
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,150
You see.

871
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,590
Yeah Oh, that's not very yeah.

872
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:22,850
Yeah.

873
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,890
Look at I've been seeing a new flag.

874
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,030
It's a black and white and blue flag

875
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,570
And American flag style.

876
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,950
I don't know what it means.

877
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,090
I've been seeing that around The Isis is

878
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,830
black that's that's that's Isis is us this

879
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,150
or you know American couple weeks ago how

880
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,690
every government wants to Really overthrow Or rule

881
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,170
overtly and then they're trying to get the

882
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,110
people weren't they just gonna rule over the

883
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,150
anyways the government like how the gods are

884
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,510
Gonna do that Well the gut there is

885
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,630
no go the governments are you could just

886
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,310
look at what it is If it's like

887
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,650
if I don't if I show you something

888
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,230
you haven't seen before and don't tell you

889
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,550
anything about it You have enough sense to

890
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,590
examine it, right?

891
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,230
Yeah, but first and then form, you know

892
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,990
what you think it is, you know, and

893
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,970
usually most of the time people are right

894
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,130
If you look at the way you interact

895
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,910
with the government It's basically a bunch of

896
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,470
stupid people working in offices or uniforms And

897
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,370
then you have all these forms whenever you

898
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,410
hear about into your interaction with the government

899
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,070
is going to be a form of some

900
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,430
Time paperwork whether it's a traffic ticket or

901
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,790
all the way up, right?

902
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,930
Now anyone who has a third grade education

903
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,910
whether on any school They will tell you

904
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,450
that anything any noun that is written in

905
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,350
all caps is improper They will fail you

906
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,050
you will have to take the third grade

907
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,870
over if you continue to do that Right,

908
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,610
all these government paperwork is all improper paperwork.

909
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,810
It's neither legal nor lawful So it's some

910
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,010
kind of and if you if you study

911
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,650
what it is, it goes under the CUSIP,

912
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,770
which is the Convention of Universal Securities and

913
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:04,110
Investment Protocols, it's basically all financial stuff based

914
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:09,710
on Non-hypothecated, which means no collateral presumed

915
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:15,010
collateral unsecured credit based Financial instruments derivatives, you

916
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,750
know all this fiat stuff So what you're

917
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,170
what you're interacting with the government is basically

918
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,950
what the what you call the government they're

919
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,610
doing nothing more but collecting your signatures and

920
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,750
and monetizing them through various Organizations for the

921
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,470
people who own your country Okay, this is

922
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,270
one thing that's confusing The country is owned

923
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,950
the country meaning like the land the water

924
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,890
the animals the buildings the people are owned

925
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,350
privately the government Job in every country right

926
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,410
now is To monetize all that just like

927
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,370
YouTube hits you ever like YouTube more YouTube

928
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,930
hits and then they monetize you, right?

929
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,590
the purpose of the government is to get

930
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,650
as many hits as they can on paper

931
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,090
and deliver it to the owners so they

932
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,090
can give it to their financiers like the

933
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,970
Rothschilds and the bankers so they could process

934
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,170
it as credit and and Create paper money

935
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,290
out of it and money on account.

936
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,330
I Think I've never really broken it down

937
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,150
this way before.

938
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,810
It's very simple What you call the government

939
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,150
in any country is nothing more than a

940
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,570
financial instrument collection agency Uh-huh, and they

941
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,730
also have what's called security forces.

942
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,570
They have military they have police they have

943
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,070
sheriffs.

944
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,090
They have citizen watch Right, it isn't wrong.

945
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,410
I have oh, yeah Yeah, they tell you

946
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,910
I think someone just put a video and

947
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,450
chat, you know white people calling the police

948
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,630
about black people doing stuff Yes, right, right

949
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,190
See something say something so so basically you're

950
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,250
Yeah, it's very very simple it's almost if

951
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,050
I break it down to simply people don't

952
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,170
get it It's kind of like what you

953
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,290
see.

954
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,090
This is a toilet.

955
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,090
You sit down you do your thing You

956
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,090
pull the handle that's it, you know, as

957
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,070
long as you don't put anything.

958
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,410
That's at least Less than half the size

959
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,750
of the hole on the bottom So to

960
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,650
make sure everything goes down If you start

961
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,610
putting things in the toilet that exceed half

962
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,550
the diameter of the outlet you might clog

963
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,990
it, right?

964
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,650
That's all you've got to know.

965
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,470
Nope.

966
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,550
No So the real kicker is how do

967
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,910
you get The people that go to work

968
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,290
and everything after they wipe out the population

969
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,950
and you would oh, yeah the psychological Yeah

970
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,030
the enemy when any any government or the

971
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,610
owners the From the the people who own

972
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,830
the the country and then the guard see

973
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,370
people think the government owns the guy It

974
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,350
doesn't the government is there to collect like

975
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,130
I said all of your signatures because they're

976
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,250
worth money to that Right the guy that's

977
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,690
all the government does the government doesn't own

978
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,030
the country or rule the country, right?

979
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,910
It's like you go on to a factory

980
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,650
you have the foreman or the manager of

981
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,650
the factory He doesn't he doesn't run.

982
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,390
He doesn't own the country or the building

983
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,490
or pay the renter or right?

984
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,150
He's there to manage it He's they're just

985
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,870
administrators.

986
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,370
That's why it's called the Trump administration the

987
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,330
Obama administration the Roosevelt the Kennedy administration.

988
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,510
They administer it, right?

989
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,330
They have nothing to do But but also

990
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,230
see they have a set of guidelines that

991
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,770
the attorneys made up under the Lieber code

992
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,130
and they say well are these?

993
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,990
Inhabitants or citizens or residents or whatever they

994
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,730
have to act a certain way and this

995
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,150
is how we want them to act today

996
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,810
It's different than yesterday.

997
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,550
So we have to let them know a

998
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,890
little bit and if anyone goes beyond You

999
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,470
know the fringe of this behavior limitation you

1000
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,790
beat them up or we put you in

1001
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,390
a cage or we shoot you It has

1002
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,970
nothing to do with law That's all it

1003
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,550
is.

1004
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,270
Yeah, you're pretty much you wake up and

1005
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,410
you realize you're a slave Well, you are

1006
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,110
a slave and you're not a slave because

1007
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,970
there's two ways in order to know You

1008
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,730
wake up and you realize there's hot water.

1009
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,650
You have to have cold water right now

1010
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,150
Everybody's under this condition.

1011
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,250
You're not gonna in other words to say

1012
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,510
you wake up and you realize your slave

1013
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,770
is very difficult In reality because you don't

1014
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,430
know anyone who is not a slave Who's

1015
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,630
free show me somebody who's free.

1016
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,650
That means you don't have a birth certificate.

1017
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,470
You don't have any licensing You don't have

1018
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,150
a surname and you don't Reside in a

1019
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,730
territory that's owned by this system Show me,

1020
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,030
you know, there are some people still in

1021
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,250
North Korea, maybe Places of let's say in

1022
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,250
Afghanistan I would say places in Afghanistan and

1023
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,350
a couple of places maybe in the Congo

1024
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,670
or Somalia.

1025
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,610
They're free people In other words, they're not

1026
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,390
registered they're not oh, you know, they don't

1027
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,050
you know what I mean?

1028
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,630
Yeah, and you can't be registered with all

1029
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,170
this stuff and then say you're free because

1030
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,210
that doesn't go away Like give me an

1031
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,450
example of personal example I years ago when

1032
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,030
I discovered this it kind of shocked me

1033
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,470
and for moral reasons I called up the

1034
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,010
the authorities like various authorities the Social Security

1035
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,850
Administration the Health and Human Services the US

1036
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,530
Treasury and I said look I I want

1037
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,530
to cancel all the all this stuff and

1038
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,810
And and I got up to some higher

1039
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,850
level people and there so listen, you can't

1040
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,490
really cancel it.

1041
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,350
Just don't use it Because I knew also

1042
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,690
it's a fiction Yeah, right.

1043
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,870
So so just don't use it is the

1044
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,710
is the in other words too late In

1045
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,690
other words, you can't on it's like if

1046
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,190
you ring a bell and make a recording

1047
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,010
of it You wish you didn't ring it

1048
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,750
will at least stop playing the recording because

1049
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,370
the bell is rung and it's finished, right?

1050
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,410
Yeah playing the recording over and over and

1051
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,310
over So it's a little late for that

1052
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,250
and also if you are free for example

1053
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,750
And you come to a country like the

1054
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,650
US or Mexico or Canada or a hundred

1055
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,070
ninety other countries that is owned You you

1056
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,730
have no business.

1057
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,870
You're a problem now Because that's why they

1058
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,630
say illegals can't work I'm not saying that

1059
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,610
the people from Mexico come to us are

1060
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,730
really free But when they come here, they're

1061
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,850
they're not Entitled let's say or it can

1062
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,850
be privileged like the people, you know given

1063
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,550
Privileges given what they can and can't do

1064
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,990
So for example when you have someone who's

1065
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,050
illegally immigrated to the US work and you

1066
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,970
give them a check or cash They'll say

1067
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,110
hey, this is a note.

1068
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,970
Let me get some money.

1069
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,550
They can't so now they have a beef

1070
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,810
with you They could say look I worked

1071
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,870
a week cutting the grass or raking the

1072
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,230
leaves.

1073
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,330
I'm not a citizen I'm from another country

1074
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,150
and you gave me this fake money.

1075
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,630
I need some real money No one can

1076
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,990
give you real money for that now.

1077
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,750
They got a problem.

1078
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,390
No, yeah, I just stole your labor That's

1079
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,630
why there's a problem with immigration But people

1080
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,510
are so stupid Hopelessly so that there's no

1081
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,070
way they'll ever see the real reality So

1082
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,610
they have to turn on the news or

1083
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,010
the Internet and see what the newspapers or

1084
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,150
the church or whatever is telling them Yeah,

1085
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,450
so much of this caravan coming up.

1086
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,110
Do you see that?

1087
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,630
Well, yeah, that's again for anything that's in

1088
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,250
the news anything and everything is there to

1089
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,750
distract you Yeah, it's it's it's gotten so

1090
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,230
obviously bad now That it's not even You

1091
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,350
can see it in the TV like Amherst

1092
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,750
is almost fake Like how they set it

1093
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,110
up Well, the caravan is not necessarily real

1094
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,530
because I mean it is real But it's

1095
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,090
not a real threat because I was speaking

1096
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,410
to someone that was in Intelligence services for

1097
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,170
Mexico and then he switched sides and came

1098
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,430
to the u.s. And he says there's

1099
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,190
never going to be a war between Between

1100
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,630
Mexico and the u.s. Because there's less

1101
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,650
than a million That's like maybe like 200

1102
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,050
maybe 50,000 Americans living in Mexico or

1103
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,890
a hundred thousand But there's 30 million or

1104
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,810
20 million Mexicans Living in the u.s.

1105
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,950
And he says he personally knows 12,000

1106
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,810
that would be armed and ready to fight

1107
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,450
You know, or you know know someone who

1108
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,370
can command 12,000 commando types that are

1109
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,530
living in the u.s. Immediately So there

1110
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,770
will never be a war because the u

1111
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,430
.s. Already lost by numbers, you know, yeah

1112
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,570
Yeah, and the only reason you have the

1113
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,510
people coming up to the u.s. Is

1114
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,010
to prevent a revolution or unrest in their

1115
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,670
country It's it's formulated.

1116
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,430
In other words, there are factions and groups

1117
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,370
in Mexico and El Salvador and Colombia that

1118
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,770
tell people that are poor or You know

1119
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,530
have a let's say quote-unquote criminal record

1120
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,530
whatever here's some money or go talk to

1121
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,570
this guy and go to America You know

1122
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,050
the people that can start like that that

1123
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,570
can like be like a would it go

1124
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,210
kinder?

1125
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,390
What do you call when a spark and

1126
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,350
a dry box?

1127
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:28,970
What's it called?

1128
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,770
Kinderbox kindling Yeah, they were people that could

1129
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,310
see the more charismatic and the more character

1130
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,990
someone has The the more people will follow

1131
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,350
them and he's easier you could start if

1132
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,070
you have a like here There's in this

1133
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,410

got a lot of character charisma and show

1146
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,010
quality and he lives out of his van

00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:15,790
or something, right?

1148
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,430
He's very poor.

1149
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,410
Yeah, he can organize with that kind of

1150
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,630
character and charisma He can organize a hundred

1151
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,010
people around him as his followers very easily

1152
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,710
That's how the gangsters operated back in the

1153
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,990
day.

1154
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,050
They were very charismatic full of character people

1155
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,350
won't like them Even though they didn't do

1156
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:32,990
good things.

1157
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:33,630
You know what I mean?

1158
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,730
Yeah Those are the people that are looked

1159
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,890
for By you know people there's watchers, you

1160
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,430
know in in all these South American countries

1161
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,430
and they look for these people Even the

1162
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,210
quiet types and they say go to America,

1163
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,820
you know It's not you know back in

1164
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,820
the day when Ronald Reagan was in office

1165
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,520
he had a deal the Mexican president says

1166
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,320
look my all my services intelligence services and

1167
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,640
Analysts and think tanks are telling me that

1168
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,420
we it's possible.

1169
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,640
We could have a revolution.

1170
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,240
This is in the 80s late 70s early

1171
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,140
early 80s.

1172
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,760
We we get we're like 1% we're

1173
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,500
like a Pubic hair away from having a

1174
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,420
revolution or civil unrest in Mexico I need

1175
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,680
for you to take a million of my

1176
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,870
people to Reagan and Reagan was like, okay

1177
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,440
Let him come.

1178
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,000
I Did not know that.

1179
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,620
Oh, yeah Back in the day and they

1180
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,540
never stopped I mean that that was the

1181
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,440
big influx and then they'd let you know

1182
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,220
through this is old That's why if you

1183
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,620
even watch the news like even though with

1184
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,900
the last administration even with this administration People

1185
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,060
who work at the Border Patrol.

1186
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,720
They're like they deliberately leave open areas You

1187
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,000
know, they'll have a concentration of Border Patrol

1188
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,520
and then they'll leave an area where like

1189
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,880
two guys are patrolling a 50-mile strip

1190
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,460
Now if you've ever driven 50 miles, you

1191
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,100
know So you can drive a highway speed

1192
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,720
it takes an hour.

1193
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,240
But if you're patrolling you're not going at

1194
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,980
highway speed you're crawling That's that's two days,

1195
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,760
you know So in other words, you'll have

1196
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,740
a patrol if you want to cross the

1197
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,140
border You'll see the patrol guy and then

1198
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,700
you won't see him for two days right

1199
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,160
this is deliberate a Porous border is always

1200
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,700
deliberate Yeah, I Wouldn't give it any and

1201
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,000
also, you know, this is winter time winter

1202
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,380
time is a time when the agricultural process

1203
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,120
and you know plantings growing and and and

1204
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,380
Reaping is over.

1205
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,480
The harvest is over so now winter time

1206
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,360
traditionally what people did is they did anything

1207
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,560
that was That they could do that.

1208
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,380
They couldn't do during the agricultural process So

1209
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,280
now in the winter time is when you

1210
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,980
put you build a barn, right?

1211
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,060
You don't build the barn in springtime and

1212
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,640
the farm, right?

1213
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,280
you don't build it in the fall because

1214
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,580
it's right you know you build a barn

1215
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,440
in the winter like when harvest is over

1216
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,060
was Planting is over when summer is a

1217
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,900
you or you don't travel when you're a

1218
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,760
farmer you agriculturally You don't travel in the

1219
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,700
middle season, right travel when the season is

1220
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,600
over Yeah, so the main manifestation seasons are

1221
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,940
over right now You're in the season of

1222
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,840
what happens is you do things that normally

1223
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,360
you wouldn't do during the progressive part of

1224
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,400
the year Production production time of the year

1225
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,740
you dude you do travel.

1226
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,720
That's why for example this Khashoggi guy This

1227
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,940
it's like a lot of times.

1228
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,260
I see this and it's like the gods

1229
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,560
are like It's like a I see like

1230
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,900
a comic book of the gods What's going

1231
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,120
on?

1232
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,960
You know like a Marvel Carl and I

1233
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,400
even Marvel cuz Marvel's like superheroes He's but

1234
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,200
like a comic book.

1235
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,060
So the comic book I see is Khashoggi.

1236
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,260
What is he doing?

1237
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,860
He's traveling right he sees this is not

1238
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,680
he's outside of indigenous country in another country

1239
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,900
where he gets killed, right?

1240
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,740
Well, what do you do the winter right?

1241
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,680
So I bet this even though it's hypothetical

1242
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,040
if it was spring summer or fall He

1243
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,520
would have been killed in his own country

1244
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,080
You get it because it's winter time.

1245
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,880
He's killed outside of his country because that's

1246
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,480
when you travel.

1247
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,900
Yeah But it has nothing to do with

1248
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,660
his ability to travel because you could travel

1249
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,040
anytime.

1250
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,060
I'm just saying The the nature of the

1251
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,160
seasons and people's behavior is is I see

1252
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,600
it as a comic book of the gods

1253
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,340
what's in the news?

1254
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:16,460
Mm-hmm.

1255
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,600
Yeah Yeah, I mean it's fall right now

1256
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,840
and then it's coming into winter And in

1257
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,300
springtime, well, yeah harvest is over.

1258
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,160
I would say right there's still some harvesting

1259
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,200
the oil You have for example, like the

1260
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,420
real slow growing which don't exist that much

1261
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,300
anymore, but still do Wheats and things like

1262
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,480
that, you know, they're still harvesting to a

1263
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,980
degree by the way Sure, yeah, and I'll

1264
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,960
keep going I mean the winter rye as

1265
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,860
well plants planted now and it's through but

1266
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,120
generally the spring summer fall is You know

1267
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,360
the planting building up breaking down and then

1268
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,600
winter or the things that are normally done

1269
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,480
that you wouldn't do during that planting growing

1270
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,260
and harvesting The other thing I just took

1271
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,640
cut in since we're a little bit on

1272
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,420
time I mean not time that we don't

1273
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,000
have time, but so I'm reckoning by tonight

1274
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
to wit the full moon Starting at noon.

1275
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,760
I I would suggest today.

1276
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,840
That is the first day of the ninth

1277
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:22,440
month So of what I'm reckoning, so So

1278
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,740
I can't to see mine yet But well,

1279
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,760
it was it was rather full This morning,

1280
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,920
let's say at dawn and almost full last

1281
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,780
night and if you look at the by

1282
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,160
the way the moon Websites, you'll notice it

1283
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,700
grows.

1284
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,260
It changes at about 3% per day,

1285
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,000
right?

1286
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,040
Because roughly 30 days per month three point

1287
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,260
three percent times 30 you see so when

1288
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,880
you look at it And it's like a

1289
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,260
97% well the next day it'll jump

1290
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,000
to another 3% and the day before

1291
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,980
was 94 you ever notice that it goes

1292
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,660
by 3% chunks because Of the nature

1293
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,900
of the 30-day cycle divided by yeah,

1294
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,100
right.

1295
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:05,120
No, okay, so So go ahead We'll call

1296
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,180
you yoga man or or Bruce and go

1297
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,260
ahead for anything else Yeah There's always a

1298
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,780
bunch of stuff that I cannot talk to

1299
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,820
you about and I always seem To freeze

1300
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:14,980
up.

1301
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,460
I do have a little random question.

1302
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,100
Why did they call Bali?

1303
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,680
the island in Indonesian the island of the

1304
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,000
gods Well, because which one isn't the island

1305
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,440
of the gods, I mean it's is the

1306
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,160
gods I mean which island doesn't have a

1307
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,580
god It's a dummy load.

1308
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,200
That's a challenge doesn't yeah, which island is

1309
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,800
not part of a grouping of gods or

1310
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,020
vice versa Isn't there a deity over each

1311
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,400
nation?

1312
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,220
Yes, 70 were initially installed.

1313
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,180
Uh-huh.

1314
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,440
They're the main ones right now is justice

1315
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,600
ball-backed and mollack Well this well each

1316
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:50,960
one.

1317
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,820
These are old old gods Right, so you

1318
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,080
would have to go and search The the

1319
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,600
categories of Genesis is an easy way to

1320
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,800
look at all the various lineages of people

1321
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,500
The 70 nations and such and look at

1322
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,080
their history and you'll see who they are

1323
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,640
Most of them have been forgotten, but it

1324
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,140
doesn't mean they've gone away Mean there's a

1325
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,260
new gods or that their old gods are

1326
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,780
coming back old gods are coming back They've

1327
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,220
always been here except for the ones that

1328
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,300
have probably most likely been killed And then

1329
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,020
their new god-like creatures that will be

1330
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:29,380
unleashed and have been unleashed Right They're like

1331
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,020
to be called angels because they have a

1332
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,260
very you see the spiritual realm just like

1333
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,800
the physical realm is defined by what?

1334
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,920
they do Like you could say if you

1335
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,720
want to really bit generic you see these

1336
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,260
are all humans or how else can we

1337
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:41,880
define them?

1338
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,540
Well, you know, we have a way of

1339
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,560
talking about race, you know, Asian white black

1340
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,480
brown, whatever Latin Right, but really what what

1341
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,800
you do is you define them by what

1342
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,180
they do.

1343
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,860
This is a farmer This is a factory

1344
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,340
worker.

1345
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,360
This is a bus driver.

1346
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,160
You ever notice that?

1347
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,620
Yeah, okay So the the way you define

1348
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,100
the in Scripture, you've seen you'll see that

1349
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,740
they they're all spiritual beings But you define

1350
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,420
them as what they do like this one's

1351
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:06,860
the boss.

1352
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,340
He's the head God, right?

1353
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,080
And then you've got this one.

1354
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,980
He's a messenger is an angel very has

1355
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,180
very little authority unless he's give it's given

1356
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,060
to him All right, then you have all

1357
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,000
these various other demons and things like that

1358
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,780
so And you define them by what they

1359
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,000
do like there's a God and a spiritual

1360
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,220
being behind death and that's personified by the

1361
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,180
grim reaper You see that often in popular

1362
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,520
culture Right, and you got one that brings

1363
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,160
disease you have one bread that brings ones

1364
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,720
world that that bring dreams Good dreams night

1365
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,100
terror.

1366
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,340
There's dreams and there's night terrors nightmares and

1367
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:46,060
night terrors right, so Yeah, I mean and

1368
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,240
it goes on and on there's a God

1369
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,980
behind the birds is a God behind the

1370
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,220
bees Right the God behind the flowers a

1371
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,200
spiritual entity.

00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,080
know You know now he was listening never

1402
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,700
because you said what there's always one bad

1403
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,820
person that wants to do something with this

1404
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:00,000
information well for every good Project there's a

1405
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,200
Anywhere between three to three hundred that want

1406
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,020
to turn it into something malevolent in other

1407
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,480
words if you're working on a project to

1408
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,300
clean up water So people didn't have a

1409
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,400
healthful life and and you start me going

1410
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,760
public There's going to be anywhere between three

1411
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,900
to three hundred Others that are going to

1412
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,160
pick that up and figure out how they

1413
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,200
could turn your methods to make water toxic

1414
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,220
Not overtly toxic, but it'll still taste good,

1415
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,680
but it'll be toxic to you, right?

1416
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:26,720
Yeah.

1417
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,560
Yeah So, I mean I've seen enough industry

1418
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,280
and enough people in various fields that whenever

1419
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,800
you bring up ideas are like wait, wait

1420
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,540
Wait, we let we don't talk about this

1421
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,100
Anyway, we want to monetize that we need

1422
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,740
to we see we need to you know

1423
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,080
What I mean, they you know that no

1424
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,560
one wants to put out anything that's going

1425
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,160
to help anyone even I've even seen family

1426
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,960
of people all over through the years Wishing

1427
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,160
other family members to do well, but when

1428
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,580
when they do well, they get upset You

1429
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,080
know, so basically what they're saying is do

1430
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,420
well in life, but just do but don't

1431
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:06,440
do better than I am doing Yeah, basically

1432
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:16,420
humans are scumbags generally speaking Yeah, and

1433
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,340
yeah the best thing is that when you

1434
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,520
once you can transcend your own family members

1435
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,540
if you're unfortunate to have a big Family,

1436
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,280
you know what?

1437
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:23,540
I mean?

1438
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,540
The most fortunate people are orphans believe it

1439
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,620
or not not socially because you know If

1440
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,100
you were brought up an orphan, you probably

1441
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,940
had a hard time because you know, you're

1442
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:37,300
probably subject to predation and pranking but Because

1443
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,220
the the way the demonic spirits have twisted

1444
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,020
what family is and you know So anyway,

1445
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,560
that's an I've discussed that before.

1446
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,680
Yeah, my grandma.

1447
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,140
I think my grandma's a witch Either way,

1448
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,900
you know, I tell people like your family

1449
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,480
is a bunch of assholes and they're like,

1450
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,560
yeah, you're right You see I I told

1451
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,920
you that it's accurate and I didn't even

1452
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,800
have to meet them, right?

1453
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,400
How do I know?

1454
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,240
This is planet Earth Yeah, so if you

1455
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,560
were say if you're cooking so if you

1456
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,560
cooked pork, right and you know You cook

1457
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,900
pork.

1458
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So would it smell like human flesh the

1459
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,220
board?

1460
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,960
Yeah, pretty much.

1461
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,700
It's no it's Only Most in other words

1462
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,820
if you went to the morgue, but let's

1463
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,320
say you you said, you know so this

1464
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,880
this car blew up and as he blew

1465
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,000
up and pieces of flesh went everywhere and

1466
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,320
you went to and and instead and you

1467
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,860
should I picked up the flesh and but

1468
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,860
you really didn't and It we just put

1469
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,520
a bunch of pieces of pork in there

1470
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,420
and he gave it to the pathologist.

1471
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,840
He'd say oh, yeah, this is human meat

1472
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,240
It's crazy because sometimes we're you know, you

1473
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,800
had to walk down Main Street and it

1474
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,880
just smells like pork and it just like

1475
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,660
smells like pretty much just death and You

1476
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,980
know people next to you like, oh I

1477
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,520
get so hungry and you know, it's society.

1478
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,420
I don't know So the headhunter one is

1479
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:52,880
the best.

1480
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,660
Oh, yeah Yeah, they've got there.

1481
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,680
They're all ready for cannibalism, right?

1482
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,980
Especially the well, I mean who isn't eating

1483
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,620
any pork except in the Middle East really

1484
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,960
but there would be camel The a lot

1485
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,920
of camel By the way, you know if

1486
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,080
you go to the Middle East and they

1487
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,420
ask you if you want meat on it

1488
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,960
and they don't specify you it's going to

1489
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,540
be camel meat, but Just like in Spain

1490
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,960
if you get a hamburger, if you don't

1491
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,820
specify beef, it's going to be horse meat.

1492
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,040
It goes without saying, right?

1493
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,280
Yeah, most people are ready they're primed for

1494
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,320
cannibalism right now because of the pork taste

1495
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,940
the flavor they have Yeah, I got it,

1496
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,700
um, you know, I was just I mean

1497
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,460
growing up and I was younger and then

1498
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,860
I was like the first thing I had

1499
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,960
to get off of was Yeah, yeah, that

1500
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,740
was it Malcolm X or one of his

1501
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,240
of you will say to pork well that's

1502
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,160
half dog half cat and all rat Yeah,

1503
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,060
pretty much I mean it's not that's a

1504
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,680
stupid thing to say in a way but

1505
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,420
at least it got them away from it

1506
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,800
You know, yeah and pigs eat each other

1507
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,160
too.

1508
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,220
Yeah, that's People like to eat pork, but

1509
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,440
anyway, yeah.

1510
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,360
Yeah, that's that's all in scripture too, right?

1511
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:07,920
Yeah.

1512
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,360
Yeah.

1513
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,620
Well people eating people in in Kings.

1514
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,620
There's a story about a woman Asking the

1515
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,420
king for advice.

1516
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,720

1518
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,700
It says well last night we had an

1519
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,420
agreement with a woman We'll eat my baby

1520
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,840
tonight and her baby tomorrow and tomorrow came

1521
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,060
and she disappeared with the baby.

1522
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:24,820
What should I do?

1523
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,200
Or they just eat it right or no,

1524
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,040
yeah, so he went to the king for

1525
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,460
advice It's like, you know, we made an

1526
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,560

What should I do?

1530
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,220
The King's like what?

1531
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,620
Yeah, that's your problem, you know, anyway Well,

1532
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,820
so then have you read that?

1533
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,940
Have you read that in Scripture?

1534
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,200
Yeah, the king is walking on the walls

1535
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,520
a time of famine He's wearing black sackcloth

1536
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,720
And when he heard that he rent his

1537
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,400
clothes he tore his clothes because he was

1538
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,780
it's like wow This is that this is

1539
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,340
what the people are down to right?

1540
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:06,770
that's insane because Well, that's just all comes

1541
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,790
from what then if it's internal input who's

1542
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:14,040
given the internal input to do that The

1543
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,920
creator no, and that's where the good and

1544
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,220
evil comes to the same source.

1545
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:18,840
So what is a giant?

1546
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,840
Oh, yeah What's that this is a giant

1547
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,840
test No, it's not a test it's a

1548
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,280
practical.

1549
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,420
Yeah, it's a test in sense of It's

1550
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,180
practical, you know, it's pretty meaning it's happening.

1551
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,560
In other words, it's stated That if you

1552
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,960
don't If you agree to do this and

1553
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,520
you don't then this will happen to you,

1554
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:41,760
right?

1555
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,780
Yeah The old famous, you know, there's a

1556
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,080
lot of You know obvious Obfuscation and deleting

1557
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,120
you Marie Antoinette, you know the famous saying

1558
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,700
she got in trouble that you know Because

1559
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,720
she sold the people didn't have bread teach

1560
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,360
because we'll let them eat cake then right?

1561
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,580
That's not what she said When they came

1562
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,100
to people don't have food to eat She

1563
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,740
said let them meet their children and then

1564
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,500
they change it to brioche because that would

1565
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,340
be too harsh Because she what she did

1566
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,980
was she went against the elitist group Because

1567
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,580
it's very common in elitist circles when you

1568
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,600
tell the any elitist or you know, like

1569
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,540
the Nobility that the people can't eat don't

1570
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,180
have food to eat.

1571
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:22,960
You say well fine.

1572
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,900
Let them eat their children.

1573
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,780
They have children, right?

1574
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,980
This is a this has been going on

1575
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,300
for a long time, but they don't want

1576
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,580
that to be known Because it's just one

1577
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,420
more thing, you know to hate the nobility

1578
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,580
about That's how the nobility think I mean

1579
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,360
I'll even say let they eat their children

1580
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,380
anyway Well spiritually they do right?

1581
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,700
Yeah, exactly It's worse to eat them spiritually

1582
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,840
like an emotional prison as a life sentence,

1583
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,180
right?

1584
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,940
Yeah, hey I Guess so, you know, I

1585
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,820
mean the emotions I Try not to why

1586
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,700
just you know falling in love you but

1587
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,540
what you say about love is the best

1588
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,740
thing I've ever heard Doing the right thing.

1589
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,020
Yeah.

1590
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,400
Yeah, very few people know what love is

1591
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,940
and then and they can't Because you won't

1592
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,240
feel once you know, what love is you

1593
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,580
can't reckon it You cannot compare it to

1594
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,860
what you see around you at all.

1595
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,730
You'll see that there's no love at all

1596
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,900
So Talking I mean sometimes you get I

1597
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,940
get into these long arguments with the women

1598
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,480
at the Yoga studio, but even there at

1599
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,360
the studio, it's so It's just so pagan

1600
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,380
pretty much.

1601
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,520
Okay That's the nature of Of it right

1602
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:43,760
now.

1603
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,920
That's just how it goes It's pagan eating.

1604
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,360
Okay, it's the very it's different though Like

1605
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,880
we went back to let's go back to

1606
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,660
Christianity, you know, when people say I'm Christian

1607
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,180
Oh, well, what Christian like Roman Catholic, you

1608
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,500
know Latin American?

1609
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:05,360
Mormon You know Protestant Presbyterian Seventh-day Adventist

1610
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,720
What Greek Orthodox Eastern or the what Christian

1611
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,660
because there's no such thing what every you

1612
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,700
notice how all those different types of Christian

1613
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,640
I mentioned are also connected To a geography,

1614
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,480
you know, you notice I right.

1615
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,420
Yeah, and you know how each year there's

1616
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,440
an attribute in other words There's a God

1617
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,500
assigned to each one of those geographies.

1618
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,860
So those gods are like, oh, yeah, this

1619
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,800
Christianity stuff is great, man It keeps people

1620
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,180
ignorant.

1621
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,160
They're never gonna learn anything about the spiritual

1622
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,560
world right on.

1623
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,420
Um, well, that's what I want, you know

1624
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,140
here All right, tell them if they're good

1625
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,760
they go to heaven and tell them if

1626
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,260
they're bad they go to this Dante's Inferno

1627
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,420
Right, and and he worshipped this guy knelt

1628
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,440
to a cross wearing a diaper regardless of

1629
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,460
what color he is or whatever And there's

1630
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,020
only one God Okay, and that's it.

1631
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,920
That's perfect man.

1632
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,920
Keep people Doug They'll never gonna find out

1633
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,200
what we do to them or how we

1634
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,100
you know, what that we're you know, well

1635
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,300
never yeah, it's perfect It's like Stalin Such

1636
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,000
stone I have the I have the etymology

1637
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,820
dictionary right now and it says paganism is

1638
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:19,400
a One of a people or community professing

1639
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:25,780
a polytheistic religion So yeah You've got to

1640
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,240
realize that all ref whether it's not it's

1641
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,940
not whether I like it or not But

1642
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,860
the a lot of the reference materials you

1643
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,680
have to be very careful on Seeing that

1644
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,120
if the meaning is based on What you

1645
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,020
know certain core things that they don't want

1646
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,340
you to understand like all of the religions

1647
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,100
that they say are non pagan are pagan

1648
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:53,340
like Islam Judaism and Christianity are pagan and

1649
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,580
they tell you that Anything anything pay if

1650
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,340
it's pagan if it's not if you look

1651
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,960
up paganism generally, they'll tell you well Paganism

1652
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,740
is anything that's not Islam, you know a

1653
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,520
monotheist, you know Christianity Judaism There is no

1654
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,700
such thing as monotheism ever.

1655
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,920
Yeah, that's a stupid thing.

1656
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,780
That's been invented recently Yeah, it also says

1657
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,580
Latin peasants and then it says right village

1658
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:26,040
royal districts and it says see heathen First

1659
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,480
cinema sure, but where do they get the

1660
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,500
right to say that because they don't know

1661
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,900
you see here's the the twisted reality There

1662
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,760
the roughly 70 gods that were put over

1663
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,400
the nations and Yahweh the chief God decided

1664
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,160
to take one nation So to to be

1665
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,620
at parity with the rest without overpowering them,

1666
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:44,840
right?

1667
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,140
Just I think I've given the example of

1668
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,960
children playing a board game or a physical

1669
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,140
game and here comes the father He says

1670
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,060
I'll play with you children You know I'll

1671
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,240
take a game piece just like you and

1672
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,580
I won't I promise I won't pick you

1673
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,720
up and throw you across the room Right

1674
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,020
a game like twister or something So he

1675
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,280
plays like the rest do you know on

1676
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,740
a minor minor level just to show that

1677
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,160
he's not out that he still exists You

1678
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,540
know practically and so he took Israel that

1679
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,960
way, you know But now that he that

1680
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,400
is really he's like, okay, Israel can't can't

1681
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,200
hang You're out now It's just all these

1682
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,380
other gods and we really don't know who

1683
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,500
they are specifically unless you research it And

1684
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,400
it's just like researching the nobility that runs

1685
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,080
the planet You could look up, you know,

1686
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,460
Bill Gates Rockefeller Rothschild and all those people.

1687
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,160
They're just like the bottom of the barrel

1688
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,680
You'll find as much information as you want

1689
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,260
on them allegedly But the real people that

1690
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,000
run and own all the countries you find

1691
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,320
very little right and that's all part of

1692
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,240
the plan Yeah, yeah You're not going to

1693
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,780
find information on those that really because give

1694
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,200
me an example Google is their company right

1695
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,700
or the in other words it's a company

1696
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,420
and they understand the so if someone let's

1697
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,080
say you got a list of all the

1698
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,800
names of the people or some of the

1699
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,160
people that own most of The countries or

1700
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,020
some some territories as they call it and

1701
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,360
put it online Google would immediately take it

1702
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,660
down and shut your stuff down immediately They

1703
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:18,300
would just block the search the input.

1704
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,420
Yeah, exactly on your and then come after

1705
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,080
your input This is high priority stuff.

1706
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,399
Yeah high priority Just block it or just

1707
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:30,380
remove it out of the search queue And

1708
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,220
right it's done.

1709
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,740
You're censored Yep, and it's the same with

1710
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,540
these gods That's why I keep pointing out

1711
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,720
you ever notice this justice thing and this

1712
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,560
is just ironic how it talks about this

1713
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,560
female goddess religion being Malevolently prevalent in the

1714
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,340
world and yet every country has adopted this

1715
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:50,000
justice religion that you equate with law Why

1716
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,160
why do you equate it with law because

1717
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,180
your law comes from your God, duh?

1718
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:02,580
You know So Yeah, the justice has it

1719
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,080
all That's a real nasty and the people

1720
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,899
ask for it.

1721
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:07,899
That's what I'm saying.

1722
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:09,160
Oh, you know if you're hungry eat your

1723
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,020
children You're doing it.

1724
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,939
Anyway eat your leg You know eat your

1725
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:17,279
arm Yeah, right.

1726
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,279
You don't want to do that.

1727
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,359
No, but that's what they want to hear

1728
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,920
And now people like it's like the gambler,

1729
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,479
you know, they're self-loathing.

1730
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,060
They like to lose this oh Yeah, the

1731
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,859
majority is always wrong People are bad people

1732
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:34,960
are evil Inherently, whatever, you know what inheritance

1733
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,939
is when someone dies or leaves they leave

1734
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,479
something for you and you take it as

1735
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,080
your own, right?

1736
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,060
Yeah, and it trusts Yeah, or however, yeah,

1737
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:43,960
it's bequeathed to you.

1738
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,180
So, you know You've got let's say a

1739
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,979
very normal couple.

1740
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,100
They have children there There their children are

1741
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,740
going to be normal most likely means fucked

1742
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,140
up like they are evil bad Whatever pagan

1743
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,880
whatever you want to call it And their

1744
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
children and their children inherited it goes on

1745
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,160
But if a couple is normal Which is

1746
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,320
fucked up or whatever and they have children

1747
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,760
and you take them away when they're born

1748
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,700
or like after you know Six months after

1749
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,260
their weaned or nine months actually five years

1750
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,380
was the Norm in the old world for

1751
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,340
children to be weaning, you know drinking mother's

1752
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,040
milk Breastfeeding up to five years old.

1753
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,280
That's why in Leviticus It was after five

1754
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,940
years old that a child can be taken

1755
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:28,860
as a slave, right?

1756
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,820
Okay Yeah, I mean now it's just like

1757
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,880
formula out of a can but but if

1758
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,500
you let's have a normal couple in any

1759
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,980
part of The developed world and which is

1760
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,640
fucked up and you take their children away

1761
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,400
and you bring them into a lawful Society

1762
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,500
or a lawful upbringing.

1763
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,820
They're not going to be fucked up.

1764
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,800
You see so it's not Genetically bred in

1765
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,560
I think after a long time Certain things

1766
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,980
certain characteristics can be carried over Genetically like

1767
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,400
if one leg is shorter than the other

1768
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,160
or the way you look right you take

1769
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,840
facial features I don't know how much of

1770
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,720
it is is truly behavioral if it's all

1771
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,560
external input You know There was a research

1772
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,560
study done on Chinese children will always learn

1773
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,680
Chinese faster than Western because of the thousands

1774
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,220
of years of breedings that way and it

1775
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:17,980
didn't experiment it took a black child a

1776
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,710
Chinese child a white child Latin child and

1777
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:23,010
As they raised them and they all learn

1778
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:29,510
Chinese equally You see yeah So it's not

1779
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,850
inbred, you know language and behavior and things

1780
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,370
like that But some of it can be

1781
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:35,850
based on certain physical attributes, right?

1782
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,190
Yeah, I mean whatever you go the model

1783
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:43,170
doctor, right Yeah, some of it can be

1784
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,650
and also the you know, the way you

1785
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:48,010
tune in, you know Well, you know anyway

1786
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:51,250
back to Jack Fesco that when he mentioned

1787
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:56,190
how people You know if you live in

1788
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:57,730
the south, you know, I'm gonna get me

1789
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,410
a nigger, you know or something like that

1790
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:02,650
There's a cultural influence and I think there's

1791
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:06,590
a lot more in percentage That goes to

1792
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:09,770
the person being who's being raised then it

1793
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:13,510
does actually from the actual parental parental units

1794
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:17,110
It's a society, yeah, I don't think the

1795
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:21,150
society does almost 80% of the raising

1796
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,650
in one way or another Right because the

1797
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:26,570
parents are not secluded and even if they

1798
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,470
were secluded in rural They would still have

1799
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,490
enough contact with society where they would bring

1800
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,270
it home.

1801
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:34,130
So to speak right exactly, you know Even

1802
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,970
if they went out into society once a

1803
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,670
month, there would be enough of an influence

1804
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:42,190
Yeah Which is yeah Because I've been around

1805
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,090
people that grew up in rural very rural

1806
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:47,290
farm areas and they'd go into town or

1807
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,550
be subject to other people, you know in

1808
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,470
a social setting Once a month and they

1809
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,430
were just as acclimated to the normal society

1810
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,290
as fucked up as everybody else was.

1811
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,570
Yeah Because they were actually about dryer sponge

1812
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,370
they took it they took it in, you

1813
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:05,150
know, you see a really dry sponge Just

1814
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,610
sucks everything up you faster.

1815
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,530
Oh, yeah.

1816
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:13,580
Yep She's well agrees actually Now I'm gonna

1817
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,840
try call back next week.

1818
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,960
I have thank you actually works out I

1819
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,600
don't want to talk, you know I love

1820
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,520
Greek speak because you can you know Talk

1821
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,620
about anything you want from actually I used

1822
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,080
to be an apprentice before I got into

1823
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,020
yoga for an electrician And that's when I

1824
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,880
first started listening to Greek speak and you

1825
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,260
can't bring can't talk about that for like

1826
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,400
an electrician Creek spit.

1827
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,320
Well, what do you say electrician?

1828
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,260
You mean like a house electrician boat electric

1829
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:38,900
commercial guy electrician like that?

1830
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,780
Okay Yeah, I'm quite familiar with that.

1831
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,500
I've done quite a bit of that, you

1832
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,540
know, basically You're getting back to the the

1833
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,700
number one thing.

1834
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,800
I think is acceptance Do we just have

1835
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,680
to accept the fact that we're in a

1836
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,800
world of pagans?

1837
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:01,220
the rarity of meeting somebody with any Real

1838
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:06,280
knowledge Is rare Right, and it's by design

1839
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,320
and by influence because the last thing you

1840
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,320
want all the way up to the Creator

1841
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,940
is a fully aware Population they're gonna say

1842
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:14,460
what do we do?

1843
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,840
Let's let's get off this and and they're

1844
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,920
gonna there's too many Spiritual beings out there

1845
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,720
that they're gonna summon to do things for

1846
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,720
them and the whole place will be a

1847
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,580
real mess Because a lot of the lower

1848
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:27,160
a lot of the lower spiritual entities find

1849
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:31,720
certain evocations Irresistible like you've seen it in

1850
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,480
the pop culture where you know There'll be

1851
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,020
like a Disney film and they find some

1852
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,400
amulet or something and they say a few

1853
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,040
words and the spirit comes and is Why

1854
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,380
did you are who's calling me?

1855
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,700
Yeah, you see that popular culture.

1856
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,260
Sure.

1857
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,520
What do you I'm here now.

1858
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,340
What should I do?

1859
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:51,420
Right, or they already have some inward knowledge

1860
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,360
of it and just evoke it To the

1861
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,660
rest.

1862
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,360
Mm-hmm.

1863
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,040
Oh, yeah, there's all sorts of It's the

1864
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,380
same.

1865
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,200
It's the same thing like years ago.

1866
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,620
It was this guy said I want to

1867
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,460
shut down Manhattan I said well There's no

1868
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,960
one really very few people live in and

1869
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,660
everybody commutes the way you shut it down

1870
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,100
is by Shutting down the bridges you do

1871
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,620
that go print out a few thousand $20

1872
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,640
bills in color and as you go crossing

1873
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,400
the bridge Open the either the panel in

1874
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,980
the floor or the back window and dump

1875
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,800
a box of thousands of Printed 20s out

1876
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,620
the window and everyone will get out of

1877
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,020
their cars.

1878
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,320
They'll stop in the middle of the bridge

1879
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,280
just to pick up this money That's how

1880
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,720
you shut down Manhattan, right?

1881
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,820
So yes Or at the subway state.

1882
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,340
Yeah, everyone will just stop to pick up

1883
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,060
this money, right?

1884
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,100
You see so what does that have to

1885
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,880
do with shutting them in it?

1886
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,260
Well, it's not it's it's what you know

1887
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,740
How people behave, you know people that are

1888
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,720
fishermen like people who do fly-fishing see

1889
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,180
people who put bait on a hook are

1890
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,440
trapping It's like setting a trap that that's

1891
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,760
not real fishing is like fly-fishing Luring

1892
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,860
where you you don't have any meat or

1893
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,620
protein on the hook.

1894
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,240
It just looks like a fish You make

1895
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,380
it look like a live fish.

1896
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,680
Yeah, you see in each which fish that

1897
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,400
you're going for is a different lure you

1898
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,060
see so And I just did a couple

1899
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,180
of emails that people bring me so I

1900
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,460
said that's not what you are that's what

1901
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,520
you do start learning to separate that and

1902
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,080
you'll start seeing with clarity and then Because

1903
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,000
you have free will and choice and you're

1904
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,980
semi, you know evolved enough to see that

1905
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,180
you can educate yourself now You'll handle it

1906
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,080
that way But if you're convinced that you

1907
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:34,200
are something whether it's alcoholic Christian or Electrician

1908
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,500
or whatever then it now you're screwed because

1909
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,920
you just put yourself in a box It

1910
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,480
doesn't exist and that box that doesn't exist

1911
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,140
is as thick as six feet of concrete

1912
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,840
go figure.

1913
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,700
So Yeah, so If you start looking at

1914
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,800
what people think what things do that's how

1915
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:52,880
Right.

1916
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,160
That's how you control them on the on

1917
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,700
the back end on the front end.

1918
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,480
You have to know what they really are

1919
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,680
All right, so you can develop new methods

1920
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,840
on what they do and this is what

1921
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,640
the think-tank stuff is based on You

1922
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,180
know figuring out like, you know I've heard

1923
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,460
like they have now an amnesia frequency like

1924
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,080
men in black like it pump it out

1925
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,540
you either From some kind of focus device

1926
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,760
could be omni-directional and it's electromagnetic pulse

1927
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,100
that affects the brain It does some cooking

1928
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,240
also heating but it clear it wipes memories,

1929
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:26,580
right?

1930
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,420
There's been around since the 60s, but now

1931
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,260
they want to make it so it's you

1932
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,140
know more available, right?

1933
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:39,000
So it's a small wavelength Yeah, they do

1934
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,060
it electromagnetically.

1935
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,400
I think that if you if you knew

1936
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,400
how to do it a theoretically you would

1937
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,580
have some pretty serious manifestations health-wise also

1938
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:51,640
not that the electromagnetic one doesn't but So

1939
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,240
anything's possible and the only reason you why

1940
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,800
would you want to wipe someone's memory?

1941
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,760
Where's the memory?

1942
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,300
I mean, you know, it's their ability to

1943
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,760
receive the memory right because it's happening in

1944
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,500
a cloud, right?

1945
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,080
So they're damn they have the only way

1946
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,560
for it to work with Electromagnetics is they

1947
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,500
have to actually damage part of the antenna

1948
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,020
It's just like certain array certain antennas, you

1949
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,900
know, each component or length of the antenna

1950
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,380
is for a certain frequency So if you

1951
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,260
have like an ham radio a certain antenna

1952
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,860
length and you cut a foot off of

1953
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,960
it Now you've lost that frequency band, you

1954
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,020
know Your game you could still get it,

1955
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,620
but you won't have any gain let's say

1956
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,740
right it's about game and Then frequency of

1957
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,560
course Which is the resonance of your antenna

1958
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,960
and all that and six foot is the

1959
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,100
magic number and then you know How it

1960
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,660
goes if you know, I won't get into

1961
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:41,220
ham radio, but right so discussion but And

1962
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,920
earlier today I was even telling someone, you

1963
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,440
know There's only a handful of principles that

1964
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,620
you can learn meaning two handfuls Let's say

1965
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,300
a dozen or so principles about the physical

1966
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,280
world that you can apply to everything else

1967
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,600
So if someone shows you an invention or

1968
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,880
a doohickey and tells you what it does

1969
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,500
you're like, oh they built it using this

1970
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,400
this And that right Just like the concept

1971
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,700
if you understand how the airfoil works the

1972
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,520
Bernoulli's principle and air wing the bottom of

1973
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,100
the wing is flat and The top of

1974
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,900
it is curved So when you put air

1975
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,560
across it Where it's flat the air will

1976
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,480
move quickly and where it's curved the air

1977
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,440
removal at a lower speed and because it's

1978
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,660
moving at a lower Speed it has a

1979
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,540
lower pressure equates lift So you could be

1980
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,400
stranded on a deserted island with a bunch

1981
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,140
of natives and as long as you can

1982
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,880
form an airfoil You can go to the

1983
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,260
cliff and jump off and fly away You

1984
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,840
can make it out of bamboo and animal

1985
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,440
skins or whatever palm leaves as long as

1986
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,040
it would had entire structural integrity, right?

1987
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,360
Oil is an airfoil Yeah, Bernoulli's principle is

1988
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,760
very simple and you know as pressure increases

1989
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,160
velocity decreases as pressure decreases I'm sorry as

1990
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,860
pressure increases velocity decreases as pressure decrease decreases

1991
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:58,100
velocity increases is another principle to throw in

1992
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,680
That's where the vortex forms.

1993
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,480
That's why if you look at a lot

1994
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,820
of airplanes Especially the small ones they have

1995
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,840
little things called vortex generators VGs Little fins

1996
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,780
like little tabs on the wings to prevent

1997
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,020
it because the vortex is going to happen

1998
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,600
anyway So you make it happen where you

1999
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,340
want it to happen?

2000
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,380
So, you know if you have like a

2001
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,260
small even like a Piper Cub, you can

2002
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:24,580
you can cut your takeoff Requirement by 20

2003
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,980
or 30 percent with VGs and also your

2004
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,780
stalls, you know, you could your cruise speed

2005
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:31,420
will be reduced So there's more there's more

2006
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,420
concept to it.

2007
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,600
You know F equals P over V is

2008
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,780
a simple mathematical equivalent So this is like

2009
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,220
I'm giving you one example of a handful

2010
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,360
of things that you can teach Young people

2011
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,920
or anyone who wants to learn everything about

2012
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,580
the world, right?

2013
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,760
Yeah That's what I wanted.

2014
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,240
That's where it's at Yeah, and the other

2015
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,200
thing is, you know, I've said, you know

2016
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,180
Greek why don't you do is it?

2017
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,480
Well, I have to speculate on it.

2018
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,240
I could easily put all this together easily

2019
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,700
It's a lot of it'll take me about

2020
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,060
six months to a year and I've sort

2021
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,140
of said I would do it But I

2022
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,220
decided not to because it would be speculative

2023
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,500
Spend a lot of work put this out

2024
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,600
do a subscription based or a membership base

2025
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,100
so so influx of credit could come in

2026
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,460
so it could be used to grow the

2027
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:14,400
project right and Or sustain it and and

2028
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,940
then if I do all this and it's

2029
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:17,820
speculative Well, how many people are going to

2030
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,440
join how much credit is going to come

2031
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:19,600
in?

2032
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,240
You know, it's like, you know, I don't

2033
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,340
I don't want to speculate, you know, I'd

2034
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,260
rather just go Paint, you know do wallpaper

2035
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,200
someone's kitchen for 300 bucks.

2036
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,560
At least I know that you know, I

2037
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,200
do this I'm gonna get that right?

2038
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,920
Yeah, I don't want to speculate like I'll

2039
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,960
put all this stuff together Put it out.

2040
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,860
Maybe who's gonna buy like people who write

2041
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,500
books are speculating, you know, well, I sold

2042
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,100
a million copies I do do you think

2043
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,440
you would oh, I don't know, you know,

2044
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,600
it's speculative, you know It's like and then

2045
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,320
when you look at your audience, you're like

2046
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,080
humans.

2047
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,860
No, they're not gonna get this, you know,

2048
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,740
it's just too simple But to prove the

2049
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,340
point wrong in a in on on a

2050
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,240
general level Is look there's people that That

2051
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,620
still email then people like yourself and other

2052
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,200
people say man.

2053
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,240
Look, this is great stuff.

2054
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,020
I like it, you know, so great Yeah,

2055
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,380
you know Only a few dozen maybe so

2056
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,320
Yeah, well, you know sometimes in there you

2057
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,940
get nervous to call in because you know

2058
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,360
what you say about no real man left

2059
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,000
You know, sometimes I feel like I'm talking

2060
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,800
to the smartest smartest guy I left on

2061
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,800
this planet I'm not smart.

2062
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,860
I'm just less stupid mom maybe Yeah, right,

2063
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:35,260
but but here Yeah Yeah Getting back to

2064
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:39,680
what you were saying before It's it's how

2065
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,620
how are you gonna train the pagan to

2066
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,620
have a mindset and that and that you

2067
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:48,560
almost have to start So simplistic like teaching

2068
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,880
a baby with well And no because yes

2069
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,640
and no yes, yes That's the principle but

2070
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,700
no because are they cosmically censored and if

2071
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,720
they're cosmically censored there's no you can do

2072
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,380
Cosmic censorship is an example.

2073
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,400
And then there's then when they censor you

2074
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,200
Cosmically the got the gods What what they'll

2075
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,300
do then they'll say okay.

2076
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,780
Do we give them like which package of

2077
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,240
censorship?

2078
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,720
Do we give them just the general censorship?

2079
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,080
So they're like bipedal cattle or do we

2080
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,240
give him the stubborn element and the rebellious

2081
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,660
element also like the college professor who's Teaching

2082
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,740
about the moon landings and you say well

2083
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,780
There's no evidence of it and also all

2084
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,320
the evidence that they show proves that it's

2085
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,900
false and the college Professor says that even

2086
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,040
if the astronauts confess that they never went

2087
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,500
to the moon.

2088
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,300
I would still say they did Yeah, then

2089
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:41,780
okay.

2090
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,180
So that's like not only do you have

2091
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,900
the stubborn and the Arrogant now, you've got

2092
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,580
the twisted mindset like they're just playing crazy,

2093
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,000
right?

2094
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,900
That's a thrown in also so for example

2095
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,460
you Bruce and I think you're absolutely correct

2096
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,760
Yeah on that, you know, like I say

2097
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,020
out of ten that I've ever Lightly and

2098
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:06,600
I do mean lightly spoke about it Maybe

2099
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,900
to Come back for more and I and

2100
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,580
I leave it at that I don't want

2101
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,740
to know if they still do or don't

2102
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:17,380
or how right it's up to them.

2103
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:17,540
Yeah.

2104
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,460
Yeah, and also they'll come back Yeah, if

2105
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,020
they're more social they want to talk together

2106
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,200
and because you know, it's like scripture with

2107
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,040
the council, right?

2108
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,440
There's wisdom exact right if you don't understand

2109
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,900
if one person might know a little more

2110
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,620
about the other and show it a different

2111
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:34,560
way But you got to realize that most

2112
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,900
people are crazy meaning they're they're just insane

2113
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,600
And they and the really insane people are

2114
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,940
the ones that seem normal initially because that's

2115
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,740
how they invite You know the the contact

2116
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,700
right, right?

2117
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,940
Because if someone's totally violently crazy and they're

2118
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,240
always flailing and foaming at the mouth and

2119
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,440
their eyes are bulging and their skin You

2120
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,840
know is totally cut you're gonna keep your

2121
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,420
distance talking about the kind of crazy like

2122
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,440
like a doctor a lawyer Judge a priest

2123
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,560
a rabbi those people are crazy Also be

2124
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,380
in other words a they wear the facade

2125
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,100
That you know, they're they're representing Yeah, they're

2126
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,220
representing something and then you approach them and

2127
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,600
you if you if you're just like one

2128
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,660
of the cattle they seem fine But if

2129
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,480
you're critical thinking and slightly well-informed, you'll

2130
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,700
see these people are nuts Oh, yeah, because

2131
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,100
they're just you know, they'll just tell you

2132
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,200
it doesn't matter what you're saying Just do

2133
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,280
this and you're like, wait a second.

2134
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,500
I thought you're an attorney or I thought

2135
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,100
you were a priest I thought you're a

2136
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:37,890
you mean it doesn't matter Right Yeah, but

2137
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,390
you've been pretty spot-on on this and

2138
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,090
everything I was listening to Greek speak in

2139
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:43,610
2016 and it was a recording with you

2140
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:47,890
and have Charlie 2015 and then you pretty

2141
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:50,710
much brought up nonchalantly like oh, yeah, that's

2142
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:53,330
that whole, you know pedophilia room and stuff

2143
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:55,930
That's gonna come up Pretty soon in the

2144
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:57,910
media and not so much later and it

2145
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:59,770
was going on at the same time in

2146
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,950
2016 the whole Pizzagate thing.

2147
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,470
So you call it out afterwards.

2148
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:04,450
I called it before.

2149
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:09,590
Yeah Yeah, well or yeah even I was

2150
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,190
a little yeah, I was a little bit

2151
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:14,590
more even prior to that I say you're

2152
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:15,790
going to see that there's going to be

2153
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:19,250
a normalization and an outcoming of this really

2154
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:24,010
disgusting repugnant stuff like cannibalism and child molestation

2155
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,570
and You know just all this stuff is

2156
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:28,130
going to start coming out and it's and

2157
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:30,770
it's not going to overturn society It'll be

2158
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,410
it'll be in society.

2159
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:33,750
You'll know about it, but it'll be like

2160
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:36,270
a big deal and that's exactly, you know

2161
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:41,050
It takes a year and a half to

2162
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:43,470
take place for a presidency to get any

2163
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,070
certain stream effects and a year and a

2164
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,050
half Later almost exactly that's when the whole

2165
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,230
immigration things are to come up again Mm

2166
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:52,890
-hmm, well, they've been floored it came in

2167
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,710
hard and then it went away just like

2168
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:54,930
that.

2169
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,450
No Trump is Trump is just a there

2170
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:01,930
at okay the whenever if I told you

2171
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:05,290
like Let's bring up a company like coca

2172
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:07,350
-cola or whatever, you know Like the president

2173
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:09,250
of coca-cola this the president of coca

2174
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:11,870
-cola that eventually you're gonna be tired of

2175
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:14,370
hearing about the executive aspect Cocoa and you

2176
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:15,730
want to know well, what is coca-cola?

2177
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:16,510
How does it taste?

2178
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,730
Is it good for you, right?

2179
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:20,930
So when you talk about the presidency, okay,

2180
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,770
he's a president of what well, what is

2181
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,930
it and is it good for you?

2182
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,570
Big for United States.

2183
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,190
It's not none of it is good.

2184
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:31,750
It is such a distraction As a matter

2185
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,930
of fact the the up until Lincoln the

2186
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:37,210
presidency was considered a very minor role in

2187
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:41,390
people's minds In other words if you before

2188
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,110
late before the Civil War American Civil War

2189
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,970
if you brought up the presidency to anyone

2190
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:46,150
here They were like, well, I hope he

2191
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,730
just does a good job and keeps his,

2192
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,730
you know, just keep him worried He you

2193
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:51,290
know, just he's got to do what he's

2194
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:51,730
got to do.

2195
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:54,670
That's it You know people then were concerned

2196
01:27:54,670 --> 01:28:03,090
about the bankers Well, they were better off

2197
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,370
There's a trip that was a time of

2198
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,890
tremendous wealth and expansion because if you're poor

2199
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,510
you can't expand right, right?

2200
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,770
You know, you know if you're really poor,

2201
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:15,570
you're not going to move And and and

2202
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:19,090
and develop something somewhere else Whenever you hear

2203
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,010
about all these migrations because people are poor

2204
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:22,650
There's always someone on the other side that

2205
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:24,510
has to have the wealth to accommodate them

2206
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:27,210
You know poor people don't move to other

2207
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:29,890
poor people neighborhoods, you know I mean they

2208
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:32,110
try to you know, go to somewhere where

2209
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,610
they can get something for worth the effort

2210
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,930
I mean there is cross movement like that,

2211
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,090
but not in that would change, you know

2212
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:44,210
a national status There was tremendous wealth being

2213
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,430
poured into the country extracted from the country

2214
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:49,070
then and all that, you know But you

2215
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,970
see then by the by the mid 1800s.

2216
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:55,370
It was time for The Westphalia thing to

2217
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:57,070
kick out, you know Which is the idea

2218
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,410
of nation-states and make the US a

2219
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:02,290
sovereign state Which is privately owned all these

2220
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:04,010
because what people don't know you could look

2221
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:04,430
this up.

2222
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:07,430
This is in not non-conspiratorial reference material

2223
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:10,430
all of the colonies all the states were

2224
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:15,250
Corporations by the way, that's why Which one

2225
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,510
is it Rhode Island's considered a plantation right

2226
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:18,430
or which one is it?

2227
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,830
Yeah, yeah, they're farms are either called farms

2228
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:28,610
the Commonwealth's Yeah homes that yeah, that's what

2229
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,970
they're still called there were corporations Yeah, yeah,

2230
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:33,570
and they had administers that were governors and

2231
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,010
a governor is just a captain of a

2232
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,110
ship when a captain of a ship Gets

2233
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,350
off his ship and creates a settlement.

2234
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:43,670
He's now the governor Yep Right a captain

2235
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,610
of a ship today when you hear he

2236
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:46,890
was a captain of a ship Well, it's

2237
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,670
either a cargo ship a tanker ship or

2238
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:53,430
a cruise boat or a Navy Admiralty, it's

2239
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,370
all it's all commercial.

2240
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:55,730
Yeah, it's all commercial.

2241
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:59,930
Yeah So what happened you had the 13

2242
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:02,330
colonies operating the way they did which were

2243
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:08,430
13 corporate projects they expanded under some kind

2244
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,810
of Semi-unified government under the Articles of

2245
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:15,170
Confederation there were Confederation people don't even know

2246
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:16,970
what the word Confederation means this means a

2247
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:23,390
group and The idea was That obviously these

2248
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,830
people don't know how to handle such a

2249
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:27,970
level of economy and economy is not money

2250
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,930
money It's just what you use as a

2251
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:32,050
means of exchange the economy is different than

2252
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:35,370
you had managers back then to or presidents

2253
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:38,810
In the confederacy I call them managers But

2254
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:41,610
and and then you had the various nobilities

2255
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,950
that were heavily entrenched and involved with the

2256
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:47,190
states, and they said yeah We we want

2257
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:47,530
it all.

2258
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:49,850
It's just you know this this country stuff

2259
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:54,210
is bullshit It's territory time you know Canada

2260
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:54,910
u.s..

2261
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:58,850
Mexico is one piece That is also the

2262
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,910
same part of the rest the whole side

2263
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:03,230
here And I've given a little bit of

2264
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:06,850
information Right now the everything from Canada all

2265
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:09,110
the way down to Chile is owned by

2266
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:14,590
one group except for Uruguay And no one's

2267
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:18,210
asked me why and that's another That's interesting

2268
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:20,850
and the reason why I'll tell you because

2269
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,090
it goes the system goes through the Universal

2270
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:27,430
Post Office And Universal Post Office is is

2271
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,390
a different ad in Uruguay has a different

2272
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:32,950
aspect to it You the the in other

2273
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,770
words in you know see an empire when

2274
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,470
you hear Empire.

2275
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:39,690
That's a ruler over the whole world As

2276
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:42,270
I the Kings are below the Emperor always

2277
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:45,990
So when you in order to have an

2278
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:47,650
empire you the first thing you need to

2279
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:50,730
okay, you cannot say you have Established an

2280
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:53,970
empire until you've established what most people say

2281
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:57,390
military because they don't know No a post

2282
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:00,470
that's right to get information and documents back

2283
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:03,970
and forth So if your post goes so

2284
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:05,910
right now, can you mail anything to anywhere

2285
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:08,850
in the world yes, or no yes pretty

2286
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,150
much?

2287
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:12,630
Okay, because you have a Universal Post Office,

2288
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,250
and that's how those are the codes just

He's about 20 years old.

01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:03,150
He's in his 21st year now Yeah, he's

2306
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:06,090

2308
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:21,390

migration and the people in the nations, please

01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:24,630
give me a little bit more on that

2311
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:31,510
Yeah, well Israel here's interesting thing if you

2312
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,630
study you got to look at everything both

2313
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,590
the secular which is the the dumb shit

2314
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:40,330
and and this and the prophetic There's a

2315
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:45,330
very strong undertone From the political powers that

2316
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:48,950
be that Israel will not exist after 2021

2317
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:49,630
2022.

2318
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:53,570
They're gonna break it up right Anybody who

2319
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,730
doesn't know this or whatever just look it

2320
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,090
up on your own as a I don't

2321
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:58,710
want to get into that discussion this is

2322
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:01,710
like, you know, the The political groups that

2323
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:03,550
you know people the power brokers.

2324
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:05,050
That's what they want to do, right?

2325
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:08,690
They see there's more value in the entire

2326
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:12,190
Middle Eastern region than just focusing on this

2327
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,630
little country and by the way the same

2328
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:16,130
people who own the United States also own

2329
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:19,230
Israel but That would be pretty easy to

2330
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:21,070
see right, right.

2331
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:27,410
Okay, right so That's going to be that's

2332
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:28,930
going to change and it has to change

2333
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,370
right because it's a you're right because in

2334
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:33,690
other words if you read in Zechariah and

2335
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:36,070
other prophecies that it will be Israel be

2336
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:40,150
taken back as as An individual piece or

2337
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:41,790
part that is separate from the rest of

2338
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:42,730
the world, right?

2339
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:47,910
prophetically Jerusalem when it says Jerusalem, it means,

2340
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:50,890
you know, the basically the Judean and they're

2341
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:56,090
gonna be subjected to the Palestinians Well for

2342
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,370
yes, if you look at a repeat of

2343
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:00,110
judges, yes, they will be if you look

2344
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:04,310
at Netanyahu being 12 the 13th or 14th

2345
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,870
Judge or Prime Minister of Israel were repeat

2346
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:09,150
Samson And if you look at Samson's time

2347
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:11,730
the Palestinians or the Philistines are the ones

2348
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:13,110
that had an upper hand, didn't they?

2349
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,660
Yeah, yeah That's where you get well Remember

2350
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:21,200
the story where Samson he wanted to prank

2351
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,020
the wheat fields the Palestinians because they were

2352
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,000
taking all the wheat he tied the tails

2353
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,780
of two foxes together and lit him on

2354
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:31,520
fire, you know, like the animal rights people

2355
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,720
now would freak out and Threw them in

2356
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,260
the field and you know, they let the

2357
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:35,780
field on fire.

2358
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,040
You ever see Firefox Yeah We think it

2359
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:46,620
comes from Like Facebook and and there's a

2360
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,560
Masonic logo if you could look at the

2361
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,940
F in the blue I think I posted

2362
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,920
in chat once yes, and Google Mail is

2363
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,200
the apron the Freemasonic apron Right.

2364
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,460
So this goes so now this goes back

2365
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,860
way before anything like that So it's not

2366
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,640
only the it's secret society So in other

2367
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,220
words, you're seeing that the the message is

2368
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,880
put in front of you Yes, the show

2369
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,480
the dumbed-down secret society crap from Freemasonic

2370
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,900
shit, which is what it is And then

2371
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,340
you have the biblical stuff.

2372
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,180
So I mean if you told someone Firefox

2373
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:20,020
is a biblical Extraction, you know what, you

2374
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:23,700
know, but what it's also well, what does

2375
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,380
it symbolize?

2376
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,580
It's tearing up the Philistines, right?

2377
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,520
so Now Samson faces a tragic end he

2378
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,720
loses his life and takes out more Palestinians

2379
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:35,580
Right.

2380
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,560
So this is right now is Samson right

2381
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,220
now is probably young then too, right?

2382
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,760
well, the Prime Minister the is going to

2383
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,960
be another Prime Minister like all merit is

2384
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,020
making trying to make not really a comeback

2385
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,620
but Criticizing that this type of behavior should

2386
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,180
end but it's going to get worse.

2387
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:57,280
In other words The the current political the

2388
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,660
sovereign state the corporation known as Israel is

2389
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:02,840
going to get even harsher With the the

2390
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,500
group of people who are not a sovereign

2391
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,300
state, by the way Are the Palestinians right

2392
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,460
because they say is they're not even a

2393
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:11,240
nation, right, but they kind of are in

2394
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,020
a way They're they you know, if you're

2395
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:15,920
you get a birth certificate from Israel if

2396
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,800
you're born in there, I think But you're

2397
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,480
not an Israeli.

2398
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:22,740
They just administer Mm-hmm.

2399
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:30,580
I'm not sure Yeah So anyway, it's gonna

2400
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:33,920
get worse All those people that live in

2401
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,140
the West Bank are gonna perish if they

2402
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:39,260
don't move You know, there's hundreds of thousands

2403
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:39,820
of them there.

2404
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,200
There's over a hundred thousand Palestinians living in

2405
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,920
Lebanon as refugees huge camps You don't hear

2406
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:52,800
anything about that But Anyway Their paper is

2407
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,340
also very silent on that which I find

2408
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:55,760
odd.

2409
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,540
Oh Yeah, because that you don't really have

2410
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,680
a media yeah, you know the the Internet

2411
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:05,700
is is really like I say a cross

2412
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:09,100
between the phone book and The television and

2413
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,840
the telephone and the television really and maybe

2414
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,300
a little access to some reference material It's

2415
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,640
not like the Internet is not like it

2416
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:18,320
was 12 15 years ago where it was

2417
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,260
all HTML white pages, you know, you know

2418
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:28,280
Stuff that made semi made sense But What

2419
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,940
what's interesting is this coming of the next

2420
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,580
prime minister and the prime minister after him

2421
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,980
that was going to be very much against

2422
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:39,260
well, I should say Extremely hostile to the

2423
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:42,560
modern-day Philistines, which are the Palestinians Coincides

2424
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,700
with this Israel being dissolved by 2021 2022

2425
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,580
That's in on the books, by the way

2426
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,080
by the You know this the societies that

2427
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,440
control, you know, like the medium societies, you

2428
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,780
know Like the groups intelligence agencies and that

2429
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,580
be what people call the shadow government What

2430
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:03,040
Shelley was having a really hard time when

2431
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,160
I was trying to explain this to him

2432
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,460
There is no shadow government.

2433
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,900
You have the Government for public consumption, which

2434
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,380
is there to just collect financial papers improperly

2435
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,600
illegally or whatever Then you have the shadow

2436
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,120
government Which is basically those that control them

2437
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,780
and then you have the owners that make

2438
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:20,580
all the decisions.

2439
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,820
He couldn't get that most people can't because

2440
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,020
once they do then of course, obviously you

2441
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,600
realize that everything you think you're knowing saying

2442
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,800
is a complete lie, but The essence of

2443
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,340
what I'm saying though is this coming Round

2444
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:39,920
about what the the Palestinians which is going

2445
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,360
to be very bad is going to change

2446
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:46,540
Israel Yeah, and it coincides with the 2021

2447
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:50,480
2022 dissolving Israel as it is Like, you

2448
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,380
know Kissinger said that The Trilateral Commission.

2449
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,940
This is Council of Foreign Relations the Bilderberg's

2450
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,080
The the English monarchy says Israel has to

2451
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,320
go.

2452
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,800
I Mean they will give them till 2021

2453
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,320
2022 and that's perfectly lines up prophetically with

2454
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,880
what I just mentioned the next Prime Minister

2455
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,420
interesting Yeah, I don't get into I think

2456
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:21,240
I brought up enough.

2457
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:25,000
I put out enough Information that if anyone

2458
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,060
really wanted to make a project of it

2459
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,300
would come back and say hey I want

2460
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,820
to talk more and no one really, you

2461
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,280
know is doing that which is fine because

2462
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,260
I keep my peace and quiet But if

2463
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,820
you go back and I don't give it

2464
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,300
all in one shot But I have talked

2465
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,860
about the future of the Middle East and

2466
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,920
how it's gonna Come about before a long

2467
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,980
time about ten years ago.

2468
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,960
I was talking about this.

2469
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,980
Yeah, there's no that question There is over

2470
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:49,220
here.

2471
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,340
That's gonna happen over here.

2472
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,000
You don't know how it's gonna happen, but

2473
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,020
over here They're just gonna get okay the

2474
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:57,460
more technically advanced so sort of technical access

2475
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,920
to society has the dumber they're going to

2476
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,600
be That's very simple, I mean, I'm just

2477
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,200
visiting taking notes I don't read when I

2478
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,420
read look at an advertisement or news I

2479
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,540
don't look at it like it concerns me

2480
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,180
because I'm just visiting right so I can

2481
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,640
see it objectively, you know what I mean?

2482
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,220
so countries that have access to like very

2483
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:19,520
robust grid systems meaning power and information grids

2484
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,920
and and And also, what do you call

2485
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:23,360
amenities?

2486
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,920
Like, you know big cities and lots of

2487
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,660
travel air airplane trains buses cars cheap fuel

2488
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,980
Power grid information grid.

2489
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,680
Okay, those people are gonna get dumber and

2490
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,380
dumber and dumber to the point where if

2491
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:40,440
you went to sleep now And woke up

2492
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,980
three years from now walked outside.

2493
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,920
You'd say these people are so dumb That

2494
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,220
that you you know that it's just unbelievable

2495
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,960
in just three years how stupid they got

2496
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,220
right?

2497
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,440
Yeah, they're nothing more than cattle walking up

2498
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,820
on their on their hind legs This is

2499
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:57,220
the you're gonna see a very rapid progression

2500
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,360
of the stupidity and dumbing down of the

2501
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:03,040
more technically advanced countries, so when you look

2502
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,640
at like, let's say the Pacific Rim in

2503
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:09,940
Asia the North America and Western Europe where

2504
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:13,540
they have robust information and power grids Most

2505
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,600
people are gonna get what it took to

2506
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,340
do in 10 years to dumb them down

2507
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,580
or 20 years or 30 years They can

2508
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:23,170
do now in a year or two Right

2509
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,890
So by the time this rolls 2021 2022

2510
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,690
rolls around 2023 the people are going to

2511
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,610
be so much dumber than now that but

2512
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:35,210
it'll be fast But gradual gradual in other

2513
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:37,190
words, it'll be light speed gradual And I

2514
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,690
mean, it's good you're gonna see a gradual

2515
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:40,950
ism that happens so fast and so acceptable

2516
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,350
That you it'll be shocking and it'll seem

2517
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:45,870
normal even anyone listening to me.

2518
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,910
That's aware of it Yeah, no wonder why

2519
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,530
the anti-christ is gonna be so easy

2520
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:57,850
to come up The chemical chemical and the

2521
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:03,930
cosmic censorship, yeah will be ratcheted up But

2522
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:05,750
but then it's going to be open regarding

2523
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:09,090
religions you see because the Benevolent gods hate

2524
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:11,170
all of the religions that exist right now

2525
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,010
and I can speak for them on this

2526
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:18,410
because this is how it's been Memorialized All

2527
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,410
of the religions that exist today in the

2528
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:23,350
forms of spirituality are repugnant repugnant means like

2529
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:27,130
disgusting To the benevolent odds and even to

2530
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:30,190
the malevolent gods they are also but the

2531
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:32,730
malevolent gods like it and permit it because

2532
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:35,250
it offers a cover and a Distraction and

2533
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,750
keeps people ignorant Right.

2534
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:43,150
Yeah But even even the worst most malevolent

2535
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:45,950
demon will say yeah Christianity and Islam and

2536
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:48,110
the Mormonism and the process that shit is

2537
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:52,550
disgusting man But I I'm glad that it's

2538
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:54,350
there because it provides a good cover for

2539
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:57,550
me You see what I mean, right?

2540
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:01,290
Yeah, and there yeah, I hate it when

2541
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:03,830
I do This kind of talk because you

2542
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:05,010
know what you ain't gonna get this kind

2543
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:09,130
of talk So Now I can't now you

2544
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,690
see now it's like I'll go I can't

2545
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:12,150
say go look that up because you have

2546
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:13,990
to really be familiar With the whole piece

2547
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:17,130
the whole thing the whole landscape see Right.

2548
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:19,010
Yeah, I'm just gonna remember what you said

2549
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,250
in the past And it's gone off what

2550
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:25,170
I see right now, you know, I Try

2551
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:28,470
to develop those eyes and ears Well, look

2552
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:31,790
like where I am you see You have

2553
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:34,450
to be able to explain it Like where

2554
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:36,470
I am today, there's an incredible thunder and

2555
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,510
lightning storm I mean where the Thunder shakes

2556
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,150
the ground and if you're standing on a

2557
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:42,710
slab on grade house with no basement You

2558
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,710
know the where the concrete slap the house

2559
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,570
was vibrating that kind of Thunder I mean

2560
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:49,490
physically moving like wow this is a serious

2561
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,470
and the power went off to like three

2562
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,170
two one and it came back on and

2563
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:56,150
Okay, so you know how the ether goes

2564
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:58,170
from low to high that means that the

2565
01:44:58,170 --> 01:45:00,330
power that was reflecting down all the power

2566
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:03,830
lines And the transformers jumped off the reflectors

2567
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,770
known as the conductors the wires and to

2568
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:09,150
go into the Scott sky Now if you

2569
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:11,910
because it was represents a low potential compared

2570
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:13,790
to the potential that was occurring in the

2571
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:14,850
heavens in the sky, right?

2572
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,410
But if you use the bullshit physics and

2573
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:19,750
theory that they tell you well if there's

2574
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:21,870
so much power in the sky Why doesn't

2575
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:23,730
it reach down and conduct through the wire

2576
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:25,110
and overload them the wire?

2577
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:27,790
It doesn't do that never does that the

2578
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:30,970
reason why you have transformers exploding is Because

2579
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:33,170
all of those coils in there It wants

2580
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,610
to jump off the coil and go into

2581
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:35,970
the sky and it has to go through

2582
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:38,790
all this oil and insulation To do that,

2583
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:39,110
right?

2584
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:42,050
And there you get the blackout because yeah

2585
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,530
the power that they're that's reflecting and going

2586
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:47,170
down the wires From the power station through

2587
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:48,950
the whole city wants to leave that and

2588
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,830
go because it represents a low potential You

2589
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:53,390
see and this is so simple once you

2590
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:55,670
know, it goes from low to high so

2591
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:59,690
a bullet Flies through the air and things

2592
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:01,610
because it has no potential anymore.

2593
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:03,750
See people would think the opposite They think

2594
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:06,430
a flying bullet has a lot of potential.

2595
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:07,390
It has no potential.

2596
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:09,910
It's released all of that's why it could

2597
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:13,670
penetrate You see so once you understand this

2598
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:20,970
principle now you can develop armaments weaponry To

2599
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:24,910
do to be a very destructive Efficiently once

2600
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:27,350
you understand low to high principle and once

2601
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:30,050
you understand, you know Once a missile or

2602
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,110
a bullet is shot out of a barrel.

2603
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:35,450
It has no more potential You get it,

2604
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:37,350
but intuitively it doesn't sound right because it

2605
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,690
what do you mean as a potential thing?

2606
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:39,890
I'll go right through the wall and kill

2607
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:40,050
me.

2608
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:42,570
Yeah, that's because it has no potential.

2609
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:44,530
It's going to the higher potential, which is

2610
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:50,610
you Yeah You saw how it flows Yeah,

2611
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:52,990
so once you understand this it's it's backwards

2612
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:54,570
what we've been taught now you start to

2613
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:56,370
see how the universe really works how physics

2614
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:59,570
and nature really works and Just like you

2615
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:01,290
know the method like Ken Wheeler says, you

2616
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:03,610
know, mother nature is not a crack whore

2617
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:08,050
with a calculator She doesn't nature doesn't nature

2618
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:09,170
doesn't do math.

2619
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:10,670
There is no math in nature.

2620
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:12,270
There are no numbers on a flower you

2621
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:15,010
can That's why I have always said math

2622
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,270
is nothing more than rational communication if you

2623
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:18,650
go into the store and you say I

2624
01:47:18,650 --> 01:47:21,410
need eggs The store people the clerks will

2625
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:21,910
look at you.

2626
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:23,430
They say yeah, we have eggs, you know

2627
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:25,130
That's the conversation ends right there.

2628
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,990
And if you say I need eggs again,

2629
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:29,170
they're gonna say this person's crazy But if

2630
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:30,170
you come in and say I need a

2631
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:31,670
dozen eggs, I'll say well here it is.

2632
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:32,430
Let's do it Good.

2633
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:33,430
You're rational now.

2634
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:35,890
You see you need to give them There's

2635
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:39,070
a need Eventually the more you elaborate on

2636
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:41,670
something there is a certain numeric or mathematical

2637
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:44,090
aspect to the conversation that's going to arise

2638
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:48,770
to form rationality That's why they they even

2639
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:51,770
have let's say a number chapter and verse

2640
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:54,510
on scripture because it's very rational If you're

2641
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,910
studying scripture to say go to Matthew 24

2642
01:47:57,910 --> 01:48:00,590
Matthew 24 verse 3, let's say right.

2643
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:01,150
It's very radical.

2644
01:48:01,450 --> 01:48:01,550
Boom.

2645
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:04,010
You go immediately and you can discuss that

2646
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:07,110
aspect of it When that's all you can

2647
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:09,550
do now, it just sounds like the McDonald's

2648
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:12,450
commercial to all be fatty special sauce, right?

2649
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:17,670
So so anyway Yeah, so then the bullet

2650
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:19,370
goes through like a piece of wood or

2651
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:21,130
whatever so on the because it has no

2652
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:24,130
potential, right yeah, no potential, but the front

2653
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:28,030
side is There is no front no back

2654
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:31,010
the bullet The bullet doesn't care whether it

2655
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:32,090
hits the front or the back.

2656
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:33,930
It's just that it hits the wood Again,

2657
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,230
stop thinking about the front.

2658
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:35,950
There is no front.

2659
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:39,170
Yeah What happens have you ever seen the

2660
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:41,970
the high speed like the 50 to 10

2661
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,730
,000 frame per second when a bullet heats

2662
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:44,390
a piece of steel?

2663
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:48,090
It vaporizes the steel on contact It turns

2664
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:50,430
into vapor right just like electricity you ever

2665
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,690
change a car battery with a wrench That's

2666
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:54,470
too long and you bridge the terminals by

2667
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:59,870
accident Not a happy situation And then you

2668
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:01,490
pick up the wrench and part of the

2669
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:03,250
wrench is gone But you'll never find it

2670
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:05,690
because it became a little miniature Hiroshima, right?

2671
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:12,530
Yeah Or a breaker box, you know Well,

2672
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:15,010
yeah, but a bus you ever seen somebody,

2673
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:17,850
you know changing a bus wire or something

2674
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,350
something heavy, you know I say bus it's

2675
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:21,950
a heavy piece of metal and shorting that

2676
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,890
out in the in the aftermath, you know

2677
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:26,110
And by the way, you ever you ever

2678
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:28,630
been around a very heavy-duty electrical short.

2679
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:30,370
It has that certain smell doesn't it?

2680
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:34,690
Yep Yeah, if you are out at the

2681
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:37,190
Nevada test sites when they were new doing

2682
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:39,530
the nukes or Hiroshima or nine or at

2683
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:42,130
September 11th in Manhattan, that's exactly the same

2684
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:46,530
smell you have So that what that tells

2685
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,910
you is atomic and nuclear and thermonuclear is

2686
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:53,510
nothing more than what electrical phenomenon not nuclear

2687
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:57,390
like they say or new or your Electrical

2688
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:59,670
stuff is nuclear a vice versa, right?

2689
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:02,870
Wow What do you think a highly dense

2690
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,730
metal ball?

2691
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:07,190
That's Purified very dense.

2692
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:09,370
The density of these radioactive materials is very

2693
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:12,810
high and All of a sudden, you know

2694
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:15,210
like the old trigger mechanisms that the did

2695
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,110
not the Germans develop I was gonna say

2696
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:19,910
Nazis, which was the rifle mechanism to get

2697
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:20,910
the uranium off.

2698
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:21,550
What did they shoot?

2699
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:22,610
They shoot a bullet?

2700
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:25,690
Literally down a rifle at a certain speed

2701
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:27,010
if it's too fast It won't work if

2702
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:28,830
it's too slow and work to create what

2703
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:30,670
they call a chain reaction to create to

2704
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:31,650
start the fission, right?

2705
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,030
That's how it started and then later on

2706
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:37,210
they got away from the rifle System and

2707
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:39,510
they decided to use implosion with reflectors.

2708
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,550
They said of having a bullet hit the

2709
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:45,210
mass they have Explosives formed in the form

2710
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:47,670
of a sphere It would like a cutting

2711
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:48,070
charge.

2712
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,470
It's directed inward and then you surround the

2713
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:53,050
whole thing with water That's that's why it's

2714
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,890
called a hydrogen bomb There's nothing to a

2715
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,830
hydrogens because they use water to increase the

2716
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:59,070
yield and then now that not not that

2717
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:01,110
is not only nuclear Now it's thermonuclear.

2718
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,010
It's assured.

2719
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:05,370
In other words guaranteed to create extreme heat

2720
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:09,090
around the environment All these is electrical phenomenon

2721
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:12,330
in the nuclear Armament and the nuclear devices,

2722
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:14,290
you know that they that detonate and by

2723
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:16,650
the way nuclear bombs and devices do not

2724
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:18,270
explode That's a misnomer.

2725
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:21,670
They detonate They've what they call the explosion

2726
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,890
or the aftermath depends on the environment the

2727
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:29,310
surroundings of the environment Right Right there what

2728
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:31,110
you call an explosion is because it's so

2729
01:51:31,110 --> 01:51:34,650
hot that the surrounding air go explodes Not

2730
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:37,250
the bomb the the device itself is in

2731
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:37,570
other words.

2732
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:39,410
These things are so simple and so miss

2733
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:44,890
They're thought of so poorly I'm giving that

2734
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,830
as an example not to talk about Atomics

2735
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:48,690
and nuclear how that stuff really works and

2736
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:50,950
what it is, but every subject is like

2737
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:56,550
that the misdirection the Keeping it concealed, you

2738
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,410
know, there's an art form to it and

2739
01:51:58,410 --> 01:52:00,310
obviously we're witness to it.

2740
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:03,490
Yes, there's a spiritual Aspect to it.

2741
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,430
Yeah, but anything that humans and when a

2742
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:08,610
human opens their mouth Stupid shit's gonna come

2743
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:09,690
out of it just to Matt, you know,

2744
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:13,820
you got to start filtering I mean, this

2745
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:15,280
is how you're gonna live your life on

2746
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,440
earth I think it's better to be ignorant

2747
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:22,740
and not paying attention Yeah discern Yeah, but

2748
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,280
you're gonna if you learn to discern and

2749
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,520
you could do that you're gonna be you're

2750
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,980
gonna find yourself isolated You know, you're back

2751
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,960
to that same story about the Persian and

2752
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,880
the water Exactly drink the cool.

2753
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:33,780
Would you rather know?

2754
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:37,060
Yeah, right Would you rather know and be

2755
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,900
unhappy or not know and be happy, right?

2756
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:44,740
It's good knowing Yeah, and there's always a

2757
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:46,640
group of people that are just downright evil

2758
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,380
and like I want to know and I

2759
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,820
know it's shitty then I want to jump

2760
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:53,720
back in and Be divisive and predatory and

2761
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,480
take advantage of these dumb fucks, right?

2762
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:56,600
Right.

2763
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:57,580
Voila.

2764
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:01,540
You've got attorneys doctors banking establishment government people.

2765
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:06,700
That's a priest rabbis There you go The

2766
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:10,440
number one Hmm You see, this is very

2767
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,100
simple man.

2768
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,180
Look if you have the attitude that you're

2769
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:16,620
just visiting taking notes The likes and dislikes

2770
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:20,320
of the inhabitants is irrelevant Yeah, whether you

2771
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,780
like something or dislike it is irrelevant is

2772
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:24,280
do you see it for what it is?

2773
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,360
You know and note it and note it

2774
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:26,860
as such.

2775
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:32,120
That's all that matters And it's very simple

2776
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:33,380
you could look at what they call New

2777
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:35,420
Testament writings even the Christ who was really

2778
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:39,520
the chief over this Creation as it is,

2779
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,960
you know the remodel he's like there's nothing

2780
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:41,480
here for me.

2781
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,180
There's nobody here for me Pretty fucked up

2782
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:45,700
over here.

2783
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,140
I have nothing here.

2784
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:49,320
No interest here as it is right now.

2785
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,540
I Mean don't you get that when you

2786
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,100
read, you know what he said and Joel

2787
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,880
But even the even the but the Christ

2788
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,340
really who was the you know, the Let's

2789
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,360
see chief administrator.

2790
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,820
He's like there's nothing here for me men

2791
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:13,580
places too screwed up everything everyone Yeah Some

2792
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:16,080
hard hard tea triple tea you gotta love

2793
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:16,400
it.

2794
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:19,840
Mm-hmm All right, Greek.

2795
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,980
Well, um, I got to get ready, but

2796
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,980
thank you so much Bruce.

2797
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:26,220
Thank you also as well you guys have

2798
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:31,580
an enjoyable night and Thanks for calling and

2799
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:41,340
then next week, okay I Thanks, all

2800
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:45,420
right, there's anything else some that's good to

2801
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:53,900
have another voice and I'll just Like that,

2802
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:55,980
okay, so I don't know if there's anything

2803
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:00,720
just go back into the office here Yeah,

2804
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:06,980
usually there isn't I think Mm-hmm What

2805
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:11,700
a fascinating discussion Okay, one of us you

2806
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:18,040
increase my research again Which will be which

2807
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:21,020
will be good I think enlightening myself is

2808
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:25,660
is definitely an intro Again, you know, are

2809
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:27,600
you you know, all right.

2810
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:30,460
Well Yeah, so so you enlighten yourself and

2811
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,060
now what you find yourself in a either

2812
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,380
either you do it in a way Now

2813
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:36,120
you're deeper.

2814
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:37,940
You see you're deeper in the shit or

2815
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:40,100
higher above it, you know, you gotta bring

2816
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:42,500
yourself higher I accept it for what it

2817
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:42,900
is out.

2818
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:44,920
There is on you know, I'm happy with

2819
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:47,360
with what I find out I you know,

2820
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,600
I don't let it get to well Let

2821
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,220
me just say this then I find it

2822
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:54,520
unacceptable So I have to isolate and insulate

2823
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,560
myself exactly exactly what is unacceptable.

2824
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:02,680
Yeah, I do that quite well Mm-hmm

2825
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:06,860
visitors are welcome and very rare So I'm

2826
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,900
well either way Well, you know and here's

2827
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,240
the thing the you know Just to like

2828
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,740
fresco when he did tutoring on art and

2829
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,180
other things.

2830
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,660
He wanted the most screwed up school children

2831
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:19,500
He didn't want the ones that did well

2832
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,660
All right.

2833
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:23,680
So in a sense Being around the most

2834
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,280
screwed up people in society is probably your

2835
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:29,120
only chance Yeah, because they haven't accepted but

2836
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:31,760
then again Some of them are so you

2837
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,360
can't polish a turd No, you see it's

2838
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,600
still a turd on the other end So

2839
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,200
some people are screwed up and it's meant

2840
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,300
for them to be screwed up.

2841
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:43,060
So either way You know, you have to

2842
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:45,660
use discernment again and don't let it don't

2843
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,780
take it personally The only thing you could

2844
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:49,440
take personally is that you run out of

2845
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,960
heartbeats you go to sleep and you wake

2846
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,520
up at the resurrection all those things You

2847
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,420
can take personally you can even take personally

2848
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:59,360
that you are incarnated in this manifestation now

2849
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,460
You can do that as well And live

2850
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:03,960
up to it and literally what I mean

2851
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,000
live up to it You mean don't let

2852
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,040
yourself be on the downside of it because

2853
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,500
that's what it's designed for or allowed to

2854
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,400
be right?

2855
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:17,200
So Okay, we'll be done for a while

2856
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:20,060

2857
