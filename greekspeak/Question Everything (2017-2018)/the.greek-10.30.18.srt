1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,080
And greetings folks, we're here with the Greek,

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,460
and how's it going tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,860
It's going.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,300
It's about the first, over a week into

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
the ninth month, in case people aren't aware

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,240
of it.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,980
Just past the Sabbath.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,500
And I'd say, yeah, it's the rainy season

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
in the Middle East, by the way.

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,700
Ninth month, you should remember, also for historic

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,240
events, the ninth and the tenth month biblically

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,660
are going to be, let's say, noted for

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,540
future events.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,560
And if you don't know what I mean,

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,060
or don't ask what, because all you've got

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,520
to do is get on the rectangle and

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,680
just put in Bible verses ninth month, or

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,520
Bible verses tenth month, and just do a

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,620
search on some Bible software, and you'll see

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,200
what I mean.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,600
Easy, right?

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,520
Yeah, so we don't have any questions or

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,840
anything, I figured you wanted to tell us

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,740
about coffee maybe?

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,340
Oh no, I was opting for my coffee,

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,880
and then I instead seen the container of

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,960
large water there, and I figured, oh, a

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,540
nice tall glass of water, and that'll be

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,020
much more refreshing anyway.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,720
Yeah, subject matter.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,820
What is it, these morons that do podcasts,

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,540
the internet, YouTube, all that, that's called content,

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:36,860
right?

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,620
Yes.

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,440
Instead of subject matter, that's what they do,

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,100
yeah, content, I guess it came from table

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,760
of contents.

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,140
So any questions out and about?

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm going to be going into the office

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,200
shortly.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,560
I did have, this past week we had

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,840
some stuff given to us by, what's your

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,660
handle here, 618 of, 618 the 7th-ish

44
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,880
of, yeah, and it had one in there

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,760
about the rangatangs being strapped down for sex,

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
and I immediately went back to one of

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,280
your old Sonics, and it was remembering you

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
taking the windy walk down the street in

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,100
the tent with the animals tied down, and

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,160
I thought, my goodness, how much things just

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,120
repeat, and keep on going on, and...

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
Well, it's always been going on, just like

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
it was back then, they were doing it

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
for over a thousand years, but even back

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,780
then, it's just that it's being put on

56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,880
the rectangle, which is a psyop, until, you

57
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,660
know, the rectangle's being used by the gods

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,680
also, to set man up.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,040
It's not a good thing at all.

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,040
No.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,840
No.

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah, when I say the gods, you know,

63
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,180
I'm talking about the ones that are, the

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,100
ones that when people say God, or they

65
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,940
think spirituality or religion, those are the ones

66
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,580
I'm talking about usually.

67
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,780
I never really discuss much about the Creator,

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,580
because no one knows anything about Him or

69
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,940
cares to, right?

70
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,460
It's very, I mean, let me just take

71
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,300
that, the last part, the latter part back.

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Some people do care, but when people bring

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,140
up the topic of spirituality wholesale, they don't

74
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,220
know that they're talking about the earthbound ones,

75
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,500
you know, like the sons of gods or

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,960
the ones that were, I call it the

77
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,680
patron and matron deities, right?

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,480
Those are the gods that we're talking about,

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,680
right?

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,060
Usually when I bring them up, yeah, I

81
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,600
tend to, you know, this is the dogma

82
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,200
that I entail in anything that I do,

83
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,540
which is I try to parallel it to

84
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:32,880
something.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
If I notice I have a dogma, I

86
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
try to find, is there a parallel to

87
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,760
what I do?

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,380
You know, a dogma means like rigid and

89
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,340
single way, means my way or the highway,

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,040
and in one way I'm kind of like

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,140
the conservative, rabbinical aspect of it, where you

92
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,760
don't share certain discoveries and certain things about

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,900
the Most High in public or with people,

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,080
unless they're already initiated, and there's nothing to

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,660
be initiated in, but other than you know

96
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,060
that it means something high, you know, high

97
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,460
order.

98
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,680
To be initiated really means to start, to

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,000
begin.

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,780
So maybe those that are initiated in the

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,600
concept of what the Most High is about,

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,700
you discuss with, you know, that's why I

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,519
think I bring up sometimes what the old

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
rabbinical sages wrote about Genesis, and they said,

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,340
well, there's a lot there, and if you're

106
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,100
a commoner, be happy with what you know,

107
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,000
but if you do know what Genesis really

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
holds, you don't tell people.

109
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,860
You know, I mean, you know, you don't,

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,180
you don't do it, and yeah, you discuss

111
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,500
it still, but not in public, right, right.

112
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,400
Another thing is what they call the, you

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,520
know, the father's name, the tetragamma tone or

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,840
written any other way, a very conservative person

115
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,440
wouldn't want it written or spoken, you know,

116
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,580
like, you know, because it's, it could, it

117
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,780
could easily be used disrespectfully.

118
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
So what I mean, when I say the

119
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,920
gods, I'm talking about the ones that are

120
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,820
not doing their jobs that are doing their

121
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,560
job as, as gods only, but they're not

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,900
doing their jobs from the beginning, obviously, and

123
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,040
those are the, that's the, you know, the

124
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,020
human mindset is based on what these gods

125
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,620
are projecting.

126
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,360
So, which is a very interesting subject in

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,260
itself, but you don't need me to tell

128
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,900
you because, you know, people say, let's not

129
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
go there, you ever heard that term when

130
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,340
people are in discussion, let's not go there,

131
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,940
Ocelli's does that a lot, you know, what

132
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,420
that the place where you don't want to

133
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,500
go is where it's obvious, the obvious stuff,

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,900
you don't want to, right, let's not go

135
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,400
there, right, means it means let's not discuss

136
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,060
what we should be discussing or what we

137
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,820
should know, but because it's right in front

138
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,480
of us, but we don't, right.

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,780
So yeah, it's interesting.

140
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,500
There is going to come a time where,

141
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,200
I don't know what, you know, I don't

142
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,440
know how to say this, but even if

143
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,480
you, let me just give it by example,

144
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,500
if you read in scripture, let's say the

145
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,300
book of Johan or John, the Christ even

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,120
says, look, I've shared a lot with you

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
in secret, right, right, right, he didn't say

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,540
go start a religion or he didn't share

149
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,000
anything with the people in public, he was

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,640
just making general proclamations based on what they

151
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,140
already knew about him.

152
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,500
Let me say that again.

153
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,500
When you read what they call the New

154
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,940
Testament, whenever the Christ speaks to people in

155
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,060
groups, public groups, or he just supports and

156
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,940
goes roundabout and within the conversation or what

157
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,140
he says regarding what they already know of

158
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,300
him, he doesn't disclose anything to them very

159
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,660
rarely.

160
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,260
And when he does, it's a parable.

161
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,840
Yeah, you see, you see, there's not, and

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
the stuff that you're reading in the New

163
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,260
Testament are the logs and the accounts and

164
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,600
the witnessing to this man, the Elohim in

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,420
the form of a man.

166
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,540
And it's not for anyone or everyone.

167
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,940
Like, for example, the New Testament doesn't really

168
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,480
apply to very few, so few people today

169
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,420
that it's not for you.

170
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,680
You know, many times have I said this,

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,940
these biblical writings are not for you.

172
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,900
It's about you and it's about what the

173
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,060
gods want, but they're not for you, that's

174
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,620
for sure.

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
But if you're curious and you want to

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
know what's going on, you know, like, for

177
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,640
example, when a building goes up, what's for

178
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,620
you is the door, the window, you know,

179
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,300
the, the directory, you know, what, yeah, the

180
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,060
space, the stairs and all that, going into

181
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,840
the blueprints of the building.

182
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,320
That is not for you.

183
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,460
No, right.

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,120
No, it's not.

185
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,100
Looking at the technical schematics and the specifications

186
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,720
on that is not for you.

187
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,040
Yes, you, whoever's listening, that is for a

188
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,200
very specific group of people, the architects, engineers,

189
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,080
the builders.

190
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
Right now at this time.

191
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,720
So and to prove myself right now, Bill,

192
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,520
facetious sarcasm, I've come out and given more

193
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
hints than anyone else has in the history

194
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,240
since any kind of whatever has been put

195
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,500
together in one place.

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,000
And no one at all other than you,

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,860
Bruce, you know, you've basically collected sonic events,

198
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
but no one has taken anything and developed

199
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,080
it.

200
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,840
You know why?

201
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,780
Because they can't.

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,620
Sorry, guys.

203
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,620
But anyway.

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,160
All right.

205
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,159
So let's continue.

206
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,200
Anything else going on?

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,860
You know, I think this comes back to

208
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,679
how do you be general enough to create

209
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,380
mindset?

210
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,420
Utilizing everything that's been given, you know, generously

211
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,380
from you.

212
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,860
And trying to relish that into a because

213
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,040
we live in a sitcom kind of society,

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,940
like you mentioned.

215
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,680
You are in what the attention span is,

216
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
what that of a cat?

217
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,760
Right.

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
It's very short or goldfish or goldfish.

219
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,920
They tap on the glass and they look

220
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,220
and then they run away in a nice

221
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,780
little way.

222
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,760
And, you know, so, you know, I've said

223
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,640
and I contemplated this many, many, many, many

224
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,180
times.

225
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,600
Even my my my tries of having conversations

226
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,700
with different people, very general, very small.

227
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
In passing, I'll forget.

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,820
Yeah, yeah, that's going to be very.

229
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,060
Yeah.

230
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,980
And I think that it's I see where

231
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,460
you come with the why bother?

232
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,040
Oh, yeah, that's but that's the that you

233
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,120
see, you talk about mastership when you get

234
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,860
to a mastership level, you do that.

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,040
Why bother anymore?

236
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll tell you why.

237
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,460
It's very simple, because you have to consider

238
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,100
the setting.

239
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,500
You know, like let's say you're the king's

240
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
roaster, you know, the king's head, you know,

241
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,700
the king's tail or the king's roaster.

242
00:09:59,700 --> 00:09:59,940
OK.

243
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,000
And you the king is no more.

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,220
It becomes a parliamentary whatever.

245
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,360
And you get thrown in with everybody else.

246
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,280
You're not going to roast things like you

247
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,860
did for the king.

248
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,360
Why bother?

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,220
These are like total, you know, these are

250
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,660
these are common oafs.

251
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, you just get a feeding trough,

252
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,800
whatever you put in and it's not easy

253
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,260
peasy.

254
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,120
Yeah.

255
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,720
Why bother?

256
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,220
Look at the the Star Wars characters.

257
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
I don't like to use that, but it's

258
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,580
very universal in the in the cultural meme.

259
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,240
Where did you find the Jedi?

260
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,860
You find what Jedi?

261
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,600
Where are they?

262
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,240
You know what?

263
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,040
And when you found them, what were they

264
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,380
doing?

265
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,220
Right.

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,800
Nothing.

267
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,720
Pretty much kicking.

268
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,540
Yeah, because not because they shouldn't do something

269
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,440
you shouldn't because why bother?

270
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
Because look what's going on around you, you

271
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,010
know.

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,400
At some point, these people will come up

273
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,280
with something that maybe is five minutes long.

274
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,880
Hopefully, you know, we'll have a rarefied cat

275
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,200
or something or a goldfish.

276
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,040
OK, well, look, here's the thing.

277
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,620
There's something about authentic, you know, there's a

278
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,140
guy, Daniel Estulin.

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,960
He's kind of funny.

280
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,120
He's he's our age.

281
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,800
He's a little younger, but he's written the

282
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,760
books on the Bilderbergers and all this stuff.

283
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,800
Estulin, S-E-S-T-U-L-I

284
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:16,900
-N.

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,460
And he did I listen to him.

286
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,060
I had found some notes on the Bilderberg

287
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,400
stuff that's not public, by the way, because

288
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,460
it's a long story.

289
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
I know someone who's involved with that, but

290
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,940
not in the group itself, but their organization,

291
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,460
like someone who does organizational work, you know,

292
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,360
for whatever.

293
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,500
So anyway, let me just cut to the

294
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,860
chase here.

295
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,480
So Daniel Estulin, he's getting interviewed.

296
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,220
It came up.

297
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,860
I said, OK, this guy's talking about, you

298
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,280
know, the reality is not how people think,

299
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,720
but he still doesn't know how the money

300
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,140
system works or anything like that.

301
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,220
It sounds to the uneducated that he does.

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,580
He doesn't.

303
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
He's pretty censored himself.

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,660
But he does.

305
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,040
He talks about the Internet and he talks

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
about the people on the Internet, you know,

307
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,340
how they just put out all their information

308
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,720
on Facebook, social media.

309
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,900
And even if they didn't, they don't have

310
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,140
one authentic creative thought in their whole lives.

311
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,920
And they're pretty, you know, useless lives, mediocrity,

312
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,320
you know.

313
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,420
And I'm like, oh, wow.

314
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,460
OK, good.

315
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,020
You know, I was very pleased to hear

316
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,060
that there's, you know, someone else being vocal

317
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,000
about the real reality of humanity.

318
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,440
Right.

319
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,640
Then you go to the new age assholes

320
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,480
and or whatever people that want the, you

321
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,160
know, the following.

322
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,360
They're like, oh, we got to do something.

323
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Say a few people are good.

324
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,520
Look at all these evil people.

325
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,880
No, people are not good.

326
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,360
Sorry.

327
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,140
Right.

328
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,600
They're not good.

329
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,760
At all, this is all very well deserved,

330
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,060
as a matter of fact, their humanity is

331
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,640
going to get to see what they deserve

332
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,840
later in about a decade plus, you're going

333
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,400
to you're going to get what you deserve,

334
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,780
which is population reduction by about 95 percent.

335
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,540
Is what you deserve of written thousands of

336
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,080
years ago, and if you don't know humanity,

337
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,040
you don't see it, if you know humanity,

338
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,080
you're like, oh, yeah.

339
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,960
This is totally in line, this is no

340
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,640
big deal.

341
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,380
Right.

342
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,300
So anyway, and it has nothing to do

343
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,860
with the numbers, because here's the thing, the

344
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,420
group that's going to be left over is

345
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,340
still going to be majority of shitsters or

346
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,480
scumbags, whatever you want to call people, you

347
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,540
know, it's still going to be but but

348
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,920
they're going to be that's a very controllable,

349
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,600
manageable group.

350
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,300
And even the group now could be manageable.

351
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,560
But the thing is, they're not going to

352
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,920
want to be they're going to just kill

353
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,680
each other off.

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
And they're going to get a little bit

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
of that before it happens.

356
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,320
So.

357
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,200
And the reason why I sound so rank

358
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,040
on humanity is because there's something called free

359
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
will, and it's pretty, you know, there's a

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,140
lot of arguments about it, I've given I've

361
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,220
given examples of how it works, not that

362
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,560
I know exactly how it works, but I

363
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,860
know more than anybody else, but excuse me,

364
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,180
or I've given enough on it that anyone

365
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,560
who does a study, what free will is,

366
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,540
you'll say when I say more than anybody

367
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,920
else, I mean, that's speaking, right?

368
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,520
I mean, they're sure somebody died a long

369
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
time ago, they did too.

370
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,660
And it's, it's just astonishing.

371
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,560
It's actually pretty embarrassing, even so you've heard

372
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,060
me say it's I'm embarrassed to say I'm

373
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,680
human, right?

374
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,020
Right.

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,660
At this.

376
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,680
Yeah, you couldn't imagine see, if you went

377
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,020
to find a species or a group, and

378
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,460
I said, this group will degrade to this

379
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,500
point, you'd say no way.

380
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,380
But you can see it around you, but

381
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,280
you don't notice it because you're in it.

382
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,640
And you were raised in it.

383
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
So again, that just to back to Daniel

384
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,000
Estelian, he's pretty rank on humanity also, in

385
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,440
a sense, but he's altruistic, you know, thinks

386
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,260
we got to do something.

387
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,280
No, you don't got to do anything, you

388
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,360
know, but you do you do.

389
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,080
Because you know, your your spirit, your soul

390
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
and your body and your body needs to

391
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,820
move to stay healthful, needs to do exercise

392
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,940
and all these other things.

393
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,940
So you do have to do stuff.

394
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,160
So when I say why bother, it's not

395
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,500
a it's within the the concept that we're

396
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,800
all communicating on the Internet, you know, very

397
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,520
rarely do I still write letters or speak

398
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,260
to people on the phone.

399
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,440
It's either a Skype thing or, you know,

400
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,320
or in person or on the rectangle.

401
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,600
So when I say why bother, it's it's

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,400
in contrast to what else you see on

403
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,460
the rect on the rectangle.

404
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,880
Right, right.

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Because you're going to bother about certain things,

406
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,740
you're going to be doing stuff.

407
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,220
Yeah.

408
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,680
I mean, like I'm sorting out various types

409
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,620
of wire and I have about 17 types

410
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,600
of wire and about 20 different forms and

411
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,980
I have to sort them out because you

412
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,200
can't just start putting wire together, this wire

413
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,880
gauge or whatever, because you have litz wire,

414
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,880
you have solid wire, you've got Teflon coated

415
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,380
litz wire, you know, litz wire is all

416
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,340
little strands are coated individually.

417
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:47,920
Right.

418
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,440
Have you seen that?

419
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:48,900
Yeah.

420
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah.

421
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah, silver wire, this is something like after

422
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,240
a while.

423
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,800
Yeah, if I say why bother, I got

424
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
a couple of boxes full of wire, you

425
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,840
know, it happens when you tug on it,

426
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,960
it's like spaghetti, get a big thing of

427
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,220
spaghetti, tug on one piece, you're not going

428
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,040
to take just one piece, it'll take a

429
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,320
little while, you'll have a good amount.

430
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,740
So I'm like, why bother?

431
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,080
Well, you have to bother, you know, there

432
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,380
are lots of things you have to do,

433
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,580
you know, brush your teeth.

434
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,960
I always give people recommendations.

435
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
If you're going to use a toothbrush, get

436
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,920
a baby toothbrush, because when you get these

437
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,340
adult toothbrushes, there are these long rectangles with

438
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,360
thick bodies and they keep knocking your gums

439
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,060
and other teeth.

440
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,460
But a little baby toothbrush or an infant

441
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,680
toothbrush is pretty square.

442
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,200
It's real small and it's usually soft and

443
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,540
you could get all the way into the

444
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,740
back with even pressure.

445
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,080
And also, you know, force, you know, pounds

446
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,800
per square inch.

447
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,400
This if you put the same amount of

448
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,820
pressure on a smaller surface, the same amount

449
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,760
of force on a small as a surface

450
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,460
decreases, the pressure goes up.

451
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,040
Right, right.

452
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,280
So, you know, if that's why you could

453
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,700
take a little 90 pound woman or 110

454
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,560
pound woman, 120 pound woman, put her in

455
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
high heel shoes.

456
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,440
That back heel has got a thousand pounds

457
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,380
per square inch.

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah, right.

459
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,960
Because it's about a tenth of a square

460
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,020
inch in area.

461
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,099
So you see, you're getting more.

462
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,819
So the baby.

463
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,099
Right.

464
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,060
So a baby toothbrush, the little tiny ones

465
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,260
that you get around, you can contour between

466
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,920
the teeth up and around the teeth, you

467
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,540
know, you get all the way in the

468
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,760
back.

469
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,540
You might take you a sleep.

470
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
It'll give you the illusion that you're taking

471
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,680
longer to brush the teeth.

472
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,180
And here's another example.

473
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,540
If you look at a lot of the

474
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,940
machine power toothbrushes, you know, the Sonicare or

475
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,460
whatever, they have very small heads on them.

476
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,580
You ever notice that?

477
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,460
And the more sophisticated the toothbrush, the smaller

478
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,900
the head.

479
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,700
No.

480
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,660
So why bother?

481
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,540
All right.

482
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,680
I've had some positive feedback.

483
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
People say, yeah, man, I switched to a

484
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,300
child's toothbrush or a baby, you know, an

485
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,200
infant toothbrush.

486
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,200
And my mouth feels cleaner.

487
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
I get a better job brushing.

488
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:51,820
Yeah.

489
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,800
I was like, OK, good.

490
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,920
Great.

491
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
I know somebody posted.

492
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,720
Haven't you noticed or something post someone posted

493
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,660
the thing about pedophilia on a TED talk.

494
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,400
It's funny.

495
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,860
Yes.

496
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,220
Yeah, I didn't watch it.

497
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,920
I just clicked on it.

498
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,680
But the lady giving the demonstration looked like

499
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,980
she was a victim of it or under

500
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,280
some kind of NK Ultra, which is a

501
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,140
form of torture.

502
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,200
Yeah, right.

503
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,120
There's just something off about that one.

504
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,660
And in the week before I was knocking

505
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,020
and the week before I was knocking, TED

506
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,440
talk is at a front for these organizations

507
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,460
that want to change you.

508
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Yeah, it's interesting.

509
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:29,720
Right.

510
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,060
So, oh, someone once said, don't hope the

511
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,700
Greek doesn't say it because it usually comes

512
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,060
true.

513
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, you have a try.

514
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,940
Any questions, anything venting about or see, maybe

515
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,820
one day post about how you had two

516
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,500
serious injuries at work.

517
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,780
Did the towel and wrapped it and very

518
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,880
positive feedback.

519
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,040
A week later, I was amazed because it

520
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,820
was serious cut down to the blood vessel

521
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,500
after a week.

522
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,320
Looked like nothing.

523
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,440
Right.

524
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,540
More shorter.

525
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,560
Three days.

526
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,320
Yeah, it looked like it looked like a

527
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,900
paper cut.

528
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,500
It'll be completely healed in a week.

529
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,740
Yeah.

530
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,000
Yep.

531
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,120
All right.

532
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,600
The TED talk was an interesting one.

533
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,700
Oh, yeah, it's just rubbish.

534
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,500
It's all rubbish, but they are putting it

535
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,180
out in the in the face more than

536
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,360
that.

537
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,860
You know, it's kind of something you notice

538
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,000
with the over the period of time is

539
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,260
how they control the masses, how they just

540
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,200
keep easily bringing it up, bringing it up.

541
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,720
And after a while, they're almost in a

542
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,000
hypnotic state to it or some crap, you

543
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,160
know, and the stuff on the Internet is

544
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,340
like what cattle probably have in their minds.

545
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,100
It's like very few cattle complain about this

546
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,060
being slaughtered.

547
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,920
Right, right.

548
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,960
They don't know what's going on, but I'm

549
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,780
sure they have some kind of a dialogue,

550
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,640
communal or internal as cattle, because, you know,

551
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,300
here's the thing.

552
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,460
If people, you know, one time in the

553
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,500
mid after the medieval ages, they taught they're

554
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,740
trying to tease aside, quote unquote, natural philosophers

555
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,760
or the ones that worked for the state

556
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,700
or the monarchy or the church, try to

557
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,700
convince people animals have no emotion, which is

558
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,500
not true at all.

559
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,080
Right.

560
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,420
And they're just dumb beasts.

561
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,320
And they're not.

562
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,120
I mean, they like if anyone's been around

563
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,180
cattle or cows, let's say they're very distinct

564
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,100
in their personality.

565
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,400
Well, they also have face recognition.

566
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,680
They recognize faces and they will.

567
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,580
You once you get to know that, you'll

568
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,460
see that they need to see your face

569
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,660
to right to figure out who you are

570
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,620
and don't actually move around.

571
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,620
Yeah.

572
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,040
And also for most animals do face recognition,

573
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,240
by the way.

574
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,660
Yeah.

575
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,400
And so.

576
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,920
In essence, if you look at the human

577
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,060
livestock, they do face recognition.

578
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,940
And if you want to know what that

579
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,540
cattle group is thinking, go on the you

580
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,900
know, go to church, go to where they

581
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,320
work.

582
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,000
Listen to them.

583
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,620
Look at their newspapers.

584
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,240
Look at their universities.

585
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,240
Look at the rectangle.

586
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,840
I mean, it's garbage, really.

587
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
You know, slop straight up.

588
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,160
So but, you know, that's OK.

589
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,320
Why bother?

590
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,280
You don't have to be a part of

591
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,380
it.

592
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,480
You might pass through it and mingle with

593
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,860
it, but you don't have to be of

594
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:22,960
it.

595
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,520
Yeah.

596
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
You can always clean your shoes.

597
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,360
So I don't think there's much going on.

598
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
A lot of the e-mails I get,

599
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,080
believe it or not, lately, you can keep

600
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,560
sending them.

601
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,900
It's fine.

602
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,000
Some of them are extremely personal, as if,

603
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,800
you know, I need to what I used

604
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,080
to do.

605
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
I used to get on Skype calls and

606
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
people used to just come up with any

607
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,680
do they need advice.

608
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,000
Right.

609
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,600
Right.

610
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
And I'm talking about serious stuff.

611
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

612
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,800
Listen, you got to send me your contact

613
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,640
information so I know where to send the

614
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,660
bill, because this kind of therapy, you know,

615
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,480
usually, you know, you go to, you know,

616
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,240
these people that charge thousands.

617
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah.

618
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,000
So I'm not going to I don't I'm

619
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,860
not anyone's psychiatrist or priest or therapist.

620
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,860
I don't mind getting them.

621
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,480
Actually, I do.

622
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,460
But but in other words, if you need

623
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,920
if you're compelled to send me a very

624
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,580
personal help thing or something very personal, you

625
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:15,960
may.

626
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,920
I don't I don't I don't really need

627
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,600
to know because I'm not in that position.

628
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,460
You see, I'm not your friend also.

629
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,680
Right.

630
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm friendly.

631
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,580
Right.

632
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,140
You're acquainted with Greek speak.

633
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,500
Right.

634
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm not apathetic to it, but I just

635
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
don't want to I'm not a part of

636
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,540
it and I don't want to be a

637
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,540
part of it because the amount of work

638
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,380
it takes to get in to get involved

639
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,220
with people personally is just that amount, a

640
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,200
good amount of work.

641
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,880
You can't just give an answer.

642
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,020
The best way to do it is to

643
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,100
form a working relationship on an issue, whatever

644
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,760
it is.

645
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,980
Right.

646
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,720
Right.

647
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,140
So you'd hate to be responsible.

648
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
And I'm not going to do it.

649
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,520
I mean, the minimum for that is one

650
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,540
hundred and fifty an hour.

651
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,200
So, you know, the minimum.

652
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,280
So I'm not going to, you know, and

653
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,080
it's sadly to say I'm far more effective

654
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,180
than these other professionals that exist.

655
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,300
But you're not going to you know, you're

656
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,580
not going to succeed in the with the

657
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,320
entitled classes.

658
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,440
If you go to an attorney, a shrink

659
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
or a doctor, they're not going to they

660
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
don't know what they're doing.

661
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,740
How do I know?

662
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,300
Because I know enough if you're going to

663
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,760
a shrink.

664
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,780
Yeah.

665
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,980
So anyway, nothing on the emails I see.

666
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,000
So maybe we'll just cut it short.

667
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,800
All right.

668
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,560
Stuff to do.

669
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,540
So, yeah, nice talking with you again.

670
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,060
It was good.

671
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah.

672
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,100
Yeah.

673
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,840
We'll do it again next week then.

674
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,440
All right, everyone.

675
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,740
You take care.

676
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,340
Good night.

677
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,180
Take care.

678
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,420
Bye.

679
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,700
Thanks.
