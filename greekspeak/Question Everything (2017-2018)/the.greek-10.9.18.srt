1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,740
Greetings folks, we're live with the Greek.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,340
And how you doing tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,880
Greetings.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Doing.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,240
Yeah, as usual.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,500
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,640
Another week has gone by.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,780
I'm reckoning that's around the 16th or so

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,360
of the 8th.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,200
Is that close enough for you guys?

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,480
Yes, I believe so.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,060
Yes.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,660
Yeah.

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,200
Yeah.

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,860
Thereabouts.

16
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,700
16th.

17
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:31,920
Yes.

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,460
Yeah, thereabouts might even be.

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah, I would say possibly the 17th, but

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,820
around the 16th.

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,360
Whether you're doing what they call Sunday, Monday

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,220
as the Sabbath.

23
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,720
Right.

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,640
Where is it?

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,440
Monday, Tuesday.

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Right.

27
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,380
So if it's Sunday, Monday, it would be

28
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,800
the 17th.

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:52,980
Right.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,720
So Monday to be this.

31
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,220
It would be early 17th, depending on where

32
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,620
you are.

33
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,540
Mm hmm.

34
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,780
Interesting book you had there that you posted.

35
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,220
I just got the audio book regarding.

36
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,140
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,180
I spring regarding that today.

38
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,600
OK.

39
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,480
Wow.

40
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,020
That's something I did about 10 years ago.

41
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,460
I was looking into because this guy, Joe

42
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,740
Blankenship, was alive.

43
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,940
I could say he was a mentor to

44
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,560
a certain degree, but we hung around for

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,260
about a decade.

46
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,320
But after the first year, he was learning

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,740
more from me than I was from him,

48
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,920
even though he's twice my age.

49
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,020
But I know that sounds cocky.

50
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,420
But but he had this Joe Blankenship.

51
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,280
You spell it as this is a three

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,900
hour video where he's talking about his life

53
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,500
experiences.

54
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,340
He's done a lot of stuff in the

55
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,120
Southwest and in the West Coast.

56
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,240
Him and his brother got into a lot

57
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,080
of trouble doing just stuff in ingenious ways.

58
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,860
Yeah.

59
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,480
I got stories from that that he's told

60
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,720
me and and backed it up.

61
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,640
Yeah.

62
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,660
But his family has come from a family

63
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,360
of many brothers born in the 20s and

64
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,139
30s, and they all came down with polio.

65
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,100
And it wasn't polio at all, obviously.

66
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,560
Right.

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,040
Right.

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,580
Right.

69
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,020
Yeah.

70
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,780
So that stories about that.

71
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,480
And he knew there was something wrong with

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,620
that.

73
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,340
But he went along with the program because,

74
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,620
you know, when you're when you're really young

75
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,360
adolescent and you have a question, you ask

76
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,860
your parents.

77
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,160
Right.

78
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,880
Right.

79
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,040
There's no there's no Google or whatever.

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,620
So, yeah.

81
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,320
So you ask your parents and then they

82
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,180
go and ask the doctor who is clueless

83
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,640
also.

84
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,740
So, you know, whatever.

85
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:35,880
Right.

86
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,560
So.

87
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,800
But there were during that time period.

88
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Oh, I would say as late as the

89
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,140
early as the 50s, as late as the

90
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,960
late 50s.

91
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,460
A panel of doctors at Congress talking about

92
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,380
the spring of insecticides is the cause of

93
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:49,820
polio.

94
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,860
You know, actually, this said that there's no.

95
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,080
Yeah.

96
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,600
But it's such a bizarre world.

97
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
So what else did you get?

98
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,180
Did you get a book?

99
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Oh, God.

100
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,740
It's this country's a waste field from the

101
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,040
way it's way it's described and the toxicity

102
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,980
of everything.

103
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,440
I agree.

104
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,400
It unnerved me more.

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,220
I went to it just because it was

106
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,360
the amount of information.

107
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,960
Number one, which seemed she did a lot

108
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
of grunt work, that girl.

109
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,900
And yes, she did.

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah.

111
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,720
But it's a testament to the to the

112
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,160
robustness of the human body, how much punishment

113
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,940
it can take.

114
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,500
Yeah.

115
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,860
That's why the only way to really bring

116
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,420
the species down in, you know, is is

117
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,060
through psychological, spiritual, you know, where they start

118
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,580
killing each other and poisoning each other more

119
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,100
deliberately.

120
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,180
Good goal at that going.

121
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Oh, yeah.

122
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,360
Yeah.

123
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,860
Oh, yeah.

124
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,200
A supermarket food.

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Yeah.

126
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,580
All pharmaceuticals, media.

127
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,140
Oh, you know, I think I've talked briefly

128
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,480
about how the chemical stuff is part of

129
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,520
the goddess religion that, you know, you can

130
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,920
see it.

131
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,560
Because it's the gender bending and even throughout

132
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,800
all cultures, the sorcerers or the ones, you

133
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,300
know, typically had wizards and witches mixing toxic

134
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,120
brews and things.

135
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:12,780
Right.

136
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,519
Typically, women were the poisoners, you know, to

137
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,240
administer it.

138
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,800
But this is not on a gender basis,

139
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,079
on a human gender basis.

140
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,380
This is on a spiritual basis as well.

141
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,700
She's into that, whatever it takes to distort

142
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,020
everything and take credit for it through through

143
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,460
justice.

144
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,600
Working overtime.

145
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,000
So, yeah, I used to, you know, I

146
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,580
never here's interestingly, I never got into activism

147
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,640
in terms of save the environment or the

148
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,780
vaccines, you know, causing, you know, destroying the

149
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,560
children and all that.

150
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Fortunately, I studied scripture before I got I

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,660
studied that stuff, it almost in parallel.

152
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,580
So I knew, but from studying scripture from

153
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,740
an objective point of view, that the chief

154
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,540
God is going to come in and clear

155
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,560
out all the other gods.

156
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,920
Right.

157
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,540
Right.

158
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,540
But, you know, just like any political thing,

159
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,200
you have the people are too hardened to

160
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,560
repent.

161
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,800
So they have to go also.

162
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,180
Right.

163
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,160
So like when when you have to get

164
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
rid of a leader, you have to get

165
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,980
rid of the people as well, you know.

166
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
So the people have to go.

167
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
So how is that going to be done?

168
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,880
Well, you know, toxification.

169
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,020
Then I started realizing being around people actually

170
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,800
that had babies when I started studying now

171
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,100
that they're almost 20.

172
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,500
I realized that there turned out to be

173
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,940
scumbags just like their parents.

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,740
Not exactly a carbon copy.

175
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,180
But you know what I mean, right?

176
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,920
Almost the same.

177
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,600
So it's like, oh, it makes total sense

178
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,820
that they should toxify the children with vaccines

179
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,480
and all that.

180
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,480
Because it's not that the children are innocent.

181
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
It has nothing to do or guilty of

182
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,960
the innocent people.

183
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,080
How do they know who's innocent?

184
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,940
It's a numbers game.

185
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,380
And it's a it's a statistical, again, thing

186
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,820
where if the gods are going to go

187
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,940
and the people are being led by these

188
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,240
gods, the people got to go.

189
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
Because they're not going to go look at

190
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,400
your average religious person.

191
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,520
They don't study anything.

192
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
They don't know what's going on.

193
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,720
The real reality, you know.

194
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,080
Right.

195
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,020
So it's it's yeah, it's just a thing

196
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,860
you have to look at.

197
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,880
And don't go for the do it for

198
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,760
the children stuff.

199
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,660
They're just little people.

200
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
It's either people or not people.

201
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,720
You know, it's either people or not people.

202
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,340
You know, don't pull the children heartstring sympathy

203
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,960
bullshit, because they're just little miniature people are

204
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,300
going to grow up to be scumbags like

205
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,060
the bigger people.

206
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,640
So in general sense.

207
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:39,880
Right.

208
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,560
Right.

209
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,300
So the reason why I use that term

210
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,720
scumbag, it's an old Navy term.

211
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
I mean, someone who's new and doesn't know

212
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,540
what's going on kind of thing.

213
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,100
Right.

214
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,000
But you could use it.

215
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,580
However, you know, you know, they go from

216
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,500
scumbags to morons to professional assholes to professional

217
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,060
assholes.

218
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,760
Basically a typical human at this point.

219
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,100
It's about as misanthropic as you can get

220
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,640
on the Internet.

221
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,560
But either way, all this stuff makes perfect

222
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,820
sense, by the way.

223
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,840
Once you understand the big scheme, it just

224
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,580
doesn't mean, you know, the choices.

225
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,740
Is it for you or not?

226
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
You know, meaning you personally and your family,

227
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,700
let's say.

228
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,120
But the rest of them screw them.

229
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,880
That's this is this is made for them.

230
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
In other words, if it's not made for

231
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,300
you, it's made for someone else.

232
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,640
Right.

233
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,040
Right.

234
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,720
Just like when you go to buy clothing

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,580
or a car or whatever, you know, it's

236
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,860
not.

237
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,380
Well, you know what?

238
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,540
Do you have it in another color?

239
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:33,960
Why?

240
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,580
You saw lots of those.

241
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,320
Well, that color is not for me.

242
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Right.

243
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,240
So it wasn't made for you in the

244
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
first place if you're not going to buy

245
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:40,860
it.

246
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,400
So it is a personal preference, you know,

247
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,180
and you separate yourself.

248
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,200
But the problem is you can't separate yourself

249
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,180
if you're an activist.

250
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,400
No, no, you can't.

251
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,740
You have to be into it.

252
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,020
Yeah.

253
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,200
Got to have your feet all the way

254
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,360
in.

255
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,440
Yeah.

256
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,580
That's a waste of time.

257
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,220
Activism.

258
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,420
Complete waste of time.

259
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,840
It belongs in the East.

260
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,560
Mm hmm.

261
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,220
I came up with that a long time

262
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,480
ago.

263
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,280
I was doing a sonic with some moron

264
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,820
out there and I opened the fridge to

265
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,620
get milk for coffee.

266
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,980
And I have some Red Star and Fleischmann's

267
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
yeast because I make my own bread.

268
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:21,780
Sure.

269
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,780
And it said active.

270
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,920
And I was like, oh, yeah, it's yeast.

271
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,360
That's about the only fundamental aspect of activism.

272
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,200
Right.

273
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:29,920
Yeah.

274
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,960
OK.

275
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,380
Yeah.

276
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,400
Any questions on the I'm not in front

277
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,419
of the computer right now.

278
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,679
We'll be sure to see anything going on

279
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,480
or nothing, really.

280
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,020
I mean, I know there's an email with

281
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,600
a lot of questions on it.

282
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,140
Keep them anonymous somewhere regarding previous sonics.

283
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,520
I think I did with Ocelli a couple

284
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,660
other things I mentioned.

285
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,640
I could actually answer most of the stuff

286
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,540
on the email without looking at it.

287
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,500
I also gave props to the gentleman that

288
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,620
was made the Greek speak dot com audio

289
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,000
boy.

290
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,680
His name was very nicely done or very

291
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,280
well done.

292
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,280
You should you should know who that is.

293
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
But I don't think I do.

294
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,700
I just haven't.

295
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah, I don't I don't endorse anything, by

296
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,240
the way.

297
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,040
Not even the chat or not even the

298
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,360
website.

299
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,800
I do.

300
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,660
There are people want to do it.

301
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,060
That's great.

302
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm just surprised that it's being done somehow

303
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,860
to the point where, you know, it looks

304
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,200
like it might look good, like someone's putting

305
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
enough behind it.

306
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,520
So and it comes up right away in

307
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,740
searches, which is good.

308
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,860
Gets it right out there.

309
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,460
Very well done.

310
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:36,980
OK.

311
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,120
At least somebody is getting it all, which

312
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,380
is good.

313
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,260
You know, here's the thing.

314
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,260
There's enough people that have heard it and

315
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,100
actually done something with great speak that if

316
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,400
it were all end right now, it would

317
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,940
be a very high resultant factor.

318
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,540
You know, considering all of it.

319
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,020
I think there's over 50 or 100 people

320
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,420
that have actually done something they wouldn't have

321
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,340
done before or stop doing what they were

322
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,920
doing before either way because of Greeks.

323
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,580
So that's a lot more than anything that's

324
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,260
ever been done before in terms of the

325
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,520
real stuff, you know.

326
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:09,860
Right.

327
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,660
Versus the bullshit, you know.

328
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,060
Yeah.

329
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,820
It's basically food, clothing, shelter.

330
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,580
Yeah.

331
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,080
That's the bottom line.

332
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,100
Yep.

333
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,340
And remember, one third of the Earth's population

334
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,440
is fixed on scamming and pranking you.

335
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,180
So if, you know, basically one out of

336
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,640
three people you'll meet can't be trusted right

337
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,600
off the bat, not because of their character.

338
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,180
Well, their character has developed, but because of

339
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,780
their upbringing, their grooming, their mentality, their mindset.

340
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,600
Right.

341
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,060
And the other third are just, you know,

342
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
walking space heaters.

343
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,680
And the other third, you know, you might

344
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,240
be able to relate to on a very

345
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,260
superficial level.

346
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,120
That's a really bad profile for a population

347
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,260
on a planet, by the way.

348
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
One third being completely worthless, one third optional,

349
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,840
and one third being totally hell-bent on

350
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,260
pranking.

351
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,640
That's not a very good place to be,

352
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,260
by the way.

353
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,660
No, no, not either way.

354
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,460
Yeah.

355
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,260
Yeah.

356
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,100
Not very good.

357
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,580
But that's why, you know, there's no changing

358
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,180
it because the, in other words, the strength

359
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,320
of numbers and the strength of the, what

360
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,700
do you call it when someone's convinced of

361
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,080
something?

362
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,680
Conviction.

363
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,380
Right.

364
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,840
Behind this, what I just mentioned is so

365
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,640
strong, you know, the worthless ones versus the

366
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,980
optional ones versus the, not versus, but, you

367
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,020
know, along with the pranksters.

368
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,860
Their convictions are so strong that any form

369
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,820
of remediation or whatever is totally, you know,

370
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,520
futile.

371
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,760
So you have to navigate that way.

372
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,000
And, you know, the best is when you

373
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,600
get a concentration of the more positive, which

374
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,020
would be the optional ones, the ones that

375
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,440
have some sensibility and sensitivity.

376
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,440
You know, a disproportionate.

377
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,640
You don't want a proportionate slice of humanity.

378
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,500
Yeah, that would be the best way to

379
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,760
go.

380
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,360
So, anything else going on in the chat

381
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,640
there?

382
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,100
Not really what's seen here.

383
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,180
I can run past.

384
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,340
We had some music in there.

385
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,080
OK, well, on the email, from what I

386
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,740
recall, one of the initial questions was regarding

387
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,020
on the Ocelli thing I mentioned.

388
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,220
You know, why don't you look through a

389
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,980
crystal and see if you could see anything

390
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,140
latched onto your body, right?

391
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,580
Right.

392
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,200
And in the email, it was sort of

393
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
like a little bit going into that the

394
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,060
crystal that I somehow suggested was used for

395
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,860
healing purposes.

396
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,840
It's optical purposes only.

397
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,460
I never suggested that it would be for

398
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,400
any form of healing.

399
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
And that's what the New Agers do.

400
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
It's purely optical.

401
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,820
If you go back in history, quartz was

402
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,720
used for optics.

403
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,600
They're finding highly polished quartz telescope lenses all

404
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
over the world now.

405
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,520
But they're not reporting on it.

406
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,140
You could look it up.

407
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,100
I think the last one was a month

408
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,820
ago, somewhere in the Middle East.

409
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,440
And the one before that was somewhere in

410
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,480
Northern Europe, like the Vikings had telescopes.

411
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,000
I mean, like the stuff that Galileo would

412
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
have had or Newton, right?

413
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,700
Are you up to par with that or

414
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,940
better?

415
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,640
Yeah.

416
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,500
There's no healing.

417
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,340
So, part of the email was about, you

418
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,780
know, these people talking about using it for

419
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,060
healing.

420
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,780
It turns gray.

421
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,380
You can't use it.

422
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:29,820
No, no, no.

423
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,580
It's purely for optical.

424
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,160
Because I've said several times, you only see

425
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,800
what you see because it's coming and activating

426
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,060
a fleshy eyeball.

427
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:41,900
Right.

428
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
Spiritual beings don't have fleshy eyeballs, so they

429
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
can't see a red stop sign like you

430
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,540
do.

431
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,760
Right.

432
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,620
We don't know what they see unless they

433
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,060
tell us.

434
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,820
But they are able to communicate with us

435
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,320
about what we see because they somehow are

436
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,400
able to receive that.

437
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,760
Right.

438
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,780
So, in terms of healing and mitigating illness

439
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,120
or demonic oppression, which most illnesses are, by

440
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,660
the way, if I were to say all

441
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,880
illnesses are demonic oppression, it would be kind

442
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,360
of, I think, overboard.

443
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,740
But you could safely say that, by the

444
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:16,940
way.

445
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,340
But demonic oppressions and illnesses, crystals have absolutely

446
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,840
nothing to do with mitigating the condition at

447
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:23,960
all.

448
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,360
So that was the first several points in

449
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,300
the email about using them for that.

450
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,020
You can't.

451
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,020
Because we study the ancient writs again, healing

452
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,860
is done by another entity, and it's the

453
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,060
creator who sends it, right, or relieves you

454
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,980
of the oppressor.

455
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,660
Right.

456
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,880
So it has nothing to do with healing

457
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,220
at all.

458
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,780
So most of that part of that email

459
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,460
is moot regarding that.

460
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,220
I just wanted to address it that way

461
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,820
that, you know, again, very often I say

462
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,540
people are, you know, they try to listen

463
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,440
to what I'm saying, but you have to

464
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,740
match it up to what they've already learned,

465
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,620
and very often it's contrary to that.

466
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,280
Right.

467
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,580
And they store it as if I had

468
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,720
said something they already heard about, and it

469
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,480
wasn't at all.

470
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,240
Interesting that you could do that with a

471
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,800
crystal, though.

472
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,400
That still amazes me.

473
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,780
Well, any form of you could do it

474
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,080
with infrared and ultraviolet cameras as well.

475
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,020
Interesting.

476
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,140
Because you're not using the standard receptor of

477
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,540
the eye.

478
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,320
Right.

479
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,780
The standard visible light, anything that prevents, anything

480
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,280
that it prevents, anything that allows you to

481
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,560
see a spectrum, spectra, the visible, normal visible

482
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,260
light, meaning bright light and dim light or

483
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,280
whatever, you know, like, for example, a manipulation

484
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,840
of that would be looking through a form

485
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,680
of quartz, which is crystal, which is not

486
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,360
glass, which is liquid, by the way.

487
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,900
Yes, glass is a liquid, you know, even

488
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,460
though it appears to be solid, it acts

489
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,000
like a liquid.

490
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
That's why you have antique glass at the

491
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,660
cathedrals.

492
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
It's thicker at the bottom than it is

493
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
at the top because it's flowing, right?

494
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,260
Right.

495
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,660
So the aspect of using ultraviolet and infrared,

496
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,300
sonogram is another way to do it.

497
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,360
It doesn't mean that you're going to have

498
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,540
success with any of those.

499
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,420
It is just something that I brought up

500
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,960
with Chuck.

501
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,760
Because I always like here, I call it

502
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,060
picking on pagans, P-P, P-O-P,

503
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,420
pop.

504
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,860
These guys that think that they're, you know,

505
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,960
most people say that they're pagan or whatever

506
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
because they just don't want to be part

507
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,820
of the mainstream, but they don't know anything

508
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,580
any more than, it's a pop culture type

509
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:29,800
thing.

510
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,220
They're pretty ignorant.

511
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Paganism is just deifying the material world.

512
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,240
That's all it is, it's materialistic.

513
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,820
I never got into talks about that because

514
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,080
why?

515
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,120
People are immersed in it.

516
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,060
You want me to tell you what you're

517
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,300
doing?

518
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah, we could.

519
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
You know, you meaning what's in the society.

520
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,500
Right.

521
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,660
They're just materialists.

522
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,840
They don't know anything about the spiritual world

523
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,540
unless they're ready to do barter with some

524
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:54,820
demon.

525
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,980
You know, I'll do this for you, you

526
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,920
do this for me, right?

527
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,800
It's an exchange.

528
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,579
So, but that's more on the evolved end

529
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,359
because now they're actually tampering.

530
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,540
You know, the word to be utilitarian and

531
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,520
to be tampering on camera looks the same.

532
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,280
You know, utilitarian means you're doing it the

533
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,099
right way, tampering is you're not, right?

534
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:20,780
Right.

535
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,680
You know, like they have tamper-proof seals

536
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,500
on a, let's say, bottle of something, you

537
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,000
know, medicine.

538
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,319
Why?

539
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,240
You're not supposed to open it anyway?

540
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,480
Of course you're supposed to open it and

541
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,900
take it.

542
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,520
But tampering is when it's done in a

543
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,340
way that it's not supposed to be done.

544
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,100
Right.

545
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,600
Malicious.

546
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,080
So the best a pagan is going to

547
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
do is tamper with the spiritual world and

548
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,500
they're ignorant.

549
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
So that's actually what the word means.

550
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
Not a good combination to be doing that.

551
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh, no.

552
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,800
So I always like to bring up stuff

553
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,840
like that just to contrast what real knowledge

554
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,340
is versus the pop stuff that people are

555
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,360
spewing out of their mouth.

556
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,760
Yeah.

557
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,380
Not because I have real knowledge, but, well,

558
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,100
first of all, well, I do only because

559
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm not as lazy as the rest.

560
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,320
You know, you have to work on it.

561
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
You have to work on a principle, then

562
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,000
you have to work on what's been memorialized

563
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,220
about it, and then you have to see

564
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,660
if it matches.

565
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,540
And not make it match, not whittling anything

566
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,820
down, just seeing if it fits.

567
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,580
Right.

568
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,160
So another one of the questions from memory,

569
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,740
I should go into the office soon here,

570
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,460
is that regarding, I think, towards the bottom

571
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,580
was, it's very interesting, I remember the top

572
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,420
of the email and the bottom of the

573
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,580
email, underground bases and things like that.

574
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,080
I guess DUMBs, D-U-M-Bs are

575
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,000
underground bases, right?

576
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,280
Right.

577
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:39,720
Right.

578
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,980
Back in the East Coast, like in the

579
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,060
area of Brooklyn, there's DUMBO, which is the

580
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,480
Down Under Manhattan Bridge Organization, right?

581
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
It's an area, but when I see that,

582
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,860
I have to remember which one it is.

583
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,860
But there's a fellow up in Breckenridge, Colorado,

584
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,380
actually, I'm not going to say anymore because

585
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,720
I just narrowed it down really well, that

586
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,840
is involved, it still is, making underground bases.

587
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,280
And since the late 90s, they're building them,

588
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,440
they, you know, the owners of the governments

589
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,200
via the government, because you're going to use

590
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
government slaves, right?

591
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,020
Right.

592
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,520
So when you want to make mud bricks,

593
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,220
you use pharaoh's slaves, let's say.

594
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,220
They've been building them nonstop every year at

595
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,060
a rate of 3 million square feet per

596
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,300
year, like very deep underground, you know, miles,

597
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,500
you know, a mile plus.

598
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,280
There was an article about who controls underneath

599
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,420
the ground, and it was a topic.

600
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,020
Don't want to know.

601
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,100
Yeah.

602
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
And I think it was very well done.

603
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,040
Yeah.

604
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,100
It was very well done.

605
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,960
Well, they're guided by real knowledge that you

606
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
shouldn't be on the surface based on the

607
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,880
conditions.

608
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,180
But they've somehow evaded the aspect that if

609
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,580
you do that to evade the conditions on

610
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,020
the surface, you still won't survive.

611
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,920
Actually, you'll wish you were on the surface.

612
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Enormous operation.

613
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh, my God.

614
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,780
Oh, yeah.

615
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,680
Oh, yeah.

616
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,900
Serious, serious stuff.

617
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,960
When they're digging underground, they'll break through tunnels

618
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,820
that were built prehistoric anyway.

619
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,680
I mean, big, large ones.

620
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,740
Right, right.

621
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,600
Yeah.

622
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:25,260
So, no, in terms of the mentality, the

623
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,300
mindset is that every day is your last

624
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,560
without the panic, right?

625
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,380
Right.

626
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,520
Because, in other words, there's no future in

627
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,240
the stuff that you've been told the future

628
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,000
is about.

629
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,500
In other words, futurism, where you have a

630
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,540
progressive culture that evolves into higher forms of

631
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,320
existence, that's not going to happen.

632
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,040
It's been all downhill since before Victorian times.

633
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,080
By the way, has anyone looked into what

634
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,840
was going on with Victorian?

635
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,580
Yes.

636
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,040
I saw a couple of videos on the

637
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,520
servers about the Victorian servants.

638
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,260
There was a BBC documentary.

639
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,980
It was filled with a little Brown 25

640
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,440
in there.

641
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,700
But the overall discourse of the conversation was

642
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,580
very well done, gave a lot of history.

643
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,220
It was in a good time.

644
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,080
Well, there's a lot of stuff that was

645
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,880
going on with the medical and political, banking

646
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,600
and industrial community that you would downright now,

647
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,320
which was openly discussed.

648
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,560
But now, even with this, civic society would

649
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,180
be considered downright immoral.

650
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,180
That was openly done back then.

651
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,500
So they kind of made a collective awareness

652
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,620
of what will transfer over to the next

653
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,680
century and omitted most of it in public

654
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,520
view, but it's still going on.

655
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,120
Like if you get into any of the

656
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,200
baby farms at all, or any of the

657
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,580
using human corpses for medicinal purposes, it was

658
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,980
very widespread, by the way, even in children's

659
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,360
candies.

660
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,880
The way the courts, the star chambers were

661
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,260
working and the medical community, the way that

662
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,700
worked.

663
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,620
So when you study Victorian times, you know

664
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,240
that World War I or World War II

665
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,080
was a blessing to clear out a lot

666
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,440
of that garbage and start another form of

667
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,840
system.

668
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,820
In other words, if you're still living in

669
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,840
Victorian times, you would have human body parts

670
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,640
and snacks listed on the ingredients, literally, openly.

671
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,440
But you still have Child Protection Services, which

672
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,840
is basically the children farming, and most of

673
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,380
that stuff is still in there, but that's

674
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,600
when the sovereign state concept became worldwide.

675
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,780
In other words, let's stop this Napoleonic, which

676
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,240
was the last imperial mindset.

677
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,560
Let's stop the imperial mindset and figure out

678
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,700
various systems of what they call modalities of

679
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,420
government, like socialism, democracy.

680
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,240
Republics were in place, but they were bullshit,

681
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,040
because they were put in place by attorneys,

682
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,400
if you know what I mean.

683
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,680
Whatever, communism, whatever, and they'll just be corporations,

684
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,460
and we're going to own them using paperwork.

685
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,460
I had a discussion recently with an academic.

686
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,400
I said, if you go to the third

687
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,140
grade and you write proper nouns in all

688
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,760
caps, you fail and you won't make it

689
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,700
to the fourth grade.

690
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,300
But every government form is all caps.

691
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,340
In other words, nothing in the government goes

692
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,680
past the third grade level.

693
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,280
It's all improper, because it's not – in

694
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,880
other words, what's going on, it's purely commercial.

695
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,860
Have you ever seen forms for credit cards

696
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,120
or these shopping cards or in schools where

697
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,340
they ask you to write the name and

698
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,420
every letter goes into a box?

699
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,520
That has nothing to do with them being

700
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,720
able to delineate whether you wrote it right

701
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,980
or what each letter is.

702
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,560
They've been doing that in the schools since

703
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,520
the 70s, really.

704
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,440
It started in earnest, really, in the 80s,

705
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,920
everywhere, for sure.

706
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
Those tests that they used to give.

707
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,100
Yeah, that's part of the CUSIP system, the

708
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,740
Convention of the Universal Securities and Investment Protocols.

709
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,260
So whenever you see the name or information

710
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,400
in those little boxes where each letter has

711
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,760
to go in a box, that's the Convention

712
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,320
on Universal Security and Investment Protocols.

713
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,840
That means that action, that act, it's called

714
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,340
an act or an action, the filling out

715
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,060
of the form is being monetized.

716
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,340
In other words, they're using credit.

717
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,660
They're turning it into credit.

718
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,440
It gets a value on it.

719
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,120
I've actually tried to explain this to even

720
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,180
people that were retired bankers and they didn't

721
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,660
get it.

722
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
And like a year later, I speak to

723
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:08,780
them.

724
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,700
They're like, oh, yeah, I looked up what

725
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,000
you said.

726
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,600
It's all true.

727
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
And I'm like, man, you worked for Goldman

728
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,940
Sachs for 30 years and you didn't know

729
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,360
that, huh?

730
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,140
Wow.

731
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,680
What are you doing?

732
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,640
You could be replaced by a robot or

733
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,060
machine.

734
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:21,920
Easily.

735
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,180
So there's so much to talk about.

736
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,180
I mean, here's the thing.

737
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,420
I'll say years ago when I was on

738
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,380
AFR, I was like, oh, yeah, we'll do

739
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,200
a private call.

740
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,880
We'll talk about more stuff in private, a

741
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
few members thing if you want to join.

742
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,120
And I was like, after a while, I

743
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,400
started saying to myself, who am I going

744
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,920
to tell this to?

745
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,380
There's only like five people that can hear

746
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,280
it because all the people that work as

747
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,340
professionals in these fields don't know it.

748
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,000
How is the common person going to know

749
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,120
it and how are they going to use

750
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,260
it?

751
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,020
So why bother?

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,640
You know what I mean?

753
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,300
Right.

754
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,460
So then it's like, oh, just relegate oneself

755
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,020
to just, you know, going a day to

756
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,120
day basis.

757
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,740
If you get past this food, clothing and

758
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,660
shelter and good company, you're way ahead of

759
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,080
the pack.

760
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,120
That's right.

761
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,420
And the good company part, learn to love

762
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,020
animals and learn to love who, you know,

763
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,260
knows about what love really is.

764
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,620
All right.

765
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
So there's a course.

766
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,360
Here we go.

767
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,600
Healing with magnets.

768
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,680
Nothing really on healing with magnets because you

769
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,880
have to learn how a magnet really works.

770
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,060
It's not north or south pole.

771
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,540
There's a vortex that goes right through the

772
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,240
magnet spinning the same way.

773
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,640
It gives the illusion that there are two

774
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,220
poles and there's a block wall.

775
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,860
It's called a block wall, B-L-O

776
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,260
-C-H, or an inertial, dielectric inertial plane,

777
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,420
as Ken Wheeler says.

778
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,120
All right.

779
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,160
That you need to avoid to get the

780
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,040
effects of a magnet.

781
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,480
So magnets are very subtle.

782
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,300
Yes, there could be healing, but I have

783
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,020
not investigated and neither do I have a

784
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,180
desire to at this point.

785
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,480
Three bloodlines in Genesis.

786
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,940
You mentioned during the chat with Achille, would

787
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,160
you be willing to give more explanation?

788
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,880
Not really, because eventually you're going to have

789
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,760
to make it evidentiary, and I don't know

790
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,540
any of the three bloodlines physically or anyone

791
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,380
that I can invite over to speak about

792
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,600
it.

793
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
But essentially there are writings about you have

794
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,700
the Adamic line and then the hybrids with

795
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,240
the Adamics, and then we don't know if

796
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,840
there are any survivors of those that were

797
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,520
before Adam.

798
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,620
Right.

799
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,840
We have to presume there weren't.

800
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,660
I suppose it could be a 50-50

801
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,240
chance if you took care of the wives.

802
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,520
Right.

803
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,900
And then there's a fourth one, which is

804
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,660
the hybrid with those, the hybrid with the

805
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,640
Adamic, the sixth day man.

806
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,420
Right.

807
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,560
Potential.

808
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,640
I think we'll know more about that on

809
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,280
a need-to-know basis as time comes

810
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,400
around.

811
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,840
But it's good to be aware of it,

812
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
so if anything pops up anomalous, you're like,

813
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,240
oh, yeah, I know there are four bloodlines

814
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,760
potentially, but three most likely.

815
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:01,560
Right.

816
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,060
So the vast seas under the crust of

817
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,420
the Earth.

818
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,940
Remember you mentioning them in relation to earthquakes.

819
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,260
How many?

820
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,640
Formation and genesis.

821
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,700
Yeah, that's a water.

822
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,620
Earth is mostly water, by the way.

823
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,500
There is no molten core, by the way,

824
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,680
and there is no magma.

825
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,960
There's heat under there.

826
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,120
Yeah, it's water.

827
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,720
It's all water, all the way down.

828
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,520
And then it inverts like a sphere, like

829
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
a clay pot.

830
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,180
Think of a terrestrial clay.

831
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,960
I like to call it terra more than

832
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,180
earth.

833
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,000
But imagine everything inversing, and you're walking on

834
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,640
the surface of a terracotta sphere, and there's

835
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,120
a hole at the top or somewhere, and

836
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,080
you walk inside.

837
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,760
And then you walk along the inside upright,

838
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,660
but you're upside down compared to the people

839
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,500
on the other side.

840
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,260
Right.

841
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,680
Yeah, it's not a hollow earth theory.

842
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,620
It's really how it is.

843
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,380
So let's see.

844
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,920
In terms of genesis and all that, well,

845
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
it's a need to know again.

846
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,520
We're not given any information on the formation

847
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,720
of the planets, really.

848
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:10,600
No.

849
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,220
We have no information on that.

850
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,560
Chronicles.

851
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,300
Book of Chronicles.

852
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,360
Parallels between Queen Sheba's visit to Solomon and

853
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,620
the Magi's visit to the Messiah.

854
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,520
Sort of.

855
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,640
Not really parallel.

856
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,400
Not much to expand on.

857
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,260
And Sheba is not Egypt, by the way.

858
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,440
That's on the other side of the Nile.

859
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,780
So that's one thing I could put out

860
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,620
that most people presume that it's Egypt.

861
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,660
I would say that the Magi are higher

862
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,360
in authority than the Queen and King, by

863
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,820
the way.

864
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,460
Oh, yeah.

865
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,140
Yeah.

866
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,940
So Solomon would be on par with the

867
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,000
Queen, but the Magi would not.

868
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,900
Solomon would have been shaking in his pants

869
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,440
if they showed up, and so would Sheba's.

870
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,820
So, the resistor that is on the stars,

871
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,220
would that be more creator-binding spiritual entities?

872
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm not sure what that means, but the

873
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,180
stars don't really exist unless you have something

874
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,720
to see them through, like an atmosphere.

875
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,600
Right.

876
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,340
Like what Eric Dollar says, they're basically like

877
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,060
transformers.

878
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,860
You know how transformers work?

879
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,980
You've got two coils, right?

880
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,660
Right.

881
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,320
OK, so no one can explain how it

882
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,680
goes from one coil to the next.

883
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,320
You know, whether it's an I-core or

884
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,180
an E-core, you know, the core, the

885
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,800
laminations?

886
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,500
Sure.

887
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,700
I didn't give a background on what I'm

888
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,720
talking about, but if you guys look up

889
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,940
how electrical transformers work, no one can explain

890
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,980
how the voltage goes from one coil to

891
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,280
the next.

892
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,340
From the primary to the secondary, yeah.

893
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,440
They call it induction, but there's far more

894
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,320
to it, I would think.

895
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,400
Yeah, but how?

896
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,100
Because the way they explain it, all the

897
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,740
loops are captured within the iron core, the

898
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,320
laminations, regardless of the shape.

899
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,180
It's an I-core and an H-core.

900
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,980
Yeah, but still there's no explanation of how

901
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,600
it goes over.

902
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,460
So, you know, but even with saying that

903
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,480
it's a transformer, it only becomes a transformer

904
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,880
with an atmosphere, or a device that allows

905
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,760
some kind of filtering.

906
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,680
Right.

907
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,000
You can't see stars or the sun with

908
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,880
the naked eye in what they call space.

909
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,020
So let's see.

910
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,040
The weather devices you used last week, you

911
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,140
mentioned if you leave them unattended longer than

912
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,040
20 minutes, they're ignored.

913
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,520
By who?

914
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,860
Oh, the ether will ignore it.

915
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,360
If you think of just a hollow tube

916
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,180
that's grounded, which would be the most basic

917
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:54,120
form of affecting the atmosphere, atmospheric ether, if

918
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,140
you look at the rooftops of many houses

919
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,720
with plumbing, you have something called a vent

920
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,240
pipe that sticks out on the roof.

921
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,800
So, you know, you've got millions of these

922
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,460
weather devices sticking out of houses, you know,

923
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,420
of houses in the country everywhere, it would

924
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,340
be screwing up the weather if the ether

925
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,720
didn't.

926
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,120
But I assure you that if you're around

927
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,740
a building where they're building these ticky-tacky

928
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,060
houses, subdivisions, or someone's putting up a house,

929
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,260
the moment the plumbing goes in and the

930
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,100
vent stacks go in, there's a slight weather

931
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
change if you follow the weather every time.

932
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,440
And then it's ignored.

933
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:28,820
Hmm.

934
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,360
So, this is something you won't find in

935
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,480
any of Reich's writings, or this is post,

936
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,920
you know, this is developing, this is post

937
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,320
-Reich, post, you know, late Trevor James Constable.

938
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,940
Yeah, there's nothing about this.

939
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,760
The water pipe in the lake, I think,

940
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,680
was the example on that one.

941
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Sure, but if you leave it there long

942
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,100
enough without movement at all, let's say you

943
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,340
were to cement it in place, yes, you

944
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,900
would have a radical effect initially, and maybe

945
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,800
subsequent, you know, effect, plural effects, for a

946
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,660
little while, and then it just no longer

947
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,180
has any.

948
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,000
Right, because if you think of it as

949
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
a form of dielectricity or dielectric, once you

950
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,500
establish short, the pathway is established, right?

951
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,400
Yep, and that's it.

952
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,220
Right.

953
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,120
Equalized.

954
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,020
So, yeah, it either establishes a short and

955
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,020
the pathway is broken or it's established, right?

956
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,960
You know, like if you drop a wrench

957
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,340
over a car battery, the part that touches

958
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,600
vaporizes, and if you don't move it, it

959
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,140
won't short anymore because it's vaporized.

960
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,400
Or if you maintain the short, it will

961
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,760
completely short out the battery and then go

962
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,940
back to some form of stasis, right?

963
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:50,740
Right.

964
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,180
And nothing else will happen after that.

965
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,920
It'll be ignored.

966
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,820
You know, you'll have a pile of molten

967
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,540
plastic and liquid everywhere, and say, what's that?

968
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,860
Oh, that was when the battery laid on

969
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,180
the wrench.

970
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,760
It kept the contacts going.

971
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,480
Yeah, just ignore it.

972
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,179
There's nothing going on with it now anymore

973
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,520
because it burned out.

974
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,900
Or it didn't burn out, it just blew

975
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,719
up the wrench, and if you leave the

976
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
wrench there for, yeah, if you leave it

977
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,340
there for 20 years, you'll say, oh, just

978
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,840
ignore that.

979
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,600
Dropped a wrench in 0.2 milliseconds or

980
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,760
microseconds, it vaporized, and there it is.

981
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,000
So it's the same thing.

982
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,719
Think of it as how dielectrics work.

983
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,600
When I mean dielectrics, I mean electricity.

984
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,640
Right.

985
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,040
It's, you know, these are subjects that are

986
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,820
easier to answer when you're on the subject,

987
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,280
but I figured I'd bring them up because,

988
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,900
you know, when you start throwing out stuff

989
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,540
like that with someone who's listening, what is

990
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,100
he talking about?

991
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,500
I don't know anything about electricity.

992
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,320
Right.

993
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,420
Or, you know, these paths and things, but

994
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,600
just throw them out there.

995
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,080
So the who is the what?

996
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,900
The ether, or the system, meaning the system

997
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,740
that we call weather or space.

998
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,840
Well, space has no attributes, but the ether,

999
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,260
we should use that term.

1000
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
Do you feel that there's many levels to

1001
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,880
the ether?

1002
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,080
Manifestations.

1003
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,420
We don't know enough about the ether to

1004
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,480
say that there are, yeah, but there are

1005
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,720
manifestations.

1006
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,340
Like if there's ether that keeps things living,

1007
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,980
if you set up, let's say, a power

1008
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,860
grid for electricity, is that energy that's living

1009
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,240
energy?

1010
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,860
No, it's not.

1011
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
As a matter of fact, if it's AC

1012
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,780
and you touch it, it'll kill you, right?

1013
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,180
And then you have the water attracting the

1014
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,520
ether or ether attracting water.

1015
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
Well, is that living or not?

1016
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,180
Not really.

1017
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,880
Is water necessary for living beings after the

1018
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,140
fact?

1019
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,520
Yes.

1020
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,380
So that's why it's easy to categorize its

1021
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,200
manifestations.

1022
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,520
But it's all the same ether.

1023
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,460
Because there is parity with the human body

1024
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,040
and electricity.

1025
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,060
You know, there's electricity.

1026
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,480
Sure.

1027
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,800
The difference between a metabolism and no metabolism,

1028
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,720
which is a dead body, is the presence

1029
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
that's measurable of electricity.

1030
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,640
A dead body will actually still give off

1031
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,660
electricity, but it's towards decomposition.

1032
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,540
Right.

1033
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,080
Chemical.

1034
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,560
I bet if you took a cadaver and

1035
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,980
you stuck a copper pole up his ass

1036
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,420
and one down his mouth, you'll have a

1037
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,120
voltage going across it.

1038
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,560
Yeah.

1039
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
You know, the two wet sides, you know.

1040
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,580
Used to have conductors.

1041
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,260
Something going.

1042
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,960
Just like a potato, right?

1043
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,480
When you put two nails in a potato

1044
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,080
and a voltmeter.

1045
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,080
Right.

1046
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
So that may be that analogy of electricity,

1047
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,820
but it's the type of electricity again.

1048
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,260
Okay.

1049
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,300
Ethiopian dam.

1050
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,420
The project was murdered a few months ago.

1051
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,600
I wonder if you had any insights on

1052
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,040
the project.

1053
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,660
Not really.

1054
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,160
Future political insight.

1055
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,200
Well, water.

1056
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,580
Anything with water is bad right now.

1057
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,160
In other words, what people are being told

1058
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,540
is that you're running out of water.

1059
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,480
And it's limited resource, like oil, you know,

1060
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,580
or air.

1061
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,500
And these are things that are constantly being

1062
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,600
renewed by the environment.

1063
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And so, yeah.

1064
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,360
Manifestation of a new prank.

1065
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,120
Remember, the A1 agenda of the world controllers,

1066
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,000
whether it's Imps, Demons, or Sons of Gods,

1067
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,180
is to eliminate as many people as possible.

1068
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,820
And there's many reasons for it.

1069
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,480
One is, you know, I think out of

1070
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,260
their own honor, like when their time is

1071
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,180
up, it'll be revealed on what's going on.

1072
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,580
So the fewer people that are around, they'll

1073
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,560
be less shameful.

1074
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,460
You know these Gods and Demons?

1075
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,220
Right.

1076
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,700
They'll be less ashamed because people will be

1077
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,420
able to see them.

1078
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,700
So if you get rid of them, they're

1079
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,900
hoping that they won't be resurrected kind of

1080
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,060
thing.

1081
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,220
I mean, there's an entire, you can cast

1082
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,720
a broad sense of reasoning why the hostile

1083
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,900
entities, spiritual entities, want to see the population

1084
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,500
go down.

1085
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,660
Because, you know, they're not very familiar.

1086
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,040
They know about the resurrection.

1087
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't know how much they trust or

1088
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,060
know about that everyone will be resurrected.

1089
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,420
So they figure if they get rid of

1090
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,900
as many people as possible, by inspiring others

1091
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,000
to do so, right, they won't, you know,

1092
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,440
you don't need to, right?

1093
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,280
If you want to, you just go to

1094
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,080
the guy in charge.

1095
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,140
That's why a lot of times people, like,

1096
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,680
Greek, I went to this company and they

1097
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,700
didn't really do what you said.

1098
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,460
I said, well, you're speaking too low on

1099
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,040
the totem pole.

1100
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,580
You got to go higher.

1101
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,480
Right.

1102
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:27,840
See?

1103
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
So the top guy can push a button

1104
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,640
or direct others to, right?

1105
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,220
So these entities, again, you tie it in

1106
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:42,100
with water, energy, petroleum, food, yeah.

1107
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,060
But the whole thing is you have to,

1108
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,860
if you're going to, even people, you know,

1109
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,140
there's something called a Judas goat.

1110
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,920
People who run farms and ranches, you know,

1111
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,020
cows, before they're slaughtered, they go through long

1112
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,580
ramps and labyrinths, right?

1113
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,360
Right, right.

1114
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,700
Yeah, so, yeah.

1115
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,080
Yeah, and remember, I've said for many years

1116
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,820
and a long time, people are unrehabilitatable, you

1117
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,020
know?

1118
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:06,780
Right.

1119
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,820
And it's like when you go to a

1120
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,500
club and you're not invited, the guy says

1121
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,080
you can't come in.

1122
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,480
Then if you ask the guy, well, where

1123
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:13,940
do I go?

1124
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,240
He says, I don't care where you go.

1125
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:15,980
Right.

1126
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,400
You just can't come in here.

1127
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,960
So the new society that's going to be

1128
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,740
on this planet, there's no room for most

1129
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,600
of the, it's not a place for most

1130
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,960
of the people that are alive now.

1131
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,380
I know it sounds kind of crazy, but,

1132
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620
yeah.

1133
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,960
But that's the truth.

1134
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:30,820
Right.

1135
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,960
So, and there's no hotel on the moon,

1136
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,140
you're not going to be accommodated.

1137
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,820
So, and either way, whether you look at

1138
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,580
what they call the new world order, what

1139
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,620
they're planning for the future of humanity, or

1140
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,260
the, you know, revealing the spiritual world, you

1141
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,100
know, with the end of days.

1142
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,540
Either way, the future society, there's no room

1143
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,040
for the people that are here now.

1144
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,000
You see?

1145
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:57,880
Right.

1146
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,960
So even if the gods weren't returning, there

1147
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,940
is no room for the future society that,

1148
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,060
let's say the Illuminati, Freemasons, or the powers

1149
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,340
that be want for the future.

1150
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
There's no room for the people that live

1151
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,100
today in that world.

1152
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,800
And also there is no room for the

1153
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,460
people that, in the future world of when

1154
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,240
the gods return.

1155
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,400
I mean, just look at how, you're going

1156
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,020
to have to actually, you know, completely redo

1157
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,620
their minds.

1158
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,980
And, you know, but they have the resurrection.

1159
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,360
That's the positive side about it.

1160
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,560
Everyone has the resurrection.

1161
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,720
So, either way, the current mindset in the

1162
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,740
humans, for the majority of the humans, there's

1163
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,500
no place, there's no future for them.

1164
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,560
Either secular or spiritual.

1165
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,520
So either way, you know, it's locked.

1166
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,320
You know what I mean?

1167
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,200
Right.

1168
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,340
It's kind of like the bridge is out,

1169
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,800
and you're not going to make it across

1170
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,120
because the bridge is out.

1171
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,320
You can, whether, well, if I go fast

1172
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,560
enough, can I jump the gap?

1173
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:57,980
No.

1174
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,680
No.

1175
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,480
And if I stop and don't go over

1176
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,900
the bridge, you're not going anyway.

1177
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,200
So, yeah, the bridge is out, folks.

1178
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,600
So, yeah, to the future, for most people.

1179
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,840
There's no bridge to the future.

1180
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,820
And it's just part of the reality of

1181
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,140
the days that you're living in.

1182
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,020
Saying such things 100 years ago, actually, it

1183
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,720
would have been popular with the Millerites in

1184
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,500
the middle 1800s, when you convinced a group

1185
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,520
of people it was the end of the

1186
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,560
world on a certain date, you know, using

1187
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,680
the Pope's work schedule and some bullshit prophecy

1188
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,580
stuff, prophecy interpretations.

1189
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,540
Christians, of course, you know.

1190
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,580
Okay.

1191
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,860
Regarding solar noon and the length of the

1192
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,680
evenings, I've been recording solar noon intermittently as

1193
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,260
the weather has allowed since you mentioned it.

1194
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,020
I've noted swings around the 12 noon mark.

1195
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,120
Marissa Grado, okay.

1196
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,780
This is a rather long description here about

1197
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,620
measuring noon.

1198
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:52,780
Okay.

1199
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,320
Now, you can measure it, but it doesn't

1200
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,220
really tie in with anything else, like the

1201
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,860
clock or anything.

1202
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,040
Of course, no, because it's observational.

1203
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,020
All right.

1204
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,420
Thanks for answering these queries.

1205
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,740
Okay.

1206
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,420
Well, thank you for asking.

1207
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,620
You know, I was invited once to speak

1208
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,620
to some people, let's say, okay, about time.

1209
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,960
Someone, I should say, someone asked me, can

1210
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,720
you come speak to my men regarding time?

1211
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,720
And I said, okay.

1212
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,420
So he said time, and I went over

1213
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,240
there, went into a place, which was inside

1214
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,920
of another place, which was inside of another

1215
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,840
place, which a bunch of guys there that

1216
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,820
were trained to do certain things, which is

1217
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,700
certain things that, you know, pretty much you

1218
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,200
could drop them off anywhere in the world

1219
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,760
to do things kind of thing.

1220
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,820
And I just talked to them about time.

1221
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,100
I really wanted you to talk to, you

1222
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,800
know, you to explain to them.

1223
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,220
So the first thing I said to them

1224
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,380
was, do you know that the sun rises

1225
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,720
and the sun sets exactly the same time

1226
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,260
every day?

1227
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,200
Right.

1228
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,340
And they were bewildered.

1229
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,240
They were like, I could see in their

1230
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,940
eyes, no, because in the summer it rises,

1231
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,220
you know, if you're in the southwest at

1232
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,260
5 a.m., and in the winter it

1233
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,900
rises at 637.

1234
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,300
So what are you talking about?

1235
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,420
One guy got it, and I said, okay,

1236
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,580
I see you got it, but you can't

1237
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,060
explain it.

1238
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,260
He says, yeah, I kind of see what

1239
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,420
you're saying.

1240
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,180
Well, how do you know it's sunrise?

1241
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:16,680
That's sunrise.

1242
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,540
Right.

1243
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,780
How do you know it's sundown?

1244
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,440
That's sundown.

1245
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,100
And sunrise happens exactly the same time every

1246
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,520
day, and sundown happens exactly the same time

1247
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,020
every day.

1248
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,060
You get it?

1249
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,140
Yes, I do.

1250
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,340
Right.

1251
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,340
So noontime happens exactly the same time every

1252
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,660
day.

1253
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,560
Mm-hmm.

1254
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,960
Chew on that for a while.

1255
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,200
Okay.

1256
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,960
Sunrise happens exactly the same time every day,

1257
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,040
because how do you know it's sunrise?

1258
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,060
Well, that's sunrise.

1259
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:43,760
Right.

1260
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,760
Noontime happens exactly the same time every day.

1261
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,620
How do you know it's noontime?

1262
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,380
Well, because sun is directly overhead, there's no

1263
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,520
shadow east or west.

1264
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,060
Right.

1265
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,420
Every day it's exactly the same time.

1266
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,860
And now sundown happens exactly the same time

1267
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,280
every day.

1268
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,800
How do you know?

1269
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,840
Because it's at sundown.

1270
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,320
Right.

1271
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Okay, now once you use those three aspects

1272
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,840
only for time, then you will start to

1273
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,440
see how other things can be revealed within

1274
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,100
that scope.

1275
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,560
What you'll be relying on is shadows, markers,

1276
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,780
landmarks, positions in the sky.

1277
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,880
The Book of Enoch talks about gates in

1278
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,560
the horizons.

1279
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,720
Sort of, yeah.

1280
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,520
I think there's a better translation for gate,

1281
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,480
but that's good enough.

1282
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,660
A gate is a place that you come

1283
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,300
in and out of.

1284
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,660
He was very specific about that.

1285
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,980
It's one of these, yes, and also intercalation,

1286
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,220
which I've found to be lost in interpretation,

1287
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,760
whether it was accurate or not.

1288
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680
It was pretty close.

1289
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,080
I haven't really looked at specifically what I've

1290
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,600
recorded.

1291
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,340
I've gotten really loose on recording, keeping records

1292
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,880
the past few years.

1293
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,780
Actually, since I've been really vocal, maybe eight

1294
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,840
years ago I was pretty tight on the

1295
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,080
records.

1296
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,620
Now I'm not at all, because it's an

1297
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,000
internal thing for me, and I know when

1298
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,280
the feast days come around, I know what

1299
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,920
they're about.

1300
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,160
But I do know real time, right?

1301
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,540
I do know what real time is, or

1302
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,320
lawful time.

1303
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,960
See, that's the thing.

1304
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,700
Do you know it?

1305
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,400
And picking up a form of record keeping

1306
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,100
where you can, I don't know, I wouldn't

1307
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,840
say make mandates, because what are you going

1308
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,060
to do?

1309
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,660
Tell people, well, today's the first day of

1310
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,480
the seventh month.

1311
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,920
People, what are you going to do?

1312
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,860
You're in a headlight look.

1313
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,740
It's about the only thing you're going to

1314
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:39,960
get.

1315
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,140
You're not going to get anything done with

1316
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,880
it, but you know it at least.

1317
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,420
Right.

1318
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,680
That's why food, clothing, shelter, preparing meals really

1319
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,020
well, understanding what quality food is about, clothing,

1320
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,200
dressing yourself.

1321
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,840
Well, we never discussed food, like eating seasonally.

1322
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,300
We never discussed seasonal clothing.

1323
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,020
You ever notice that?

1324
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,120
Oh, yeah.

1325
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,780
And shelter, we haven't discussed a lot either

1326
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,680
about seasonal and all that.

1327
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,480
Because shelters, I've noticed, architects, like psychiatrists, are

1328
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,760
pretty fucked up in the head.

1329
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,820
Use that medical term.

1330
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,780
They're a pretty screwed up guy.

1331
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,140
I like what people, I mean society, within

1332
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,600
society.

1333
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,300
I like what Fresco says in one of

1334
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,800
his lectures.

1335
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,300
He shows all the city.

1336
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
He says, well, think of the city skylines.

1337
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,980
That's not order.

1338
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,620
That's utter chaos, and it's ugly.

1339
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,720
It's total chaos.

1340
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,260
It's all ego.

1341
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,600
Each time you see a building, it's someone's

1342
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:37,860
ego.

1343
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,500
And there is no ego, meaning they're expressing

1344
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,680
their mark on society, manifesting and building.

1345
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,540
But in terms of clothing, you know how

1346
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,080
you acclimate, for example, when you go to

1347
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,300
the beach or water, and it feels cold

1348
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,040
initially?

1349
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,860
You kind of jump in, and then you're

1350
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,200
in the water, and it doesn't feel so

1351
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,320
cold.

1352
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,840
We're not talking about water so cold you

1353
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,600
get hypothermia.

1354
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,260
Right.

1355
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,620
You acclimate and adjust.

1356
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,800
You acclimate and get adjusted, yes.

1357
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,860
It's best to, like, for example, here in

1358
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,320
the American Southwest, it's turning into winter or

1359
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,360
late fall.

1360
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,260
It's a beautiful fall.

1361
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,040
Yeah, I noticed that you lost a little

1362
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,280
cold air coming your way.

1363
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,920
Oh, yeah, because of the rains.

1364
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,880
And also, since that hurricane left, I pulled

1365
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,600
out a couple of more translators and set

1366
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,620
them up, and I haven't moved them since.

1367
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,080
And it's taking over a week and a

1368
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,180
half, but it's drawing the entire jet stream

1369
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,900
from the Northwest.

1370
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,220
And this is the best time of year

1371
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,760
to do it.

1372
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,540
And you can see, it just comes down

1373
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,380
and then goes exactly right into the translator.

1374
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,500
I mean, exactly where the translator is aimed.

1375
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,200
So I have one West and one Southwest.

1376
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,000
It must have been a smoother way, too,

1377
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,460
I think.

1378
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:52,840
I think North.

1379
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,420
Yeah, it was North, yeah.

1380
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,360
It was a good cold, though.

1381
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,320
Well, with clothing, you kind of do the

1382
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,700
opposite.

1383
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,020
When the winter is coming, in other words,

1384
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,620
I would rather overdress now while it cools

1385
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,700
down than not, right?

1386
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:14,120
So in other words, more clothing.

1387
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,020
But even also in summer, you're always better.

1388
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,800
Here's the simple thing about clothing.

1389
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,480
You're always better prepared or slash overdressed than

1390
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,160
underdressed.

1391
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,660
Right.

1392
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,040
Because it's easier to take off a layer

1393
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,980
or a jacket than to put one on

1394
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,140
when you don't have one.

1395
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,420
Or if you can have it.

1396
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,780
So the idea here is to – and

1397
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,980
it also has to do with age.

1398
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,620
You know, parents always tell their children, you're

1399
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,600
underdressed, and the children are not because they're

1400
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:44,880
older.

1401
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,900
And as you get older, you have less

1402
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,040
tolerance for cold, right?

1403
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:47,520
Yep.

1404
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,140
Yep.

1405
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,460
But still, the rules with clothing are very

1406
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,800
simple.

1407
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,780
It's easier to take off a layer than

1408
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,040
to put one on that you don't have

1409
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,520
available.

1410
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,060
You know, so if you have, for example,

1411
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,660
a motorized, engine-driven wagon, you know, a

1412
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
minivan, let's say.

1413
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,540
I have a little box in the back

1414
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,780
where I have, you know, bottled water, biscuits,

1415
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,600
flat tire fix-it stuff, first aid kit,

1416
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,500
bungee cords, rope, knife, oil, transmission fluid.

1417
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,920
And I have a cotton sweatshirt and one

1418
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,600
of these Anorak, like, windbreakers with a hood

1419
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,600
that comes out, right?

1420
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,480
The hood that's – okay?

1421
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,180
And that's in there all the time.

1422
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,120
So if I'm ever anywhere that the temperature's

1423
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,840
too low, well, I've got a layer I

1424
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,940
could put on, and I've got an oversized

1425
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,560
windbreaker with a hood.

1426
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,840
And there's also gloves.

1427
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,040
And it's always in there all year round

1428
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,340
because I would rather – you see?

1429
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,900
Yep, very smart.

1430
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,680
Yeah, so you always do – and I'm

1431
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,300
in the desert where, you know, it's hot

1432
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:54,660
usually.

1433
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,780
But, you know, desert, you could have 40

1434
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,440
-degree Fahrenheit temperature difference between day and night,

1435
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,220
which is – Easily.

1436
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,000
That's why if you go anywhere in a

1437
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,220
desert area city, you'll see sidewalks that are

1438
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,000
buckled and bridges that are twisted, you know,

1439
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,100
footings because, you know, the amount of thermal

1440
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,260
expansion and contraction.

1441
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,120
Right.

1442
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,360
Okay.

1443
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,240
So the rule for clothing is always better

1444
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,380
off having more clothes than you think you

1445
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,260
might need because you could strip down and

1446
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:20,920
– okay.

1447
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,900
Got it?

1448
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,540
Very simple.

1449
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,180
And the shelter part to get into –

1450
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,020
the reason why I mentioned architects are such

1451
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,860
scumbags is because they don't understand the subtleties

1452
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,720
of orientation.

1453
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
There's several subtleties with it.

1454
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,320
For example, when houses are being built and

1455
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,920
you have the house facing the street, you'll

1456
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,620
have the bedroom on one side and then

1457
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,000
the car garage on the other, right?

1458
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,920
If the house is facing the street, let's

1459
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,240
say, front door in the middle, living space

1460
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:49,680
in the middle.

1461
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,400
Well, when they have a house next to

1462
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,660
it, it should be a mirror image so

1463
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,720
you have garage to garage and bedroom to

1464
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,100
bedroom.

1465
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:56,900
Right.

1466
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,040
Right?

1467
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,280
Most of these houses are not built that

1468
00:50:59,280 --> 00:50:59,440
way.

1469
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,140
Most of these houses that you see through

1470
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,460
America are a house – you look at

1471
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,740
the front of it, you see the entrance

1472
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,260
door on the left, you know, and you

1473
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,820
go into the living space and the bedrooms

1474
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,960
are on that side, garage on the right

1475
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,320
or either way.

1476
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,860
And the next house next to it is

1477
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,360
the same.

1478
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,300
It's not a mirror image.

1479
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,780
So you have the garage next to the

1480
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,480
bedroom side.

1481
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,760
So if someone has a straight pipe, cherry

1482
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,680
bomb muffler or a Harley Davidson early in

1483
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,880
the morning or coming late at night, they

1484
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,620
will hear it on the bedroom side of

1485
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,340
the house next to it.

1486
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,100
You see?

1487
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,900
So it should be mirror image.

1488
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,260
It should be the garage against the garage,

1489
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,080
you know.

1490
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,900
You got it?

1491
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,600
The house should be mirror image.

1492
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,540
So an orientation would be preferential in a

1493
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,300
way but not necessarily like you don't want

1494
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,500
bedrooms on the east side, bedroom windows on

1495
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,180
the east side unless you have people that

1496
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,160
are early risers or you should have them

1497
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,640
on the – bedroom windows on the east

1498
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,440
side because when the sun rises, it lets

1499
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,060
the inhabitants know, well, get up.

1500
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,240
It's time to get up.

1501
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,740
All right.

1502
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,220
So you guys ever watch Boondocks on Uncle

1503
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,720
Ruckus?

1504
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,480
I have not, no.

1505
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,400
It's actually kind of harsh to say, well,

1506
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,340
I get up anyway at 5 in the

1507
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,660
morning, which is about six hours before most

1508
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,840
N-I, the N-words do.

1509
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,600
So it's just really – you got to

1510
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,120
watch it.

1511
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,540
Yeah, Uncle Ruckus, Boondocks.

1512
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,400
Okay.

1513
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:35,920
Yeah, yeah.

1514
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,900
It's just a trip.

1515
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,480
It's beyond – it's beyond like – Okay.

1516
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,440
I used to – I have their DVDs

1517
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,440
and when I used to have a bunch

1518
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,780
of white people over, I used to put

1519
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,620
it on and watch them.

1520
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,240
This is not politically correct.

1521
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,180
This is not politically correct.

1522
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,140
Yeah.

1523
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,020
Okay.

1524
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,200
So anyway, having the eastern side bedroom, right,

1525
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,340
and then you have the western side living

1526
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,820
room, you're going to get harsh light coming

1527
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,120
in at sundown, very harsh light.

1528
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,400
So all these things have to be considered.

1529
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Now, if you're in a mountainous, forested area,

1530
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,560
maybe it doesn't matter.

1531
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,840
The other aspect about orientation is are you

1532
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,660
actually building the house over what are called

1533
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,360
ley lines and things like that, which is

1534
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,900
a whole other thing that is almost difficult

1535
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,180
to even consider now because what do underground

1536
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,020
metal pipes and electrical wiring do to those

1537
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,780
ley lines, right?

1538
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:31,440
Yeah.

1539
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,300
One aspect of me ethereally would say eventually

1540
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:39,120
nothing because they're so well formed that eventually

1541
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,760
they'll be disturbed, let's say, if you run

1542
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,880
an underground trench with metal in it, but

1543
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,240
eventually I think it returns.

1544
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,060
It could be mitigated if you look at

1545
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,360
Ibrahim Karim's work with biogeometry.

1546
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,920
He says he can mitigate them.

1547
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,400
And then, of course, there's materials in homes,

1548
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,100
what they call…

1549
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,740
Have you noticed you're a homeowner or a

1550
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,200
home loan, but never a house owner?

1551
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,060
You ever notice that in English?

1552
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,140
Yeah, because there's no money to buy anything,

1553
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,420
right?

1554
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,340
So it's all in your mind.

1555
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:09,620
Yeah.

1556
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,700
It's amazing how much when you learn the

1557
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,400
language it's there.

1558
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,800
But most people's houses they live in are

1559
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,820
toxic, especially the ones that are less than

1560
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,800
20 years old, especially when I used to

1561
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,540
be more social.

1562
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,600
I used to run into people that had

1563
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,740
young children and themselves.

1564
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,520
They acquire a house, and it was fairly

1565
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,720
new, and they all came down with allergies.

1566
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,680
And I said, well, why don't you leave

1567
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,840
the windows slightly open?

1568
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,740
Your heating and cooling will cost a little

1569
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,360
more, but your allergies will go away.

1570
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,700
And they reported back to me, yeah, exactly.

1571
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,880
We all feel better now.

1572
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,640
Yeah, it's $20 more a month in electricity

1573
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,340
or $40 more, but it's worth it.

1574
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,740
It's cheaper than going to the devils in

1575
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,280
the white lab coats, you know, the doctors

1576
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,060
for drugs.

1577
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,640
And so what's going on?

1578
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,060
I said, all that carpeting and all that

1579
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,340
material, that chipboard, all that stuff is toxic,

1580
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,260
and it's outgassing, and it will be outgassing

1581
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,020
for a long time.

1582
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:03,580
So what do we do?

1583
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,140
I said, pull all the carpeting out and

1584
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,520
just paint the concrete floors.

1585
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,320
And all the cabinetry, countertops, anything that's that

1586
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,240
particle board stuff, you need to remove it

1587
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,300
and seal the back of it.

1588
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,900
You get a really good sealer, you know.

1589
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,700
So there's no exposed particle board anywhere.

1590
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,340
And a lot of them, actually a couple

1591
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,920
of people that have done that, and they

1592
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,560
said, yeah, it's much more breathable now.

1593
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,920
Well, in the winter months, you close up

1594
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,220
the houses, and boy, you can still use

1595
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,420
it.

1596
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,300
Yeah.

1597
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,520
You still should have it ventilated if it's

1598
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,000
a new house.

1599
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,620
Now, the irony of it is, is the

1600
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,440
older houses, if you live, they're leaky.

1601
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,000
You know, like the windows didn't really shut

1602
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,820
well, you know, and they're leaky.

1603
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,500
You know, old houses, you know, if you're

1604
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,940
living in a 100-year-old house or

1605
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,220
50 years or more, it's a leaky house.

1606
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,880
You know, people, you know, they don't pass

1607
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,800
energy, inspect your single pane windows.

1608
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,600
Actually, those are actually more healthful because they

1609
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,740
ventilate any of the modern.

1610
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,900
If you have particle board furniture, it'll ventilate

1611
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,200
better in a leaky house, an old house,

1612
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,400
than it does in a new house.

1613
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,620
So Hilda Clark used to say that people

1614
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,600
who lived in mud floor huts were much

1615
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,780
healthier than people who lived in developed communities.

1616
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,080
Well, if you really want a good example,

1617
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,880
just get yourself a very high-powered light

1618
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,640
and shine it in your house at night.

1619
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,400
And just look at the air.

1620
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:35,660
Oh, okay.

1621
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,680
Oh, yeah.

1622
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,040
I have a fan that's always a small

1623
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,960
fan exhausting in the office through a screen,

1624
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,220
and I have to clean it every three

1625
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,940
days because you can see all the buildup

1626
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,700
on the screen.

1627
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,360
And I prefer it that way.

1628
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,180
24-7 over at my place all year

1629
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:55,520
round.

1630
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,920
There's a little fan that vents out the

1631
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,180
window.

1632
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,220
It costs a little more energy, but well

1633
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,020
worth every penny.

1634
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,600
And it's probably more particulate pollution than if

1635
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,940
you were living out in the forest.

1636
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,540
Yep.

1637
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,360
Yeah, because I remember trekking through wild lands

1638
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,700
in the past with a flashlight.

1639
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,220
I didn't see as much dust as I'd

1640
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,140
see in the house, right?

1641
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,360
And then the new homeowners have to contend

1642
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,840
with how much pesticides were sprayed in their

1643
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,660
yard prior to their arrival and ownership.

1644
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,640
You've just got a whole mess of stuff

1645
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,680
that you'll never know.

1646
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,660
Well, again, separate yourself from it.

1647
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,720
Water is a good agent to get rid

1648
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,300
of that stuff.

1649
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:49,060
I think that a drastic reduction of sympathy

1650
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,940
towards what's going on is the best.

1651
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,120
In other words, when people get sympathetic or

1652
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,040
get into the activism thing or whatever, that's

1653
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,000
the wrong thing to do.

1654
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,440
The thing to do is to be proactive.

1655
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,740
It's not going to stop.

1656
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,040
No, no.

1657
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,540
It's not going to go away.

1658
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,100
So, you're a stranger in a strange land.

1659
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,620
You know, if you're a stranger in a

1660
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,900
strange land, are you going to start making

1661
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
waves about how things should improve?

1662
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,560
Nope.

1663
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:15,980
Hell no.

1664
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,500
How are you going to protect yourself from

1665
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:19,700
it?

1666
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,660
That's the bottom line.

1667
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,240
Because ultimately, the destruction, whether it's slow or

1668
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,960
quick, is well deserved, number one.

1669
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,800
Number two, it's inevitable.

1670
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,020
And number three, it's not for you.

1671
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,520
So, if you start telling people, well, this

1672
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,700
is poisonous, didn't you know that, or whatever,

1673
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,080
now you're screwing up their calm.

1674
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,260
And they're already being messed with, so now

1675
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,380
you're messing with them, you know?

1676
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,860
Yeah, it's pretty interesting how the worldview is

1677
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,840
so far removed from what is really going

1678
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,740
on in the world.

1679
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah.

1680
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,840
Stranger in a strange land would be, wasn't

1681
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,360
that a book?

1682
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,220
Who wrote that?

1683
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,420
Anyway, someone.

1684
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,380
It harkens back to something of antiquity, which

1685
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,820
is more than 50 years ago, right?

1686
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,420
Okay.

1687
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,340
So, anything else going on, or we should

1688
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,000
wrap it up here?

1689
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,840
I was just looking up that book.

1690
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,340
And let's see what we got here.

1691
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,360
Stranger in a strange land, 1961.

1692
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:31,940
Mm-hmm.

1693
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,720
Fiction, Robert Hewin.

1694
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,720
Okay, there you go.

1695
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,560
Yeah, I grew up reading books.

1696
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,740
When I was a young child, there was

1697
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,300
actually a library in the house, and I

1698
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,680
was able to, when I was grounded, I

1699
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,720
just locked myself in there and read books.

1700
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,100
At nine years old, I read My Secret

1701
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,460
Life, which is, have you ever heard of

1702
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:57,840
that book?

1703
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,560
I have.

1704
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,000
It's a very torrid, pornographic almost, it's about

1705
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,080
900 pages long, bizarre, about a man's encounters

1706
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,140
with all these women, and the way he,

1707
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,580
you know, erotic encounters, you know.

1708
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,040
Mm-hmm.

1709
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,420
So, you know, adults would open the door

1710
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,920
and say, look, he's reading, you know, and

1711
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,700
I'm like, what is, what is, you know,

1712
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,180
what is he talking about?

1713
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,160
Oh, okay, I mean, sex ed, you know,

1714
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:25,840
before there was.

1715
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,460
Sure.

1716
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,300
Yeah, yeah.

1717
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,360
So, anyway.

1718
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,640
I'm surprised you heard of My Secret Life.

1719
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,600
Not many people have.

1720
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:35,820
I have.

1721
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,280
It was a bizarre.

1722
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,240
Yeah.

1723
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:37,940
Mm-hmm.

1724
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,940
A couple of other torrid things of antiquity.

1725
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,460
When I say antiquity, you know, most people,

1726
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,100
believe it or not, you know, like say,

1727
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,880
you know you're old when most people around

1728
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,120
you are younger than you, and you know

1729
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,900
you're young when most people around you are

1730
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,840
older than you, right?

1731
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,460
Right.

1732
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,620
So, now wherever I go, I see most

1733
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,580
people are younger.

1734
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,600
So, you know, like when you were young,

1735
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,260
you look around, oh, we all want to

1736
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,800
grow up and be like everybody else, right?

1737
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah.

1738
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,580
Now, you go out and you're like, man,

1739
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,280
everybody's younger than me, I guess I'm old.

1740
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,200
Right.

1741
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,000
You kind of notice, you know, when someone

1742
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,740
is younger than you.

1743
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,660
Yeah, you do.

1744
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,320
Yeah.

1745
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,060
So, antiquity, which doesn't quite classify, I don't

1746
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,820
know how, and the classification of the term

1747
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,880
antiquity, does it mean ancient, like a week

1748
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,020
ago was ancient to alternative media, by the

1749
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:28,200
way?

1750
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:28,740
Right.

1751
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,160
Those morons.

1752
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,040
Or is it 100 years or just a

1753
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,560
half a century plus, you know?

1754
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,740
Yeah, yeah.

1755
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,900
I like the older books.

1756
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,240
You know, but here's the thing, it's still

1757
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,900
low grade.

1758
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,140
I know, I know.

1759
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,420
I've looked at stuff, even, you know, here's

1760
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,920
something you really want to hear, this might

1761
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,460
sound aghast, this might make people aghast in

1762
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,980
a certain way, Newton is low grade.

1763
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,980
You read Isaac Newton, his scientific works and

1764
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,460
his biblical comedies, low grade.

1765
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,980
To me, at least.

1766
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:02,460
Okay.

1767
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,180
I'm not saying don't read it.

1768
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,020
You know, and if you might be impressed

1769
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,240
by the writing style.

1770
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:08,800
I can understand where you've come up with

1771
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,280
that, yeah.

1772
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,900
Well, the way they worded things, you know,

1773
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,720
might seem like a higher form of the

1774
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,840
language, more command of the English language, let's

1775
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,240
say, than you see, but it's still low

1776
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:18,500
grade.

1777
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,280
You know, you read and you don't leave,

1778
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,260
I mean, you could do an hour's worth

1779
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,500
of Greek speak and it'll top anything Newton

1780
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,140
ever wrote.

1781
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,500
Well, I'm sorry.

1782
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,860
That said, we're limited by our language to

1783
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,370
begin with.

1784
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,840
Yeah, well, that's true.

1785
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,280
But I mean, in terms of low grade,

1786
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,920
in terms of where they're going with it.

1787
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:38,960
Right, right.

1788
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,520
What are you going to leave with?

1789
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,410
You know, so.

1790
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:45,970
Yeah.

1791
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,260
Well.

1792
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:54,640
Mm-hmm.

1793
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,390
Is there anything going on?

1794
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,250
No, she's quiet.

1795
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:05,450
Yeah.

1796
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,170
Let's just call it a, we've covered a

1797
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,670
bunch of stuff.

1798
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:11,510
And mostly thanks for sending that email regarding

1799
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,290
all those questions.

1800
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:16,270
And again, just listen to what's being said.

1801
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,250
It's a mindset thing.

1802
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,930
So when a topic is brought up, let's

1803
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,050
say I bring up a topic, it's not

1804
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,950
going to be usually, not because I just

1805
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:27,770
want to be contraire, but it's not going

1806
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,070
to be discussed and I'm not going to

1807
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,570
present it the way you're used to hearing

1808
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:30,830
it.

1809
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,450
Because what you've pretty much heard before is

1810
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:33,870
a lie.

1811
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:34,970
So.

1812
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,350
That's a tough one to get around.

1813
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,050
And just starting off, you know, what we

1814
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,590
started off regarding crystals for healing.

1815
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,950
They're not used for healing and they can't

1816
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:46,110
be.

1817
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,390
I mean, well, some people believe they are,

1818
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,010
but that's not what they're for.

1819
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,070
They're visual.

1820
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,070
They're optical tools, solely optical.

1821
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,350
Healing is the same.

1822
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,190
If just to finish off, first will be

1823
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,170
last, last will be first.

1824
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,030
The if I were to say I might

1825
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,570
sound ultra conservative in terms of a viewpoint,

1826
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:11,770
a spiritual or scriptural viewpoint that all disease

1827
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:14,290
and is a spiritual oppression.

1828
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:14,770
Right.

1829
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,210
Actually, it's true to say that.

1830
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,110
But I would rather say that disease, you

1831
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,210
know, maladies, physical maladies and spiritual oppression.

1832
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,250
The the to mitigate that there's only if

1833
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,570
you understand scripture, the the creator sends those

1834
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,570
things and retracts them and heals.

1835
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,850
He's your only source for that.

1836
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:35,710
Right.

1837
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:36,550
Right.

1838
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,950
So so that's the the key.

1839
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,730
The thing that I again, just to recap

1840
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,050
what I brought up, the visual optical aspect

1841
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,410
was, look, you know, one of the things

1842
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,470
that was used in old times because they

1843
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:51,790
understood that we see through a fleshy eye.

1844
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,970
Again, we're taking it for granted.

1845
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:58,170
People just see, well, see what they see

1846
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,570
and they take in regard, again, whether it's

1847
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,510
low grade or high grade.

1848
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,150
Well, do you see?

1849
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,010
Well, or do you need glasses or do

1850
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,530
you not see?

1851
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:08,370
Well, but no one is discussing the the

1852
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,730
let's say the philosophy of optics.

1853
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,030
What it really is, is the impulse has

1854
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,050
gotten through the eye.

1855
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,650
And the only reason photography makes sense is

1856
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,810
because they are adjusted and made so we

1857
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,330
can interface, you know, fight with a printed

1858
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,990
photograph or something on a rectangle that we

1859
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:27,550
recognize.

1860
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:28,410
Right.

1861
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,850
Cameras see differently than we do.

1862
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,010
You know, there's there's algorithms in the digital

1863
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:38,010
stuff and there's chemistry and contrast has to

1864
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,030
be considered in the chemical photography.

1865
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,190
So it makes sense to us.

1866
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,550
Right.

1867
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,010
But, you know, there are people like Kirlian

1868
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,050
and Trevor James Constable and others that have

1869
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,890
taken photography to the study, the anomalies of

1870
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,770
what it can be recorded, you know, and

1871
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,570
that we can make sense optically later.

1872
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,070
Right.

1873
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:02,810
The infrared and ultraviolet and whatever else.

1874
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,450
In other words, is it is it analogous?

1875
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,190
That's where you get analog.

1876
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,050
You know, ultimately it has to be analog.

1877
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:09,850
Right.

1878
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:12,230
Where you can interface with it, with your

1879
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,910
ears and eyes.

1880
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:18,430
And if there's tactile sensation, of course.

1881
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:19,690
Right.

1882
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,310
And olfactory.

1883
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,170
So.

1884
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:28,210
But ultimately, in the aspect of all healing

1885
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:31,270
or spiritual with the opposite would be spiritual

1886
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:36,590
oppression or illness or disease is, let's just

1887
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,210
say the apex or the locus point starts

1888
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:39,950
with the creator.

1889
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,690
So you go to him for it.

1890
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,750
I mean, whether he'll let you over there

1891
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,290
or not is between you and him and

1892
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,870
the angels, really, that, you know, I'm just

1893
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:51,710
saying he's the source.

1894
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,020
That's the whole thing.

1895
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,100
That's the beauty of watching all the stupidity

1896
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,560
in the world.

1897
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,680
The beauty of it is how calm it

1898
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,780
is for the creator.

1899
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,780
Or the higher beings, because most of the

1900
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,740
people are only used to low grade stuff.

1901
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,240
So all the low grade crap gets filtered

1902
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:14,580
out.

1903
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,300
So there's really not much getting up there.

1904
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,740
I know it sounds kind of crazy to

1905
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,760
say that, but I want you to think

1906
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,940
about that for a little while.

1907
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:26,400
In other words, the spiritual realm is polluted

1908
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,700
with humans making requests, but very little of

1909
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,240
it is getting up to the higher grade

1910
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,600
level.

1911
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,180
Because they filter it out, you know.

1912
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,040
Right.

1913
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,780
So if you understand what I just said,

1914
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,600
just to think out loud for a minute,

1915
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,540
get your shit together, figure out what high

1916
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,560
grade communication with the spiritual side really is,

1917
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,040
because then you could bypass all the pollution.

1918
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,820
And all the dumb shit that you see

1919
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,000
in religion and all that.

1920
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,440
And get to where things can really be

1921
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:00,700
done.

1922
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,180
You know, are.

1923
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,780
We had an interesting question.

1924
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,320
Was not the Christ, let's see, how did

1925
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:10,820
he put that?

1926
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,100
Was not the Christ sick for most of

1927
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,180
his day, but healing the sick?

1928
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,779
You could say that pretty much, you could

1929
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:21,359
garner that from the Psalms.

1930
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,500
There are a bunch of Psalms that regard

1931
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,399
descriptions that could only be applied to the

1932
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:29,020
actual Christ's life.

1933
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:30,100
Right.

1934
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,279
And I've actually mentioned that before, that if

1935
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,240
you look at that Psalm, it clearly states

1936
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,000
he had taken on illnesses.

1937
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,340
Right.

1938
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,740
But, you know, that's something, again, that needs

1939
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,560
to be studied, because to say that the

1940
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,220
Christ took on illnesses and was sickly himself,

1941
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,700
if we take the very conservative view that

1942
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,700
all illness and disease is a form of

1943
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,040
spiritual oppression, he allowed himself to be spiritually

1944
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,620
oppressed.

1945
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:58,720
Now, the antithesis of that is that they

1946
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,640
had recognized him as the Christ and they

1947
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,460
would avoid him.

1948
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:02,560
Right.

1949
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,439
Because he had the highest authority.

1950
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:04,779
Right.

1951
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,100
But, you know, and then again, you could

1952
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,700
switch back and say, well, maybe it was

1953
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,760
by directive, again, that he was of the

1954
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,399
nature, you know.

1955
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:23,460
Because the interesting thing that you can say

1956
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,600
about the Christ, actually, which is you can

1957
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,340
garner from the text quite immediately if you're

1958
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,140
doing an objective study, is he had the

1959
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:31,819
power of invisibility.

1960
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:34,859
Not like the invisible man in sci-fi.

1961
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:38,439
But more like the description given in the

1962
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:39,260
movie Men in Black.

1963
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,060
When you meet people, they won't be able

1964
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,819
to make out who you are or remember

1965
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:43,020
you.

1966
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,960
You'll just be like deja vu or something

1967
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,279
to them.

1968
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:45,920
Uh-huh.

1969
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,640
He had that ability.

1970
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:50,540
So if he were to be assessed by

1971
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,580
authority as a child, they would probably see

1972
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,360
him as such.

1973
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,400
But others that knew him would see him

1974
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,240
in perfect health.

1975
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,820
It depends.

1976
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,980
That needs to be studied.

1977
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,140
But I have gone out and said that

1978
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,420
based on certain verses in the Psalms, he

1979
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,260
had taken on illnesses, yes, throughout his life.

1980
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,500
And it would make sense if we had

1981
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,400
more information, historical information, which, by the way,

1982
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,280
it was known to many people on who

1983
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,240
he was in an academic sense, based on

1984
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,100
who he said he was and who others

1985
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,780
said he was.

1986
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:32,360
And there is a lot of records about

1987
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,280
the Christ, but they're still secret.

1988
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:38,400
And the only thing that leaks out is

1989
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,680
through some rabbinic traditions where they speak of

1990
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,420
him very poorly.

1991
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,480
Right.

1992
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,020
You know, especially after, you know, later first

1993
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:46,460
century.

1994
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,560
But if you read in the New Testament,

1995
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,440
in many places there were scribes that followed

1996
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,660
him around and took notes.

1997
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,180
In the New Testament, they used the Pinox,

1998
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,560
you know, which is a form of writing.

1999
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,300
In modern Greek, if you go to school

2000
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,800
and someone writes on a board, it's called

2001
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,700
the Pinox also.

2002
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,160
But in order to gain, I don't think

2003
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,500
he gained that kind of notoriety immediately just

2004
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,740
when he was doing, quote unquote, what they

2005
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,200
like to say is his ministry when he

2006
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,780
was going out in public.

2007
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:18,180
I think he was quite well observed earlier

2008
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,020
on because there are also Psalms that state

2009
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,980
that, you know, the drunkards at the gates

2010
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,760
and others were aware of him.

2011
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,120
Right.

2012
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:26,840
Right.

2013
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,180
So so he was quite well acknowledged to

2014
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:32,700
what degree.

2015
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,280
I'm not sure.

2016
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,840
But I would say that there's enough in

2017
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,940
the Psalms to say that he just didn't

2018
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,860
appear on the scene later, you know, in

2019
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,300
his last four years or so.

2020
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,060
He was known about before.

2021
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,720
But his purpose, again, is very simple.

2022
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,720
And it's not what people think it is,

2023
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,960
you know, because, again, why would you come

2024
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,160
in and step on the game that was

2025
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,260
the game board?

2026
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,360
You know, if children are playing a game,

2027
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,860
you don't come in and step on the

2028
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,280
game board.

2029
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,760
So the high the high level spiritual beings

2030
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,360
have set the lower spiritual beings to rule

2031
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,700
the earth a certain way and they're not

2032
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,900
doing it and they're not going to come

2033
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,320
in and disturb it until it's time to

2034
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:14,760
do so.

2035
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,460
Well, it definitely would also show that he

2036
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,640
had permission to do so.

2037
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,860
Instructed.

2038
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:24,580
Right.

2039
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,880
His purpose was well known to him was

2040
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,340
to die.

2041
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,000
And, you know, and also within that proved

2042
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,560
that everything in Scripture was true.

2043
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:34,440
Right.

2044
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:41,790
Even if you study Scripture, you can almost

2045
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,310
say it as a private thing.

2046
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,190
You know how I say that if you

2047
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,850
don't say it or write it down, the

2048
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,310
most spirit beings or spirit beings don't know

2049
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,710
because they can't read your mind.

2050
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,410
They could put things in your mind.

2051
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:53,770
Right.

2052
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,590
They can't read your mind.

2053
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,630
There's no one verse declaring the Messiah directly,

2054
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,450
you know, who exactly he is and where

2055
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,550
he's going to be and when he's going

2056
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:02,930
to come.

2057
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:03,910
Right.

2058
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,050
There's no one verse.

2059
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:05,810
It's spread out.

2060
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,430
You know, there's no there's no like footnotes

2061
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,150
and bullet points on the specifics.

2062
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:17,950
Almost as if it's the prophetic aspect is

2063
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,430
hidden as well.

2064
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,090
Yeah.

2065
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:24,730
Because the spiritual realm doesn't, you know, unless

2066
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,490
you just like people, you either know him

2067
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:26,950
or you don't.

2068
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,830
So it's, you know, in other words, he

2069
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:36,450
was not announced cosmically, directly in the scriptures.

2070
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:39,890
He's all over the place indirectly for those

2071
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,310
that have wisdom to see it, you know.

2072
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,550
So in other words, that's why very often

2073
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,250
I always say everything about him is a

2074
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:46,590
secret.

2075
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,590
It's a complete secret, you know, whether it's

2076
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:54,030
pre or post or even still everything about

2077
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,110
the Christ is a secret.

2078
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:58,610
It's amazing to to look at that because

2079
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,530
it's it's a major cosmic thing.

2080
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:01,070
You know what I mean?

2081
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:01,910
Yeah.

2082
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,340
So so if that's a secret, how much

2083
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,020
of Genesis is a secret where you could

2084
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,220
say, well, the Christ is one thing.

2085
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,640
But the beginning of the world or the

2086
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,860
beginning of everything is another.

2087
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,180
How much of that is a secret?

2088
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,660
Well, that's a big secret also.

2089
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,720
You know, again, when you go back to

2090
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,620
certain Talmudic writing Targum Targum writings, which are

2091
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:32,140
Aramaic, more the northern part of the world,

2092
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,960
you know, there or if you go to

2093
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,540
any of the even Native American or sages,

2094
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,120
you know, whether it's rabbis or Native American

2095
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,640
Indians or what they what everyone is always

2096
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,400
stating is be happy with what, you know,

2097
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,240
about you to the common people, whatever you

2098
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,200
know, and get what you can out of

2099
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,560
studying.

2100
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,400
But those who do know, keep it to

2101
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:58,940
yourself.

2102
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,740
That's that's the ultimate thing.

2103
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,780
It's still a world of secrets.

2104
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,900
In other words, like if you so scripture

2105
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,320
aside, study the Native American culture.

2106
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,880
Let's say the DNA people, they call them

2107
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,360
Navajo.

2108
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,320
And you study them objectively and you really

2109
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,940
make progress.

2110
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,340
If you were to run into anyone that

2111
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,200
held ancient knowledge or, you know, more high

2112
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,080
grade knowledge, he won't share it with you.

2113
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,560
He'll he'll pat you on the back saying

2114
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,640
you've done really well.

2115
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,880
But are you happy with it?

2116
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:31,300
Yeah.

2117
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,160
OK, good.

2118
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:32,800
Go now.

2119
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,520
I know more, but that's for me to

2120
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,560
know, not for you to know.

2121
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:37,320
Right.

2122
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,100
You see, this is how the ancient sages

2123
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,800
were or the people that were studying scripture.

2124
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,340
We could call them rabbis now because of

2125
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,200
that part of the world.

2126
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:47,920
Right.

2127
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,540
They they would study and look at things

2128
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,420
and make discoveries and they wouldn't share them.

2129
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,860
The people, they keep them within their own

2130
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,280
group.

2131
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,460
And when someone would appear and, you know,

2132
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:03,940
try to demonstrate what they've discovered, they wouldn't

2133
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,200
discourage them, but they wouldn't add to it.

2134
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,440
They wouldn't help them along either.

2135
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,360
This has been the human tradition.

2136
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,980
How many times have you heard me say,

2137
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,300
you know, even parents of the children want

2138
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,200
you to do well in life.

2139
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,560
Just don't do better than I am.

2140
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:15,920
Right.

2141
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,900
Yeah, that's how people, you know, I see

2142
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,700
that all the time.

2143
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah, I want you to do well in

2144
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:23,900
life, just don't do better than I'm doing.

2145
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:24,700
Right.

2146
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,020
That's the same mentality there.

2147
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,840
This is a human scumbag condition, I call

2148
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,360
it.

2149
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,380
Because humans are groomed by these gods, by

2150
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:42,680
these various imps, demons, patron deities, matron deities,

2151
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,060
their priesthoods, you know, it's real trash.

2152
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,160
It's a real trash existence.

2153
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,140
And it's been going on for so long

2154
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,200
it doesn't make it right.

2155
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,480
You know, just because, you know, if you

2156
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,720
study tort law, one of the old things

2157
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,580
they wrote about tort was that time does

2158
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,800
not nullify a void act.

2159
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,260
Let me say it again.

2160
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,280
Time does not nullify a void act.

2161
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,200
Right.

2162
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,240
That's the use of English that people are

2163
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:07,920
not used to hearing.

2164
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,820
So if someone is voided, you know, has

2165
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,320
a void act or a tort or a

2166
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,100
harm, no matter how much time goes by

2167
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,020
it doesn't nullify it.

2168
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,500
It still stands as if it was just

2169
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,280
done yesterday.

2170
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:19,880
Right.

2171
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,460
So if someone stole your iPad 50 years

2172
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,560
ago, ha ha ha, it's no difference if

2173
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,940
it was 50 years ago or today.

2174
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:29,440
Right.

2175
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,300
Right.

2176
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,400
Because it's a tort.

2177
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,000
Right.

2178
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,900
So most people are living with the concept

2179
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,780
now that these void acts that they call

2180
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,860
tradition and culture and ignorance is nullified because

2181
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,640
it's been going on for so long.

2182
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:45,660
Get it?

2183
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,440
Right.

2184
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,300
So when you go out into the world,

2185
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,000
whether it's the entitled classes or your family

2186
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,680
or your friends or your neighbor or co

2187
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,080
-worker or anybody out there, and they pull

2188
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,860
that plausible deniability bullshit where everybody's been doing

2189
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,860
it for so long now, that's bullshit because

2190
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,040
if it's void, it's void.

2191
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:01,160
Right?

2192
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,200
Right.

2193
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,020
It's not nullified because it's been going on

2194
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,060
for thousands of years.

2195
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:07,580
Bullshit.

2196
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,420
It's just as fresh and just as it

2197
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,620
needs to be remediated as if it was

2198
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,640
just developed today.

2199
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,120
See?

2200
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,260
Mm-hmm.

2201
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,580
That's why very often I have such harsh

2202
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,520
criticisms for the entitled classes, you know, the

2203
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,920
legal field, the medical field, the administrative, I

2204
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,540
shouldn't say administrative, but the political side of

2205
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:28,900
stuff.

2206
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,560
The administrators are different, by the way.

2207
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:38,640
The religious, just because they've been doing it

2208
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,240
for so long, it doesn't mean that it's

2209
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:40,540
okay.

2210
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,600
That's basically tort law.

2211
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,560
And that's how the gods see it.

2212
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,580
And, well, the Most High sees it that

2213
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:48,800
way.

2214
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,140
That's why when you read, especially in Jeremiah,

2215
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,160
one of the excuses that he gets is

2216
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,580
that, well, we've been doing this for so

2217
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:01,540
long, making offerings to Ashtar and we'd be

2218
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,180
prospering.

2219
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,740
What do you mean?

2220
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,760
Who's this Yahweh guy now we have to

2221
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,500
heed to?

2222
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,040
We're not talking about, you know, for all

2223
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,120
these years we made offerings to Asht, Queen

2224
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,100
of Heaven, and we prospered.

2225
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,900
What are you talking about, you know?

2226
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,480
So it's irrelevant.

2227
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,460
So, okay, with that said, I don't know.

2228
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,520
Maybe we just had an irrelevant.

2229
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,460
I don't know how long we've been on,

2230
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,120
but for most it would be irrelevant, an

2231
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,200
hour and 20 minutes roughly of irrelevancy.

2232
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,480
But either way, we'll have another week of

2233
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,700
irrelevancy coming up, hopefully, next week.

2234
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,320
Thanks, Bruce, for archiving this.

2235
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:40,780
Thank you again.

2236
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,200
Okay.

2237
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,180
Anything else?

2238
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,320
Otherwise, we'll just sign off.

2239
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,400
Looks like that would be it there, Greek.

2240
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:47,500
Okay.

2241
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,460
I'll see you then.

2242
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:48,900
Thanks, man.

2243
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,760
You have a good day.

2244
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:50,740
Bye-bye.

2245
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,080
You too.
