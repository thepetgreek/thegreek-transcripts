1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,890
And greetings folks, we're live with the Greek

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,070
and how are you doing tonight greet?

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,210
Doing okay.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,090
Yeah another week seven days.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,570
I should say because things go by the

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,390
eighth month is almost over You know things

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,370
go by on a on a daily.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,830
I guess I tend to look at things

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,490
By the you know monthly and yearly as

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,670
well.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,370
But as you get older the years are

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,790
just General groupings of events.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,830
They're very short.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,910
I noticed so They go by fast they

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,670
go by fast So we're gonna talk a

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,590
little bit more about food Yeah, as I

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,510
have in the past.

18
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,250
See I know the sonic events that I

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,910
did on food a while back Early, I

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,750
didn't do one with Ocelli because I think

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,890
that would have been a deer in the

22
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,970
headlights But I did one or two.

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,830
I did one or two with Seth Yeah,

24
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,770
and I wouldn't do anything like that with

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,990
Freeman because he doesn't fly.

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,390
So either way Going for more instruction And

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,450
you know all the relative stuff that people

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,590
think about learning how to cook is irrelevant

29
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,550
if you lack the mindset Right and essentially

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,810
the mindset is what is food and it

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,910
passes through the body?

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,670
It doesn't get absorbed never you've never absorbed

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,390
anything And if you have you've been quite

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,370
ill and you probably didn't make it so

35
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,450
you wouldn't be listening to me.

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,450
Well Right now it is that's why it's

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,970
so critical when they do subdermal stuff like

38
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,890
hydration, you know injections IVs and all that

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,950
The body can take it but you know,

40
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,790
there's a lot of subdermal, you know But

41
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,510
basically an IV of any sort from drug

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,190
addicts all the way to the hospital doing

43
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,030
a hydration drip with saline no matter what

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,010
you do in that respect again, it shows

45
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,830
that's a completely unnatural and Subdermal, you know,

46
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,010
even a mass trauma wound where opens the

47
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,270
skin the body can survive it, right?

48
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,990
It's not conducive to the body.

49
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,170
Okay, so it's yeah So, you know, so

50
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,310
basically nothing ever goes in and out.

51
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,830
It just passes through think of magnetic tape

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,710
like the old Right, so just passing over

53
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,070
a tape head and get all the music

54
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,270
and all the dynamics that you need Essentially

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,470
that is really a difficult thing to settle

56
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,730
in.

57
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,670
I mean I've had Maybe I should say

58
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,130
several scores, but over a hundred discussions with

59
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,910
medical people And not just like I'm not

60
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,550
talking about nurses and people who empty the

61
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,670
garbage cans in hospitals I'm talking about the

62
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,350
heads of the hospital the head of trauma

63
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,070
the head of universities that that on the

64
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,170
regent level that teach Doctors right the heads

65
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,530
not not just the regular doctors Yeah, and

66
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,570
they acknowledge they can't acknowledge it.

67
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,930
They they did not no one ever Ever

68
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,910
in the medical community has ever said that's

69
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,510
not possible.

70
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,970
That's not how it is They always lean

71
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,230
towards it being the truth and some of

72
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,090
them see it Actually, I got a couple

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,070
of doctors to quit so they had seen

74
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,770
seen it But right they will never acknowledge

75
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,730
it because it goes contrary to their bullshit

76
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,330
Which is what it is bad science or

77
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,030
BS right right?

78
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,010
So why what does that have to do

79
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,770
with food well?

80
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,170
In conversation when someone eats food, and they

81
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,970
feel better they feel invigorated They feel satiated

82
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,310
they feel strengthened.

83
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,590
They never say I feel like I absorbed

84
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,470
it right not even not even in common

85
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,830
language Yeah, no one ever feels anything passing

86
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,710
through their body or even even in common

87
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,610
parlance the way people speak It's not possible.

88
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,950
It's it doesn't exist So think of it

89
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,910
as a form of induction Whatever that is

90
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,290
you can look it up.

91
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,970
It's a term So there's many many attributes

92
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,010
Resonance right, but resonance is not Hertz Ian.

93
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,510
It's not Hertz Ian like in the right

94
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,630
people talk about frequency It's proximity Yes, and

95
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,130
the closer the proximity well you see you

96
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,230
also get juice or energy from the environment

97
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,330
That's why people in the country tend to

98
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,430
eat less Right when you go camping you

99
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,110
might get really hungry in the beginning because

100
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,070
you're you adjust you're less stressed you're changing

101
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,390
environment But then you notice as you're out

102
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,150
living in the wilderness.

103
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,270
You don't need as much food right most

104
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,510
people do right?

105
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,610
That way another thing is Years ago back

106
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,130
and maybe 30 years ago or so when

107
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,490
I first started learning about this I met

108
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,690
a bunch of people that were into something

109
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,830
called macro biotics, and I said what you

110
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,170
know I said You know about macrobiotics said

111
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,970
no, what's that?

112
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,290
You know and so we'll come check it

113
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,670
out And it's just a way of thinking

114
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,670
in a way of it spawned out of

115
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,810
Japan Yeah, Michio Kushi, Georgia Sawa and Shizuko

116
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,830
Yamamoto later on I was pretty Well acquainted

117
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,950
with Shizuko Yamamoto.

118
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,970
I volunteered at the macrobiotic center in New

119
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,610
York City Oh, and after after about being

120
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,630
there for a short while a few weeks

121
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:02,890
or months.

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,210
She invited me over for dinner I came

123
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,450
back and no one wanted to talk to

124
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,330
me and I said why what's going on?

125
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,110
I pulled over this one.

126
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,010
I said what's going on He says well,

127
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,570
you know we've been working here volunteering for

128
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:14,810
years.

129
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,210
She never invited us over for dinner You

130
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,690
you show up in a few weeks.

131
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,610
She invites you over for dinner So and

132
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,930
I Made some desserts from Michio Kushi back

133
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,010
in the day And he says is the

134
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,210
best microbiotic desserts I ever had he told

135
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,890
me about three or four times and after

136
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,870
that I stopped baking but anyway Give you

137
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,610
a little history about microbiotics I mean I

138
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,990
used to it just like any group Gustave

139
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,630
Le Bon they become very narrow and they

140
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,650
lose focus And they forget why they're there

141
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,930
and just to make a Point of it.

142
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,910
I used to run into people that were

143
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,950
into macrobiotics, and they said they were macrobiotic

144
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,170
I said you look too healthy to be

145
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,510
into health food because usually these people look

146
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,270
terrible right you know or you look right

147
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
Yeah, or Mac.

148
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,150
I started dubbing them macro neurotics.

149
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,950
They're very dogmatic You know I had someone

150
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,390
who overcame a pretty strong case of cancer

151
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,690
came over here years ago He traveled a

152
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,310
cross-country in a you know RV It's

153
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,330
actually a distant relative but The point is

154
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,350
he beat the cancer that they said he

155
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,550
would die it with a macrobiotic diet And

156
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,690
he was over here And I was preparing

157
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,970
a meal and I used some local that

158
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,190
you know some veg from the garden other

159
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,750
things is that's not microbiotic I'm not gonna

160
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,110
eat that I'm like what are you talking

161
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,810
about you see they're very dogmatic even though

162
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,790
he had success So I'm just giving a

163
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,270
little shades of story here just to back

164
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,530
up the mindset now.

165
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,550
There's nothing to do with microbiotics I'll give

166
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,290
you an example It's just a mindset if

167
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,790
anyone wants to research that and I keep

168
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,990
repeating the terms so you could look online

169
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,530
It's very little viable on the internet about

170
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,790
it by the way if you want to

171
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,270
look up some old If there's anything on

172
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,430
Herman Ahara or Georgia Sawa, maybe None of

173
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,870
the modern people they're assholes.

174
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,590
Sorry to use that term But that I

175
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,130
would go back to the old ones of

176
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,210
course Like in other words if I had

177
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,810
to bring someone on and discuss macrobiotics I

178
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,850
say I can't because everyone I think that's

179
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,670
worth discussing it is dead so again another

180
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,490
situation here Okay, so But even then around

181
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,110
that time I was I was in some

182
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,330

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,790
a venture capitalist kind of guy, so he

196
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,770
wanted me to work with him.

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,010
He says come on and and And Make

00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,930
office was it was in the Trump Tower

200
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,470
so anyway It was just built so some

201
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,730
people came to visit and this was like

202
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,990
he was going to merge with a group

203
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,670
and He wanted to beat him up on

204
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,970
the price in other words on the merger.

205
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,250
You know they wanted to Put some money

206
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,970
together and do something, but he wanted to

207
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,930
come upper hand it so he says to

208
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,950
me He says look we're gonna go we're

209
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,890
gonna take them out to lunch And it's

210
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,770

211
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,410
together and listen We're gonna order for them

212
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,690
bloody rare steaks if they eat meat Like

213
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,250
very rare make sure that we suggest they

214
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,809
eat the steak And they suggest they eat

215
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,970
it rare And we're just gonna eat vegetarian

216
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,630
make sure you don't eat any of any

217
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,110
meat for the you know a day or

218
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,970
two before we do This and I didn't

219
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,550
know so so we sat down and we

220
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,750
did eat vegetables and salad and We and

221
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,930
these guys did there were three or four

222
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,910
of them more than us And he ordered

223
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,550
made sure that they ordered rare steaks Right

224
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,370
and the meeting worked out really really well

225
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,670
And then like after a couple of weeks

226
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,910
went by when the dust settled.

227
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,810
I said why did you do that?

228
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,790
It says oh yeah, what when you eat

229
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,930
rare dead.

230
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,990
You know animal meat like that your body

231
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,250
Your body goes into a serious change internally.

232
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,950
You know there's adrenaline in the meat.

233
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,950
There's blood You know if you can't eat,

234
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,610
but when you're eating the vegetable Whatever your

235
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,550
body's you know in a much calmer state.

236
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,670
You know even like scripture.

237
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,690
You're unclean right right, so I was like

238
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,490
Oh, man, okay.

239
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,210
That's that's like a real interesting bit bit

240
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,990
of trivia right and I saw it work

241
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,930
I mean these guys kind of confused.

242
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,130
I mean about not not Openly and overtly

243
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,290
confused, but definitely we're not on their a

244
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,810
-game right right So I kind of I

245
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,330
kind of settled that back, and then I

246
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,090
found out about Macrobiotics I started putting things

247
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,790
together, then I found out about like what

248
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,310
veganism one day someone said hey Let's go

249
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,290
down to Tompkins Square Park men the Krishna's

250
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,330
are going to be there to have great

251
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,350
food But I mean those guys and you

252
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,850
know robes and all that and it was

253
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,870
the best I mean you know no animal

254
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,730
no onion either because they don't do onion

255
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,350
they do hin instead They think that onion

256
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,470
a bulb is as it brings you down

257
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,290
spiritually, so it's like ah it's gonna be

258
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,770
yeah You know it's probably would be like

259
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,170
macrobiotic pretty plain.

260
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,730
It has to be high quality to taste

261
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,170
good And I ate I was like wow

262
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,890
this was so delicious So then I started

263
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,010
looking for vegan restaurants and that type of

264
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,890
stuff so back 30 years ago I'd say

265
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,410
like between 84 and maybe 86 88 89

266
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,270
I was on this food Discovery it kind

267
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,810
of just got thrown at me or I

268
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,950
ended up being in certain situations that gave

269
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,990
me a different perspective And it basically leaned

270
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,070
Towards not meat is bad, but you know

271
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,050
no meat low meat no meat or low

272
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,730
meat and fish and Understanding the the energies

273
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,550
behind it right now, so and then of

274
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,950
course it came The level of experimentation one

275
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,370
does when you like to prepare food Even

276
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,170
though I grew up in a traditional Greek

277
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,650
family.

278
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,010
I never liked the way the food was

279
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,730
prepared I think the people around me when

280
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,050
I was a child as adults were not

281
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,990
good cooks But they were traditional was still

282
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,370
good, and I mean non.

283
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,390
You know like I Grew up in an

284
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,330
upper-middle-class Jewish neighborhood and most of

285
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,790
the people around did like the food I

286
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,350
didn't think it was that good so at

287
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,010
nine years old.

288
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,630
I started cooking on my own when no

289
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,290
one was around right well So I'm getting

290
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,230
a little bit of this cross-section of

291
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,790
when I'm discussing food.

292
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,370
It's coming from this historical past.

293
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,070
Yeah You see so now you could put

294
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,410
it all together Roughly 30 years ago I

295
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,930
was made aware that Raw meat or rare

296
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,130
meat or meat has a negative effect on

297
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,210
someone's psyche or spirit or mindset when they're

298
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,790
in a critical situation The other thing I

299
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,290
learned about was this thing called Macrobiotics when

300
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,070
the people who started it or brought it

301
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,850
here were still alive and Also various other

302
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,470
experiences at Bacchus Let's say New York City

303
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,530
where there was more of this quote-unquote

304
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,850
alternative food type stuff which again Harkened back

305
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,810
to extremely traditional transplanted methods you know like

306
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,910
ancient Japanese ancient Indian Brought into and you

307
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,190
know the American society, so this is the

308
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,270
perspective of where I learned and how I

309
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,370
continued And it's not I'm rigid about it.

310
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,450
It's that I am I find that the

311
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,270
the high-grade originality that exists in that

312
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,490
type of methodology the Macrobiotic thinking Mediterranean cooking

313
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,890
Asian cooking is high grade What I what

314
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,770
I did was starting to prepare you know

315
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,870
basically whole foods and mostly vegetarian stuff You

316
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,870
know for I was I would say pretty

317
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,990
much five or six years no animal products

318
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,010
and then another several years no meat at

319
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,830
all ever and Occasionally maybe once a year

320
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,790
you know in there.

321
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,690
I might have a burger Because I I'd

322
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,450
go to like Shakespeare and company What's a

323
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,770
burger famous burger joint or Jackson Hole or

324
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,430
whatever and someone would meet and like okay?

325
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,610
I have a burger a lot It's not

326
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,350
even appetizing and I would eat just like

327
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,790
a part of it not a whole you

328
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,370
know one just to taste it And I

329
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,610
was glad that I didn't eat meat because

330
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,490
I noticed the the effects on me, right?

331
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,090
So so again, I've been through this and

332
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,270
I can tell you the fine fineties not

333
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,650
enough in a sonic but I'm laying out

334
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,830
the mindset because I Might say certain things

335
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,790
I might sign harsh to people and subjective

336
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,030
well.

337
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,890
He doesn't like this.

338
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,590
That's his problem I do and he says

339
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,570
this is this and as I know I'm

340
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,710
trying to be as objective as possible and

341
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,690
and show you a Gradation scale high grade

342
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,410
medium grade low grade right because at the

343
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,590
same time when I started preparing foods For

344
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,330
example if you've seen in the chat Of

345
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,150
various aspects I noticed that there was a

346
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,030
higher grade in Mediterranean in Asian No matter

347
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,370
how well you and a lower grade of

348
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,970
course as you got down And it was

349
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,830
culturally involved like Latin American food Caribbean is

350
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,870
lower grade and the lowest grade the white

351
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,930
people food Which in that case is just

352
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,290
doesn't have to be Because if for example

353
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,230
if you want to cook Mediterranean and Asian

354
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,930
you're gonna get you can get most of

355
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,730
it Grown here in the u.s..

356
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,730
Most of its sourced here matter of fact

357
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,470
some of the better rices in the world

358
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,610
or here are Lundberg And they're from California

359
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,870
Right a lot of the really good Japanese

360
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,170
rices are grown in California or Kentucky not

361
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,570
so much anymore But that's another by the

362
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,690
way You know if you ever watching you

363
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,610
Vietnam movies where they show rice patties and

364
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,490
swamps that shot in Kentucky Kentucky's full of

365
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,070
those kinds of it looks just like Vietnam

366
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,730
in certain places right really well Yeah, yeah

367
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,310
like apocalypse now right yeah shot in Kentucky.

368
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,510
Yeah, okay.

369
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,930
I know one of the actors.

370
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,650
Yeah, it's okay anyway So so when I

371
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,150
discuss the high grade and low grade It's

372
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,590
from preparation observation for of the culture the

373
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,930
actual Preparing of the dishes and the way

374
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,970
again back to how the culture presents it

375
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,950
so the for example if you're in a

376
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,430
big city And you go to a macrobiotic

377
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,410
restaurant things will be prepared much better than

378
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,110
if you go to a Dominican or Puerto

379
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,850
Rican restaurant Or South American restaurant, that's for

380
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,830
sure Across them if you go to a

381
00:15:15,830 --> 00:16:24,800
Jap Okay

382
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay you there Great I'm gonna have some

383
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,440
Cheese and bread while we're speaking if you

384
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,340
want to pop this back in at any

385
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,680
time.

386
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,340
That's fine with me We just go on

387
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,520
where we left off Sorry about that folks

388
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,460
internet dropped Yeah, that's okay.

389
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,180
That's that's what happens by the way for

390
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,140
example playing YouTube playlists now They shut it

391
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,060
off after an hour.

392
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
Are you there, and you have to turn

393
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,320
it back up?

394
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
I have it on in the background see

395
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,000
what they'll do is You know like the

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
drug dealer gives you stuff for free the

397
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
internet they're gonna make everything really easily available,

398
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,079
and then they throttle it back and you

399
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,260
watch the Slave livestock complain.

400
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,900
It's a rule.

401
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,119

It's not your country.

421
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
It's not you know That's where you listen

422
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,100
to people on the internet our country our

423
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,920
military really Really, I wouldn't want to take

424
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,060
ownership of that Yeah, what a bunch of

425
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,400
idiots.

426
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,700
You know that so screw them so what

427
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,060
they're doing obviously You have to use the

428
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,900
internet on in good taste as much as

429
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,380
possible.

430
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,580
Yeah, but it's put together by Idiots basically

431
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,420
that are what I call them the geeks

432
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,380
the computer geeks And you're that you have

433
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,400
to agree with what they do and also

434
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,560
their bosses to use it That's why I

435
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,320
don't use a smartphone because I it's very

436
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,940
Subjective it you it's this system is written

437
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,600
to accommodate the mentality of a nine-year

438
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,140
-old girl Girl and I can't use that

439
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,380
What is it called the iPhone or the

440
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,040
Android because it has in it the agenda

441
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,220
in it I see the stupidity or whatever

442
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,480
It's to you know is it possibly be

443
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,240
more objective of course yeah, just be objective

444
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,660
not subjective so anyway Before we got cut

445
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:08,820
off.

446
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,080
I was discussing that many of things.

447
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,320
I want to discuss might sound subjective, but

448
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,600
I want to show Yes, of course it

449
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
can be subjective, but I want to show

450
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,480
why and qualify what I'm saying Basically we're

451
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,020
talking about high grade low grade food preparation

452
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,880
Essentially and ingredients by the way you know

453
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,080
So the high grade highest grade style methodology

454
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,900
ingredients And you know methodologies food preparation and

455
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,420
also that you know the ingredients the way

456
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,940
the ingredients are sourced and grown all that

457
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,860
By far as Mediterranean and Asian food throughout

458
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,520
this planet.

459
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:42,760
Well.

460
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,320
We're talking about this plan Secondary would be

461
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
East Indian if you understood how to use

462
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,900
the what they call spices Right not all

463
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,860
Indian food is spicy by the way You

464
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
know if you if you comprehend that if

465
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,280
you've been to you know various regional or

466
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,760
depending on what tradition unfortunately when you go

467
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,140
and you're in a Western country and you

468
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,960
go to Indian food Greek food Italian food.

469
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
It's it's westernized Right that's of the pallets

470
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,840
adjusted to the palate right okay, so that

471
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,160
would be Mediterranean Asians top grade preparation ingredients

472
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,380
consideration flavor health wise Second would be East

473
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,500
Indian if you understand how to balance the

474
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,200
spices doesn't have to be spicy and the

475
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,880
and then it would be downgraded from there

476
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,160
would be Your Latin based foods, which would

477
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,980
be you know Latin America Caribbean And the

478
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,080
bottom grade would be white people food not

479
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,180
only in America Canada England Ireland Scotland Right

480
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,720
that's why if you go to any big

481
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,020
city.

482
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
You don't see an English restaurant.

483
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,680
They don't even want to do English style

484
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,860
pubs Or Scottish here's an Irish restaurant.

485
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,120
Are you joking are you joking?

486
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,380
You know so anyway That's the idea And

487
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,020
this is this has nothing to do with

488
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,980
your personal preferences has to do when you're

489
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,580
visiting a planet And you're contained in a

490
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,520
human body And you say where am I

491
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,740
going to get low-grade to high-grade

492
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,240
sustenance, and that's the order So if we

493
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,140
want to help people out in a way

494
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,180
that you're putting out something That's going to

495
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,480
make things quote-unquote better food clothing shelter.

496
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,300
Why do we want to talk about?

497
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,420
low-grade white people food or Latin food

498
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,660
you know I say Latin because there is

499
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,740
Latin in Europe and Right, but basically American

500
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,340
side this side we don't talk about that

501
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,620
stuff.

502
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,100
You know if you when we talked about

503
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,180
for example How to make perfect rice?

504
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,380
Yeah, you want to go ahead and make

505
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,140
Mexican food go ahead, but now you got

506
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,280
Rice that no Mexican can make Sorry because

507
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,160
they based they do a traditional like grandma

508
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,880
did right mm-hmm So now you know

509
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,640
how to make rice properly Go ahead, but

510
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,980
it's still low-grade, so we're gonna focus

511
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,280
more on the higher grade Mediterranean Asian South

512
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,200
Maybe some Indian stuff to a certain degree

513
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,100
the The focus is not even a focus

514
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,600
like we're going to talk about how to

515
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
make and prepare things I think like I

516
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,520
did on one sonic Let's talk about the

517
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,460
mindset and how people can prepare their mindset

518
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,460
when they're eating for example The one of

519
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,020
the easiest mindsets to always encounter in your

520
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,840
own self, or you know keep conscious of

521
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,500
is seasonality Right So when you approach seasonality

522
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,560
from a Mediterranean and Asian point of view

523
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,880
When I say Mediterranean it would be the

524
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,820
entire Mediterranean Rim if you look at where

525
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,300
the Mediterranean Sea is all the countries that

526
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,160
are in there on their borders, right?

527
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,660
So it would be the north coast of

528
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,460
the African continent the Levant You could stretch

529
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,920
it all though.

530
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,460
It's interesting when you go east from the

531
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,040
Levant you goes all the way to Persia

532
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,660
to India again Up to Turkey Greece southern

533
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,680
Greece, you know all that area Italy Portugal

534
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,780
right and of course England is interesting how

535
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,540
England is not in there, so Yeah, okay,

536
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,140
so that is the entire area so that

537
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,520
is a sense of regionality That might be

538
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,280
a little warm or out of seasonality or

539
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,100
across latitudes So if you go up to

540
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,240
Japan and look at where the by the

541
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,920
way in terms of Asian food the Japanese

542
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,520
food is The hot cuisine in Asia by

543
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,700
the way the high level right I mean

544
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,000
Of course you know we could talk about

545
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,260
the lower quality overall of The way it's

546
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,740
considered in Western countries about the Chinese because

547
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,200
years ago the Chinese were unwelcomed immigrants And

548
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,020
they people would say well they eat rats

549
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,060
and things like that right or you know

550
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,560
if you want a good Chinese restaurant You

551
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
gotta have white people open it because the

552
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,580
Chinese are dirty, so they've had no they've

553
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,840
had a very bad rap Because they're essentially

554
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,280
very poor like Mexico is very poor most

555
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,220
of the northern part But they also have

556
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,180
a high form of cuisine, which I think

557
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,600
it's a little strange, but you can look

558
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,100
at that Japan and China is across latitude

559
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,600
for the colder regions you see Like You'll

560
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,060
find the use of most popular prolific use

561
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,840
of olive oil in the Mediterranean Will you

562
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,380
find more prolific use of sesame oil in

563
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,680
Asia?

564
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,960
Acquire acquire both of course Sesame oil is

565
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,020
a higher temperature Especially if it's not a

566
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,200
toasted sesame than olive oil olive oil you

567
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,540
should really avoid cooking with it unless you

568
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,320
know how to Should be very low temperature

569
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,060
like if you I've even you can make

570
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,960
dishes like for example if you understand what

571
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,040
poaching is mm-hmm You could poach in

572
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,280
warm olive oil not hot olive oil right

573
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,380
or hot would be no more than 130

574
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,980
Right if you understand right and it kind

575
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,020
of cure it as it has an acidic

576
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,520
flavor and a lot you can do the

577
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,740
same With sesame oil there's something called oil

578
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,440
pulling where you wake up in the morning

579
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,220
and do a teaspoon of oil Yeah Yeah,

580
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,960
you just do a half a teaspoon Sesame

581
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,620
oil raw sesame oil on toasted is the

582
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,380
best because of its new Olive oil might

583
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,240
be a bit acidic What you do is

584
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,120
you just push it around the mouth until

585
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,140
it it feels like it disappears then spit

586
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,480
it out it'll be all foamed up, and

587
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,320
that's really good for drawing things to the

588
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,100
mouth and Re-adjusting frequency like a demagnetizer

589
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,800
on your tape head right when you Okay

590
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,180
There's a some people had really good success

591
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
Some people not so great success, but everyone

592
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,820
who does it feels better.

593
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,860
It's called oil pulling.

594
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,660
There's many Theories and concepts about it.

595
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,480
I could tell you from doing it that

596
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,020
you do feel better It helps stabilize the

597
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,060
entire digestive tract mouth ailments skin Just your

598
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:06,540
overall Vigor increases Sesame oil is probably the

599
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,460
best that I've tried for that So The

600
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,520
reason I bring those to the Mediterranean aspect

601
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,240
up again because sesame oil and olive oil

602
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,640
you need fat Unless you're going to be

603
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,620
steaming and you know doing all that stuff

604
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:19,940
all the time.

605
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,560
You still you do need fat now You

606
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,460
understand that you?

607
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,880
Humanity has been run and guided by really

608
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,320
we use the term terrorists loosely and conservatively

609
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,360
is accurate for over 150 years you've been

610
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,540
terrorized to the hilt.

611
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,260
I mean there's no where to go as

612
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,880
A human being on this planet with any

613
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,720
kind of Interacting with any you know quote

614
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,540
-unquote entitled class you know whether it's academic

615
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,740
governmental religious.

616
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,780
You're being terrorized essentially, right?

617
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,560
so What I mean by that is that

618
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,200
you know back to food If you're going

619
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,860
to consider what I just said about fats

620
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,680
I tell you fats are bad because you

621
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,200
you know why they tell you fats are

622
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,500
bad because that's what you need the most

623
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,820
by the way For your nervous system in

624
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,500
your mind to work clearly So I'll bring

625
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,080
up the concept of fats first always in

626
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,020
a good food conversation So let that sink

627
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,980
in for a minute Are you still there

628
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,480
Bruce or we drop if you don't answer

629
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,780
back?

630
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,640
I think we drop I'm here Okay So

631
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,900
that's fine All right, well, it's not fine,

632
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,660
but you know thanks.

633
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,820
Yeah, okay?

634
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,800
Yeah, if you might just put something in

635
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,600
the text so I know otherwise I'd rather

636
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
stop you find it We're gonna drop again.

637
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,160
Let's say right All right, so those are

638
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,700
your fats in the secondary fats.

639
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
You know a lot of people discuss coconut

640
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,040
cooking with coconut Oil and butter and all

641
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,220
that.

642
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
I don't really think so.

643
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,080
I mean, it's it's there's a There's a

644
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,460
lot of stuff that's praised around there, but

645
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,340
just think about the origin of coconut and

646
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,840
also You can't live on coconuts.

647
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,220
You know you'll die if you just eat

648
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,680
coconut Flesh and water and fat all right

649
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,680
It's one of the few things that you

650
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,640
will die for sure after two weeks if

651
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,000
you eat, so I'm not putting a negative

652
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,640
light on it.

653
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,080
I'm just saying if you consistently live in

654
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,520
an area where that's warm or you are

655
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,340
seasonally making a Dish that requires some fat

656
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,480
and you find it palatable use the coconut.

657
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,000
It's fine, but I Don't have it for

658
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,900
food at all.

659
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,060
I just have it for skin and other

660
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,560
things you know you could use you know

661
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,940
I never really consume it Personally that's where

662
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,180
the subjective aspect comes in.

663
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,800
I don't find it palatable very well very

664
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,520
palatable So I would recommend more of the

665
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,660
olive oil or the sesame oil For your

666
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,680
basic fat, and then of course you switch

667
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,460
over to Animal fats, and I'm not going

668
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,040
to get into discussing canola oil and sunflower

669
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,160
oil and sesame you could do And rapeseed

670
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,060
you know which is canola and you could

671
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,920
look up your oils your peanut oil is

672
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,040
good for high temperature frying you could Get

673
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,800
into your oil study get into your fat

674
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,080
study if you would I Don't look at

675
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,660
what is on the internet conservatively because most

676
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,620
people That do put up articles about this

677
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,800
kind of stuff are just doing it in

678
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,500
a passing way.

679
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,900
They really don't have much experience For example

680
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,560
I knew an editor of food and wine

681
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,080
magazine, and I saw her compiling years ago

682
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,260
Some stuff to be put into print, and

683
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,500
I said well these recipes you just drew

684
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,840
up you never cooked anything Oh, yeah, we

685
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,600
don't need to cook it.

686
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,000
We just kind of imagine, and then we

687
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,840
get some stock photos, and we put it

688
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,940
up, right?

689
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,060
You know I mean It's kind of an

690
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,520
imagined thing so Be careful when you're looking

691
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,720
at recommendations on the internet Which is interesting

692
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,080
because eventually somewhere down the line you might

693
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,100
find this sonic event down the line So

694
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,120
the the next thing To consider would be

695
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,260
animal fats of course If you're going to

696
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,700
provide an animal free Palate or a diet

697
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,620
for yourself, then you wouldn't consider this, but

698
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,880
there's butter various qualities of butter You know

699
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,300
well, then of course.

700
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,740
There's there's the the strict aspect of fat

701
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,940
like tallow like years ago You know if

702
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,060
you work in a restaurant by the way

703
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,640
even now not years ago You shortening for

704
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,120
deep frying right if you've ever worked in

705
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,980
a restaurant the fryer is filled with shortening

706
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,520
Because it's a much higher temperature than an

707
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,780
oil right so just You know for higher

708
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,780
temperature things that coagulated at room temperature Which

709
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,160
would be like a coagulated beef fat right

710
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,460
or vegetable shortening?

711
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,400
Which is not very I find palatable, but

712
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,780
it tastes good when it's fried right Is

713
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,380
is the way that it's done industrially so

714
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,120
that these things need to be considered as

715
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,400
well?

716
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,860
You know chicken fat by the way goose

717
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,920
fat duck fat Did I say goose fat

718
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,840
duck fat and and yeah and chicken fat

719
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,380
are rendered are considered?

720
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,000
To be delicacies with certain dishes as well.

721
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,860
I mean You can research that depending upon

722
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,160
What side you want to go on?

723
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,960
Again vegetarian or animal right right either way

724
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,920
even if you don't consider yourself a vegetarian

725
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,440
by the way And you say I eat

726
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,680
meat.

727
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,500
I would do very little of it if

728
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,780
if you know what I mean Sparsely And

729
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,800
there's also a scriptural reason for it Leviticus

730
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,820
11, I think I'll just you know I'm

731
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,700
not do a To all these patties you

732
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,020
know you could figure out Where it is

733
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,400
and what I mean, I'll just reiterate if

734
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,840
you touch Flesh of a dead animal or

735
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,940
a dead animal you're unclean Usually it's till

736
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,380
noon the next day till your washer.

737
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,580
It could be up to seven days.

738
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,640
That's not specified in there, but you run

739
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,480
clean All right, so if you're eating a

740
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,020
chicken salad sandwich was chicken is allowed or

741
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,200
beef is allowed right It's a to eat

742
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,700
as you know it's not allowed, but it's

743
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,920
it made us fit and proper If you

744
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,320
eat a hamburger Are you touching and parts

745
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,560
of an animal that are dead or an

746
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,800
animal?

747
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,140
It's dead of course right So even though

748
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,580
you're not eating Unclean meat any meat renders

749
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,240
one unclean.

750
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,260
I just want to point that out again

751
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,340
Let that sink in Because Doesn't it it

752
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,900
doesn't say be vegetarian, but doesn't it indirectly

753
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,180
promote vegetarianism you see that's why I say

754
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,000
that Scripture doesn't say you're ready to eat

755
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
a lot of people try to use the

756
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,240
verses Oh, yeah, the green plants and I

757
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,460
was your food and your meat.

758
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,280
You know that I don't know well yeah,

759
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:09,680
okay, that's fine, but Right well, he doesn't

760
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,900
care about food is even just touching yeah,

761
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:19,900
right yeah So you can rationalize Well because

762
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,000
there are animal sacrifices that are consumed right

763
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,620
so, but you know, but then there's washing

764
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,320
That's why I say it's within you know

765
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,120
a day But because there's a priest consume

766
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,580
the sacrifice the evening and the morning sacrifice

767
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,140
right which is right there's two sacrifices almost

768
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,080
you know, so Nonetheless, you know, I don't

769
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,600
like here's interesting thing You notice I haven't

770
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,320
really been getting into many much scriptural discussion

771
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,500
because I put out enough To see if

772
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,180
there's enough people to really get into and

773
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,160
there isn't I'd hate to say People still

774
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,700
just want don't they don't want to really

775
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,420
study I find as a general They want

776
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,740
someone to tell them what it says and

777
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,560
which is very dangerous and not very good

778
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,480
but I Don't blame them because if you

779
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,980
read scripture, by the way The author has

780
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,719
an aversion for stupid people Do you ever

781
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,139
notice that if you read scripture?

782
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,940
Well, if you're one of the stupid people

783
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,480
you may not be you just might have

784
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,600
to put it down But if you ever

785
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,380
try to study scripture, you notice like it's

786
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,280
almost talking down to people that are stupid

787
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,500
Yes, there are stupid people doesn't quite say

788
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,580
that but right.

789
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,760
Yeah If you're slow or you don't get

790
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,960
it or you're censored it taught it talks

791
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,440
down and indirectly against those people Keep saying

792
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,739
the wise will understand.

793
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,840
So anyway, so it's interesting how I watch

794
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,300
people who actually Studies it or attempts to

795
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,900
study it versus those who want to hear

796
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,159
what someone else I say about it And

797
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,520
they it's very difficult for them to study

798
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,000
it because they kind of pick up on

799
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,139
that.

800
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,000
But anyway So back to the food on

801
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,440
the fats There there's a whole level of

802
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,680
consideration when you're coming down to fat and

803
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,040
and when we're talking about high-grade preparation

804
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,960
for example If we're going to bounce back

805
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,720
and forth between vegetarian and non-vegetarian The

806
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,600
second thing would be your protein, you know

807
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,880
What's actually it's all protein and starch if

808
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,160
you look at what they call a protein

809
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,260
and a carbohydrate molecule, you know On the

810
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,180
BS on the bad science, what's the difference

811
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,000
between the carbohydrate and the protein?

812
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,600
On the molecule, you know, can you you

813
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,140
could pull it up?

814
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,940
It's what one nitrogen atom It's all both

815
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,320
carbohydrates and protein are the same except the

816
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,960
protein is a little more nitrogen Okay, this

817
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,600
is at an assay when they burn it

818
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,560
up and to see what's in it, you

819
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,840
know in a Lab or whatever Okay, some

820
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,360
plastics are like that too if you look

821
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,260
at polyethylene or polypropylene, right?

822
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,020
It's just one night nitrogen which is you

823
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,040
know nitrogen and Oxygen and it's ammonia basically,

824
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,020
you know, what do you know ammonia, right?

825
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,400
Okay.

826
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,520
So anyway I'll climb When you think of

827
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,200
things as starches and proteins that's a very

828
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,500
easy way to discuss openly but even though

829
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,360
There's more to it.

830
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,740
Like for example in the vegetarian world, you

831
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,100
know There are aspects of legumes or beans

832
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,000
are considered protein like rice and beans rice

833
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,280
as your starch and the beans as your

834
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,880
protein Yeah, and though, you know, it's mostly

835
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,260
starch still, you know, like nuts are mostly

836
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,360
more protein Base so what is it?

837
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,200
You know, there's something about that nitrogen that

838
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,140
they show in the scientific world that makes

839
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,880
it Different, right?

840
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,160
The animal world they basically think of the

841
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,180
animal as a protein whether it's fish fowl

842
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,840
or for or hooves, right?

843
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,780
So You consider that, you know kind of

844
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,000
a setup When you're preparing a dish and

845
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,420
again when you lean towards the vegetarian side

846
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,420
You're still going to consider a little bit

847
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,180
more starch then more rice than beans for

848
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,140
example More starch than you more bread than

849
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,460
peanut butter, you know, if you make a

850
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,260
PBJ So I'm gonna have to take a

851
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,480
break.

852
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,940
I noticed that's raining outside here.

853
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,220
I need to just prepare a few things

854
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,540
I'll be back in about two minutes.

855
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,820
Okay.

856
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,320
Okay Nope, I'll just mute it out cuz

857
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,420
I'm kind of far I mean the Wi

858
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,120
-Fi may not I mean the the headphones

859
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,320
may not reach I'll be give me another

860
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,240
minute and a half or so Okay, let's

861
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,200
kick it again, okay, I just had to

862
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,880
cover up some things I Personally, okay, so

863
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,340
I could tell you objectively and subjectively coconut

864
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,280
Should get the wrap that soy does, you

865
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,960
know, soy has gotten a really bad rep

866
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,940
Mm-hmm, right don't eat soy.

867
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,980
It really should be the coconut for different

868
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,040
reasons Now that's the more of a subjective

869
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,880
more objective is it's tropical It's handled here,

870
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,600
let's think of it this way do yourself

871
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600
an experiment do yourself a favor do yourself

872
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,800
an investigation Seek out real high quality coconut

873
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,120
products organic whatever high quality Even though if

874
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,600
it costs just don't get a you know

875
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,500
let's get a sample if you can because

876
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,300
it's going to be very expensive compared to

877
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,200
the regular stuff and Taste it and you'll

878
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,140
notice I had to taste nothing like the

879
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,380
stuff.

880
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,240
That's Normally out there.

881
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,420
All right, it's over it's an overused product

882
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,920
set coffee Soy Has a bad rap because

883
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,540
they decided not to grow the higher grades

884
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,120
because they take longer and they need more

885
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,600
water and all that Basically what everyone is

886
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,380
eating a soy and they said it's bad

887
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,320
For you and many different levels is because

888
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,920
they're eating animal grade soy Right.

889
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,380
Yeah, very low grade just like there's low

890
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,900
-grade wheat that causes Gluten intolerance, right?

891
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,400
It's a higher minute.

892
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,680
It's a mineralized gluten versus a more flexible

893
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,180
protein-based gluten So these these labels so

894
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,120
again Subjectively, I could tell you I don't

895
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,000
like the way coconut tastes in food.

896
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,460
I like coconut milk For example when I'm

897
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,280
cooking Thai food Because the Thai the cultural

898
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,740
now if you look at the cultures that

899
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,200
use a lot of coconut milk The other

900
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,700
ingredients in the dishes balanced it out Think

901
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,240
of it if you're making a Thai soup

902
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,640
like which I do I poach chicken And

903
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,860
make a chicken broth and I roast red

904
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,660
pepper and I use kefir lime leaves I

905
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,160
use basil bay leaf sugar and some fish

906
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,960
sauce, which is basically rotten anchovy juice And

907
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,680
I and whenever I make this for quote

908
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
-unquote white people They say it's the most

909
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,920
delicious thing they've ever tasted unless they're familiar

910
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,200
with Thai soup And when they do have

911
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,340
the Thai soup to say well, this is

912
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,820
better than I've had out, you know Well

913
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,680
the kefir lime think about lime, you know,

914
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,440
you have citrus lemon and orange if you

915
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,060
ever have lime It's very bitter at lime

916
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,940
is a very strong flavor, right?

917
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,560
Mm-hmm.

918
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,980
If you're familiar with lime, it's one of

919
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,620
the strongest citrus flavors Okay, that goes after

920
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,900
the coconut and then you have the fish

921
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,680
sauce, which is an extremely sharp.

922
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,160
Umami It's like a room imagine a fish

923
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,860
a fishy Romano cheese or Parmesan cheese is

924
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,320
what the fish sauce is like and then

925
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,300
you have bay leaf right or laurel leaf

926
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,520
and The meat you see so it balances

927
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:32,840
out.

928
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,180
So I've just given it and the sugar

929
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,780
of course and you use palm sugar You're

930
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,320
not cane sugar if you can get it.

931
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,740
It's a different flavor as well, right?

932
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,520
You know when you read about a lot

933
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,260
of these Thai food Recipes or Vietnamese where

934
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,340
there's sugar being used.

935
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,420
It's a palm sugar comes from a palm

936
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,660
tree Different type again different energy, but you

937
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,920
know, essentially if you look at a large

938
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,620
palm, it looks like a cane anyway, I

939
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,500
mean but similar so again, I just gave

940
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,680
an example with kind of avoiding the whole

941
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,260
idea of Saying as coconut milk or coconut

942
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,280
butter or coconut oil good or bad.

943
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,040
Well There's something about good traditions that consider

944
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,100
the qualitative aspect of food combination with good

945
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,060
recipes That balance out all the ingredients you

946
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,960
see So if you're having Thai food and

947
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,420
you're trying to master meth Thai methodologies food

948
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,940
preparation and all that You will see cook

949
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,060
a lot of coconut milk or frequently coconut

950
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,220
milk being incorporated and it correctly done But

951
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,620
if you're going to make a grilled cheese

952
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,000
sandwich and you put coconut fat on the

953
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,400
outside Instead of mayonnaise, that's stupid.

954
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,500
Yeah, you're torturing yourself unless you're into that

955
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,600
Right, or if you're going to make fried

956
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,200
vegetable fried rice and you use coconut fat,

957
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,520
that's stupid.

958
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,420
Yeah It doesn't balance out, you know use

959
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,100
sesame oil or peanut oil Right.

960
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,100
I mean that's in my opinion in other

961
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,240
words for years I've been exposed to it.

962
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,500
I'm like, dude, you've cooked you used coconut

963
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,180
oil on this right?

964
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,060
Yeah, I could tell it just coats my

965
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,560
mouth With like this oily slick feeling and

966
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,140
it detracts from tasting certain things Yeah, you

967
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,060
know don't use it.

968
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,260
You know, it's like well, I like it.

969
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,260
Well, okay try peanut oil or sesame oil

970
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,480
on this instead Okay, as they come back

971
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,960
usually say it's better, but I still I'm

972
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,220
going to use the coconut You know everyone's

973
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,740
people in other words people still have their

974
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,160
ideas I'm not trying to get into anyone's

975
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,400
head I don't want to get anyone's head

976
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
and I don't want to know what's in

977
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,760
your head The thing is I just want

978
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,520
to put out the information so at least

979
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,540
people can you know?

980
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,340
Resort to something because there's very little real

981
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,820
talk going on anywhere anymore, so again The

982
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,300
first thing I said about methodology and mindset

983
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,580
is seasonality, right?

984
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,980
When you do seasonality you consider cross-latitude

985
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:06,620
like for example places like Malaysia, Thailand Northern

986
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,060
coast of Africa are pretty much locked near

987
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,880
the equator All right, and what do you

988
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,980
know about those areas?

989
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,300
Well, they do have seasons They have rainy

990
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,960
season and very rainy season right and and

991
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,500
very very hot and then very very hot

992
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,980
right, right, actually, they do have about a

993
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:29,460
week's worth of winter, but Nonetheless Those are

994
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,700
interesting places to run to for the the

995
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,320
hot side and then you have the cold

996
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,400
side Which would be northern northern let's say

997
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,660
Russia or which I don't know what they're

998
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,380
really cooking there.

999
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,300
They just Not much just meat they hang

1000
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,420
out.

1001
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,840
They just shoot a deer and hang it

1002
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,060
up in the shed They don't even because

1003
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,720
it's freezing there all year round You know

1004
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,020
when you want some meat you go out

1005
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,520
with a chainsaw right anyway Smack off of

1006
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,540
these Yeah, but you go northern China right

1007
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,980
northern like Japan right northern Europe you can

1008
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,760
end up in bad food territory, but you

1009
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,080
see so okay, so again you look exactly

1010
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,020
where the The culture or the latitude is

1011
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,780
based on the season that you are in

1012
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,080
So when it's summertime where you are or

1013
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,960
hot Depending on how hot it is or

1014
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,940
warm go to the warmer climates pull out

1015
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,660
some dishes when it's cold where you are

1016
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,300
Depending on how cold again you go to

1017
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,960
Cold places and pull out some dishes.

1018
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
So now you've getting the variety from all

1019
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,940
over the world now again Just to go

1020
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,200
back to refer back to the concept of

1021
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,480
coconut milk and coconut butter and all this

1022
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,020
Pulling out one ingredient and Detracting it from

1023
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,000
the situation that it exists in culturally and

1024
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,960
traditionally like in a recipe is Is I

1025
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,480
wouldn't say a mistake, but?

1026
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,300
Not good for beginners Right when you're more

1027
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,520
on a journeyman a mastership level you can

1028
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,740
start experimenting understand the quality One day we'll

1029
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,020
talk about how to discover.

1030
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,440
What quality is and how do you discover

1031
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,460
the quality of the thing right?

1032
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,260
Qualitative measurement like if you look at all

1033
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,440
your measurements all of your metrics are always

1034
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,200
quantities or how many pounds is it how

1035
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,640
many inches?

1036
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,080
How many meters how many?

1037
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,640
What's the temperature?

1038
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,580
It's all never a quality, right?

1039
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,920
so same with Food so so again if

1040
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,300
you're going to pull out an ingredient.

1041
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,300
Let's say you say coconut again Whether it's

1042
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,820
the milk the butter the fat well Traditionally

1043
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,820
culturally the people who have mastered the use

1044
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,800
of that are the tie right and other

1045
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,160
others as well So I would use I

1046
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,280
have coconut milk and other things like that,

1047
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,780
and I use them when I make Thai

1048
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Recipe food right if I make pad Thai

1049
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,720
if I make a Thai soup, right?

1050
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,580
But if I'm going to do another if

1051
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
I do let's say Japanese There's even just

1052
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,600
a plain beans and rice or fried rice

1053
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,720
or a sandwich.

1054
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,260
I would not I would not use coconut

1055
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,660
I would restrict it For the simplicity of

1056
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,720
getting the best outcome to where it came

1057
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,280
from originally traditionally combined, right?

1058
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,320
so That's one way to think of your

1059
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:11,900
ingredients.

1060
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,180
I would avoid any kind of trend logic

1061
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,700
Trend thinking you know where people kind of

1062
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,560
say well fat is bad for you Or

1063
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,600
soy is bad or coconut is good, or

1064
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,900
you know plastic food has to be wrapped

1065
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,400
in plastic Otherwise, it's no good, or you

1066
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,680
know all this stuff, or you know the

1067
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:30,940
safe.

1068
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,060
You know what kills me really in terms

1069
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,240
of having enthusiasm Especially with Westerners is the

1070
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,280
food safety rules food borne diseases When you

1071
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,060
research like you know this plate You know

1072
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,420
the reason it has nothing to do whether

1073
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,000
it's still going to make you sick even

1074
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,820
if it's cooked Those pathogens are still there

1075
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,740
So if they tell you this chicken has

1076
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,600
to be cooked or these eggs have to

1077
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,800
be cooked Or you might get a food

1078
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,680
borne illness that is not because inherently chickens

1079
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,300
or meat or fish or eggs will make

1080
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,560
you sick That's not true.

1081
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,280
It's because the quality of it is it's

1082
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,380
either diseased from the get-go in other

1083
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,160
words the factory has disease They've tainted it

1084
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,140
with disease by the way and or it's

1085
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,040
just poor you know All around so you

1086
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,580
shouldn't be eating it anyway The transportation of

1087
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,720
it is caused ill effect also sure sure

1088
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,280
so it's a Yeah, yeah very bad question

1089
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,420
if someone says that chicken will get you

1090
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,340
sick if you don't cook it properly Then

1091
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,620
you don't want to eat it cooked or

1092
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,180
uncooked.

1093
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,040
It's sick.

1094
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,220
You don't want to eat sick food So

1095
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,740
what does that tell you that renders about

1096
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,400
90% of the the aspects of eating

1097
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,660
out or what you can buy?

1098
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,680
You know, but that's okay You know if

1099
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,600
it's not like you're open, I mean, it's

1100
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,000
not okay, but it's not like you're open

1101
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,420
for a society That's going to be around

1102
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,020
for much longer So I mean that's okay.

1103
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,020
So just cook it or just just keep

1104
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,960
that in the back of your mind qualitatively

1105
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,200
Food borne diseases are because the food supply

1106
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,980
is diseased The animals the vegetables whatever are

1107
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,020
diseased not you know, right?

1108
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,140
It's a current condition thing Okay, so in

1109
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,560
terms of going back or we discussed the

1110
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,420
fats basically and then a little bit of

1111
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:25,280
proteins and starches To go into the aspect

1112
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,040
of quality really is where it's at You

1113
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,480
know, there's many I was thinking part of

1114
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,740
my mind, you know, we discussed certain food

1115
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,880
preparations But I don't think that's really necessary

1116
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,740
The aspect of I think good food discussion,

1117
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,580
you know, I brought up the the various

1118
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,340
grades, you know higher grade to low grade

1119
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,740
And if anyone wants to consider that they

1120
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,460
should you know, look into it a little

1121
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,680
bit more When you get going back to

1122
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,660
quality a high grade would be Mediterranean and

1123
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,020
Asian Mediterranean would be Pacific the Mediterranean Rim

1124
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,600
all those countries Northern Africa all of Southern

1125
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,840
Europe East West to the Levant and Asian

1126
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
and Asian the highest grade would be Japanese

1127
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,640
without a doubt and then Chinese, of course

1128
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,300
in most of the Pacific Rim Area like

1129
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,080
Thai Vietnam.

1130
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,140
The only reason Vietnam Vietnamese cooking has gotten

1131
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,360
popular is because of pho You know pho

1132
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,740
pho soup and that was created by demand

1133
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,840
by the French occupiers Right.

1134
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,460
Otherwise, they were eating pretty Slop and they're

1135
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,960
very poor people.

1136
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,420
They basically ate Very either very fresh food

1137
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,080
or just slop gruel and things like that

1138
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,200
when the French got there They demanded finer

1139
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,440
pastries finer application, you know, there's also a

1140
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,160
Chinese influence because China invaded several times unsuccessfully

1141
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,980
because Viennese are overfighting back but Make a

1142
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,180
point of that.

1143
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,460
There's an there's every country also has an

1144
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,420
influence So the highest grade in Asia would

1145
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,100
be Japanese.

1146
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,880
So what do you know about Japanese food?

1147
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,100
Right nothing probably for most people so you

1148
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,140
have to study that there's no reason to

1149
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,660
do a sonic on that Specifically or Mediterranean

1150
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,120
food to do a sonic on that specifically

1151
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,440
because what do you know about it?

1152
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,600
Nothing, if you don't know anything about it

1153
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,480
I don't think I need to if we're

1154
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,960
going to discuss on how to master these

1155
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,260
things and you're on apprentice level You need

1156
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,660
to do a lot of homework on your

1157
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,240
own Like a pretty study on your own

1158
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,840
But at least we're setting the mindset and

1159
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,300
why not just have this mindset and that's

1160
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,960
the way it is Sorry, no, but why

1161
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,860
why it's them set you see now essentially

1162
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,400
for the quality Also, it's something called freshness.

1163
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,280
And what does that mean?

1164
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,720
Well, you're being bombarded with.

1165
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,600
Oh, yeah, it's vacuum packed to seal in

1166
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,440
freshness bullshit Impact creates anaerobic condition means lack

1167
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,220
of occupy another it breeds an entirely different

1168
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,680
set of pathogens Yeah, right look up aerobic

1169
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,940
and not anaerobic Now I noticed before we

1170
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,080
get on to a little bit more on

1171
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,940
the quality side and keeping things Well, actually,

1172
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,220
let me just say this thing and then

1173
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,780
I want to get into the pickling and

1174
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,280
preservation of food because that's important There's something

1175
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,180
you're going to someone's house especially white people

1176
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,640
you open the fridge and it's jam-packed

1177
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,980
to the front and they just eat Off

1178
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,340
the front and then they pull something out

1179
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:21,680
of the bag.

1180
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,900
I think this is still good I don't

1181
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,020
remember when I made it though.

1182
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,740
Yes Yeah, right.

1183
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,640
There's a three-day rule That's a food

1184
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,040
or the other a cabinet with spices in

1185
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,300
the back that you never remember buying But

1186
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,620
they're there and you look at the date

1187
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,040
and they expired six years ago.

1188
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,420
Well, that's that's what I call the food

1189
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,260
ZM All right, the food museum Okay, you

1190
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,320
should Seasonally really if you're active seasonally clean

1191
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,320
out your fridge or you know spring Actually,

1192
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,660
if you just did it spring and fall

1193
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,500
would be enough Empty everything out of your

1194
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,800
food storage pantry refrigerator and all that and

1195
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,420
go through and throw away anything that you're

1196
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,900
not using or give It to someone who

1197
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,600
might right because if or you there is

1198
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,880
something that you need as a backup.

1199
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,460
That's fine.

1200
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,800
Keep it there the The aspect of when

1201
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,480
you prepare a meal three-day rule Three

1202
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,320
you'll see the three-day rule everywhere by

1203
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,240
the way in in the legal and law

1204
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,080
you'll see it and yeah 72 hours So

1205
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,580
in other words, you can you can bend

1206
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:15,940
it likely.

1207
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,780
Let's say you make something tonight It can

1208
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,200
count.

1209
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,040
It doesn't have to count for the whole

1210
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,340
day.

1211
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,720
In other words tomorrow night will be just

1212
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,580
be one day Right, right and then the

1213
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,740
next night is two days and the next

1214
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,260
night is three days So you could still

1215
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,460
eat it on the fourth right because it's

1216
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,720
really in it as a dish It's been

1217
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,180
in existence only for 72 plus hours, but

1218
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,280
that's about the limit Okay All right.

1219
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,660
So that leads us into pickling because pickling

1220
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,240
pickling and pickles are Food that's prepared or

1221
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,340
preserved and stored for more than three days

1222
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,360
The 72-hour rule is for foods you

1223
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,360
prepare dishes not pickles Before we get into

1224
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,560
pickling though, which I've discussed how it changes

1225
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,840
something for seasonality as someone had put a

1226
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,620
good I'm outside right now, by the way,

1227
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,540
meaning outdoors laptop.

1228
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,440
I'm all the way on the other end

1229
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,320
of the garden here So I might go

1230
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,040
inside have the chat on the other.

1231
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,440
Let me know if there's anything No, the

1232
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,900
reason I threw this in is because there

1233
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,500
was something in chat about it was answered

1234
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,060
Well, I forgot who answered it really there

1235
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,340
was odds and end I or someone.

1236
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,020
Yeah, or someone else answered it very properly

1237
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,720
that's very impressive to see that someone's listening,

1238
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,500
but You know, I give the analogy before

1239
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,520
about pickles, but before we get into pickle

1240
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,260
We have never discussed dehydration of food Because

1241
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,040
when you dehydrate food, which is basically drying

1242
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,960
it quickly right There are many ways of

1243
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,560
doing it.

1244
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,420
You don't have to buy a food Dehydrator

1245
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,000
actually if you went out and bought one,

1246
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,700
you'd be surprised as an empty box with

1247
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,480
a fan and maybe a heating element right

1248
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,720
Yeah, even an industrial one that cost 10

1249
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,160
grand It's just a big-ass box with

1250
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,040
screens and a fan and a heating element.

1251
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,560
I mean a tiny heating element, right?

1252
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,300
So get creative Basically to dehydrate food successfully

1253
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,400
need air circulation.

1254
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,120
Yeah, you could do a very simple of

1255
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,520
dehydrator if you have an oven I always

1256
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,640
like doing stuff stovetop But basically preheat the

1257
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,360
oven to 200 shut it off gets all

1258
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,320
the humidity out of there Then put whatever

1259
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,720
you want to dry on a rack and

1260
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,540
leave it there overnight If it's a good

1261
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,880
sealing up and then you'll come back.

1262
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,460
It'll be pretty drop But you've got to

1263
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,300
preheat the oven not hot and let it

1264
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,440
cool down without it being open that Pushes

1265
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,180
all pumps all the humidity out, right?

1266
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,560
Right and also most ovens do have a

1267
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,320
vent if you notice in the back There's

1268
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,100
a little hole holes and they do vent

1269
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,840
out to somewhere, you know If you go

1270
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,800
to someone's kitchen you see so what's this,

1271
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,120
you know, ah, it's really hot.

1272
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,720
Why is it hot?

1273
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,140
Well, it's venting out the oven, right?

1274
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,340
Okay Okay, so you you got to make

1275
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,140
sure that that you can have a little

1276
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,120
fan and that you could convert any oven

1277
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,740
into a dehydrator So also since we're on

1278
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,180
the topic of ovens if you ever want

1279
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,960
to get a bitchin You know a kick

1280
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,940
-ass broiler or oven for making homemade pizza.

1281
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,360
I have a indoor oven a gas stove

1282
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,260
It's a Roper stove.

1283
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,720
It looks like a restaurant kind of stove,

1284
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,620
but it's got a big cavity so all

1285
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,040
I did was basically raise the tray the

1286
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,180
bottom of Solid panel over the burner and

1287
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,740
I replaced that with a grill and I

1288
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,500
put aluminum foil on that So there's a

1289
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,960
very tiny so now instead of the oven

1290
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,160
being 2 by 2 by 3 is now

1291
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,920
6 inches by 2 by 2 And it's

1292
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,200
sealed.

1293
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,420
So when I turn that on the thermostat

1294
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,720
says it's 250, but it's 500 When the

1295
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,940
thermostat says it's 500 at 750 and you

1296
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,520
throw a pizza in there that you just

1297
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,840
made it'll cook in five minutes Perfectly, right

1298
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,700
Wow Basically kill the volume in your stove,

1299
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,360
right?

1300
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,940
You know how the bottom of a stove

1301
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,720
on the burner, right?

1302
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,360
You just move the steel tray up and

1303
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,980
you put this the rack where the tree

1304
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,980
was so now you got a tiny little

1305
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,900
compartment and I'll get super hot if you

1306
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,140
have a You know, once you go above

1307
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,200
six or seven hundred, you don't use thermometers

1308
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,340
anymore use what's called a pyrometer Mmm, right.

1309
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,380
That's why you'll see thermometers is digital ones.

1310
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,080
They say just eight high They won't read

1311
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,660
over five or six hundred six or seven

1312
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,280
six fifty.

1313
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,320
They go blank you above that You need

1314
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,440
what's called a pyrometer Which is different those

1315
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,620
go from 700 up to a couple thousand

1316
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,060
depending on the rating So if you have

1317
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,620
a pyrometer, you could see you could approach

1318
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,540
a eight nine hundred.

1319
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,400
The only problem is in a residential Stove

1320
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,280
when you rig it like that the insulation

1321
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,280
and the knobs and the fittings and the

1322
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,660
gaskets are not Can't take that kind of

1323
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,260
heat for long.

1324
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,520
So this is just for an eight-minute

1325
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,520
pizza cook, right?

1326
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,320
Because pizza doesn't taste good unless it's cooked

1327
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,100
at high temperature.

1328
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,560
It's got to be over five or six

1329
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,700
hundred Even though the The white people pizza

1330
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,060
spots tell you it's 450.

1331
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,380
That's not real pizza.

1332
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,540
That's just slow baked That's just fast baked

1333
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,640
bread fast baked bread and pizza to get

1334
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,120
different.

1335
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,360
Mm-hmm so We're throwing that about an

1336
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,340
oven only to make it a dehydrator So

1337
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,780
basically need air movement air movement and low

1338
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,920
humidity to dehydrate food Obviously the thinner you

1339
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,420
cut it the more efficient it will be

1340
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,820
dehydrated You can do fruit and meat that

1341
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,680
way as well and you could dehydrate bread

1342
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,400
It's called croutons or breadcrumbs, right?

1343
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,460
You can't make it's different than toast You

1344
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,960
know You know breadcrumbs are basically dehydrated by

1345
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,280
the way in the Middle East What they

1346
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,880
do is they dehydrate loaves of bread and

1347
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,460
they throw it in the camel sack And

1348
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,760
then when they're going on a long trip

1349
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,380
if you have water Submerge the loaf of

1350
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,160
bread in the water and it reconstitutes and

1351
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,080
it tastes totally different than fresh paper, but

1352
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,100
you have bread Are you familiar with that

1353
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:39,320
tech?

1354
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,880
Yeah Yeah, yeah, it's really good if you

1355
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,720
have that kind of bread will last for

1356
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,940
years if you do it, right Like if

1357
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,840
you're gonna urgency kid if you have a

1358
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,460
first aid kit in the car emergency kit

1359
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,520
Do you get some of those biscuits dry

1360
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,900
biscuits?

1361
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,540
They serve for babies when they're teething.

1362
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,540
Those are pretty well preserved Forgot what they're

1363
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:58,880
called.

1364
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,080
They look like little miniature slices of bread

1365
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:01,220
here.

1366
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,200
Mm-hmm Yeah, yeah, keep those in the

1367
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,860
car because they have a shelf life for

1368
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,160
10 years Yeah, and if you get a

1369
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,920
heartier bread and you just don't you have

1370
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,520
a hot drink you just dunk it and

1371
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,220
reconstitutes it Those crackers if the the biscuits

1372
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,280
for child teething on the someone's they sell

1373
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,920
basically on the market if you do dunk

1374
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,720
them They'll dissolve.

1375
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,360
Yeah, you need to work.

1376
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,660
You need a high gluten bread You know

1377
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,360
like for example, you know a bagel take

1378
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,040
a was just high gluten dehydrate that you

1379
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,540
know If you you know, if you threw

1380
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,040
it across the room, you'll give someone a

1381
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,020
concussion You can't you can't eat it and

1382
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,740
you can't crush it.

1383
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,260
It's too hard because of the gluten fiber

1384
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,420
But if you soak it in water, you'll

1385
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,780
get a bagel Like you're not a fresh

1386
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,240
bagel, but you'll have a you know a

1387
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,600
bagel you can chew on This is an

1388
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,780
important staple in Middle East countries If you've

1389
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,400
ever been in the Middle East or know

1390
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,500
people that do they still traditionally do that?

1391
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,060
They'll bake a loaf of fresh bread They'll

1392
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,100
slice it and then dehydrate it and put

1393
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,740
it away and then when they're ready to

1394
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,300
use it They dunk it in hot soup

1395
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,700
or tea or water and it reconstitutes it

1396
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,820
Yeah, so the so instead of these dumb

1397
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,040
white people that try to do the the

1398
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,340
They have these trends where they do the

1399
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,880
survivalists and the send away for our powdered

1400
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,100
this and powdered survival kit and all that

1401
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,000
That's such a joke, you know, they're basically

1402
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,080
selling you MREs MSG and garbage Yeah, and

1403
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,520
you end up paying ten dollars a pound

1404
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,480
for it when you do the math, right?

1405
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,620
You know ten dollars a pound you can

1406
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,820
get rip Yeah, so all you have to

1407
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,080
do is know how to actually preserve things

1408
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,080
without using chemicals Dehydration is a good way

1409
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,040
But the only thing is mold can build

1410
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,040
on it mold can build on certain spores

1411
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,820
and sugars on meat So you might want

1412
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,640
to add like if you want to make

1413
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,700
homemade beef jerky or any kind of jerky

1414
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,880
or even a You know any kind of

1415
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,580
fish or whatever also you dunk it in

1416
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,200
salt water first You know You cut all

1417
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,060
your strips and you you put yours literally

1418
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,340
literally on a clothesline with clothes pins or

1419
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,500
something Or thread them through a rope with

1420
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,420
a distance between you can imagine what that

1421
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,300
looks like Or a string and then you

1422
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,980
dunk it in salt water or I do

1423
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,540
tamari and sugar which is water salt sugar

1424
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,780
tamari which is like a soy sauce and

1425
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,160
Some sugar and and then I dehydrate it

1426
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,180
like that That's what you know when you

1427
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,620
go out and buy a beef jerky, by

1428
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,320
the way, that's what it's it's it's treated

1429
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,520
It has it's been dunked in a in

1430
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,320
liquor of some kind when I say liquor

1431
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,500
meaning, you know It's a salty sweet kind

1432
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,980
of mixture you ever notice Yeah, okay now

1433
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,840
you can also dehydrate notice there was something

1434
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,540
in the chat yesterday from memory regarding squash

1435
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,280
twice You can dehydrate Kale you can dehydrate

1436
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,920
Actually, as a matter of fact the Trader

1437
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,140
Joe's sells Kale chips or dehydrated super delicious

1438
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,940
if you know what to do with it

1439
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:57,620
or how to do it.

1440
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,260
I you could do it by you know

1441
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,260
what miso is a chickpea miso or just

1442
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,810
me so mix that with water and Filter

1443
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:05,990
it out and put it in a spray

1444
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,410
bottle and you spray the leaves of that

1445
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,870
when the miso dehydrates is super umami super

1446
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,270
delicious But you could you could make chips

1447
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,430
you could dehydrate the squash and all that

1448
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,150
Right, and what's interesting when you dehydrate certain

1449
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,010
foods, you can process them differently in other

1450
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,190
words You can let's say make squash chips

1451
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,170
and put them in the blender and blend

1452
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,590
them if they're dry enough And then you

1453
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:30,830
have this squash dry powder that you can

1454
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,510
add hot water to and make an instant

1455
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,930
squash soup right this is for for You

1456
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,470
know packing stuff away So, okay.

1457
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,490
Also when you dehydrate it changes things again

1458
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,010
Right, right.

1459
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,110
Have you ever had dehydrated?

1460
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,550
I've ever had banana chips or plantain chips.

1461
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,210
You ever seen those?

1462
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,650
They're delicious and they don't taste anything like

1463
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,010
bananas.

1464
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,530
No, I mean they do You have a

1465
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,110
hint of it.

1466
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:02,610
Yeah Right, so we've never got into dehydration

1467
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:06,130
And it's viable traditionally there is much dehydration

1468
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,150
if you look at The majority of the

1469
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,530
Japanese and Asian condiments are what?

1470
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:17,050
dehydrated Actually, most condiments are dehydrated herbs black

1471
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:17,390
pepper.

1472
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,530
You ever had fresh peppercorn instead of no

1473
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,010
black pepper.

1474
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,230
It's very different Yeah, it's delicious.

1475
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,130
You drop it in.

1476
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,450
Yeah, okay Fresh pepper.

1477
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,850
Yeah, so so all most of your condiments

1478
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:30,250
and the spices and things that people interact

1479
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,330
with pasta, for example, that's dehydrated You ever

1480
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,670
get a thing of spaghetti right or fettuccine?

1481
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:36,570
That's dehydrated.

1482
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,110
It's fresh pasta is dehydrated Does it change

1483
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,250
it?

1484
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,770
Yes, it does as a matter of fact

1485
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:44,170
that when you have fresh pasta If you

1486
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:46,230
blindfolded me and gave me fresh pasta and

1487
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,930
dehydrated pasta, which is nothing wrong with I

1488
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,310
could tell you which one was fresh And

1489
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,090
which one was it?

1490
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:58,390
right so most people can That's why certain

1491
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,950
pastas now are for like raviolis are best

1492
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,390
frozen because the filling shouldn't be dehydrated like

1493
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,770
a cheese or something Also, you can get

1494
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,590
into the habit which I've mentioned before when

1495
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,490
it comes to pasta, it's just Clean your

1496
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,870
counter put some flour you could use flour

1497
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:19,150
barley wheat, whatever Make a well drop an

1498
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,130
egg in water a little bit of water

1499
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,210
oil and an egg Beat it in place

1500
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,030
in the well right on the counter make

1501
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,090
sure it doesn't the well doesn't open and

1502
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,970
spill on the floor or spread out too

1503
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,350
far and start making yourself a nice little

1504
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,530
ball add flour or add liquid if it's

1505
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:38,030
too dry if it's too wet and And

1506
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,870
roll it out roll it out as thin

1507
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,890
as you can if you don't have a

1508
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,890
rolling pin use a wine bottle wine bottles

1509
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,670
make great rolling pins and and Then you

1510
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,330
score it roll it put lots of flour

1511
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,450
and you got your fresh pasta there you

1512
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,190
make two sheets And you could you could

1513
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,130
make a filling of some sort and put

1514
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,090
a dollop Spaced out two inches apart all

1515
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,650
around and put the other sheet over press

1516
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,790
it down and cut it now you got

1517
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,710
ravioli, right?

1518
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,130
See what I mean See how easy this

1519
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:11,270
is to make Okay, well often I would

1520
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:15,730
have people Well, it's amazing when you make

1521
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,390
it fresh yourself always put an egg in

1522
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,830
it don't go with the eggless pasta Always

1523
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,290
put or some kind of protein if you

1524
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,030
if you're going to this is where your

1525
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,230
squash paste comes in right You could put

1526
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,810
some Bean paste in it also, but make

1527
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,970
a just a point here I always used

1528
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,790
to make a well very often fresh pasta

1529
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,090
and people is the best pasta I read

1530
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,110
as I just made it And they're like,

1531
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,830
what do you mean?

1532
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,490
We were just talking.

1533
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:39,850
What do you mean?

1534
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,070
You just made I didn't see you make

1535
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,270
it Right.

1536
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,170
I mean, that's how easy when you get

1537
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,070
used to making it, you know, someone would

1538
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,270
sit down I'm in the kitchen and we're

1539
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:47,590
speaking.

1540
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,150
I'm just put the flour out Make a

1541
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,690
well put the liquid a drop an egg

1542
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,710
in there mix it up with some olive

1543
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:55,210
oil Maybe some salt and raw as we're

1544
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:57,690
still talking in real time right now as

1545
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,930
I'm speaking you So also the kitchen I've

1546
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,350
set up is not set up with cabinet

1547
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,090
doors and all that I have a very

1548
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,730
long shelves that slide out So, you know

1549
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,810
when you go into a regular kitchen You

1550
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,670
have to open all these drawers and doors

1551
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,390
to look for stuff.

1552
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:14,310
Everything is exposed, you know, it's just Shelves

1553
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,810
that slide out and then of course there's

1554
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,170
a front to it, you know for pots

1555
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,590
and pans ingredients So basically, you know, you

1556
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,050
can open it with your leg reach in

1557
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:21,610
with your hand.

1558
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,310
Everything's there close it with your leg, you

1559
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,490
know So anyway, I could be in real

1560
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,210
time as I brought up the pasta subject

1561
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,530
and if the water were going we'd be

1562
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,870
eating pasta In another minute.

1563
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,990
This is how fast it can be done

1564
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,930
It's like second nature.

1565
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,510
Yeah, right As a matter of fact, I'll

1566
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,950
do it faster I'll have a pasta dish

1567
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,710
ready for you faster than if you had

1568
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,290
the dry pasta because guess what?

1569
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,970
The fresh pasta you dunk in water for

1570
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:48,610
a minute and a half, right?

1571
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:50,470
How long does it take how long do

1572
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,410
you have to wait for the dry at

1573
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,430
least 10 you say 8 to 10 minutes?

1574
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,270
It may be 15 in some cases depending

1575
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,430
on how thick it is So in this

1576
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:00,930
case if I as long as I have

1577
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,550
all my pasta pre cut and formed in

1578
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,290
less than 10 minutes You're eating sooner You

1579
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,210
see how fast it is And I want

1580
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,710
to bring up also if you instead of

1581
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,610
bringing up a whole pot of boiling water

1582
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,030
when you want to boil something Just figure

1583
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,750
out how tall your ingredients are in the

1584
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,850
pot and put much water to cover the

1585
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,130
ingredient And then have another pot on the

1586
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,550
side like a kettle with water going So

1587
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,270
then you put let's say your pasta and

1588
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,970
you just cover it with water An inch

1589
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,790
or so that comes to boil much faster

1590
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,790
than a big pot, right?

1591
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,950
Right, and then as it's coming to a

1592
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,430
boil you add water from the next pot

1593
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,990
next to this way You're saving on energy

1594
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:41,630
and time Because a large pot, you know

1595
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,230
four or five quarts takes at least ten

1596
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:43,590
minutes.

1597
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,330
Maybe more depending on your burner I have

1598
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,150
a pretty strong burner.

1599
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,210
It's fast, but most people don't I've seen

1600
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,730
some people's stoves at home They look like

1601
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,930
a little camp camping stoves the burner head.

1602
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,010
You ever see that, you know, it's a

1603
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,590
little tiny Okay, so So always make sure

1604
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,390
that you're you know, bring out just enough

1605
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,230
water to boil That's going to cover your

1606
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,310
ingredients and then have a second pot on

1607
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,950
the side to keep adding to bring to

1608
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,270
the height Alright, so this is how you

1609
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,890
save energy right and get into stovetop cooking

1610
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,350
All right.

1611
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,850
So the pickles now, let's get back to

1612
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,990
the pickles because dehydration was an idea that

1613
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,750
I think needs to be brought up That

1614
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,510
wasn't in terms of pickle That does change

1615
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,510
things in the easiest metaphor for that as

1616
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,790
you know, what a cucumber tastes like Well,

1617
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:29,650
when you get a pickle in a sandwich

1618
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,370
or a burger or something, you know what

1619
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:33,230
that tastes like Can you compare the two?

1620
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,530
No, they're completely different Right.

1621
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,410
All right How many times does someone say,

1622
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,530
you know, I said you want it with

1623
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:40,450
pickle or without pickles?

1624
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,350
I want with pickle.

1625
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,010
Are they thinking cucumber?

1626
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,750
Are they thinking of that tangy pickle easy

1627
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,250
to eat flavor, right?

1628
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,370
You know the the yeah the tang They're

1629
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,090
not thinking like cucumber is like a melon

1630
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:55,790
flavor like a cantaloupe flavor most They're not

1631
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,110
you're not thinking when someone says you want

1632
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,630
pickle on it Sure, they're not thinking of

1633
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,030
that green melon flavor from a cucumber.

1634
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,070
You're thinking of this tangy crunchy Maybe sweet

1635
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,910
maybe sour maybe so right?

1636
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,110
Completely different not only is it completely different

1637
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:10,850
to your palate It's completely different to the

1638
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,110
energetic also the way you did you pass

1639
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,250
it through the body and the way it

1640
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,210
affects the body Right, you can think of

1641
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,109
many other pickled foods like for example there

1642
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:19,930
in Japanese.

1643
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,250
There's something called umeboshi, which is a plum

1644
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:25,069
You can't eat it raw, but a bit,

1645
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,149
you know, you know, even ripe or whatever,

1646
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:30,670
but it's preserved and pickled and salt water

1647
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,490
has very good medicinal quality for the stomach

1648
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,430
people who have stomach ailments and things like

1649
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:37,950
that or even Balancing the stomach with digestive

1650
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,350
aid.

1651
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,770
No one would consider eating umeboshi plum unless

1652
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:45,990
it's pickled In Japan, you see there's just

1653
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,550
an example.

1654
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:50,370
Well, what is cheese is dehydrated and pickled

1655
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,670
dairy, isn't it?

1656
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,310
Yeah, well not pickled in itself.

1657
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:55,890
What's different?

1658
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:56,689
It's fermented.

1659
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,170
I should say from the concept of pickling

1660
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,310
the brine, which is salt and and sugar

1661
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:07,149
or salt and acid is Why most pickles

1662
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:08,510
are done and when you say pickle, it's

1663
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:09,890
wet Right.

1664
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:11,649
Yeah, so it's going to be in a

1665
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:15,290
liquid and that's typically called a brine And

1666
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,689
essentially that does change the properties like for

1667
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:21,250
example olives you cannot eat olives Ripe or

1668
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,470
unless they're pickled or ripe or raw or

1669
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:23,990
right?

1670
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:27,090
You cannot eat them unless they're pickled I

1671
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,810
mean you can try you can make oil

1672
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,830
out of them and all right, so so

1673
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:34,510
there are aspects to the Food that not

1674
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,810
only are necessary for the food to be,

1675
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:38,890
you know interacted with or consumed or eaten

1676
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,170
But they have to be pickled or preserved

1677
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:46,130
a certain way So again, the quality aspect

1678
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:46,670
is main.

1679
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,649
I know I haven't really brought up some

1680
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:52,069
new stuff I'm very tentative about getting into

1681
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:54,230
how making to make things even though I

1682
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:57,170
do remember I had excellent feedback When I

1683
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:59,390
talked about making perfect rice and stovetop baked

1684
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,030
potatoes, maybe some other things.

1685
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,770
There's some very good feedback But the thing

1686
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,750
is I realized that okay, so you're able

1687
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,590
to make perfect rice and understand stovetop baked

1688
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,450
potatoes There's very little energy and all that

1689
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,330
that's good.

1690
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:13,090
But do you have the mindset to continue

1691
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:13,870
and move forward?

1692
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,890
You know, in other words, I feel like

1693
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:16,810
I just gave fish.

1694
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,350
I didn't really teach people how to fish

1695
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,470
So the way you learn how to fish

1696
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:24,450
is by study Unfortunately, the rectangle is just

1697
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:25,930
Full of crap.

1698
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:26,750
It's getting worse.

1699
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,470
By the way, it was better when it

1700
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:31,430
was just HTML white, you know pay you

1701
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,430
know at 10-15 years ago, I Think

1702
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,190
that people are up there more doing suffer

1703
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,930
more serious and the browsers are better and

1704
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,990
all this and less whatever but You still

1705
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:43,030
can go around the world on the rectangle.

1706
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,890
You know what I mean and visit the

1707
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,890
various Culinary traditions and see what you like

1708
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,130
you know it just because they say Mediterranean

1709
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,690
and Asian is the best if you have

1710
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,350
an aversion to that and you find that

1711
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,810
repugnant by all means and you know Sorry,

1712
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,210
well, I'm sorry for you, you know, but

1713
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,950
that's like saying, you know If Italian shoes

1714
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:04,490
fit your feet fit your feet, you're blessed

1715
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,510
right, right?

1716
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,270
Then it was shoes made in Spain and

1717
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,990
Brazil like some people can't wear Italian shoes

1718
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,970
because they're cut a certain way Well, that's

1719
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:12,310
fine.

1720
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,370
You know get Reebok's or whatever, you know,

1721
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:18,530
I don't know but If you if your

1722
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,330
feet do conform to Italian shoes, you are

1723
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,170
really blessed In other words, you'll be able

1724
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,590
to wear some of the best-made shoes

1725
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,190
ever, right?

1726
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,970
And by the way, speaking of shoes out

1727
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,850
of discussion someone recently they're young But do

1728
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,730
you know that up until the mid 1800s

1729
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,130
if you bought shoes you just bought two

1730
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,630
shoes There was no left and right You

1731
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,090
just had to wear them and break them

1732
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,830
in for left and right, right?

1733
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,610
And that's why people didn't like wearing shoe

1734
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:45,010
wear And then I you know, actually there

1735
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,670
were shoes then they did finer shoes were

1736
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,350
discovered to be You should have a left

1737
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,770
the left foot is a mirror image of

1738
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:52,110
the right.

1739
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,970
Not only that they're very different as well

1740
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,690
in length and shape sometimes They started selling

1741
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,370
left and right shoes and each, you know

1742
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,990
shoe company that did it had their own

1743
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,410
way of doing it But you know back

1744
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,530
in the day when you watch shoes, you

1745
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,310
just bought two shoes.

1746
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:09,990
It was no left and right Yeah, yeah

1747
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,290
you put it in it went yeah, so

1748
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,430
In a sense.

1749
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,170
I am giving you the left and right

1750
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:20,290
though Mediterranean and the Asian so you So

1751
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,970
it's not just square.

1752
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:24,490
I'm not being square just you know about

1753
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:28,790
Mediterranean or whatever you use your best Judgment

1754
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,750
on that and you'll see Also, you'll find

1755
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,830
the people or have the best best health

1756
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,290
and longevity not that you need either Actually

1757
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,470
good health but short longevity is the way

1758
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,830
to go on this planet, by the way

1759
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,390
You want to be in good health and

1760
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,270
live really short though, you don't want to

1761
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:45,690
live long here I mean you might do

1762
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,090
whatever you want, but I'm telling you this

1763
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,970
is my I've been telling people for years

1764
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,950
My earth adventure is over now.

1765
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,090
It's just food clothing shelter I'm just waiting

1766
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:55,170
to you know, you know the company car

1767
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,730
just go to sleep and wake up later,

1768
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,430
you know, there's nothing here Just deception evil

1769
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:03,550
and bullshit But it's a pretty place.

1770
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,430
So I think Some did up quite well

1771
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,630
when it when somebody asked him do you

1772
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:13,170
believe that there's In much more intelligent life

1773
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,930
out in the galaxy and he says well,

1774
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,550
of course there is you know And that's

1775
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:20,350
why they're not coming to visit here Yeah,

1776
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:26,570
very good Mm-hmm Yeah Yeah, it's just

1777
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,530
the yeah it's just you know, but the

1778
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,170
thing is the level of deceit that I

1779
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:32,550
mentioned and Evil is on a very very

1780
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,950
high high high level that the most people

1781
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,490
will never see it Or contemplate it so

1782
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,630
they don't they can't comprehend this is a

1783
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,370
statement like you want to be healthy, but

1784
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,530
short-lived, right?

1785
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:48,610
short-lived or short-lived Yeah So, okay.

1786
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,370
So on the quality aspect of it, I

1787
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:54,170
think we can go into you know, here's

1788
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,950
the fork in the road Well, if we're

1789
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,790
going to talk about the high-grade stuff

1790
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,430
Give us some stuff to Mediterranean food and

1791
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:02,030
Asian food.

1792
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,490
Well, actually you could decide on your own

1793
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,850
Don't be intimidated.

1794
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,270
For example, if you go to Mediterranean food

1795
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:09,650
and they show you falafel Even I still

1796
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,010
have problems making good falafel.

1797
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,090
I consider myself to be on a mastership

1798
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:18,370
level when it comes to cooking It's very

1799
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,190
simple, yeah, but it's very sensitive and right

1800
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,570
so so don't be like what is that?

1801
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,190
You know, it's it looks difficult to make.

1802
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,890
Yeah, some stuff is difficult, but pick the

1803
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:29,930
stuff that's easy again, something in the middle

1804
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,110
to Middle-eastern food is something called hummus,

1805
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,250
which is basically ground peas with lemon juice

1806
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:39,010
Maybe some garlic cumin and sesame paste Sesame

1807
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,850
paste is a little fuss tahini is a

1808
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,550
little it's basically sesame butter But it's finer

1809
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,510
actually because sesame has such an high oil

1810
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,970
content.

1811
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,670
It doesn't form a paste when you mash

1812
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,670
it forms that liquid All right.

1813
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,750
It's very runny if you chill it it

1814
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:58,250
can get pretty firm, but You know again

1815
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,870
with the squash what's wrong with Undercooked steaming

1816
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,670
some squash where it's still kind of crunchy

1817
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,250
Chop it up.

1818
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,570
Keep chopping it up and then grind some

1819
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,010
of it down, you know Either in a

1820
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,910
mortar and pestle or food processor add some

1821
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,870
cumin Tahini and garlic and lemon juice and

1822
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,450
olive oil and see what happens for a

1823
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,940
dip Right.

1824
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,580
It doesn't have to be chickpeas to make

1825
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,880
hummus You can make black bean hummus.

1826
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,220
I wouldn't it's a little too.

1827
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,040
It's a different flavor But still you see

1828
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,440
There's many aspects to the combinations Now I

1829
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,780
didn't get into really the I did a

1830
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,460
little bit in the chat I think I

1831
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,280
posted why the low-grade foods are low

1832
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:42,440
-grade.

1833
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,060
We'll skip the East Indian East India can

1834
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,960
get kind of complex Because the their spice

1835
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,900
profiles are complex and they use a lot

1836
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,080
of what's called key in many places, which

1837
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,020
is basically Rendered clarified fat.

1838
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,900
I mean clarified butter, which is the fat

1839
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,360
part removed.

1840
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,740
So would you go for high temperature?

1841
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,980
What I do like from the Indian food

1842
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:07,200
I find to be preferable are the flatbreads

1843
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,120
I think I've done discussion on how to

1844
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,780
make a quick flatbread it just like your

1845
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,580
pasta except your brother you can actually I

1846
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,360
see a lot of white people preheat an

1847
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,920
oven a Big-ass oven to heat up

1848
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,420
a little tiny thing like a piece of

1849
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,940
toast or something toast size.

1850
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,560
Don't do that Don't do that.

1851
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,800
Do it on stovetop.

1852
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,060
You can do flatbread on a stovetop.

1853
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,360
And if you need that crunch just last

1854
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,660
minute turn on your broiler for 30 seconds

1855
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,440
and toss it the you know, hopefully you

1856
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,040
don't have a I think most plastic handles

1857
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,360
on Pans are flame retardant and I have

1858
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,260
to consider these things because I'm you know

1859
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,240
I because I have like restaurant equipment right

1860
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,160
knives and pots and when I say someone

1861
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,240
throw the pan in the oven.

1862
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,100
I Keep forgetting that they have pans that

1863
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,560
are made out of aluminum that are actually

1864
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,120
painted with paint on one side with plastic

1865
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,240
handles I mean, you know, I Yeah So

1866
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,180
I have to consider if you if you've

1867
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,660
got you could still do it with the

1868
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,480
cheap pots and pans and the nasty stuff

1869
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,540
You guys use out there, you know, the

1870
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,220
majority of the world has You could still

1871
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:10,620
do it.

1872
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,200
But just be prudent and careful if you

1873
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,640
see if you see something that's not metal

1874
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,280
and you're sticking it near fire It should

1875
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:28,460
be near fire, you know Yeah, so And

1876
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,040
if you have If you're impressed because the

1877
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,400
pot was large But but it's a real

1878
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,820
cheap and how cheap it was because really

1879
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,180
thin on the bottom and you're gonna burn

1880
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,720
all your food Get get a heat diffuser.

1881
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,600
They're real cheap.

1882
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,900
They're easy to get just look up heat

1883
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,480
diffuser So you could save the the cheap

1884
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,060
-ass pots and pans that you guys are

1885
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:55,740
using Just we're using a heat diffuser Two

1886
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,080
bucks three bucks, right?

1887
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:57,780
Yeah.

1888
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,060
Yeah, and I'll save you else So you

1889
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,560
should be used if you have heaven forbid

1890
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,420
Teflon or those coated pots and pans now

1891
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,020
years ago There were baked enamel coated pots.

1892
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:08,660
Remember those.

1893
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:09,380
Mm-hmm.

1894
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,380
Actually they still are like crusade But if

1895
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,580
if you have like crusade easy to find

1896
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,200
Yeah, they there are they're pricey.

1897
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:16,900
They're cast iron.

1898
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,520
Usually it's just like a cast-iron tub.

1899
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,120
Those are pretty good Liquor, you don't want

1900
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,080
to use a scrape too much heavy.

1901
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,360
You don't want to lean into it with

1902
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,640
metal It could scratch it, but it's very

1903
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,280
good But if you have all these coatings

1904
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,040
these synthetic coatings plastic coatings inside your pots

1905
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,400
There's a heat diffuser is a must just

1906
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,700
to prevent the flashing Have you ever I

1907
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,740
showed this to someone once have you ever

1908
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,120
left a Teflon pan on the heat?

1909
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,480
With nothing in it.

1910
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,360
Well, it'll start to it starts to smoke.

1911
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:51,760
Oh, yeah Yeah, and bubble Yep.

1912
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,720
Yeah that comes off in your food every

1913
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,200
time you eat it at a lower temperature

1914
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,380
The bonding it's called the bonding vehicle, you

1915
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,860
know, the the binders that they use to

1916
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,380
get that crap on there Yeah, so and

1917
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,700
it's also what is Teflon tetrafluoro?

1918
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,160
It's a fluorinated plastic floor.

1919
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,800
Yeah so anyway You ever wonder why people

1920
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,980
are so dumb but okay, I Think that's

1921
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,300
enough of the roundabout but just to finish

1922
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:18,560
off.

1923
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,240
Let's give a dig into why the low

1924
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,940
quality the lower grade I say are low

1925
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:24,740
grade the Latin American is low grade because

1926
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,640
if you've ever been to anyone's house, it's

1927
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,840
Latin American Not all of them, but most

1928
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,800
of them Doesn't matter what part Mexico South

1929
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,220
America, Puerto Rico, Cuba Caribbean you're going to

1930
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,580
be served either too salty, but definitely overdone

1931
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:45,540
slop Ninety nine point nine nine percent of

1932
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,300
the time and it's going to taste good

1933
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,380
because they've discovered something called adobo or Sasson

1934
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:54,840
or MSG Sorry Their meat is overcooked.

1935
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,720
They cook it to death heaven forbid.

1936
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,800
You go to a Latin American person's house

1937
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,840
for chicken Heaven forbid unless it's deep-fried

1938
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,920
Even then it'll be as dry.

1939
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,820
It'll be Like sawdust like eating balsa wood

1940
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,460
Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent nuts

1941
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,360
up somebody's probably might be listening in the

1942
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,280
future announcing Greek.

1943
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,380
That's not true I'm Latin Cuban or Brazilian

1944
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,580
Argentina we make good food.

1945
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,060
Yes, you're you're not the rule.

1946
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,840
You're the exception now.

1947
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,860
Why did I bring this up?

1948
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,640
Starts at the home then the restaurants Go

1949
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,140
out to a Mexican restaurant, what do you

1950
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:29,780
get slop?

1951
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,020
Sorry Slop and none of the food has

1952
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,700
any flavor until you raise your hand and

1953
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,960
ask the waitress for what?

1954
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,980
Salsa, right you ever notice.

1955
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,040
I need some sauce all the white people

1956
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,140
in the in the restaurant Even though they

1957
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,320
have no palate for good food.

1958
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,180
Anyway, they're like more salsa, please more salsa.

1959
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,900
I'm inhaling this burrito Yeah, can't eat it

1960
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,600
without salsa the cheese has no flavor the

1961
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,720
tortilla has no flip yes, it's better in

1962
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,300
Mexico, but it's still slop overcooked under nourishing

1963
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:07,120
Okay, you get it Yeah, and basically the

1964
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,140
salsa and the seasonings that they use as

1965
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,560
a vehicle to make it palatable, but the

1966
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,320
actual Content itself is not very palatable.

1967
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,040
I don't know if you've eaten Mexican food.

1968
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,060
I do maybe once or twice a year

1969
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,480
Out yeah, because I'm seeking it and it

1970
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,580
looks terrible too.

1971
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,520
It looks like the an aftermath of some

1972
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,040
sort All right, and if you and then

1973
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,240
there is the some of the Caribbean foods,

1974
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,140
okay are good if you're there visiting But

1975
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,200
it's very primitive.

1976
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,960
In other words, you're you're in a hotel

1977
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,360
somewhere in the Caribbean and it's by the

1978
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,980
Oceanside by the beach and you have a

1979
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,060
great you have a great meal because the

1980
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,620
fishing boat just came in With the fresh

1981
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:51,260
fish that they overcooked on the broiler and

1982
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,680
fresh fruit and whatever, but otherwise in that

1983
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,460
it's all overcooked slop Not not to mention

1984
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:01,860
their propensity for pork and everything but and

1985
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,140
Yeah, you know unclean fish both.

1986
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:09,400
It's also mostly unclean food predominantly unclean But

1987
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,640
the thing that I'm hard keeping on on

1988
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,760
the American Latin side this part of the

1989
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,340
world and the white people food We're not

1990
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:19,700
going to get into Is because I Think

1991
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,260
the culture is rather primitive.

1992
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,020
I think I mentioned on a chat the

1993
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:29,260
entire Latin American Sands maybe a tiny pocket

1994
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:29,980
that's so rare.

1995
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,800
I can't even mention are all hybrids whether

1996
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,520
you go all the way down from Canada

1997
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,480
to the but the very southern tip of

1998
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,840
The Fuego Tierra de Fuego by Chile most

1999
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,400
of the people are hybrids They're European hybrids

2000
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,260
with the Native Americans that were here the

2001
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,760
natives that were here Right, so it's a

2002
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,140
very young culture, right, right If you meet

2003
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,160
like a Puerto Rican a Cuban a Dominican

2004
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,040
Argentine or Brazilian they're hybrids You know, well

2005
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,400
on one side somewhere.

2006
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,940
They're either 1 5th 1 quarter 1 3rd

2007
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,800
Indian the native Mayan Aztec if you meet

2008
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,340
Mexicans They're Aztec Mayan right or German and

2009
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,580
Spanish French mix Right, and they've developed this

2010
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:18,820
new Species called the South American and the

2011
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:19,280
Caribbean.

2012
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,200
They're hybrids Right, so if you go to

2013
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,880
you know, and and that's okay We could

2014
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,140
you could say, you know The older countries

2015
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,480
the older countries in the old world Europe

2016
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,420
Middle East or whatever in the Chinese Well,

2017
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,140
they're hybrids too.

2018
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,740
Yes But they were they were they were

2019
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,280
hybridized a long time ago and they've developed

2020
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,800
a culture based on XYZ Which is a

2021
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:43,580
higher quality food culture so it seems like

2022
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:47,320
the South American Caribbean and all that area

2023
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,180
the Latin culture of you know from Mexico

2024
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,220
on down and and the Islands they they

2025
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:55,260
adopted the worst of the native and the

2026
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,920
worst of the European and made their hybrid

2027
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,760
food as well so Doesn't mean there aren't

2028
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,980
any Latin America Latin Americans or Cubans or

2029
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,020
whatever that can't cook Well, they think they

2030
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,140
do I I'd beg to differ but it's

2031
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:09,620
possible.

2032
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:13,040
They are like Mexico City For example here

2033
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,620
in this other was a there was a

2034
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,700
Mexican restaurant of Mexico City I said I

2035
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,180
got to go there because that's not Mexican

2036
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:21,880
Mexican as we know Mexican Americanized or northern

2037
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,380
Mexico.

2038
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,640
That's French Food that uses ingredients from the

2039
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,480
Mexic the cut this continent, right?

2040
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,420
So that was very good actress or finally

2041
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,800
done But they still couldn't cook foul so

2042
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,340
Anyway, most people have never had foul cooked

2043
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,280
properly, you know bird turkey or chicken.

2044
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,000
I'm surprised It's thinking of opening a restaurant

2045
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,940
that just prepares foul so people can have

2046
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,460
it properly done I've never had foul properly

2047
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:51,100
done out Actually, that's not true recently There

2048
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,540
was a place called Indian twist that opened

2049
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,240
down the street here and they did prepare

2050
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,180
some chicken properly believe it or not very

2051
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,480
rare Not rare cook, but very rare that

2052
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:01,960
you have fun.

2053
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,040
It's amazing.

2054
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,200
How Kennedy has lost its ability to properly

2055
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:10,460
prepare foul And that's actually it's it's so

2056
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,400
bad that if you do eat foul It's

2057
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,200
almost worth doing a sonic on believe it

2058
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:16,540
or not.

2059
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,220
That's how bad it is More than anything

2060
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:23,240
else Yeah, yeah, so now most people don't

2061
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,220
they eat foul like chicken or whatever that

2062
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:29,260
that's been heavily tenderized and chemicalized Oh, so

2063
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,180
it is edible, you know when you're out

2064
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,000
Processed food like a chicken sandwich chicken nugget.

2065
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:35,900
I'm not talking about that.

2066
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,940
I'm talking about when you have a whole

2067
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,740
bird Do you know how to prepare?

2068
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,380
The answer is no most people don't they

2069
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,680
think they do And even again and the

2070
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,360
reason I bring this up is because if

2071
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,800
you do any one from Cuba or Puerto

2072
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,240
Rico or Dominican Republic you talk to them

2073
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,640
you say what Jeff for dinner, you know

2074
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,060
a month ago.

2075
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,620
I say what Jeff for dinner Chicken and

2076
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,320
rice, I don't complain.

2077
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,480
Oh, yes a couple days.

2078
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:56,860
I would you have for dinner chicken or

2079
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,680
chicken and rice What are you having tomorrow

2080
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,520
chicken and rice?

2081
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:04,700
right Broiled chicken fry they get away with

2082
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,180
the fried chicken, of course because of all

2083
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,080
the fat So even though it's devoid of

2084
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,820
moisture and not properly seasoned at least the

2085
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,840
fat tastes good I say if you could

2086
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,720
deep fry a shoe or a chair, I'll

2087
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,320
eat it If it's deep fried, it just

2088
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:18,700
tastes good.

2089
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,520
It's the fat that makes things the fat

2090
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,200
the salt and how it's cooked I make

2091
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,800
it taste good right the mineral So there's

2092
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,440
the low grade.

2093
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,260
So any sorry, but you know, but anyone

2094
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:30,800
will can easily Acknowledge, I don't forget about

2095
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,980
agree or not that again the Latin American

2096
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,240
that whole Caribbean is slop Basically, just look

2097
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,060
at it go online and look at the

2098
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:39,220
food.

2099
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:42,060
Just look at how it looks even Right

2100
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,440
and again, my experience is always overcooked and

2101
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,380
They don't know how to season food.

2102
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,640
Basically, it's salt and of course a pepper,

2103
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:52,520
you know, there's so frito But so frito

2104
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,300
is a different thing Altogether if you why

2105
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,560
use so frito if you're going to kill

2106
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,940
the rest of the meal and make slop

2107
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,540
anyway, so This is not this is the

2108
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,400
reason I bring it up is because I

2109
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,040
don't pursue that type of cooking I like

2110
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,860
a higher form of higher grade of cooking

2111
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:13,120
if I prepared starches vegetables and meats I

2112
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,260
don't want to do it the way they

2113
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,400
do it, right?

2114
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,320
So I it's not and the only reason

2115
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,600
people eat it believe it or not is

2116
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,620
because it's cheap It's convenient and it tastes

2117
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,220
good because of all the MSG They do

2118
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:25,920
buy MSG.

2119
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,460
All their seasoning is loaded with MSG and

2120
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,720
the white people food We're not going to

2121
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,140
talk about at all.

2122
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,120
You guys know what it is.

2123
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,940
And if you don't that's a that's great

2124
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:37,460
Don't worry about it it's best that you

2125
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,700
don't and again, just And just to touch

2126
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:46,560
on the white people food slop Overcooked salt

2127
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,300
is the main ingredient for seasoning no concept

2128
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,900
of seasonality No concept of energy, you know

2129
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,680
how to do anything with it.

2130
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,060
Just just my stomach is growling I got

2131
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,100
to put something in it.

2132
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:57,360
Yum.

2133
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,640
Yum.

2134
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,240
It's good And you swallow it's funny when

2135
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,560
you see white people eating white people.

2136
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,080
How is it?

2137
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,800
I always say it's good.

2138
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,700
It's good It doesn't tell me anything about

2139
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,760
how it tastes That's why I say the

2140
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,480
ghetto style how it tastes this is right?

2141
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:14,220
anyway So again, the high-grade of Mediterranean

2142
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:17,100
and we basically a discussion was qualitative the

2143
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,560
little bit of history and on How to

2144
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,740
pursue, you know, there's a mindset behind food

2145
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:24,960
food is very very important If you're used

2146
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,740
to eating a certain way and you go

2147
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:29,020
travel and the food is better You feel

2148
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,540
great and you come back to where you

2149
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,820
were and you don't feel so good anymore

2150
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,840
You kind of get over it for me

2151
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,700
it's the opposite because I'm used to eating

2152
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,060
a certain way if I travel I feel

2153
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,520
like crap because it's really hard to get

2154
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,940
good food and Especially like I think I

2155
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,060
put in the chat I've once stayed with

2156
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,820
some very wealthy white people for a few

2157
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,000
days as a guest and I got sick

2158
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,200
literally I mean, I felt like I've been

2159
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,060
the stuff they were eating.

2160
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,220
I was like, I wouldn't feed this to

2161
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,760
a dog I didn't even really eat but

2162
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,000
And they could afford, you know, I mean,

2163
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,280
there's nothing, you know, but anyway Yeah So

2164
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,260
what I've discovered is I'm traveling now not

2165
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,280
to seek out restaurants, but to seek out

2166
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
food markets or a supermarket So I would

2167
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,960
see all the people run to a pizzeria,

2168
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,480
which was not even a real pizzeria, you

2169
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,020
know, like a white You know fast food

2170
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,380
pizzeria.

2171
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,020
It's not pizza.

2172
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,400
I told them What I would do is

2173
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,160
go to an Albertsons or a raw Ralph's

2174
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,800
or a Safeway or I don't know where

2175
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,160
those big supermarkets, right?

2176
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,400
And even though they're geared towards white people

2177
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,040
food They don't really you it's the general

2178
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,720
quality is not very good you walk in

2179
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,040
It doesn't smell like anything you ever notice

2180
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,960
that we walk into a good food market.

2181
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,480
It smells delicious You're going to an Italian

2182
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,300
Really good or Asian food market except for

2183
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,500
the dried fish smell Sometimes it just smells

2184
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,780
good and a good fish in a good

2185
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,720
food market go to a whole foods.

2186
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,420
Well when they're clean it smells More appealing

2187
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,680
like there's food here versus a regular sanitize

2188
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,980
But anyway, I would go to these super

2189
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:54,500
these guys would go traveling with traveling and

2190
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,740
do things and they would go and eat

2191
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:59,120
this Crappy pizza or crappy steak or crappy

2192
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,100
and I'm like no I'm going over here

2193
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,060
to the you know, the supermarket, right?

2194
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,360
You could even go to a food a

2195
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,360
Walmart food area now and make the best

2196
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,780
choice possible I go over the vegetable.

2197
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,980
I'll get a seasonal vegetable.

2198
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,900
It doesn't need to be cooked I go

2199
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,460
get myself a block of cheese and I

2200
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,760
go get myself some bread and and I

2201
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,540
Basically go to the cash out and it's

2202
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,660
like maybe two bucks for the bread three

2203
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,320
bucks for the cheese and two bucks for

2204
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,900
the veg So at around seven bucks, I

2205
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,380
have like a really like two meals of

2206
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:32,540
bread cheese and vegetable three meals, maybe right

2207
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,920
for seven bucks Yeah, or farther where they're

2208
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,280
spending ten or twelve on crap and one

2209
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:44,100
meal you see restaurant, yeah, so so and

2210
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,940
that doesn't mean if a Supermarket has a

2211
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,720
hot bar or something like that.

2212
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,100
Even though I do go crazy for a

2213
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,220
wing bar a good wing bar They've been

2214
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,180
doing that over here.

2215
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,780
They have a Chicken wing bar with all

2216
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,540
these different flavors.

2217
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,720
There's been one of those when they're fresh

2218
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,700
Yeah So anyway, um, like you said before

2219
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:02,960
though.

2220
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
The problem is is trying to find a

2221
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,040
well prepared Without them being overdone when you

2222
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,780
see as very great or that they could

2223
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,020
now also occasionally might get some good fried

2224
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:18,960
chicken out there occasionally But I'm saying to

2225
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,300
the cooking Oh fouled different ways properly most

2226
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,480
people don't know That's it's sad because I

2227
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,860
can't you know, unless I go to a

2228
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,980
really high-end restaurant.

2229
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,820
It's not going to be done Even then

2230
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,300
it's probably not going to be done right

2231
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:32,740
last time.

2232
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:34,400
I'd follow out a high-end restaurant It

2233
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,880
wasn't done though as well as it could

2234
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,940
be, you know for what, you know for

2235
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:40,120
40 bucks for a dish you know for

2236
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:44,480
an entree, but So basically when you're going

2237
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,740
to eat out I Try to give yourself

2238
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,420
good food supply In other words restaurants are

2239
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,400
going to provide if anyone's worked in the

2240
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,980
restaurant business as other the it just been

2241
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,600
around it You know that they get food

2242
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,960
from suppliers, right?

2243
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,300
And they they're interested in quote-unquote making

2244
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:01,780
profit.

2245
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,020
So they're going to ask the cheapest to

2246
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,760
get the cheapest Quality its cheapest price for

2247
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,760
the best quality But sometimes what happens is

2248
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,280
they forget about the quality and go just

2249
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,860
to the cheaper But if the customer complains

2250
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,260
and they go back to the better one

2251
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,760
like, you know When you go to a

2252
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,520
store and get a whole chicken, it's anywhere

2253
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,420
between like five to ten bucks depending on

2254
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,440
the quality of the chicken right a Small

2255
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,540
chicken, maybe four to six bucks Well, you

2256
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,320
know how much a restaurant gets a whole

2257
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,680
small chicken like these Mexican grill places You

2258
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,020
know these mom-and-pop restaurants that serve

2259
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,260
chickens or you know a restaurant just a

2260
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,960
regular restaurant You know how much a chicken

2261
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,380
a whole chicken costs a restaurant?

2262
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,590
Yep, just under a buck about a buck

2263
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:45,290
the whole chicken.

2264
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:49,370
Yeah, but 25 cents a pound 20 cents

2265
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:51,970
20 to 25 cents a pound That so

2266
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,090
in other words that same chicken is also

2267
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,130
what you're by.

2268
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,950
It's the same quality that you're buying in

2269
01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:00,950
the stove right, unless it's a preferential, you

2270
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:04,030
know local or more regional and Higher, you

2271
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:07,250
know higher grade That's how cheap food is,

2272
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:07,550
right?

2273
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:11,570
So Still so the reason I'm saying this

2274
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:13,650
is because you'll notice that instead of eating

2275
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:16,570
out try to Purvey your own food supply.

2276
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,850
So when you're out Don't make your first

2277
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:25,450
hunch to go eat out Make your first

2278
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,570
hunch to get some food Even if you're

2279
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:30,450
traveling, let's say you're in a engine driven

2280
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:32,570
wagon have a little mess kit with you,

2281
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:33,290
right?

2282
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:36,930
literal literally a mess kit If you know

2283
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:39,450
what that is, look it up Camping kit,

2284
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:41,330
you know, I even have a little portable

2285
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,690
stove I I used to cook Yeah and

2286
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:45,710
anything actually not anymore but at any time

2287
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:46,970
I could pull over at the side of

2288
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,390
the road to make a meal it would

2289
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:51,810
Be better than the restaurant Ready to go

2290
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:53,510
because I have a little pocket stove.

2291
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:54,790
You've seen the pocket So I was literally

2292
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:56,410
fits in getting you have a little tank.

2293
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:59,970
Yeah, okay so and then they have the

2294
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:02,890
The the mess kit where the pot fits

2295
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:04,510
inside the pan and it has a lid

2296
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:07,490
and you know Stuff right, right.

2297
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,770
You got some high quality stuff They've really

2298
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:12,090
have some stuff titanium now for the mountain

2299
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:13,930
climbers because they have to be lightweight, right?

2300
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:17,310
Right, so So anyway, there you go And

2301
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:19,030
also here's another thing to consider when it

2302
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:20,970
comes to quality you eat at home and

2303
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,070
you dine out You shouldn't be eating out.

2304
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,910
You should be dining out Now dining is

2305
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,970
different than eating out.

2306
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:29,690
That's when the sir you You're eating either

2307
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:31,690
way whether you're eating at home or not

2308
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,010
at home.

2309
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,750
But the reason you call it dining It's

2310
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,850
because it's about the service you're being made

2311
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:40,030
to feel like a master just like as

2312
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,770
if you you turn on a film and

2313
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,590
you see a butler and a hostess and

2314
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:46,750
wherever and they're treating the The manor or

2315
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,570
the master of the house a certain way,

2316
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:50,230
you know It's like a hot cuisine like

2317
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:52,990
you're more of like a high society type

2318
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:53,370
thing.

2319
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:54,970
That's why you eat out.

2320
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:57,170
That's not available I mean it is available,

2321
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,130
but it's rare that you see it now.

2322
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:01,730
It's about eating out It used to be

2323
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,570
you eat it when you dine out right

2324
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:08,690
you see again, so in essence at home

2325
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:12,970
And yeah, yes and it since there is

2326
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:15,330
such a disparity well actually that's very disparate

2327
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:17,790
there is no quality either way at all

2328
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:21,010
at people's homes or out forget about the

2329
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:23,890
dining make the dining experience the effort that

2330
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,750
you make at home to make the best

2331
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:30,650
quality in preparation and ingredients And again, I

2332
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,690
I didn't I didn't really get into the

2333
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:36,810
the direct How to prepare anything but just

2334
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:39,570
the mindset I think most people still have

2335
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:41,550
a lot of studying to do regarding the

2336
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:44,810
the hot explain the why the why you

2337
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:49,470
do this Yes because it's going to be

2338
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:51,050
the high at the best use of the

2339
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,170
ingredients ingredients that are more healthful for you

2340
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,950
and also the the meth the way that

2341
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:00,270
it's Put together You know the calm the

2342
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,210
food combining just like we brought up someone

2343
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:05,170
asked about the coca Coconut whether it's the

2344
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:09,150
milk the fat the butter The oil I

2345
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:12,010
think outside of where that ingredient has been

2346
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:13,730
mastered outside of Thai cuisine.

2347
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:17,910
It's it's not relevant Right I mean it

2348
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,450
makes a great.

2349
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:22,450
You know topical Coconut oil and things are

2350
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:24,810
great for topical and bought you know Condition

2351
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:27,050
things you could use it for right skin

2352
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:29,170
and other things, but I would suggest that

2353
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,170
Look at the ingredient.

2354
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:33,270
You know when you look at for example

2355
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:36,110
the sesame seeds it's very highly used in

2356
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:39,910
the Japanese in the Asian Chinese mostly and

2357
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:43,810
Also in the Mediterranean isn't that interesting how

2358
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:47,910
it's crossed and it works well In the

2359
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:50,890
America you see so that's something that like

2360
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:51,250
for example.

2361
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:51,950
I have tahini.

2362
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:53,810
I have sesame seeds I have raw sesame

2363
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,730
seeds roasted sesames.

2364
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:55,930
I have black sesame seeds.

2365
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,770
I have sesame oil raw.

2366
01:36:57,930 --> 01:37:00,830
I have sesame oil toasted I You know

2367
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:04,370
I have sesame in every form Because it's

2368
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,770
it goes with Asian and like if you

2369
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,970
go to a let's say get a roll

2370
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:11,610
a Japanese roll rice roll It has sesame

2371
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:14,190
seeds on the outside right they use something

2372
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:17,450
called gamaccio Which is a condiment you roast

2373
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:18,450
sesame seeds?

2374
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:21,610
And then you grind a half of you

2375
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:23,930
put half of it aside and the other

2376
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:25,650
half or a third you grind with some

2377
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:28,390
sea Salt you mill it down just slightly,

2378
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:30,230
and then you combine them all together, and

2379
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:32,330
you put it in a shaker So Pete

2380
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:34,130
that's a great way to get people off

2381
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,790
of salt people who like to add a

2382
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,830
lot of salt to food You have them

2383
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:40,870
use oshio instead now salt also I didn't

2384
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:42,650
talk about as many things we could talk

2385
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:45,010
about the chemical properties You know cooking is

2386
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:47,550
about chemistry and heat you know like salt

2387
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:51,850
attracts oil you know acid Dissolves a nullifies

2388
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:55,130
oil right Like that's why when you have

2389
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:57,230
fried food or oily foods You put salt

2390
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,070
on it when you have into a lot

2391
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:01,310
of Asian cooking when you have a high

2392
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:03,190
fat high protein you dip it in tamari

2393
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:06,470
You know I say soy sauce right there

2394
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:08,010
We see like sushi you dip the fish

2395
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:09,610
and that's in the black sauce the soy

2396
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:13,150
sauce because it's salty So what happens is

2397
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:14,190
when the the salt?

2398
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:17,110
Combines with the oil so you don't have

2399
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:19,730
this radical oil in the intestine they stick

2400
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:22,670
to each other Now the the acid breaks

2401
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:25,030
up oil if anyone wants to try this

2402
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,930
experiment if you have a good exhaust fan

2403
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:28,450
It would be the way to do it

2404
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:33,090
or not Anyway a small saucepan and heat

2405
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,870
up some oil and then I want you

2406
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,610
to squeeze some lemon juice on the side

2407
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:38,390
and when the oil gets good and hot

2408
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:41,590
pour the Lemon juice on the oil on

2409
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:43,610
the pan not not a lot of oil

2410
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:45,530
like it's blast But just an oily pan

2411
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:47,590
like a coating on it what will happen

2412
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,070
is you're gonna see you're gonna hear a

2413
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:51,650
very loud what you like a flash like

2414
01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:54,710
a foot like a like a Steam flash

2415
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,850
you're gonna see a vapor that you can't

2416
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:58,850
see through and then the vapor disappears into

2417
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,830
droplets And then when you look at the

2418
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,030
pan there is no oil.

2419
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:06,150
It's stripped clean Wow So when you when

2420
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,010
you combine an acid with a hot oil

2421
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:10,670
the oil will vaporize and leave the entire

2422
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:13,050
surface and it'd be gone It'll it'll be

2423
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:15,050
it'll be it'll be gone and stay gone.

2424
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:17,370
It'll be in the air and it'll coat

2425
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:19,150
everything in the room, right?

2426
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,610
Okay, so what it's that's why have you

2427
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:25,290
ever seen You know the British when you

2428
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,570
have fish and chips, which is french fries

2429
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,270
and fried fish.

2430
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,530
What do you put on a malt vinegar?

2431
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:32,670
It tastes great Ketchup has got why does

2432
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,230
ketchup on fried food taste good?

2433
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:36,990
What's the main ingredient other than tomato the

2434
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,110
main flavor thicker?

2435
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:41,630
Acid if you go to parts of Europe,

2436
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,310
they put lemon juice on everything put lemon

2437
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:45,850
juice on french fries, by the way Try

2438
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:48,890
that you'll be pretty Be pretty that's what

2439
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:51,130
you ever had fresh you ever have fresh

2440
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:55,270
sliced tomato with french fries delicious Because the

2441
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,870
acid in the tomato and the umami in

2442
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:58,990
the tomato the glutamate flavor, right?

2443
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:01,250
Yeah, so in other words, so, you know

2444
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:05,490
acids and oils And salts and oils different

2445
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:09,950
the acid will disperse the oil And the

2446
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:12,110
salt will combine with the oil and keep

2447
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:14,550
it from Spreading.

2448
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,480
Yeah, that's why Fried foods, you know, you

2449
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,980
ever have french fries without any salt at

2450
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:22,220
all really bland.

2451
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:22,860
That's so good.

2452
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,420
They don't digest that well either Yeah Yeah

2453
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,780
Okay, so these are the reason I brought

2454
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,460
up this in closing maybe is because that

2455
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:33,680
that's so obvious But you know obvious meaning

2456
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,980
in your surroundings, but you didn't know why

2457
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:40,140
right if you can describe how to make

2458
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,160
You know, if you were described someone industrial

2459
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,940
industrial setting or commercial say how do you

2460
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:44,380
make french fries?

2461
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,640
Well, put them in the fryer Wait till

2462
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,560
a golden brown depending on the crunch and

2463
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,820
then you put salt on them Then you

2464
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,960
serve them you just give a description everyone

2465
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,860
could give the description why you put salt

2466
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,920
on french fries But no one is explaining

2467
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:58,130
You know, I mean how why yeah, exactly

2468
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:00,160
That's why if anyone wants to try that

2469
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,980
experiment just do you put a little bit

2470
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,900
of oil in a pan or a pot

2471
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,000
and then wipe the oil off with a

2472
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,340
Tissue or a paper towel or something?

2473
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,720
So there's no dangerous amount of volume and

2474
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,280
get it nice and warm not hot where

2475
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,820
it's burning and then pour some acid in

2476
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,480
there Whether it's vinegar or lemon juice watch

2477
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,960
what happens and stand back because it will

2478
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,400
vapor You'll get oil droplets micro oil droplets

2479
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,300
in all over the room and the pan

2480
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,440
will be Looked like you just went through

2481
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,220
at it with a dish sponge and rinsed

2482
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,320
it and wiped and put it ready to

2483
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:33,660
put it away Amazing how this works Right,

2484
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,280
yeah, it's best to do it outside But

2485
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,460
this so these are these are the things

2486
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,440
that also can be discussed for example at

2487
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:44,380
a cooking school type Situation, you know everyone

2488
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,540
in their lives that's been out or around

2489
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:49,100
food prep knows that you put you've they've

2490
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:51,240
seen you've seen the Salt-going on the

2491
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,400
fried food at the counter of the right

2492
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,080
where any place that makes french fries or

2493
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,120
they're all you've seen the ass You know

2494
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,920
the ketchup on the fried foods and the

2495
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,620
in the relishes or whatever.

2496
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,560
Oh, but why?

2497
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,800
Why you see because when it gets inside

2498
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,240
of your body If you if you eat

2499
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,560
a fat or an oil without the salt

2500
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,280
or the acid whether it be a vegetable

2501
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:17,800
fat meaning Even beans taste better with salt

2502
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,160
salt them afterwards, right?

2503
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,260
There's a cook faster with that, right?

2504
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,720
So what happens if you if you put

2505
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,800
fats and proteins in through the body without

2506
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,820
the salt or the acid?

2507
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:32,120
Which would be various forms of vinegar or

2508
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,060
citrus or whatever?

2509
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,900
What will happen is that oil will be

2510
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,460
like a radical in the in the intestinal

2511
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,100
literally?

2512
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,360
Your body will say well, what do we

2513
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,460
do with this because it's getting everywhere and

2514
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:46,800
it's messy When you have the protein or

2515
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,800
the fat going through the body with salt

2516
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:53,220
or acid it stays Contained or bonded in

2517
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,760
other words the salt will bond To the

2518
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,540
fat or the protein and the body will

2519
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:00,200
see it together as a very tidy unit

2520
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:03,220
where in the acid will disperse it to

2521
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,720
the point where it could mix in with

2522
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,900
the Hydrology and the ecology of the intestine

2523
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,140
very well and use it differently and use

2524
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:11,440
it again Right.

2525
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:14,260
Sometimes the best is to eat with heavy

2526
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:18,620
fats and proteins to use salt and Acid

2527
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:22,380
you want to put for example Certain foods

2528
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:25,380
again fried food You put salt on the

2529
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,400
fish and chips and lemon juice or malt

2530
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,980
vinegar and ketchup and salt, right?

2531
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:33,280
French fries tastes better with salt and ketchup

2532
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,480
or malt vinegar or lemon juice, right?

2533
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,580
Not just salt, right?

2534
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:45,200
Hard Oh, well, it does well initially it

2535
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,460
doesn't know what to do with it.

2536
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,300
It's like this oil is just a hand

2537
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,300
Right.

2538
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,620
It's just getting everywhere and not it's not

2539
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,460
behaving right?

2540
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:54,060
It's like a free radical.

2541
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,840
Let's say in the body You know But

2542
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,460
once you combine the salt in the acid

2543
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,540
with the protein or the fat that could

2544
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:03,140
be vegetable or animal The body sees it

2545
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:05,740
as a neat tidy self-contained well behaved

2546
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:09,400
package that it can administer what the intestines

2547
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:15,250
do So there's your coconut butter.

2548
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,550
Your coconut is a very difficult one to

2549
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:17,890
handle.

2550
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,690
By the way, by the way When you're

2551
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:24,170
dealing with coconut fats When you come whether

2552
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:25,950
you combine acid or salt with it, it

2553
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:28,590
doesn't like to behave like other things do

2554
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:28,970
either.

2555
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:33,550
So that's Yeah, to me eating coconut fat

2556
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:37,310
is like Vaseline Coke it's just one thing

2557
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:40,330
I can never Muscle down it's coconut.

2558
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,950
It's just Not the harp on it just

2559
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:45,710
to give like, you know, if I give

2560
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:47,570
a make a comment that might sound negative

2561
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:50,630
I'm also backing it up with why yeah

2562
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:55,130
So then that's the important part is, you

2563
01:44:55,130 --> 01:45:01,120
know knowing Having some basis on it.

2564
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:04,120
Yeah, we explained a lot though that that

2565
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,920
uh It was a wealth of information there

2566
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,560
and you gave me some ideas Okay, good,

2567
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:15,360
so I getting some messages here and there

2568
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:23,490
and maybe some maybe nothing pertinent All right,

2569
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:25,890
I think was it was about mindset I

2570
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:27,670
really wanted to clarify a little bit more

2571
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:29,090
of what I put in the chat Which

2572
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:31,270
was the low grade high grade type of

2573
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:32,970
food and what people can pursue because I

2574
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:34,610
think most parts of the world right now

2575
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:37,370
We're set into a seasonal change I think

2576
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:39,370
it's already been established whether you're a northern

2577
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:42,530
or southern that you've established the seasons have

2578
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:50,750
changed or are changing Yeah Freezing temperatures and

2579
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:53,370
I'm waiting to see how many people start

2580
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:56,330
coming down with the Mucusy troubles and all

2581
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:58,050
that kind of stuff, which is always oh

2582
01:45:58,050 --> 01:45:59,370
because it's their diet.

2583
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:02,050
Yeah Yeah, it's their diet and then what

2584
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:03,870
happens is if the diet is so poor

2585
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:07,390
the body goes into that Decomposition state where

2586
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:09,310
the pathogens can breed it more.

2587
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:12,290
Well, they actually come from the body You

2588
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:14,470
know, they actually the body produces them, right?

2589
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:16,310
This has been shown in blood tests that

2590
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:18,550
have been suppressed, but you can still be

2591
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,350
suppressed in the mainstream But you can still

2592
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:23,390
access them and then once you they everyone

2593
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:24,290
has them.

2594
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:28,690
They're all emitting this this Sick frequency, let's

2595
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:31,110
just say or field and it makes it

2596
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:34,610
even easier To get you know that that

2597
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:36,130
sickness, but they're not they don't change their

2598
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:36,570
diets.

2599
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,790
Yeah Yeah, and by the way, they're yeah

2600
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:43,170
No, by the way, most of the diets

2601
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:46,470
Sorry, I'll say most of that Most of

2602
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,710
the diets that whether it's the Atkins of

2603
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:50,870
paleo or whatever none of them ever address

2604
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:53,750
seasonality and illness So I just wanted to

2605
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,030
throw that out there all the diets that

2606
01:46:55,030 --> 01:47:02,710
you hear a dummy load That got sick

2607
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:05,790
and then when they went up by the

2608
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:09,810
fence by other sheep that were Not infected

2609
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:12,970
or something at that time They also caught

2610
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:14,390
this kind of disease.

2611
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,750
I was trying to remember Without contact.

2612
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:17,250
Yeah.

2613
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:17,610
Yeah.

2614
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,910
Yeah is either based on food or there

2615
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:22,090
were so many sick sheep in one spot,

2616
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:22,890
right?

2617
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:27,110
Emitting it or also the you know, what's

2618
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,610
interesting was also the the the study someone

2619
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,990
put I didn't watch the video Thomas I

2620
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:34,610
think put a video up on sick trees

2621
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:37,530
That's chemtrails and also what was funny when

2622
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,210
I look at I shouldn't say for sure,

2623
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:41,870
but most likely What I want to say

2624
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:43,590
also is when you look at videos, it's

2625
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,950
so funny It's if you're actually watching a

2626
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:48,790
video of scientists quote-unquote and lab technicians

2627
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:52,010
and doctors wherever working, you know I'll tell

2628
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:53,490
you what I see All I see is

2629
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:55,710
someone that went out to a laboratory supply

2630
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:57,870
bought all the equipment and the coats and

2631
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,710
the clothing and then they went To this

2632
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:01,950
place called University and they memorized all the

2633
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:02,270
bullshit.

2634
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:03,750
They told him and then got something gonna

2635
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:04,430
hang on the wall.

2636
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:06,530
That's it That's all that's going on with

2637
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:16,190
scientists Right, it's all presumptuous The attorneys

2638
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,930
tell them it's presumptuous and all of your

2639
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:21,790
scientific studies, by the way I've predetermined results

2640
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:24,410
don't ever think that there's any research being

2641
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:27,690
done because anything that that Is known or

2642
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:29,790
could be known was already is already known,

2643
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:30,590
right?

2644
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:32,770
This is what they don't want people any

2645
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:35,010
if you know anyone in any field that

2646
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,090
does research They give them the results.

2647
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:39,770
They want the the experiment to be structured

2648
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:43,710
to have predetermined results Right, why because there's

2649
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:46,390
no reason for research They already know and

2650
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:48,210
now it doesn't mean that everyone working in

2651
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:50,430
the field does but it isn't everything is

2652
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,730
known already But they don't want you to

2653
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:54,250
stumble across and rationalize.

2654
01:48:54,330 --> 01:48:56,310
It's going to be too problematic There was

2655
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,030
an old quote.

2656
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:59,590
I forgot who wrote it It says you

2657
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:02,350
you you are seriously erroneous if you think

2658
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:05,310
that education is for enlightenment It's there to

2659
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:09,910
prevent originality Prevent and prevent thinking and dissent

2660
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:13,070
Who was that that said that?

2661
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:18,330
You said this about 1920s when they because

2662
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:20,310
it before the 1920s there wasn't such a

2663
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,590
stand there was a stamp There's public education,

2664
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:24,190
but not like it is now, you know

2665
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:31,230
No Yeah, maybe second find it while we're

2666
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:35,930
here or So, yeah, so the other otherwise,

2667
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:37,590
I don't know what else to comment on

2668
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:40,570
the the mindset I'd never really got into

2669
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:43,590
it It's important to comprehend and again just

2670
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:46,430
to recap You're always going to be better

2671
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:52,530
off Spiritually mentally Spiritually physically with a vegetarian

2672
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:56,230
quote-unquote diet always hands down It doesn't

2673
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:58,450
mean that meat is the animal flesh is

2674
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:01,230
the plague No, the plague is the plague

2675
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:03,630
animal flesh is something dead that you consume

2676
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:07,630
Because of taste or desire or necessity, right?

2677
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:12,750
But if I were to say just a

2678
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:15,710
few things about food it would be be

2679
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:20,510
veggie For sure as much as possible and

2680
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:22,830
the other thing is be seasonal for sure

2681
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:25,570
as much as possible and if you have

2682
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:28,650
Doubts on either one of those especially the

2683
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:31,170
second one Seasonality, what does that mean?

2684
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:34,070
Just look at what's going on in your

2685
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:37,730
environment and what traditions or cultures have mastered

2686
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:43,190
their environments Yeah, well You're not going to

2687
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:46,250
live in Northern climate or the most southern

2688
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,870
antarctic or the most or that if you

2689
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:49,310
eat like they do in the tropics or

2690
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,170
the Caribbean You're not going to survive even

2691
01:50:51,170 --> 01:50:53,950
no Right like years ago.

2692
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:55,470
I knew people that worked on the in

2693
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:58,070
Alaska on the pipeline, which is not like

2694
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,450
Anchorage and other places where it's where most

2695
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:02,790
people live there These people working on the

2696
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:04,590
pipeline were in the tundra the places that

2697
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:05,710
was very harsh, right?

2698
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:08,110
And they had a commissary and the guy

2699
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:10,030
what wanted bananas and oranges and they charged

2700
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:12,070
you ten dollars for one banana or one

2701
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:13,430
orange Because they had to bring it up

2702
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:16,430
there specifically And he's like that's stupid.

2703
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:18,070
I want it but those that did get

2704
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:21,370
it got sick Those that did spend the

2705
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:22,970
ten bucks for the you know what they

2706
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:24,510
wanted on the truck.

2707
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:28,090
We're sick So and this is something that

2708
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:29,270
I heard also when I was young and

2709
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:31,790
I started matching the things putting these things

2710
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:35,130
together and again, I hope people get something

2711
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:36,810
out of this Greek speak stuff because no

2712
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,210
one's ever been able to put that I've

2713
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,570
seen this kind of Concentrated information in one

2714
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:47,210
little package in a sonic so I Hope

2715
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,570
you guys get something out of it I

2716
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:50,590
sure have and I think sharing it at

2717
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:52,410
least you know if and it's not a

2718
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:54,610
matter of being popular I know that's this

2719
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:56,330
one this stuff will never be popular It's

2720
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:58,510
a matter of helping one or two or

2721
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:11,270
three or five or ten or whatever But

2722
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:21,000
knowing why You're

2723
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,020
welcome, I don't see anything else going on.

2724
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,160
I'm out.

2725
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,260
I'm in the kitchen right now.

2726
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:36,830
Uh-huh no pun intended If

2727
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:39,190
there's any questions if there isn't yeah, we'll

2728
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:43,530
just Well it takes about 10-15 seconds

2729
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:46,410
to get down the line to them Okay,

2730
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:56,590
we'll just wait a minute No

2731
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:58,630
you gave me a lot of ideas especially

2732
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:00,170
When you know and I only get a

2733
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:02,130
half hour to eat at work And there's

2734
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,810
just a lot of times just due to

2735
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:06,930
the choices around there well what they're gonna

2736
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:10,090
do is They're going to fall into the

2737
01:53:10,090 --> 01:53:12,010
routine, which is you know well There's a

2738
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,390
lunch wagon, or this is where we go

2739
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:13,930
for lunch.

2740
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:17,730
You know the various prepared foods or The

2741
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:21,830
better way is for someone to prepare To

2742
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:24,870
prepare lunch you know a lunchbox literally I've

2743
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:26,710
ever seen an Indian or Japanese lunchbox.

2744
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:29,490
It's a bunch of stainless steel Interlocking bowls

2745
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,390
they stack up and the handle straps over

2746
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:31,530
there.

2747
01:53:31,650 --> 01:53:34,650
Maybe see what you're seeing that Oh Okay,

2748
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:37,310
I don't know put in Indian lunchbox or

2749
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,590
Japanese lunchbox in a search you should see

2750
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:43,210
a stack of Stainless steel bowls about anywhere

2751
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:46,050
between three to six and as you stack

2752
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:48,070
the bowls you know they interlock And there's

2753
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:50,110
a side strap that locks them all in

2754
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:52,290
place with a handle on top And it

2755
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:54,510
goes into is that what it was did

2756
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:55,270
I get the description.

2757
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:55,810
That's clever.

2758
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:58,570
Yeah, okay, so what's cool about that is

2759
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:01,590
Mm-hmm yeah, you could heat it up

2760
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:03,270
very well You know in a steamer the

2761
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:05,390
idea is to have your food there And

2762
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,130
then put the whole thing everyone puts the

2763
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,230
everyone shows up with this and then when

2764
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:11,270
it's time to eat everyone 15 minutes or

2765
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:14,030
so before everyone sticks them in a steamer

2766
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:18,810
or an oven right mm-hmm or in

2767
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,510
the summer You could put you know the

2768
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:27,290
fridge if it's cool cool foods Or You

2769
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:29,190
could separate the hot and the cold before

2770
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:30,610
you eat, you know heat them that way,

2771
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:34,370
but okay Yeah, those are those have been

2772
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:38,290
around for over a century Before the lunchbox

2773
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:39,270
that we were given.

2774
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:41,230
I think were you given a lunchbox.

2775
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:43,290
You're not you're not that old Yeah, as

2776
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:45,390
we were given you probably still had I

2777
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:47,110
had ones with the trains on them I

2778
01:54:47,110 --> 01:54:48,670

I never had a superhero's box.

2781

It was either a train.

2782
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:58,970
I remember or some landscape Right I think
