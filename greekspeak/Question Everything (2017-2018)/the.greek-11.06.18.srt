1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,880
Greetings folks, we're live with the Greek and

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,020
good evening to you Greek.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,940
Good evening.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,680
All right.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,020
I'm going to be in and out.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,880
Hopefully the connection will hold up.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,380
OK.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,740
So.

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,080
All right.

10
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,440
Let's just get right down to it.

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,840
We're going to say today it's.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,760
Wow.

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,280
Am I losing track here?

14
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,240
It's about the second.

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,320
Well, we're into the third week, aren't we?

16
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,280
Or past the second week of the of

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,100
the ninth month.

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,880
It's just in other words, we've just completed

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,720
two weeks whole weeks.

20
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,960
And it's the third beginning of the third

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,320
week of the ninth month as a Nova,

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,160
meaning nine.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,280
Yes, I believe the 14th.

24
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,440
No.

25
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,880
Fifth, 16th, I'm reckoning.

26
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,440
The 15th.

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,040
It's the Sabbath.

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,380
Yeah.

30
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:51,740
Yeah.

31
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,620
So that's why I want it.

32
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,580
Well, when the weekends I kind of it's

33
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,220
still really an interim.

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,760
Is it part of that week?

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
Yes, it still is.

36
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,760
Because the seventh day of the week, you

37
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,200
know, but I consider it the end of

38
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,540
the week.

39
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,660
The week is complete, but it's not really

40
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:10,940
right.

41
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,340
The end of the right.

42
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,800
OK.

43
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,980
You know, it's I think we've gone over

44
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,960
the counting enough ad nauseum.

45
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,120
I think one day we'll probably do a

46
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,580
fifty nine minute, fifty nine second sonic event

47
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,760
strictly on introductory Greek speak.

48
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,760
What did they used to call it in

49
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,000
the old educational circus?

50
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,160
Condensed version and abridged version, right?

51
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:35,820
Yes.

52
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,340
The abridged.

53
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,560
Yeah, it would be an abridged and slightly

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,220
condensed.

55
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,040
Yes.

56
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,100
Just before we get into anything, I got

57
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,240
an email regarding water.

58
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,020
People are still trying to get in touch.

59
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,380
They say they go to the Web site.

60
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,500
Just a colorful black background in an email.

61
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,960
I haven't linked anything, the sonic events or

62
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,140
or anything, not because I'm not proud of

63
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,680
them or anything.

64
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,220
It's just something to be proud about.

65
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,400
But about anything on this planet.

66
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,620
But it's just I don't I just think

67
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,520
that if you've come across Greek speak and

68
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,580
you've figured out that the only place to

69
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,140
get live stuff is on a chat, an

70
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,340
obscure chat on the obscure side of the.

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,960
It's not the very last page of the

72
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,220
Internet.

73
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,700
Do you remember that right back in the

74
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,300
day, the very last page of the Internet?

75
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,120
They had like some strange technological stuff.

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
I haven't really done anything.

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,860
Rumor has it someone wants to start an

78
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,360
official podcast on a pod stream on what

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
they call January.

80
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,460
The same person is doing the just Greek

81
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,400
speak Web site.

82
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh, OK.

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,440
And yeah, I mean, OK, fine.

84
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,860
They think it's going to go real big.

85
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,540
And I never said it wouldn't.

86
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,180
It could, but not right now.

87
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,760
Right.

88
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,380
People are still too censored and getting worse.

89
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,620
But remember, the censorship has to be opened

90
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,400
for enough lawfulness to be admitted, not remembered,

91
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,380
not acted on.

92
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:00,820
Right.

93
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,720
In order for the mop up crew to

94
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
come, because they will not.

95
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,780
But you did say that it increases the

96
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,480
censorship also increases, but then it opens at

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,100
a certain point.

98
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,160
Well, only increases because how can how can

99
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,940
a society on an entire planet be so

100
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,220
morally devoid and so full of depravity that

101
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,420
they don't notice it?

102
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,120
Right.

103
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,840
The only way that could happen is with

104
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,240
censorship.

105
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,760
I mean, no, there's talk about like, you

106
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,160
know, how did the headhunters do it or

107
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,980
certain cultures that were full of depravity.

108
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,380
But were they really depravity?

109
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,300
You know, no.

110
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,560
I mean, look at the depravity.

111
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,380
You know, it's a sense, you know, I

112
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,660
say stupid people are dangerous, not because it's

113
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,960
just, you know, like even a most lethal

114
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,640
snake or tiger or lion or rabbit dog

115
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,940
is dangerous, but not always.

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,740
There's their methodologies to get around that danger.

117
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,340
The reason why stupid people are dangerous is

118
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,160
because they're stubborn, they're dimwitted.

119
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,580
In other words, they react on that impulse,

120
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,620
you know.

121
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,340
And anything they believe is the truth.

122
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,740
Which is why they're stupid.

123
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,100
So essentially, I've been getting a bunch of

124
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,820
emails still, like someone just sent an email,

125
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,860
would you talk about Enki and Enlil and

126
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,160
all that?

127
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,140
And I'm like, well, would you stop watching

128
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,860
so many alternative YouTube videos?

129
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,959
Because it's really minor.

130
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,500
Put it in perspective, you know, why should

131
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,600
that stand out?

132
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
That was like the time of Abraham.

133
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,940
That's like what they called, they dubbed the

134
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,620
Bronze Age, which there's no such thing as

135
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,240
a Bronze Age, Iron Age or Stone Age,

136
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,640
by the way.

137
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,660
It's a Bronze Society, Stone Society, Iron Society,

138
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,660
because there still are stone societies.

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
There still are iron societies.

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,300
You know, this is a plastic society, let's

141
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,440
say.

142
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,160
There's no such thing as an age of

143
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,480
such.

144
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,120
Yeah, the only reason they call it a

145
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,700
Bronze Age is because they discovered the easiest

146
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,060
way to get, yeah, the easiest way to

147
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,180
get copper and zinc was to go on

148
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,040
the opposite ends of the earth or globe.

149
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,200
Most of the majority, this is something that's

150
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,320
being hidden from the people.

151
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,200
If you do isotopic analysis of all the

152
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,300
copper that's been found from the quote unquote

153
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,680
Bronze Age, I'd say about 10 to 20

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,820
% is from the Cyprus region, like the

155
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,140
southern, the Aegean.

156
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,600
And the other 80% is from here,

157
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,160
the states, the American states.

158
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,900
And to make bronze, you need zinc and

159
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,820
copper, basically, and then there's a slew of

160
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,800
other impurities or alloys that are in there.

161
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,420
Actually, I have a formula for a secret

162
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,880
copper alloy that has to, not only do

163
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,300
you have to combine the metals, certain metals,

164
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,400
but the way you do it also that

165
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,220
is as strong as carbide steel.

166
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,380
So now you understand how it's easy to

167
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,100
make stone cutting tools, copper.

168
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:52,680
Yeah.

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
So it's sort of alchemic.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,320
Alchemists still exist, but not in the way

171
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,480
they told the public, right?

172
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,640
But if you look at where most of

173
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,980
the zinc and other alloys came from, it

174
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,000
came from the area of Afghanistan back in

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,960
these ancient times.

176
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,740
And this is not discussed.

177
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,100
This is just like when the Baghdad batteries

178
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,400
were dubbed Baghdad batteries were discovered in the

179
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,260
30s, well, they were acknowledged in the 30s

180
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,700
publicly.

181
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
All the museum curators ran and tested all

182
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,760
the supposed solid gold artifacts, and they never

183
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,460
printed the findings.

184
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
They made public.

185
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Because most of that stuff that they told

186
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,880
you was solid gold was not solid gold,

187
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,740
like Tutankhamen's mask and all these other solid

188
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,720
gold things are not solid gold that they

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,300
have in museums.

190
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,780
They're not.

191
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,380
They're plated.

192
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,780
So this is just how it shows, again,

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,480
is it censorship?

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,040
Yes.

195
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,980
Is it stupidity?

196
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,280
Yes.

197
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,180
Is it stubbornness?

198
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes.

199
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,180
Is it the sign of the times?

200
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,620
Yes.

201
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,420
Is it because you're being ruled by a

202
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,160
series of patron and matron deities?

203
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,720
Yes.

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Is there pranking going on?

205
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,640
Yes.

206
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,000
It's very simple.

207
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,820
Last week, there were no questions or anything,

208
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,180
just like there isn't much, so we could

209
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,980
probably make this a very short one.

210
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,980
There are just a few questions and emails

211
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,600
that I've answered.

212
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,060
I usually get emails about people struggling with

213
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,140
certain things in a good way, and they

214
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,600
ask me to expand on it.

215
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,540
I said, well, your questions I've already expanded

216
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,840
on.

217
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,080
I already answered your question, so I would

218
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,060
invite anyone and everyone to consider.

219
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,680
I know it's not neat and tidy and

220
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,780
compact, but put it this way.

221
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,220
You've heard certain things, certain euphemisms or colloquial

222
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,000
things, like if you think you're the first

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,100
one who thought of it, you haven't.

224
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,880
Someone else has came up with it before,

225
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,380
or you're not the only one asking the

226
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,680
question.

227
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,860
If you're going to send me an email

228
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,060
about something specific like that, 99% of

229
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,620
the time, I have a pretty good memory,

230
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,460
it's been answered already.

231
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,260
It's just a matter of rehashing.

232
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,940
Years ago, I was a little more, quote

233
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,280
-unquote, forgiving, and people would ask me questions,

234
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,120
which I knew I'd gone over in great

235
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,200
depth, either in smatterings or in one sitting,

236
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,540
and I would answer it back.

237
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,100
Now I don't.

238
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
If you get an email back that says,

239
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,780
well, I've answered this before, I'm not being

240
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,260
sarcastic or lazy or anything.

241
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,120
It's because I didn't just do it in

242
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,580
passing.

243
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
I actually went into it in great detail.

244
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,280
Unfortunately, there isn't one single place.

245
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,940
There is no card catalog or appendix that

246
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,380
will lead anyone to any specific topic.

247
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,240
I didn't think doing it formally...

248
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,960
You know how a lot of events, whether

249
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
they're written literary events or sonic events, are

250
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,580
cataloged and given titles and topics?

251
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,660
I think the time for that is over.

252
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,440
You either develop a mindset that is perceptive

253
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,100
and objective and lawful, so you can pick

254
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,100
up on everything that I've discussed, or you

255
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,480
don't.

256
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,480
In other words, if you're a type of

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,900
individual or human or man or woman or

258
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,580
child that needs to have their hand held

259
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,440
on each and every different topic or theme

260
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,520
or whatever, you're not going to get Greek

261
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,760
-speak.

262
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,640
That's not for you.

263
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,200
Yes, there might be some information that's given

264
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,360
here that you could check up as being

265
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,260
true that you don't get anywhere else, but

266
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
how did I figure it out?

267
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,740
How does anyone figure it out?

268
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
That's the point of Greek-speak.

269
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,660
The early Greek-speak talks from years ago,

270
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,740
if you remember being on interviews, always started

271
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,420
out by, no one's paying any attention.

272
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,540
No one's being objective.

273
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
No one's looking at stuff just five feet

274
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,080
in front of them.

275
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
The biggest hypocrites are these researchers that are

276
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,020
trying to find out what's on the bottom

277
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,660
of the ocean or out in space or

278
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,820
across the world, because they don't even notice

279
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,060
what's five feet in front of them.

280
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,260
So the whole thing is about mindset, mindset,

281
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,000
and one more thing, it's mindset.

282
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,940
So when people ask about certain subjects, it's

283
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,320
irrelevant.

284
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,260
Some people think of me as a science

285
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,460
guy.

286
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
Other people think of me as just a

287
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,400
pain in the ass.

288
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,940
Other people think of me as a scripture

289
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,320
guy.

290
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,380
I'm none of that.

291
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,820
All of it, none of it.

292
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,480
Other people think of me as a health

293
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,860
guru.

294
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,720
No, I'm not that.

295
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,080
Other people think of me as an alternative

296
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,600
shrink.

297
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Other people think of me as a mechanical

298
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,900
genius.

299
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm none of that.

300
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,180
None of that.

301
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,860
It's all mindset.

302
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,980
Are you paying attention?

303
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,820
No, you're not.

304
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
Are you being objective?

305
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,980
No, you're not.

306
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Are you being lawful?

307
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,520
No, you're not.

308
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,420
Lawful just means what is it based on?

309
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,000
For example, if you said Stan Lee invented

310
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,620
Mickey Mouse, that's not lawful, because Stan Lee

311
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
is Marvel Comics.

312
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,980
It's Walt Disney, Walter Disney, that did Mickey

313
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,360
Mouse.

314
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,140
That's lawful.

315
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
But they're both fictions.

316
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,140
They're all into fiction.

317
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,900
But you see, are you connecting the sources?

318
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,900
So even though something is a fiction, are

319
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,160
you attributing it to the source?

320
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,180
As simple as that.

321
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,720
So when you look at all the religions

322
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,140
of the world, Christianity, what's the source of

323
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,240
it?

324
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,100
Well, they'll tell you history and the Bible.

325
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,660
Well, nope, sorry, you failed on that.

326
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,240
So what's it based on?

327
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,900
It's not lawful.

328
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,660
It doesn't matter what you believe.

329
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,760
See, what they do, this is all about

330
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,100
human livestock management, or livestock management, because I'm

331
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,840
using that term human loosely anymore.

332
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,620
I really don't think they're human as such.

333
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,620
I think they're just really upright pigs, goats,

334
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
and dogs, and whatever else you want to,

335
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,220
spiritually that way.

336
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,460
Now, what you would say on that, for

337
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,060
example, is if you look at something like

338
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,700
Christianity, or Judaism, or Islam, or whatever, any

339
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,620
religion, or even though science is in it,

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,540
if you say something that's not scientific, the

341
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,680
people that do control the other people, because

342
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,160
it is a free world, by the way,

343
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
and I'll explain what I mean by that.

344
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Instead of, get the people who believe in

345
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,220
certain things to separate, and also we use

346
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,560
it as a marker to see how stupid

347
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,860
they are, because if they say they believe

348
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,460
in, we don't have to ask them if

349
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,820
they're stupid, we know they're stupid.

350
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,140
And then what you do is you put

351
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,960
out a credo that says, how dare you

352
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,640
insult someone's belief, or you shouldn't speak out

353
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,880
against someone's belief, or freedom of religion.

354
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,000
You're being set up, that's a prank.

355
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,600
From the get-go.

356
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,000
Now, at least in the past there was

357
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,900
more honesty in it, where you either did

358
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,340
our God or not.

359
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,460
Now there's no God, just saying God is

360
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,160
not good enough, it never was.

361
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,960
So, if you look at any of the

362
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,220
major religions or scientific stuff and you ask

363
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,780
them what they're based on, because science, knowledge

364
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,460
is based on these beliefs also, you'll find

365
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,420
that it's all unlawful, all of it.

366
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,460
Now, Christianity, I haven't found anything that's Biblical

367
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,380
in it, at all.

368
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,040
Sounds like a ridiculous thing.

369
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,180
Judaism, a little bit, where they'll pull up

370
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:27,500
some strange, esoteric, rabbinic arguments, that do adhere

371
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,240
to narrow points in what they call the

372
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,300
Torah or the teachings.

373
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Even something as ridiculous as fundamentalists or orthodox

374
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,860
Jews saying you shouldn't eat milk and meat

375
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,380
together, which is not scriptural, by the way,

376
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,860
at least that points to the specific doctrine

377
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,900
of the last commandment, or an analysis, an

378
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,660
interpretation of it, which is kind of swayed.

379
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,680
Christians don't know any of the Ten Commandments

380
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,900
written in stone, none.

381
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,680
Actually, by coincidence, one or two, by coincidence.

382
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,420
But they're not aware of anything.

383
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,560
By the way, the last commandment is do

384
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,500
not see the kid in its mother's milk,

385
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,940
or it could be taken as do not

386
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,360
eat a goat or kid that is still

387
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,880
nursing.

388
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,060
Right, right.

389
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,660
Which I would say is closer, because it

390
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,640
also talks about when you take eggs from

391
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,140
a nest, don't take the mother and the

392
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,500
eggs, just take the mother or the eggs,

393
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:32,720
right?

394
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,460
One or the other, but not both.

395
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,720
So you'll always see a connection.

396
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,640
Eventually, when you start reading what people loosely

397
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,880
call God's law, in the beginning it's kind

398
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
of strange, but as you study it, you'll

399
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,600
say, oh, here's one that I'm beginning to

400
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,000
read now.

401
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh, that makes total sense, because if you've

402
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,120
studied the others, you'll see there's a pattern

403
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
that emerges, right?

404
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,320
So there's a pattern there.

405
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
So Islam, again, there's no law in that.

406
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,000
The Koran refers you back to Moses, by

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,340
the way.

408
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,620
No one has ever come back to me

409
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,600
and said, no, no, Muslims are not supposed

410
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
to do Moses' law.

411
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,360
No, you know why?

412
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,960
Because they can't.

413
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,760
Because the Koran explicitly says they should.

414
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,680
Right.

415
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,480
Right.

416
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,160
And I love, years ago, I shouldn't say

417
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,240
I love it, I hated it, but I

418
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,260
love how simple a point to hang on,

419
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,740
you know how a cheap sweater, you just

420
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,960
pull on a thread and the whole thing

421
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,480
comes apart?

422
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
Whenever I speak to one of these Muslim

423
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,560
idiots, I just hang on that thread.

424
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,680
Law.

425
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,860
That's it.

426
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,280
It doesn't matter what they say.

427
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,780
I keep pulling on that until the whole

428
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,480
thing falls apart.

429
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,160
Not to pick on them, even though they

430
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,480
deserve it, basically.

431
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,420
And the whole thing just falls apart, because

432
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,900
obviously these are what's called state religions.

433
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
Let me go back to what I was

434
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
saying about freedom.

435
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,260
Okay, you know, like America is a free

436
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,600
country.

437
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,080
All countries are free countries.

438
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,220
The world is a free world.

439
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
How do I know that?

440
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
How do I know that?

441
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,300
Let me run through this, because this is

442
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,700
going to be explicit, in a sense, in

443
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,020
your face, that you've never really realized.

444
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,340
I know you haven't realized this, and no

445
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,000
one really has.

446
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,520
And I'm going to just spell it out

447
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,920
again.

448
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,220
Okay.

449
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
Except that it's in private.

450
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,660
The Creator put the various patron and matron

451
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,960
deities over the countries, right?

452
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
You could read about that.

453
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,180
You know, and also the hybrids, you know,

454
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
that had more power.

455
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,540
Which, the person who asked about the email

456
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,980
about the Enki and Enlil, all that Akkadian

457
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,500
stuff, you know, the Anunnaki.

458
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,600
What about, there's another group.

459
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,600
The Anunnaki just means the royalty.

460
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,160
But there's the Apkali, or the Apkalu.

461
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
No one talks about them.

462
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,420
They're the hybrids.

463
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,820
They're like the Nephilim.

464
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,940
They're the hybrids, right?

465
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay.

466
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,420
No one talks about the Apkali, right?

467
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,260
They're like Anunnaki.

468
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,859
You know, like who's that idiot, a bunch

469
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,579
of UFO idiots, the Project Camel moron.

470
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,740
Yeah, yeah, right.

471
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,079
They get so stuck in the New Age.

472
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,240
They don't know that they're being pranked.

473
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,220
Why not study anything, right?

474
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,700
So, like, you know, so when you look

475
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,280
back and you see how the setup is,

476
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,740
those people of power did not go away.

477
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,680
And the Creator set this up.

478
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,360
And if you ever read anything in scripture

479
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,260
or old, it's always free will.

480
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,320
In other words, if you remember reading Old

481
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,880
Testament stuff, what kind of an offering is

482
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,020
it?

483
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,480
It's a free will offering, right?

484
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,080
Right.

485
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
And if you don't bring the offering by

486
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,140
free will, then you have to wait a

487
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,680
certain amount of time, whether it could be

488
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,560
immediate or really lengthy, multi-generational, to suffer

489
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,460
the repercussions of that, right?

490
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,740
Because you can do something and it might

491
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,520
just not hit you even in your lifetime.

492
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,680
So these are large scope in terms of

493
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,220
man's perspective of livelihood, you know, how long

494
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,920
your life is.

495
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,640
But if you go back, the Creator, everything

496
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,500
was free will.

497
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,120
Well, he's put free will in there as

498
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,260
more than an option.

499
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,840
It is set up as a free will

500
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,200
setup.

501
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Right?

502
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,660
Anything that's a free will option always has

503
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,140
stringent requirements and constraints.

504
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,620
Like, I always give the concept of free

505
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,560
will as a ship with thousands of passengers

506
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,420
going from London to New York.

507
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,680
Okay?

508
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,700
Well, the ship is going from London to

509
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,840
New York because it says it on the

510
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,080
ticket.

511
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
It's planned to go that way.

512
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,460
No matter what, it might deviate on the

513
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,260
path a little because of weather or what

514
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,100
have you or frequent stopping, but it's going

515
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,000
to go to New York.

516
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Okay, that's the set thing.

517
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,600
Now, your free will as a passenger is

518
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,160
on the ship, what you're going to do

519
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,020
on that ship, right?

520
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,140
Right.

521
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,360
But you're all going – so the free

522
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,100
will is what you're going to do.

523
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,820
And also based on your rank and class,

524
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,320
if you're on the ship's crew, you don't

525
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,140
have it because you're on a different schedule

526
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,820
than the passengers, right?

527
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,720
So you have to look at it that

528
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,320
way as well.

529
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,860
So the whole world, we know how it's

530
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,660
going and nobody can change it, but there's

531
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,360
free will even there, you see, within one's

532
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,200
life to a certain degree because the large

533
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,940
overall outcome is still based on actions of

534
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,260
people and groups of people known as nations

535
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,960
and minor gods and things like that affecting

536
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,260
both ways.

537
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,980
Right.

538
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,720
So this free aspect of free will –

539
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,740
now, when you're chosen to do something, you're

540
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,580
also chosen freely, you should do it freely

541
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,320
if you are part of that covenant, part

542
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,100
of that group.

543
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,300
You could be born into it.

544
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,160
Like, for example, Yonah or Jonah is an

545
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,840
example where he was asked to go to

546
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,560
Nineveh to tell them to straighten up or

547
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,340
the destruction will fall and he didn't want

548
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,040
to go, right?

549
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,620
Well, somebody might say, well, there's no free

550
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:12,820
will.

551
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,640
Well, you don't understand that this man already

552
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,020
had a covenant with Yahweh.

553
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,140
So once you make a covenant, by definition

554
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,000
of what constraints or freedoms are listed in

555
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,660
that covenant is what you live by, you

556
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:27,820
see.

557
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,920
And you can be chosen.

558
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,620
Right.

559
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,340
A covenant would be like a marriage.

560
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,120
If you are married, now your free will

561
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,380
to go and fornicate is over, right?

562
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,020
Right.

563
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,580
You can only be with that woman unless

564
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
it's by consent that you marry again.

565
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,420
Right.

566
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,220
Because it is lawful to marry again, right?

567
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,820
Mm-hmm.

568
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,280
For a man.

569
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,200
And a woman, it's not lawful.

570
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
So for that woman, it would be this

571
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,980
is the only man I have until the

572
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,700
day I die unless he dies or we

573
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,380
divorce, which would be through adultery anyway.

574
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,540
Right.

575
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,900
So certain covenants will show you the path

576
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,420
that you're on.

577
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,620
Just like if you're going cross-country, there's

578
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,300
only a certain amount of highways you can

579
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,580
take.

580
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,100
And if there's one that clearly takes you

581
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,720
direct, you know you're only going to be

582
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,480
on that road.

583
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,000
So, again, when I say free will, it

584
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,860
really is free will.

585
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,740
Jonah did have free will overall, but a

586
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,960
certain amount of free will to deny going

587
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,340
to Nineveh to prophesy to the leaders of

588
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,900
Nineveh was not in the free will equation

589
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,060
because of previous allegiances he had to that

590
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,460
god.

591
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,160
And that's implied and inferred.

592
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,920
It doesn't have to be restated because we're

593
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,740
not that stupid.

594
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,560
You see?

595
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,460
Mm-hmm.

596
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,330
So when you look at how much freedom

597
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,150
man is given, and you've heard, for example,

598
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,910
in America, this is a free country, and

599
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,590
there's a lot of quote-unquote freedom here.

600
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,470
All nations were like that.

601
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,750
Even when they were under the division of

602
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,350
each related patron or matron deity.

603
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,310
This is the difference.

604
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,850
What your national gods do, you know, each

605
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,330
nation has a god or group of people,

606
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,110
is essentially they just demand human sacrifice.

607
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,270
If you really want to boil down to

608
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,370
it.

609
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,630
They don't give any laws, really.

610
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,530
They send demons and things like that to

611
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,870
communicate with various oracles of the people or

612
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,150
what they call psychics or give dreams and

613
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,150
various things based on the culture.

614
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,430
But they basically, the bottom line is they

615
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,510
just want human sacrifice.

616
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,610
They just want you to sacrifice.

617
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,230
That's why it was so normal for Abraham

618
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,850
to accept bringing his son.

619
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,090
It was normal for Abraham.

620
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,670
Abraham said, that's a terrible thing to do.

621
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,550
Why would you ask me to do that?

622
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,690
Because it was normal back then.

623
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,870
And it still is.

624
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,650
We just convert.

625
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,850
So it's freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom.

626
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,530
And again, to go back to America, people

627
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,290
are free here.

628
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,970
But let's just say we comprehend.

629
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,930
We're not stupid, right?

630
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,630
I know it's kind of hard for most

631
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,510
people to do, to think that way.

632
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,030
In other words, not in a stupid way.

633
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,250
In other words, let's not be ignorant.

634
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,590
When I say because we're not stupid, I

635
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,950
use that in a facetious way.

636
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,750
Especially when I describe the biblical Christ.

637
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,290
He was not nailed to a cross wearing

638
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:18,670
a diaper.

639
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,710
How do we know that?

640
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,570
Because we're not stupid.

641
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,210
When we're reading the New Testament, we know

642
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,170
it's PhD level.

643
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,810
You have to go back and see how

644
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,770
it would be done, right?

645
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,230
What I mean by that is, are you

646
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,150
paying attention?

647
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,330
So, if you're not stupid, and you know

648
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,070
it's a free country, and you have wherewithal

649
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,430
to knowledge, you have wherewithal to what's called

650
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,810
money, funds, power, influence.

651
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,190
And again, remember, you're not stupid.

652
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,590
You're aware of human society.

653
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,770
If you have two people on an island,

654
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,390
and they get along, what are the chances

655
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,530
of you leaving that island and coming back

656
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,550
in 500 years?

657
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,490
Let's say a man and a woman.

658
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,770
Coming back in 500 years, and there's still

659
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,650
just two people there.

660
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,890
You're probably going to come back, and there'll

661
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,930
be thousands of people, or hundreds of people,

662
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,190
right?

663
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,430
Most likely thousands.

664
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,270
This happens all the time.

665
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,250
When you had a colony, in any condition,

666
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,030
any situation, you had Australia, the US, Canada,

667
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,350
places where you had indigenous people.

668
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,270
You had colonials coming over by the hundreds.

669
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,130
Dozens, scores, hundreds.

670
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,730
And then, less than 50 years later, there's

671
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,490
a million of them.

672
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,730
Yes, there's a lot of interbreeding with the

673
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,390
natives and all that, but they are considered

674
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,690
the people that came over from, right?

675
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,670
I have people in acquaintance that are here

676
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,910
in the southwest, and they're like, oh yeah,

677
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,490
what do you do?

678
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,850
I come from a family from back east.

679
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,050
We started the Costa Naga wagons, one of

680
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,290
those big, famous large wheels wagons.

681
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:00,870
Sure.

682
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,870
They mass produced those, so people would go

683
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,750
on long journeys.

684
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,550
Basically, it was the first RV, the Costa

685
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,110
Naga wagon.

686
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,930
It had kitchen area storage, even a gun

687
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,970
hole, so if someone was inside, they could

688
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,470
lay down and shoot through it.

689
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,970
Yeah, it was the first RV.

690
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,890
That's where they come from.

691
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,670
They came from England and Scotland.

692
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,550
Well, that was like 300 years ago, dude.

693
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,550
Right.

694
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,810
There's a lot.

695
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,170
But he still attributes it to that.

696
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,810
You see?

697
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:37,750
Lineage.

698
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,990
Okay, so I'm going slow here, but there's

699
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,450
free will.

700
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,390
If you're smart, again, let me go back.

701
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,010
You have access to knowledge.

702
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,090
Notice I didn't say education, but let's consider

703
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,770
it education.

704
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,510
To funds, you have access to history.

705
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,270
You understand how people operate.

706
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,750
When you put a few people in an

707
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,530
area that has a lot of cheap energy,

708
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,990
back then it would be easy access to

709
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,390
water and wood and animal products, surface products,

710
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:04,710
right?

711
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,410
That's why people mostly came over here.

712
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,670
Like they didn't mind the church in Europe,

713
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,530
even though they just stayed out of their

714
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,390
way, but they minded that they had to

715
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,190
pay for firewood, right?

716
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,530
Or there was no firewood.

717
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,090
When you came here, there was wood everywhere,

718
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,510
right?

719
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,550
Cheap energy.

720
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,730
It still is cheap energy.

721
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,690
America is still the capital of cheap energy,

722
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,550
except for places like Kuwait where basically they'll

723
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,370
give you gasoline.

724
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,590
Basically gasoline there is like 15 cents a

725
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,670
gallon, five liters, and Venezuela also.

726
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,110
But either way, let me just get to

727
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,590
the point here.

728
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,890
When you're smart or less stupid than others,

729
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,010
you understand how people operate when they move

730
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,310
and how they expand.

731
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,550
You're all free, but you have an advantage.

732
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,030
You have access.

733
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,330
You might want to purchase or control land

734
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,490
and waterways before they do.

735
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,170
There's actually a race.

736
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,490
Like when a new area starts to develop,

737
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,290
there's a race to who's going to control

738
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:11,770
it.

739
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,390
Right.

740
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,110
Right.

741
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,090
And when you're early on the game and

742
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,930
you start controlling early in the game, and

743
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,390
eventually your influence of control over the environment,

744
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,690
land, water, people, and all that, hopefully we'll

745
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,650
be slightly ahead of the population expansion.

746
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,210
Why?

747
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,090
Because as the population is expanding, you will

748
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,050
be the first one to put schools in

749
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,370
place.

750
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,090
You will put media in place.

751
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,030
You will put religion in place, right?

752
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,110
And if you don't believe that, usually when

753
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,270
a colonial or a small town you can

754
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,530
even look at, it's the rich person's religion.

755
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,530
He's the one that builds the church or

756
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,730
the synagogue or the mosque.

757
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,030
You could read about this in history.

758
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,370
All through America, I know a family from

759
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,730
Ohio, a little town in Ohio, my dad

760
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,050
was a painting contractor, the largest painting contractor

761
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,090
in the area, and he built the first

762
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,470
church.

763
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,450
Well, guess what?

764
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,550
That church would be the denomination of the

765
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,470
guy who funded it.

766
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,230
You see how it works?

767
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,150
Oh, yeah.

768
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,670
So when you're ahead of the game and

769
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,150
you start to see the people, you could

770
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,650
steer the people and say, well, we'll keep

771
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,290
telling them that they're free because this is

772
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,970
how the world started out, but we're going

773
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,890
to control them.

774
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,230
We're going to give them bullshit because, look

775
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,050
at them, they believe they like it anyway.

776
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,930
When we tell them bullshit and give them

777
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,090
garbage, quality mental stuff, they smile and laugh

778
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,970
and enjoy and go back to their jobs.

779
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,710
But when we give them serious information, they

780
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,090
become contemplative and they don't work as well,

781
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,490
you see.

782
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,730
They're still free.

783
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,470
Everyone is still free.

784
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,470
So, like, even in the most despotic state,

785
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,970
you could pick, like, Stalin or, you know,

786
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,290
let's use modern terms, you know, Bopod, Hitler,

787
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:01,690
whatever.

788
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,230
The people there were still free.

789
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,290
Why?

790
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,650
Because none of those atrocities that you've heard

791
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,890
about in history, whether they're true or not

792
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,310
is irrelevant.

793
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm giving it as an example.

794
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,910
We could use another planet.

795
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,350
That could not happen without the support of

796
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,790
the people.

797
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,070
Just like the video I put up recently

798
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,610
about somebody coming forward.

799
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,190
They call it TIs or gang stalking or

800
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,470
whatever.

801
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,030
All kinds of techniques.

802
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,250
Well, there's a million people that are doing

803
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:26,510
that.

804
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,570
I mean, it's like – how many times

805
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,910
have you heard me say that even your

806
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,270
best intellectual professors can't go beyond third or

807
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,190
fourth grade mentality?

808
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,290
I remember growing up in the public school

809
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,710
system and private school system, in both, it

810
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,170
doesn't matter how – if you go to

811
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,890
an expensive school, private or public, there's always

812
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,530
going to be a, quote, unquote, kid that's

813
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,310
being picked on.

814
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,350
Or no one wants to touch him, right?

815
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,690
Okay, so that mentality stays in.

816
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,490
And then it's applied now.

817
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,930
So it's very simple.

818
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,710
It's not part of human society or human

819
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,710
culture only because it's – it is now

820
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,830
because you don't think about it.

821
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,190
It's tradition and culture, you see.

822
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,750
Okay, so you're still free.

823
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,610
So even the most despotic dictators and atrocious,

824
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,090
quote, unquote, governments or controllers that were put

825
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,090
in place could not do it without the

826
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,870
help of a percentage of their people, a

827
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,810
good percentage, right?

828
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,350
Now because of technology, and I put it

829
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,770
in that YouTube, because you only need less

830
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,370
than 1% of the people to really

831
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,790
dominate the other 99 because they've already agreed

832
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,750
to electronic dog leashes and electronic devices to

833
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,870
capture their attention and their mobility, right?

834
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,670
Yeah.

835
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,410
So you still are – you're always going

836
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,150
to be free, right?

837
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,770
It's just that you don't know what it

838
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,150
means.

839
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,150
Like Dimitri, on one of his videos, said,

840
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,630
Calasso says, people don't have the ideology of

841
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:51,950
freedom.

842
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,340
Like in America, in the Western world especially,

843
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,160
if you said, well, let's get rid of

844
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,940
these systems, no more electronic money, we've got

845
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,140
real money, people would freak out.

846
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,120
No, no, no, we want the convenience of

847
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,540
it, right?

848
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,680
Right, right.

849
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,420
See?

850
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,700
I mean, how easy would it be, for

851
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,080
example, for – I know that when I

852
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
was at AFR and I was asking for

853
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,380
donations for AFR, which you could just go

854
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,900
to the home website or whatever, and raised

855
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,640
about $1,500 in three weeks from people

856
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,900
electronically because it's so easy.

857
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,560
Oh, I like what he's saying.

858
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,980
I'm going to go PayPal right now, click,

859
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,180
click, click, click, $20 or $100 or $50.

860
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,460
Or for Ocelli, it could raise like $500

861
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,420
for Ocelli in two days electronically.

862
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,160
But when I tell people, if you want

863
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,800
to send something in the mail, oh, no,

864
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,580
I don't want to do that.

865
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,060
I still get some people sending stuff in

866
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,320
the mail.

867
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,400
You know, more and more people don't even

868
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,060
know how to fill out an envelope.

869
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,260
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,840
And I don't think they even teach it

871
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,220
anymore.

872
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,300
No, I don't think anything is really being

873
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,040
taught outside of what needs to be taught.

874
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,700
Correct, right.

875
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,340
So you're always free.

876
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,640
The only thing is you have to factor

877
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,420
in that the pranksters, like they always tell

878
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,520
you in the media you're free.

879
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,280
By the way, I'm looking on the Internet,

880
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,800
it says election day in America.

881
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,760
Oh, yeah.

882
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,760
You don't need to go.

883
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,900
If you think that has anything to do

884
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,160
with anything, you need to go get some

885
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,900
pills for your brain.

886
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,880
You need to get some, what do they

887
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,200
call it?

888
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:31,900
Vacation.

889
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,220
Oswald, that's like the old Bill Hicks thing.

890
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,300
He went to the memorial at the book

891
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,660
depository where Kennedy, his assassin supposedly, shot Kennedy.

892
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,160
And he says it was very accurate because

893
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
they had the rifle there, the window was

894
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,640
there, and the rope, but Oswald wasn't there.

895
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,020
That's why it was very accurate, right, when

896
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,080
he saw the memorial, right?

897
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,360
Sure.

898
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,140
So anyway, it's just so stupid to vote.

899
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,760
And they even tell you, if you understand,

900
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,860
do you know why they promote voting commercially?

901
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,660
I've gone over this before.

902
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm not putting you on the spot.

903
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:12,840
Right.

904
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,840
Because you have to fill out a form

905
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,920
to register, and that form is monetized 50

906
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,800
,000 bucks front end in most places.

907
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,540
How do I know this?

908
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,120
I poked around where I shouldn't have been.

909
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,400
It got me in trouble back when I

910
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,920
was in New Mexico for a little while,

911
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,620
about a dozen and a half years ago,

912
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,720
or a dozen years ago, I should say.

913
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,340
I knew a guy who was driving around

914
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,840
in a brand new BMW.

915
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,520
His wife had a brand new Mercedes and

916
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,680
had a big house, a young guy in

917
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,300
his 20s, and he was like the Republican

918
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,340
registrant voter.

919
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,820
He was in charge of collecting registrations and

920
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,180
getting people to register to vote.

921
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,220
He got a commission on those forms, which

922
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,040
was a tiny amount of commission, but still.

923
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,580
When you figure out that, I'm like, whoa,

924
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,880
that must be at least 50 grand.

925
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,460
I started poking around and started seeing numbers

926
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,880
in code, and it was way up in

927
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,600
the tens of thousands for every time someone

928
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,280
signs up.

929
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,780
Where do they get it from?

930
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,139
They get it from the social, the credit

931
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,600
that you have.

932
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,199
By the way, I want to talk about

933
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,420
that.

934
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,820
You have a credit line.

935
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,100
You can't use it.

936
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,440
I remember a case where someone had used

937
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,639
it and bought a whole bunch of stuff,

938
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,060
and then a year later, the attorney general

939
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,739
crashed on him because they were supposed to

940
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,940
punish him for figuring out the truth.

941
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,960
In the court case, it said that he

942
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,659
was using public funds because he was taking

943
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,280
the Social Security number and sending it to

944
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,719
the Treasury on a check.

945
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,440
So guess what?

946
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,760
Where do you get the Social Security number

947
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,219
from?

948
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,620
Health and Human Services, the Treasury Department of

949
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,580
Commerce, it's all public funds, and they're telling

950
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,540
you it's private.

951
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:50,679
Yeah.

952
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,440
Hold on to it.

953
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,300
It's public funds, man.

954
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,600
In other words, the credit line that you're

955
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,520
given to operate in this country is considered

956
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,800
public funds.

957
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,860
All right.

958
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,820
Anyway, too much.

959
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,760
Too much TMI, they call it, right?

960
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,460
Right.

961
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,720
Oh, my.

962
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,420
Thankfully, I didn't have any of the pranksters

963
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,560
reminding me that I needed to go vote,

964
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,800
which is very good.

965
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,000
Of course, I'm in the back.

966
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,960
I don't have to do it.

967
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,700
It's on the Internet.

968
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah.

969
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,460
Oh, God, yes.

970
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,200
Let me just complete the point more about

971
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,660
the freedom.

972
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,360
Sure.

973
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,340
Even in the most dystopian society, you still

974
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,740
are free.

975
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,600
Well, you're free to leave.

976
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,840
Actually, scripturally, it is valid to do that.

977
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,740
But the problems that inhibit the freedom, and

978
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,540
even in a dystopian society, is the people

979
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,160
that are making other people's lives difficult, let's

980
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,840
say, are unlawful, which is kind of hard

981
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,740
to say unlawful because pretty much there is

982
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,640
no law anywhere.

983
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,380
But let's just say use it anyway.

984
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,260
Use the term anyway.

985
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,840
They're pranksters.

986
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,020
They don't care about law.

987
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,560
I don't know if you – they tell

988
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,840
you you're free in America, but if you've

989
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,680
ever walked into an attorney general's office or

990
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,980
a state attorney of any capacity and had

991
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,920
a discussion with them, a free discussion, he

992
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,380
says, no, you're not allowed to do this.

993
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,220
You're supposed to do what everybody else does.

994
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,300
Mm-hmm.

995
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,500
Okay.

996
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,100
I don't know if you've ever spoken to

997
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,460
any sheriffs in private or sheriff chief of

998
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,480
police or sergeants or captains.

999
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,640
No, you can't do that.

1000
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,340
You have to do what everybody else does.

1001
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,020
Right?

1002
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,180
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,820
You see what they tell you individually?

1004
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,700
You ever walked into speaking to people, prank

1005
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,180
managers?

1006
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,740
No, no, you can't do – you have

1007
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,020
to do what everybody else does.

1008
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,000
It's like they're in a hive.

1009
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:43,860
Yeah.

1010
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah.

1011
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,560
Or the lawfully – well, I don't care

1012
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,980
about the law.

1013
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,320
Just do what everybody else does.

1014
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,380
So do you see the problem?

1015
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,100
Well, here's the essence.

1016
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,480
How many times have I – you heard

1017
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,180
me say we have to make the world

1018
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,460
better to save the people?

1019
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:57,960
Never.

1020
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,560
You know why?

1021
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,200
Not one.

1022
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,160
Because it's the people that are screwed up.

1023
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,000
Why?

1024
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,300
Because their leaders are saying, we don't care

1025
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,800
about the law because we're ruling over a

1026
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,080
bunch of vulgar animals.

1027
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,510
And we like it that way because it

1028
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,830
makes it easy for us.

1029
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,850
So the pranksters now are ruling over the

1030
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,290
– you see?

1031
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,970
How many times have you heard me say

1032
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,650
you can't fix it, it just has to

1033
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,570
be mopped up?

1034
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,270
Right.

1035
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:24,930
Right?

1036
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,090
The worst thing with a toilet being clogged

1037
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,670
is when the toilet's full of shit and

1038
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,390
it's clogged.

1039
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:30,830
Yeah.

1040
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:31,510
Yeah.

1041
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,210
Ain't gonna happen.

1042
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,910
See, people think that the toilet is just

1043
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,390
clogged.

1044
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,070
No, I'm telling you that it's full of

1045
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,630
shit to the brim and it's clogged.

1046
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,710
What are you going to do now?

1047
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:44,750
See?

1048
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,670
So, it's the people's ignorance.

1049
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,890
Now, the thing is, you can't say the

1050
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,930
people are ignorant and vile due to lack

1051
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,790
of access.

1052
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,470
Access to information.

1053
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,390
Right?

1054
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,490
You can't say that.

1055
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,070
No?

1056
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,250
Ever.

1057
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,570
Ever, because how many times have I said

1058
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,470
pretty much everything you need to learn is

1059
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,790
five feet in front of you and then

1060
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,590
you go ten feet and then out from

1061
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:09,810
there?

1062
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,810
There's a book somewhere, Everything You Need to

1063
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,150
Learn in Life You Learned in Kindergarten, you

1064
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,710
know, which is a stupid social thing, but

1065
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,150
that's kind of like the sentiment.

1066
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,330
So, everyone is free.

1067
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,630
You've always been free.

1068
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,470
Right?

1069
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,230
In general.

1070
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,950
But if you read in the book of

1071
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,990
Judges, for example, or other places in Scripture,

1072
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,030
they became enslaved or oppressed by other people.

1073
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,890
The Israelites did.

1074
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,270
Why?

1075
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,390
Why did they lose their freedoms?

1076
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,230
Because of previous agreements that they did not

1077
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,510
uphold.

1078
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,970
Right?

1079
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,790
Yeah.

1080
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,490
It's not because they worshipped idols.

1081
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,570
Because there were plenty of cultures that worshipped

1082
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,370
idols that were not oppressed.

1083
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,350
It's because they promised not to worship idols

1084
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,350
and they worshipped idols.

1085
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,070
Do you see the difference?

1086
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,770
Mm-hmm.

1087
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,990
Big difference.

1088
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,470
Mm-hmm.

1089
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,770
So, you're always free.

1090
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,670
You've always been free.

1091
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,530
But when you get subject, when you drift

1092
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,730
away from objectivity and lawfulness so far, and

1093
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,910
the pranksters discover, because people are always going

1094
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,850
to discover that pranking is the easiest way

1095
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,290
to get what you want or need.

1096
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:23,790
Stealing.

1097
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,250
Right?

1098
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,710
Mm-hmm.

1099
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,850
Right?

1100
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,430
Whatever.

1101
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,350
Is always easier, unlawfully.

1102
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,450
You know, it's easier in their minds because

1103
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,610
it's allowed culturally.

1104
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:34,610
Yeah.

1105
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,210
Do what everybody else does.

1106
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,810
It's not the leadership.

1107
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,690
I'm telling you, it is not the leadership.

1108
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,770
It is the people themselves.

1109
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,130
And I prove this on a daily basis,

1110
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,250
especially when I'm speaking to people and I'm

1111
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,430
out, and there's families around with children.

1112
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,690
You know, well, children that can speak, not

1113
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,690
just children that are like in a stroller

1114
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,270
that are, you know, newborn or something.

1115
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:58,930
Right.

1116
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,590
And I said, watch these, you know, you

1117
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,390
see these, just let's stop speaking for about

1118
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,210
two minutes and look at how these parents

1119
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,510
are relating to their children back and forth.

1120
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,910
And you tell me you have a future.

1121
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,910
They're like, oh shit, this is terrible.

1122
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,150
And I'm talking about any social economic group.

1123
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,550
Any social economic group.

1124
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,850
I have a golden ghetto up here north.

1125
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,710
We go up there, there's Prada and Apple

1126
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,350
stores.

1127
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,210
And, you know, Prada is the, I think

1128
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,910
it's Italian designer, Gucci store.

1129
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,690
Okay.

1130
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:39,770
You know, there's a hundred million in credit

1131
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,630
worth of cars in a small parking lot,

1132
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,950
you know, because they're all, you know, Rolls

1133
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,930
Royce, Ferrari, Bentley, Maserati, whatever.

1134
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:45,510
Sure.

1135
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,330
The golden ghetto.

1136
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:46,550
Right.

1137
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,530
You know, retired people.

1138
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,410
And you look at how, you know, in

1139
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,830
their case, because it's a retirement community, let's

1140
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,930
say it's grandchildren and parents.

1141
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,230
And it's like, whoa.

1142
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,610
No different than the white trash in the

1143
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,210
middle of town.

1144
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,510
Or the Mexicans or the blacks or the

1145
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,950
Italians.

1146
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,990
Anywhere.

1147
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,390
All the group.

1148
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,590
Wherever you go, it's just trash.

1149
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,030
Whether they're wealthy or not, poor or not.

1150
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,850
It's just humans are just trash at this

1151
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,150
point.

1152
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,930
Right?

1153
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:15,710
Yeah.

1154
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,890
Because they've agreed.

1155
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,730
They've allowed.

1156
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,170
And you don't have to get to know

1157
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,330
them.

1158
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,350
You just listen to how they interact.

1159
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,870
So they're complaining about, like, even the video

1160
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,750
I put in, oh, how are we going

1161
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,490
to make this country better?

1162
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,710
And the guy catches himself.

1163
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,370
There's no way.

1164
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,610
There's no way.

1165
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,390
You're finished.

1166
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,100
Because you're lazy and stubborn.

1167
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,240
And, you know, I'm not going to blame

1168
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,720
the cosmic censorship, even though it is the

1169
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,620
major fault.

1170
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,000
Not at fault, but a fault.

1171
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
You know, like when you have a fault

1172
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,220
in a circuit and you find the wire

1173
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,400
or the solder joint is broken or something.

1174
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:51,760
Right?

1175
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,120
Or a short, you know, where it kills

1176
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,760
the whole thing.

1177
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,600
Or sends it to a path that doesn't

1178
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,180
allow the signal to work.

1179
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,900
That's all a short is, right?

1180
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,220
Right.

1181
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,600
It's not working for you.

1182
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,820
It's like a leak in the pipe.

1183
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,720
You turn on the faucet.

1184
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,560
Why am I not getting water?

1185
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,880
Well, because there's a big-ass leak down

1186
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,220
the street.

1187
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,840
So it's just not doing what you want

1188
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,400
it to do.

1189
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,640
It's not the leader.

1190
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,860
The people, if they're looking at the leaders,

1191
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,220
they're looking at the wrong place.

1192
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,960
Because the leaders are there because they're lazy.

1193
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,460
And also, the people in this age are

1194
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,120
not going to find out who leads them,

1195
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,480
really.

1196
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,880
Because, obviously, they have no concept of the

1197
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
spiritual world.

1198
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,220
And they have no concept of the secular

1199
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,660
world.

1200
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,340
You see?

1201
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,160
Right.

1202
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,560
There's not a lot of biblical history on

1203
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,840
the past 2,000 years.

1204
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,260
Because it all ended 2,000 years ago.

1205
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,260
And if you really want to know who

1206
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,520
is behind the scenes, you have to go

1207
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,560
back and see who was behind the scenes.

1208
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,720
Or who was running overtly 2,000 plus

1209
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,240
years ago.

1210
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,280
Who was running the world.

1211
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,520
And I've broken that down several ways.

1212
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,040
And my research on the Magi, because there's

1213
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,880
three levels to that.

1214
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,680
It's not over.

1215
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,060
I haven't been as diligent as I like

1216
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,660
to be on it.

1217
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,080
And I'm not doing it online, by the

1218
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,260
way.

1219
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,380
Some of it.

1220
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,080
But it's not.

1221
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,620
You put on stuff that you're not going

1222
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,140
to get a Magi.

1223
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,880
You have to go at it indirectly online

1224
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,340
if you could find it.

1225
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,700
But, nonetheless, there are powerful groups of people

1226
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,800
that have been endowed by deities.

1227
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,700
Like the Apkallu, for example.

1228
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,540
They're still around.

1229
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,140
Or the Nephilim.

1230
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,980
They're still around.

1231
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,940
The sons of gods are still around.

1232
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,380
The Hybrids.

1233
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,900
I'm not sure of how much of the

1234
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,120
early Genesis man is around.

1235
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,860
But descendants of Adam are around.

1236
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,510
In other words, I'm not sure of how

1237
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,810
many men that are descendants of the people

1238
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,690
that Cain said he was afraid of.

1239
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,730
Because when Cain said he was afraid of

1240
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,190
going out into the world, basically, he didn't

1241
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,390
mention he was afraid of his brothers and

1242
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,090
sisters, did he?

1243
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,450
No.

1244
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,410
He was afraid.

1245
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,530
He was just afraid of them.

1246
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,310
Who's them?

1247
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,990
You know, when you're speaking, directly or indirectly,

1248
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,970
you never give people that are kin the

1249
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,730
term them.

1250
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,010
No.

1251
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:22,850
No, you don't.

1252
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:23,590
Notice that?

1253
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,210
Always.

1254
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,890
When you use the terminology them or they,

1255
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,450
it's strangers, foreigners.

1256
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,630
Right?

1257
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,490
Yeah.

1258
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,370
So how could they, if Adam and Eve

1259
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,430
and Cain...

1260
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,730
The High One knew who they were.

1261
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,710
Oh, yeah, because he told you.

1262
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,590
He gives it to you.

1263
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,230
In etymologically form, if you look in the

1264
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:50,930
Hebrew etymology and in the Hebrew concordance and

1265
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,810
or interlinear, you'll see that they're not given

1266
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,590
names, but they're given descriptions.

1267
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:57,490
Yeah.

1268
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,110
You had the man of remembrance and you

1269
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,790
had the female.

1270
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,310
Mm-hmm.

1271
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,110
Where Adam was never called the man of

1272
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,730
remembrance and Eve was never called a female.

1273
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,230
No.

1274
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,350
Yep, and they had 2,000 years to

1275
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:15,890
muck about.

1276
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:16,490
To do a lot.

1277
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,310
Yeah.

1278
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,110
That's a lot of time.

1279
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,170
And there's a lot of other stuff in

1280
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,710
Genesis that needs to be discussed.

1281
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,310
That's right in front of you, right there,

1282
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,570
and I haven't brought it up yet, and

1283
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,010
I'm waiting.

1284
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,510
And last week I said the reason why

1285
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,050
there hasn't been much commentary on it is

1286
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,510
because you can't yet, is what I should

1287
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,430
have finished off saying.

1288
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,050
You can't yet.

1289
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,690
So hurry up and do it.

1290
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,550
Somebody.

1291
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,320
But not because of my sake or your

1292
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,800
sake, just for the sake of it.

1293
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,400
Because we can't be that piss poor of

1294
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,360
a human race, are we?

1295
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,220
Yes, we are, actually.

1296
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,120
It's that pathetic.

1297
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,320
What else is there in Genesis prior to

1298
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,900
the creation of man, even after, all the

1299
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,840
way to chapter 5 that needs to be,

1300
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,160
it's just like in neon lights, if you're

1301
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,480
reading an interlinear, and no one's saying anything.

1302
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,960
It's like, man, I'm not going to say

1303
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,100
it.

1304
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,760
You know what?

1305
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,000
I better get quote-unquote paid for it.

1306
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,660
I'm not saying it in public, and I'm

1307
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,600
not going to do it for free.

1308
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,080
Sorry.

1309
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,140
Too much work went behind to figure it

1310
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,340
out.

1311
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,040
So, in other words, paid for it doesn't

1312
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,580
mean, well, you send me money and I'll

1313
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:29,980
tell you.

1314
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,180
No, that doesn't mean that either.

1315
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,600
It means that it's a position of empowerment

1316
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,100
that shouldn't be granted freely, based on the

1317
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,620
subject.

1318
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,100
You know what I mean?

1319
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:42,700
No.

1320
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,940
Like, for example, let's talk about the medical

1321
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,480
industry.

1322
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,300
You could talk to these medical morons that

1323
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,160
have licenses in state training and all that.

1324
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,960
How many of them actually tell you how

1325
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,640
to treat a simple cut or a wound

1326
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,040
effectively, that goes beyond anything that they can

1327
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,200
do?

1328
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,140
None.

1329
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,820
Not a one.

1330
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,400
They don't know it.

1331
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,020
And it's instinctive to do it.

1332
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,260
If you hit your nose by accident or

1333
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,240
your elbow, or you get a bump on

1334
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,640
the head, instinctively, don't you want to squeeze

1335
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:13,800
it?

1336
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,040
And don't you go, ow, my nose.

1337
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,740
Ow, my elbow.

1338
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,280
Ow.

1339
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,560
Right?

1340
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,400
Don't you do that?

1341
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,830
So how many of these medical morons can

1342
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,510
actually explain to you, how much is that

1343
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:28,890
worth?

1344
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,930
A lot, believe it or not.

1345
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,750
By the way, it works really well on,

1346
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,950
not a lot in terms of, you know,

1347
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,250
I'll give me money and I'll tell him,

1348
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:37,490
Greek.

1349
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:37,770
No.

1350
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,030
Empowering.

1351
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,150
It's worth a lot.

1352
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,110
It's very empowering.

1353
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,830
Yesterday I used, I have an oven that's

1354
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,190
modified.

1355
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,610
By the way, just jump around here to

1356
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:46,850
cooking.

1357
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:47,550
Sure.

1358
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,830
I have like a Roper brand.

1359
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,050
It's a restaurant style oven.

1360
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,410
But it's not stainless steel.

1361
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:54,950
It's baked enamel.

1362
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,310
But it has the restaurant type grid on

1363
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:57,870
top, you know.

1364
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:58,570
Sure.

1365
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,690
It's not the, you know, it's very wide.

1366
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,110
Anyway, when you open up the oven, it's

1367
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,310
gas burner on the bottom, broiler section, oven

1368
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:06,710
section.

1369
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,050
What I did is I put a solid

1370
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,710
partition so when I turn on the oven,

1371
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,430
it gets really, really hot beyond the 500

1372
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,490
or 600 degrees really, really fast because it's

1373
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,390
a small volume.

1374
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,960
Well, I was doing something stovetop like I

1375
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,280
like to, but I wanted it crispy and

1376
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,640
I knew this oven will go to 500

1377
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,960
degrees in 30 seconds flat with that compartment.

1378
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,900
So I threw it in there.

1379
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,520
It's a Lincoln pan.

1380
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,360
Sure.

1381
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,660
It's a restaurant, very thick, heavy stainless steel

1382
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,300
pan, copper bottom, you know, with a handle.

1383
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,720
So I put it on the stovetop and

1384
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,680
about five or six minutes later I forgot

1385
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,200
that I had been there and I grabbed

1386
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,260
it and I actually hear the searing sound

1387
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,600
when I touched it.

1388
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,120
You know, the searing sound?

1389
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,400
Yeah.

1390
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:50,740
Yeah.

1391
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,940
I'm like, oh, that's not going to be

1392
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,220
good.

1393
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,400
So I wrapped three of the fingers and

1394
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,580
it was quite painful for about an hour.

1395
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,180
Really tight, to the point where I did

1396
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,580
let it go for about half an hour.

1397
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,560
It got a little numb.

1398
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,600
Replaced it and went over this.

1399
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,440
Today it looks like nothing happened.

1400
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,240
And where the blisters would have formed, there

1401
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,100
was no fluid in the blister.

1402
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,720
You just see that the skin is partitioned

1403
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,240
white in that area, like a pale chalky

1404
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,240
white color.

1405
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,160
But there's no fluid in the blister.

1406
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,120
You see?

1407
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:25,860
Yeah.

1408
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,620
You get it?

1409
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:26,800
Yeah.

1410
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,300
Right.

1411
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,480
Because the vacuum was not broken.

1412
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,940
So it does also work for that.

1413
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,900
So there are so many things that can

1414
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,140
be discussed that are very high value, empowering

1415
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,040
and all that.

1416
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,300
Let me just go back to Genesis.

1417
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,720
Again, if you're going to be conservative, there's

1418
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,820
the rabbis, the ancient sages, says, if you

1419
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,660
know, be happy.

1420
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,780
If you know what it is, don't say

1421
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:48,960
it.

1422
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,440
And for the commoners that don't know, be

1423
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,060
happy with what you know, because these things

1424
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,920
should be kept secret.

1425
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,780
I don't really agree with that.

1426
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,600
I'm not saying what they're saying is wrong.

1427
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,920
There's purpose to it, though.

1428
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,420
There is.

1429
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,100
Yeah.

1430
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,580
Right?

1431
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,960
Because, see, the wicked people always mock.

1432
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,100
And they don't know how to act.

1433
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,360
I mean, there's plenty of people that I've

1434
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,500
been around for years doing Greek speaking and

1435
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:11,980
other things like that.

1436
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,300
And then I pull back and I'm going

1437
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,040
to look at this person.

1438
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,300
They're just, you can't polish a turd, really.

1439
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,860
You have to just walk away.

1440
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,740
They don't improve themselves.

1441
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,380
They can't explain anything.

1442
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,320
So you've just got to walk away.

1443
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,580
You've just got to be like, okay, that's

1444
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,280
next.

1445
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,120
Well, I think one of the bigger reasons

1446
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,560
would be when the pranksters get a hold

1447
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,220
of the info.

1448
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,260
Oh, well, the pranksters won't understand it because

1449
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,960
it's in conflict with their mindset.

1450
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,920
But if they do, they have a huge

1451
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,580
opportunity.

1452
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,540
Well, look at Simon Megas.

1453
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,920
Oh, in that case.

1454
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,080
Yeah, well, the thing is, humans are very

1455
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,980
easy to prank.

1456
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,820
So, I mean, you should be able to

1457
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,380
see through it if you have the mindset.

1458
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,900
So they don't need much to do it.

1459
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,960
See, what the pranksters, like all the politicians,

1460
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,140
the heads of your scientists, your heads of

1461
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,800
entertainment, your medical people, your religious people, they're

1462
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,400
figureheads by the secret people that have been

1463
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,700
in power for thousands of years.

1464
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
We don't know who they are.

1465
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,880
Actually, you can figure out who they are.

1466
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,060
I'm not going to get into that.

1467
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,420
You could figure out who they are.

1468
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,100
But if you put their names in Google,

1469
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,820
they won't show up, by the way.

1470
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,420
And if you got real specific with their

1471
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,100
names, you're going to have a problem with

1472
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,220
Google, by the way.

1473
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:34,920
Yeah.

1474
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,640
Because they control Google as their company.

1475
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,020
And they know that.

1476
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,920
So these are all just your basic morons.

1477
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,780
The reason why, you know, all your religious

1478
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,840
leaders, your political leaders, your medical leaders, your

1479
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,840
legal leaders, lawful, they have to put a

1480
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,540
moron in that position because if he wasn't

1481
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,160
a moron, the people would see them and

1482
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,840
say there's something wrong with this guy because

1483
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,500
he's not a moron like us.

1484
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,100
Right.

1485
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,640
They won't be able to relate.

1486
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,120
You get it?

1487
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:07,580
Right.

1488
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,000
And that's why they're called figureheads, you know,

1489
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,280
all of your religious leaders.

1490
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,880
I mean, you know, give me an example.

1491
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,320
Years ago, back in the 80s, I was

1492
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,440
hanging out with some people that did, quote,

1493
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,480
unquote, real estate rentals, high-end rentals in

1494
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,760
New York.

1495
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,060
We rented some people from Tibet.

1496
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,940
And I thought I was being cool by

1497
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,340
talking about the Dalai Lama, and they all

1498
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,660
put a frown on their face.

1499
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,780
They were like upper-class Tibetans, you know.

1500
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,280
Sure.

1501
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,560
And they were like, and one of the

1502
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,720
younger said, well, you guys don't like the

1503
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,080
Dalai Lama.

1504
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,900
And he said, nope, we do not.

1505
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,780
He's a CIA drug dealer pedophile.

1506
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,700
He deals, he steals children.

1507
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,720
He deals in drugs.

1508
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,760
He works for the CIA.

1509
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,040
He covers up for all the crimes of

1510
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,280
the Western intelligence agencies and Western business people,

1511
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,820
essentially.

1512
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,080
And I was like, ooh.

1513
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
And I thought, like, the Dalai Lama was,

1514
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,640
like, the shit, right?

1515
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,300
Because that's what they want you to think.

1516
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:58,960
Right.

1517
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,480
Right?

1518
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,340
Wow.

1519
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,360
So if the Dalai Lama is imagining what

1520
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,780
the Pope is doing, right?

1521
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,300
Well, you know.

1522
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,180
Right.

1523
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,540
Whoa.

1524
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:09,940
You know?

1525
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:10,800
Wow.

1526
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,640
Talk about fried foreskins in a bag for

1527
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,200
snacks.

1528
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,480
So, you know, and all these guys, you

1529
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,880
know, all these guys are put in front

1530
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,360
of you.

1531
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,980
They have to be this way because that's

1532
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,320
what people resonate with, you see.

1533
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,120
The people that are in power that are

1534
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,240
behind the scenes are completely, you know what

1535
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,280
their number one thing is?

1536
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:33,940
Secrecy.

1537
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,860
That's their number one thing.

1538
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,880
They still get out.

1539
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,240
They get out and about.

1540
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,540
They're not, like, underground and they're not hiding.

1541
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,820
They're in your face.

1542
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,680
You can run into them if you know

1543
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,240
what to look for.

1544
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,080
Right?

1545
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,160
And I've explained this to people.

1546
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,140
I did a long Skype about ten years

1547
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,880
ago or less.

1548
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,920
Maybe it was Skype.

1549
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,700
I was a year into Skype or whatever.

1550
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,140
I was talking about the Bilderbergs, right?

1551
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,620
So I said, look, okay, we got all

1552
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,500
these Alex Jones photos and all these other

1553
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:03,840
people.

1554
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,940
Try to get as many photos as possible

1555
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,220
of people going to the Bilderbergs.

1556
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,760
You see, like, Henry Kissinger and this other

1557
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,240
guy in the back of the limousine, right?

1558
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,960
Window down.

1559
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,080
You see Prince Charles.

1560
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,140
You see all these other guys.

1561
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,880
I said, well, look, you're not noticing.

1562
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,860
You see these guys that you're looking at

1563
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,680
the wrong person.

1564
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,340
These people in the back seat that you

1565
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,320
know about, look at their faces.

1566
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,380
They're in terror.

1567
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,720
And who are they in terror of?

1568
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,540
The driver.

1569
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,080
Because the driver is the guy who's really

1570
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,860
in power.

1571
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,000
The janitor.

1572
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,580
When you control the world and you want

1573
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,680
to go to a Bilderberg, you dress up

1574
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,540
as housekeeping.

1575
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,600
You drive there as the chauffeur.

1576
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,420
Take the chauffeur's photo, not Kissinger's photo, and

1577
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,520
run him through a database.

1578
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,920
You won't find him.

1579
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,840
Because he owns the database.

1580
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,160
Wake up.

1581
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,820
Think about it.

1582
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,420
It's 007 time, people.

1583
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,420
Or, you know, who was it?

1584
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,220
Ben Franklin was number 72.

1585
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,640
You know, they like to number their agents.

1586
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,120
You know, Ben Franklin was a spy.

1587
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,120
He probably instigated the Revolution, but it only

1588
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,980
goes so far, so the English always still

1589
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,580
had the upper hand to put their institutions,

1590
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,560
banking, religion, academia.

1591
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,500
Because if the American Revolution went so far,

1592
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,200
it would have prohibited anything English other than

1593
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,920
commercial, and it would have been filtered as

1594
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,240
such.

1595
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,560
But anyway, so he was number 72, allegedly.

1596
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,480
There's a mysterious number 72 during the war,

1597
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,980
and although the correspondence fits only with one

1598
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,360
man, it was also with France, because the

1599
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,380
enemy was not England.

1600
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,380
It was France, and it was France versus

1601
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,960
England during those times, because France was the

1602
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,600
most advanced country in the world for at

1603
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,920
least 100 years already.

1604
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,130
But anyway, so no one is paying any

1605
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:00,470
attention.

1606
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:01,510
No one's being objective.

1607
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,190
Let's say no one.

1608
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,090
Yeah, there are out there.

1609
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,110
I don't know where they are or who

1610
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,450
they are, but it doesn't matter at this

1611
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:05,730
point.

1612
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,590
No one's being lawful, because lawful just means,

1613
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,910
you know, what are you basing it on,

1614
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:11,270
right?

1615
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,530
So, for example, if you know that mankind,

1616
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,370
I'm not saying believe in, know that you

1617
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,050
are a created being, and there are gods

1618
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,910
put over each nation, but there is one

1619
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,070
creator, who actually humbled himself to come down

1620
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,450
and be a god over a group of

1621
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:26,790
people.

1622
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,830
That's why they're called chosen people.

1623
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,110
People don't know why.

1624
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:32,610
They're so stupid.

1625
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,310
You still hear, oh, what makes them chosen?

1626
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,530
That's embarrassing to ask that question.

1627
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,930
It means you're a total oaf.

1628
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,210
How many times do you hear, like the

1629
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,450
anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist types, what makes them

1630
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:44,850
chosen?

1631
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,330
You hear that all the time.

1632
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,110
Even Ocelli used to add people on and

1633
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:48,970
laugh about that.

1634
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,050
That shows you're just like a common oaf.

1635
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,090
That means you have no education at all

1636
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:54,870
about anything.

1637
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,410
None of them do.

1638
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,690
People that are educated and don't have an

1639
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,510
agenda and do not do YouTubes, people, they

1640
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,350
don't do shows.

1641
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,530
That's why I don't do shows.

1642
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,630
I do sonic events.

1643
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,290
Here it comes.

1644
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,850
I heard it or not, or was I

1645
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:11,270
listening?

1646
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,950
Did you hear that?

1647
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,050
Yeah, I heard that.

1648
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,570
Yeah, but were you listening?

1649
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,430
Right.

1650
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,530
So, you can't polish a turd.

1651
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,350
There's seven billion, you could presume seven billion

1652
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,350
turds on this planet.

1653
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,530
Which one can be polished?

1654
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,130
Don't bother.

1655
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,650
You don't want to find, you want to

1656
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,270
find people.

1657
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,510
Who was the Greek philosopher?

1658
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,410
I keep forgetting his name.

1659
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,530
I look him up and I forget him.

1660
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,750
He lived in a clay vase, a large

1661
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,790
terracotta vase in the forest.

1662
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,690
And he would come out into the marketplace

1663
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,090
in ancient Greece with a lantern at noontime,

1664
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,010
a lit gas lamp, an oil lamp.

1665
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:47,570
Right.

1666
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,850
And he put it in people's faces.

1667
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:49,730
And he says, what are you doing that

1668
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:49,870
for?

1669
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,470
He says, I'm looking for an anthropos, which

1670
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,470
is, you know, mankind.

1671
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:53,810
Because none of you fit.

1672
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,130
None of you fit the bill.

1673
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:57,230
Anyway.

1674
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,890
All your secret societies started with the ancient

1675
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:01,710
Greeks, by the way.

1676
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,050
Your attorneys, the Bar Association, all that shit

1677
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,990
in the western world.

1678
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,750
And there was always a very deep connection

1679
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,910
between the eastern and the western.

1680
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,730
Don't ever think that there's xenophobia.

1681
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,090
Xenophobia came later with what they call the

1682
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,010
early dynasties.

1683
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,830
But no one ever wants to tell you

1684
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,150
what was going on when you had a

1685
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,070
new world order on the earth, you know,

1686
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:24,970
after the flood.

1687
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,610
You know, around the time before the flood

1688
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,630
and just after the flood, the whole world

1689
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,310
was connected.

1690
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,370
It became disjointed later.

1691
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,750
Because the nations were set up in populace

1692
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,930
and in priority over each, you know, each

1693
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,530
god decided, you know, let's make it interchangeable

1694
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,190
here and xenophobic here.

1695
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,030
Xenophobic means no strangers.

1696
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,170
So xenophobia came later.

1697
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:56,050
But anyway, yeah, I don't know what, you

1698
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,530
know, every time I do a sonic event,

1699
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,670
it's like, why bother?

1700
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,290
You know, why bother?

1701
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:04,050
But I know that there is a very,

1702
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:07,970
very, very, very small, minute group of people

1703
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,870
out there, not as a group or as

1704
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:11,970
followers or whatever.

1705
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,310
It's like someone was saying, you know, I'm

1706
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,250
not looking for students.

1707
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,310
I'm looking for teachers.

1708
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,990
I'm not interested in students.

1709
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,950
Right?

1710
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,510
Because then you have to set up a

1711
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,170
form of exchange and tuition.

1712
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,290
You have to set up a school and

1713
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:25,750
all that.

1714
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,770
And then you have to check them and

1715
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,550
make sure they learn it.

1716
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,170
Nah, fuck that.

1717
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,610
I'm looking for teachers, people that, people who

1718
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,110
want to teach.

1719
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,150
I'm not looking for students.

1720
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,170
I don't care about students.

1721
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,490
It's too way down the ladder.

1722
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,690
Not that I'm way like a high.

1723
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,470
It's just that it's too far.

1724
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,210
It's too late.

1725
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,210
I mean, there's not enough.

1726
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,490
In other words, there's 7 billion people on

1727
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:45,950
the earth.

1728
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,710
You know, you go, you find 5, 10,

1729
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,910
20 or 100 that can, that can be

1730
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,470
objective, that can be lawful, that could be,

1731
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,590
have a good mindset and let them go

1732
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:57,150
teach it.

1733
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,610
A student is irrelevant at this point.

1734
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:10,960
So anyway, the whole thing, again, just where

1735
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,220
we started off, I did put a YouTube

1736
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,840
in there.

1737
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,020
It's worth looking at in the chat.

1738
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,180
I don't know what the title is.

1739
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,560
I should go look on the computer.

1740
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,320
Look it up.

1741
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,340
It's about a guy who used to do

1742
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,420
gang stalking and he's speaking about like Seattle,

1743
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,520
Washington is a hub for using tech.

1744
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,020
What is it?

1745
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:31,860
What do you call radio?

1746
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,520
Tesla called it when you use technology to

1747
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,260
mind control people and harm them.

1748
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,300
What's the term?

1749
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,480
Tesla coined it a while back, Bruce.

1750
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,200
Anyway, it's where you use radio waves and

1751
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,260
microwaves to beam at people to inflict pain

1752
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,860
or mind control or voices.

1753
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:59,650
Anyway, so he says Amazon Corporation and some

1754
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,840
company called SIS in California and all that.

1755
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,880
So anybody in Seattle, Washington got any firsthand

1756
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,960
knowledge or even secondhand knowledge of that?

1757
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,080
It'd be interesting to start a little conversation

1758
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,620
about it.

1759
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,660
I'm not against it.

1760
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,440
I'm not for it.

1761
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,440
It's just I just want to know if

1762
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,320
I run across something like that.

1763
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,440
It'd be good to have it confirmed.

1764
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,760
And if it's not confirmed, it doesn't matter.

1765
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
Are you still there, Bruce, or are you

1766
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:29,880
muted?

1767
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

1768
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,480
I was looking at a video up for

1769
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,960
you and also checking on the Greek guys

1770
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,240
in the clay pot.

1771
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,220
Oh, OK.

1772
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,360
Muted in between there.

1773
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,060
Sorry about that.

1774
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,320
No, he's a Greek philosopher.

1775
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:44,400
Yeah.

1776
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,760
Yeah.

1777
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,700
He was just tired.

1778
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,760
He was just, you know.

1779
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,860
So we're here on this planet with this

1780
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:57,280
sick society, depraved, sick, and waiting for the

1781
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,380
mop-up crew 12 and a half years

1782
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:00,980
or less.

1783
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,630
So what do you want to do?

1784
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,150
Do what you've always been doing.

1785
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,910
Food, water, clothing.

1786
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,090
Good company.

1787
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:20,610
All right.

1788
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,610
Looking at some e-mails.

1789
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:22,990
I think I mentioned them.

1790
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,750
They were mostly sent before I started.

1791
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:27,470
So I don't see any questions here.

1792
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,930
Molecular weight of water.

1793
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,470
Someone was sending an e-mail about it.

1794
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,510
He doesn't understand it.

1795
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,350
I get it wrong.

1796
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,170
He had it wrong.

1797
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:43,290
Water is 18.01528 grams per mole, right?

1798
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,010
Right.

1799
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,270
And air is 28.97 grams per mole.

1800
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,450
So if we do a quick division.

1801
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,270
So it still is.

1802
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,570
So I just sent them that information.

1803
01:02:55,270 --> 01:03:02,030
So if you take roughly a rough estimate,

1804
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,630
18 divided by 29, air is 40%.

1805
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,970
It's not even 5 or 10%.

1806
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,750
It's 40% air than water.

1807
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,550
You could almost say double.

1808
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,110
Because 18 is pretty close.

1809
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,030
Yeah, 29 is pretty close to 36, but

1810
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,070
it's not quite still off.

1811
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,970
I put it like guardians to the galaxy.

1812
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,710
They're going to put us a quarter of

1813
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,910
a mil.

1814
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,450
A quarter of a mil is a third.

1815
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,430
No, it's not.

1816
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,430
A quarter, you can't even get a pair

1817
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,510
of boots for a quarter.

1818
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,270
Right?

1819
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,050
Right.

1820
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:35,610
Yeah, anyway.

1821
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,470
Yeah.

1822
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,570
That's just really shitty.

1823
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:44,390
But, so, is it diogenes?

1824
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,010
It could be, but I'm not sure.

1825
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,170
I think it could possibly just put it

1826
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:48,270
in.

1827
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,670
So, again, learn to cook good meals.

1828
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,070
Take care of yourself.

1829
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:53,670
Good hygiene.

1830
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:54,610
Use soap.

1831
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,270
My favorite soap is any kind of a

1832
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,730
liquid soap is good, by the way.

1833
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,670
It doesn't have like vegetable tallow where you

1834
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,690
have to scrub your shower down every so

1835
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,030
often.

1836
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,470
You know, more often than not.

1837
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,410
But I like the Chandrika soap from India.

1838
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,010
I do, too.

1839
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,150
It's about a dollar fifty apart.

1840
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:13,890
I've shared that with quite a few different

1841
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,050
folks, and all had a very favorable response.

1842
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,450
Oh, good.

1843
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,750
There's a green one, and there's a yellow

1844
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,310
or an orange colored one.

1845
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,290
I like the green.

1846
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,810
You like the green?

1847
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,050
It's a little more potent, yeah.

1848
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,370
Yeah, it's really good.

1849
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,570
It's just basic.

1850
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:37,470
It's basically olive, and there's no animal in

1851
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,510
it is why I like it.

1852
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,470
Because the last thing you want to be

1853
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,810
washing with is animal tallow.

1854
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,530
Soap is basically alkaline fat.

1855
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:51,030
Soap, by the way, is alchemy.

1856
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,770
How can you start off with fat and

1857
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,990
turn it into something that actually dissolves fat?

1858
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:02,530
There's so much alchemy going on that catalysts,

1859
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:07,550
like a catalytic converter, like a hydrogenated vegetable

1860
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,410
shortening is water and oil, and it's passed

1861
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,990
over nickel and some other material, beads.

1862
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:17,370
Water and oil don't mix, but if you

1863
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:21,630
pass it over the nickel material, you don't

1864
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,530
deplete the nickel unless you go high velocity,

1865
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,170
a lot of friction, and you end up

1866
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,090
with this vegetable shortening.

1867
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:32,430
It defies science to explain because it's not

1868
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,190
real science.

1869
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,730
Or the catalytic converter.

1870
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:39,470
How does the platinum get the fuel to

1871
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,070
reignite and burn off the sulfur?

1872
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,650
It's just passive.

1873
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:49,070
So when you understand how, to a scientist,

1874
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,250
a tree, an oak growing from a seed

1875
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,990
is considered passive, by the way.

1876
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,710
It's in their paperwork that way.

1877
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,090
It's not dynamic.

1878
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:00,390
They don't consider natural growth to be dynamic.

1879
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,830
They can't.

1880
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,290
Definition.

1881
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,170
Yeah, they don't.

1882
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,290
That's why back in the 30s there was

1883
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,130
a movement called dynamic farming, with Steiner and

1884
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:14,570
all these other guys using dynamic farming methods,

1885
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,610
because they basically, even in science, what they

1886
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,310
consider organic, they still use terms as if

1887
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,070
it's not dynamic.

1888
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,270
It's still dead to them because they only

1889
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:25,450
know the chemistry of it.

1890
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:29,270
They can't touch the physics of it because

1891
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,130
it goes against their god.

1892
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:32,970
And that's where you came in with the

1893
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,930
copper tubes and all that, or the copper

1894
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:39,310
plowing and different implements.

1895
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:44,210
Right, or soil inoculation.

1896
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:50,670
You can take a very potent compost and

1897
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,250
you stuff it in a cow's horn, literally,

1898
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,570
for a certain time of year, and you

1899
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,410
bury that in the ground.

1900
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,410
And then you take that stuff you stuffed

1901
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,270
in the cow's horn and you empty it

1902
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,970
into a tank of water and you mix

1903
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:02,930
it a certain way.

1904
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,150
And you take the water out of that

1905
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,870
tank and just add it to your irrigation.

1906
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,490
It could be like parts per thousand.

1907
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,810
You could put just like a quart of

1908
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:16,870
this water into a large irrigation channel and

1909
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,330
it will make everything bloom like mad.

1910
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,470
Now, chemically, it doesn't make any sense, because

1911
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,010
the quantities are so small.

1912
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:25,670
Right.

1913
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:30,770
The way certain composting should be done, geometry

1914
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:31,850
is very important.

1915
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,910
You can't just bury it in the ground.

1916
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,930
It's how you bury it in the ground.

1917
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,670
How deep and what the shape of the

1918
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,070
hole looks like and what you cover it

1919
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,270
with.

1920
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:48,450
So, yeah, there's a lot of discussion on

1921
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,930
progress and edification to be done, but I

1922
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,150
don't see any need for it.

1923
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,530
I think that when I want to get

1924
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,630
on certain subjects, whether they're general or in

1925
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:00,570
depth or just as simple as cooking methods

1926
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,270
or whatever, I don't think there's a need

1927
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:02,690
for it.

1928
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,410
I think there's just people find to get

1929
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,250
kicks out of it.

1930
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,510
And even when they come back and say,

1931
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,490
well, it's much better now, I didn't ever

1932
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,370
really think there's a need for it in

1933
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,250
this society.

1934
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:15,270
In the next society, it'll be the only

1935
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:16,470
way it's going to be done.

1936
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,950
So it won't even be considered a need

1937
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,010
because it'll be known.

1938
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,770
You see, this society is too entrenched in

1939
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,350
their ways.

1940
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:28,109
And that doesn't mean why bother.

1941
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,950
Yes, it actually does mean why bother.

1942
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:32,069
But in a sense, if you're going to

1943
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:35,250
speak, a fool has to say something, but

1944
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,569
a wise man has something to say.

1945
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,810
I'm not saying that I'm wise, but I'm

1946
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:40,550
saying there's a lot to be said, a

1947
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,330
lot that could be said, that can be

1948
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:46,029
said, that's very edifying and all that.

1949
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:50,170
And, yeah, I'm not inspired to do that.

1950
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:52,550
I seemed like I was in the past,

1951
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,770
and I did, but I never expanded on

1952
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,350
anything because the feedback was never in a

1953
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,670
point where it graduated to the point of,

1954
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:01,430
you see.

1955
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:06,350
Even when people send me an email, most

1956
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,950
of the time it's not to expand on

1957
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,310
stuff, but most of the time it's just

1958
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,130
to restate something that they missed.

1959
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:12,910
And if you missed it, it's not my

1960
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:13,310
problem.

1961
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,550
You need to stop saying, did you hear

1962
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:17,870
that?

1963
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,490
And start saying, maybe I should listen again.

1964
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,250
Instead of, did you hear what he said?

1965
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,550
No, I don't care about hearing, I care

1966
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,210
about listening.

1967
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:36,229
And if you tie in, let's say, the

1968
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:38,930
biggest feedback I've gotten from a positive outset,

1969
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:41,649
which is, of course, what you expect from

1970
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:44,090
a materialistic society, is based on water and

1971
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,450
food.

1972
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,910
Some on scripture, but it just dies on

1973
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:50,270
the vine.

1974
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,229
I mean, there's really no one really interested

1975
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,630
in scripture.

1976
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,710
They say they are, but it doesn't matter

1977
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,170
what they say, I watch and see what

1978
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:59,390
they do, which is, nothing's going on.

1979
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,590
And that's not a complaint, by the way,

1980
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,570
that's just an observation.

1981
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,990
You don't want to hear my complaints.

1982
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,550
I don't complain because, why bother?

1983
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,330
Complaining doesn't help.

1984
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,830
And it's not a disapproval, because I don't

1985
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,450
want to give approval or disapproval.

1986
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:20,730
The thing is, are you pursuing a mindset

1987
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:25,410
that is objective, that is lawful, that is

1988
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:25,850
clear?

1989
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,520
So, again, make sure you prepare some good

1990
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,820
water and food for yourselves, and whatever.

1991
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,980
And if you're white people, you have to

1992
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,780
try extra hard, because you have a handicap.

1993
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,400
If you have a culture that comes from

1994
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,800
Europe or Asia, that handicap is not there

1995
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,660
as much as Western culture.

1996
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,560
Just remember where you came from and that

1997
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,560
place, they did a pretty banging job.

1998
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,620
As long as you could hybridize the methodologies

1999
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:06,980
of European, let's say, Mediterranean and Asian cooking

2000
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:11,620
with lawfulness, you'll be alright.

2001
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,540
So, I don't see any questions or anything,

2002
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,800
any other comments or anything, otherwise we'll just

2003
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,740
do it right here.

2004
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,300
You don't have to be long.

2005
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,760
Just to reiterate, you're always free, and everyone

2006
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,280
has always been free, as Free Will would

2007
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:32,760
have it.

2008
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,920
That's why they want you to pledge allegiances.

2009
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,920
Have you ever heard of that?

2010
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:39,740
Oh, yes.

2011
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,200
Pretty harsh if you don't.

2012
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,120
Well, that's okay, because they don't know.

2013
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,240
Well, you should remember that when you were

2014
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,780
growing up, you had that.

2015
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,820
And the reason that they're harsh is because

2016
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,660
their lives will be harsh if you don't.

2017
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,820
If you don't, right.

2018
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,500
You see, right now it's hard to call

2019
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,520
the attorneys, the doctors, the priests, the rabbis,

2020
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,640
the politicians, the scientists pranksters, because their followers

2021
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,160
are so deeply entrenched, which is the majority,

2022
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,500
that they're also pranksters.

2023
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,860
So there's no reason to state the obvious

2024
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,540
that it's a pranking society.

2025
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,020
Again, when you see parents pranking their own

2026
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,320
children, you know it's a...

2027
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,580
Forget about what the politicians, the scientists, the

2028
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,240
attorneys, the priests, the rabbis are saying.

2029
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,960
The parents are pranking their own children in

2030
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,140
their homes, in private.

2031
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,340
They don't stand a chance.

2032
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:36,860
Forget it.

2033
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,240
When they go out into the world, they're

2034
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,740
going to be accommodated and whittled down, especially

2035
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,860
with a credit-based economy, when there is

2036
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,840
no money, when your actions are being monetized.

2037
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,360
There are people I know in alternative media

2038
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,060
through the years, and I've always asked them

2039
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,340
when they talked about YouTube being monetized, where

2040
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,920
does YouTube get the money from?

2041
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,540
I don't know.

2042
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,200
I don't care.

2043
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,420
All I know is I get a couple

2044
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,360
hundred bucks every month.

2045
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,100
These are the people that are bringing you

2046
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,700
alternative media that talk about making the world

2047
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,500
a better place.

2048
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,400
I don't have to mention names.

2049
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,080
You know who they are.

2050
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,080
They don't know anything.

2051
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,900
They don't want to know.

2052
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,280
There's nothing going on, people.

2053
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:13,980
Nothing.

2054
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,040
Sorry to give you the news if you

2055
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:17,900
haven't gotten it yet.

2056
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,400
So, if you really want to find out

2057
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,200
what's going on, learn to look beyond five

2058
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,540
feet in front of you, beside you, behind

2059
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,500
you, all around you, and you'll see what's...

2060
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,840
rectify that, and you'll see what's beyond that,

2061
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,260
what you see on the stupid rectangle, all

2062
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:41,760
the morons on there, all of them, and

2063
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,540
wherever else, whether it might be in your

2064
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,040
own home, or at work, or out in

2065
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,360
the street, or whatever, you'll see that the

2066
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,880
best thing to do is food, clothing, and

2067
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,220
shelter.

2068
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,420
And up the quality of that.

2069
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,820
And on that trip, you will discover the

2070
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,560
things that matter.

2071
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,260
You know?

2072
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,960
Take time to enlighten yourself, too.

2073
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,680
So, a little bit over a decade left

2074
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,080
is not a long time.

2075
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:08,860
No.

2076
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,700
But it depends on how intense it is.

2077
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,940
You know, like, if you're in a car

2078
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,440
accident, the moment you acknowledge you're going to

2079
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,480
be in a car accident, even though by

2080
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,980
the stopwatch it's .8 seconds, it seems like

2081
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,240
a really long time.

2082
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,240
Like, you ever fall off of a bicycle,

2083
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,260
or fall off of a ladder?

2084
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,000
The moment you realize that you're not going

2085
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,960
to recover, and you're going to go through

2086
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,240
a control, you know, fall?

2087
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,320
That's why I used to, in cycling, I

2088
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,600
used to tell people, practice dismounting.

2089
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,620
Many, many different ways, and rapid dismounts in

2090
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,200
many different ways.

2091
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:42,420
Why?

2092
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,400
Is it because a crash is just an

2093
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,840
indeliberate dismount, isn't it?

2094
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:46,740
It is.

2095
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,380
You fall off of a ladder, it's just

2096
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,120
an indeliberate dismount, isn't it?

2097
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:51,760
Indeliberate.

2098
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,920
What's the difference coming off of a ladder,

2099
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,740
as you would normally, and falling off of

2100
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,060
a ladder?

2101
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,780
There's no difference.

2102
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,600
In both cases, in one instance you're on

2103
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,140
the ladder, in the next instance you're not.

2104
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:05,560
What's the difference?

2105
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,820
One is deliberate, the other one is indeliberate.

2106
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,400
Right?

2107
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,060
You could ram a car into a tree

2108
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,960
any time of the day.

2109
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,860
What's the difference when you have an accident?

2110
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,420
Well, the result is the same.

2111
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,140
One is deliberate.

2112
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,620
You deliberately ran a car into a tree,

2113
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,660
or you had an accident.

2114
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,240
What's the difference?

2115
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,140
Or running someone over, you deliberately ran them

2116
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,460
over, or you hit them by accident.

2117
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,140
What's the difference?

2118
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,900
The result is the same.

2119
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,820
One is deliberate, one is not.

2120
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:40,250
You see?

2121
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:45,190
In other words, the more you practice, and

2122
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,710
the more ways you are aware of, and

2123
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,990
not only aware of the ways, but aware

2124
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:55,250
of going through that way, you can see...

2125
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,750
For example, if you ever hung out with

2126
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:04,070
upper-middle class teenagers, usually if they jumped

2127
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,690
out their wallet, or they said, here's my

2128
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,350
wallet, and you went through it, you saw

2129
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,290
there was a bail bondsman's card in there,

2130
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,950
prepaid for $500 or $1000.

2131
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,190
Because the parents knew, well, my son likes

2132
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,250
to drink, he's 16, 17, he's probably going

2133
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,150
to get arrested or whatever, at least he

2134
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,670
has a prepaid bail bondsman's card, he can

2135
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,330
just walk out of jail if he takes

2136
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:22,430
it.

2137
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,610
So the parents had already considered that and

2138
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:26,950
prepared.

2139
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,250
Well, no one says, well, my child's going

2140
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,010
to go to jail.

2141
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,550
Most people don't think that way, and when

2142
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,710
it happens, it's just a surprise.

2143
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:37,390
But upper-middle class and wealthy people prepare

2144
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:37,890
themselves.

2145
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,890
They say, well, they've got a teenage son,

2146
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,110
or even a daughter, and they're kind of

2147
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,590
rowdy.

2148
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,390
I think we should go to the bail

2149
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:46,270
bondsman and get a prepaid card, just in

2150
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:46,690
case.

2151
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,290
What's the difference between the two?

2152
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:55,830
One is considered what might happen, and prepared

2153
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:56,470
for it, right?

2154
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,010
What is it?

2155
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,630
One out of 1,200 times of driving,

2156
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:01,630
you're going to get a flat.

2157
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,490
So one out of 1,200 chance, or

2158
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,450
one out of 2,000 sometimes now, with

2159
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,070
better tires.

2160
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:08,890
Back in the early days, it was one

2161
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,430
out of 50.

2162
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,970
I remember back in the late 60s and

2163
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:15,270
70s, flats were still fairly popular.

2164
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,730
When they were experimenting with the extra-heavy

2165
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:21,430
steel-belted radials that actually blew through the

2166
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:22,110
thing.

2167
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,470
And back then, there were still some tires

2168
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,450
that had tubes in them.

2169
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:33,370
But anyway, why do you have a spare

2170
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,810
tire in your car if it's a one

2171
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,210
out of 200, or one out of 1

2172
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,070
,200 chance?

2173
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:43,270
Indeliberate.

2174
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:44,750
You can deliberately go out and put a

2175
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,450
hole in your tire.

2176
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,730
People don't do that, because it's inconveniencing.

2177
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,290
But if you went out and put a

2178
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,910
hole in your tire, deliberately, you said, I'm

2179
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,830
going to go put a hole in the

2180
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:55,070
tire.

2181
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,710
Well, before you do that, don't you say,

2182
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,830
well, what if I want to go somewhere

2183
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:00,330
and I can't?

2184
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,350
Before I put this hole in the tire,

2185
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,050
shouldn't I get a spare tire first and

2186
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:04,510
then do it?

2187
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:05,970
Because it seems kind of wasteful, I know.

2188
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,050
It does.

2189
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,670
Same thing when you get a flat, you

2190
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,530
prepare for it.

2191
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,190
So that's why I say this was a

2192
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,410
long way around the block, a slow walk

2193
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,090
around the block, to why bother?

2194
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,710
The mop-up crew is coming, like it

2195
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,350
or not, or know it or not, believe

2196
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,910
it or not.

2197
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:28,210
So why bother?

2198
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:34,010
So, in terms of, the reason, again, I'm

2199
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:37,950
saying that is back deep in the mind

2200
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,050
or in the spirit of most people is,

2201
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,030
well, I shouldn't say some people, not most,

2202
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,950
is they do want harmony and peace for

2203
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:46,450
everyone.

2204
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:52,590
Even the psychopaths, the real, when I think

2205
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,230
of stupid people, it gives me the chills,

2206
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,050
it's really creepy.

2207
01:18:56,490 --> 01:19:00,130
But the stupid people, even they want harmony,

2208
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,330
but they can't admit it because they just

2209
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:04,190
don't know, they're just going to do what

2210
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,270
everybody else does, right?

2211
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,470
This is the great majority, the seven billion

2212
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,890
plus, or eight billion now, whatever it is.

2213
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,550
Inherently, most people that do have a proper

2214
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:19,370
mindset, in the back of their spirit or

2215
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,930
their mind, they do consider, wow, what about

2216
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,670
a day of harmony?

2217
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,190
What about being free from all this bullshit?

2218
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,390
Because most stupid people think, oh, there's a

2219
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:29,330
threat of war, there's a threat of economic

2220
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:34,030
collapse, former people have spoken to you, what

2221
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,570
a ridiculous, how can you crash a credit

2222
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,210
-based society?

2223
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,310
All they do is cut off your credit,

2224
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,910
just like your parents cut off your allowance,

2225
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:40,570
they're not broke.

2226
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,050
You're allowed to access, because it's not even

2227
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:44,270
theirs.

2228
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:46,930
But anyway, all of these things that people

2229
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:50,550
are thinking of go away, because they're all

2230
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:50,870
fictional.

2231
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,710
They're there for several reasons.

2232
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,230
Most of them are not fiction once they

2233
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,130
take effect socially.

2234
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,270
Like, for example, rioting is a good example.

2235
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:10,410
Most riots are caused by some plausibly misgiving

2236
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,950
event, like Rodney King, remember in L.A.,

2237
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:17,170
there was blatant evidence that all the cops

2238
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:19,350
were acquitted and people rioted because they're not

2239
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,030
getting justice.

2240
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:23,090
There are so many levels to all of

2241
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:23,290
this.

2242
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,510
Or opportunists, these things are in the mind.

2243
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,550
So in the mind of a rational mindset

2244
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:33,490
that is a proper mindset, you want to

2245
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:36,030
think of a future that is clear and

2246
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:40,490
prosperous and all this, and you're going to

2247
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:41,910
get it, but it's not going to be

2248
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,730
based on the systems that are in place,

2249
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,710
that have been in place since time immemorial.

2250
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:47,110
It's going to be a new system.

2251
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,590
But here's the thing, all of the corruption

2252
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:52,750
that you see that your average human is

2253
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:58,150
involved in, willingly, is still based on something

2254
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:58,750
lawful.

2255
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,190
You see, that's why it's so difficult for

2256
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:04,390
them.

2257
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,210
See, they're putting the chips in cards right

2258
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,470
now, I know it's bank cards, right?

2259
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:13,290
They know that if they outwardly come in,

2260
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,070
one of their other problems is how they're

2261
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,510
going to chip everyone for money.

2262
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:20,790
Because they know that as long as you

2263
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,290
have something you could hold or use, like

2264
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:27,050
money, a credit card or an object, as

2265
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,730
long as it could be objectified away from

2266
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,110
you, they'll accept it.

2267
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:33,950
But very few people will accept the chip

2268
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,110
in their body for it.

2269
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,050
So that's another problem that they're having.

2270
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:40,330
The transhumanism, they want to start integrating it.

2271
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,150
They already got everyone pumped up through the

2272
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,450
food.

2273
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,890
There are elements and compounds you could put

2274
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:46,310
in food that you will ingest that will

2275
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,630
stick to your intestines, right?

2276
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,490
You know there's magnetic drinks you have to

2277
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,130
take before you do a CAT scan, right?

2278
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,030
And some of those have been recalled because

2279
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:58,390
it actually killed people, those magnetic drinks.

2280
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,130
Actually I told a lady, don't do a

2281
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:02,430
CAT scan, it doesn't matter, just do a

2282
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,690
FAST if you think you have a tumor

2283
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:04,270
in your head.

2284
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,490
She did the CAT scan anyway and then

2285
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,110
she had to have her thyroid removed or

2286
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:09,030
something a year later.

2287
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,390
Anyway, drink.

2288
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,250
Human livestock though.

2289
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,650
There's so much to discuss, but you see,

2290
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,730
most people still think money is lawful, and

2291
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,710
it's not, but once they go to a

2292
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:29,090
chip in your hand, then it's obvious, right?

2293
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:30,530
But it's too late.

2294
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,910
Years ago there was a military base in

2295
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,870
Hawaii and a woman that lived there says,

2296
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,010
oh yeah, a friend of mine's brother is

2297
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,330
part of a protest on the base, they

2298
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,050
don't want to get chipped.

2299
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,490
So what they did in the military, whoever

2300
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,350
protested, they threw them in the brig and

2301
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,630
then they just chipped them in the brig.

2302
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:49,950
Anyway, right?

2303
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,390
You get it?

2304
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,650
Is that the point?

2305
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:54,950
So.

2306
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:58,390
Yeah, you get it one way or another.

2307
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,380
So, alright, we were going to cut it

2308
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,900
short, let's I guess cut it, I don't

2309
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,860
think there's anything else.

2310
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:08,740
Okay.

2311
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,480
And we'll do it again next week maybe.

2312
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,920
You'll notice we're doing, usually I've been kind

2313
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,660
of temperamental, if there are any questions or

2314
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,200
any reason to do a sonic event, we

2315
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,840
won't do it, but we'll just come on

2316
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,780
every week maybe and if there's just nothing

2317
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,620
we'll just keep it short.

2318
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:25,480
Okay.

2319
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,120
Thanks for doing all the work behind the

2320
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,320
scenes to keep it on the servers.

2321
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,160
And I don't know how well organized it

2322
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,480
is, I haven't really been there in a

2323
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,460
long time, but if we can, I'm thinking

2324
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,020
of maybe putting some stuff on the site,

2325
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:45,540
by the way, I'm not upkeeping the Uncommon

2326
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,700
Radio site, or I'm not doing anything on

2327
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,020
it, but I might start putting some stuff

2328
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,620
on it, right now it's in free mode,

2329
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,720
I don't even want to give them the

2330
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:58,100
80 bucks or whatever a year, I'd rather

2331
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,500
buy smokes and coffee, which I have a

2332
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,660
$300 or $400 a month of smokes and

2333
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,380
coffee anyway.

2334
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,060
but I'm thinking of, that's what I mentioned

2335
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,800
earlier, maybe next week or the week after,

2336
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:16,400
or the week after that, sometime do the

2337
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:22,000
essential Greek speak abridged, mixed notes maybe, and

2338
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,320
so I could put something like that on

2339
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,980
the site, so when people look it could

2340
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,520
be something.

2341
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,700
If I can help in any way Greek,

2342
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:31,860
just let me know.

2343
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:34,340
Well if anyone's listening, here's the thing, if

2344
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,660
they do want to help, if anyone is

2345
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,420
listening, because everyone will hear, notice I said

2346
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,940
hear and listen, hear things and listen to

2347
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:43,400
things differently, if you folks are out there,

2348
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,580
I know it's been done in the past

2349
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,500
not well, and I never really told the

2350
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,260
person it wasn't done well, there's no reason

2351
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,280
for it, because I've discovered, not to complain

2352
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,780
about people's writing abilities, because I think I've

2353
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:57,680
discussed that for over 100 years now, the

2354
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,780
dumbing up, there's hardly anyone that could really

2355
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:04,360
write or read anymore, but if you want

2356
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,260
to go beyond that, and are not bashful,

2357
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,080
if you want to send me each one

2358
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,380
who's listening, if so cares to, a personal

2359
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,240
outline of what they got out of Greek

2360
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,480
speak, it could be bullet points, it doesn't

2361
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,200
have to be written, just bullet points, and

2362
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,780
I'll look at all those, and I'll put

2363
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,640
all the common ones together, and do an

2364
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,180
essential Greek speak thing, and put it up

2365
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:28,900
on the site as an introductory thing.

2366
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,420
Because of course, there's lawful timekeeping, body cooking,

2367
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,300
pranking, cosmic censorship, whatever you guys think, do

2368
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,560
an outline for me, and just email it

2369
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,040
over, and I'll take a look at it,

2370
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:45,060
just out of curiosity, to see how things

2371
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:45,620
go around.

2372
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,560
With that said, thanks again Bruce.

2373
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,440
Okay, you take care.

2374
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:52,940
See you next week.

2375
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,040
You too.

2376
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,640
Thanks everyone.
