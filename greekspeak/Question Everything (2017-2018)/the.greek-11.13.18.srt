1
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:03,870
And greetings everyone we're live with the Greek

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,390
and how are you doing tonight Greek?

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:06,770
Greetings.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,650
Yeah, it looks like this might be a

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,170
another short sonic.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,490
Maybe we'll see everything seems to be going

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,390
along as expected so Yeah, it's cold by

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,690
Where were you say about central continent of

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,090
America slightly to the north?

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm often Wisconsin mid mid, Wisconsin Hmm yeah,

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,010
I noticed the idiots are complaining about how

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,690
somebody's jamming up the jet stream And it's

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,110
not moving Well, I happen to just I

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,850
left a small device in a tree Pointing

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,130
West it's actually very well isolated It's actually

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,530
not really in a tree, but it appears

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,910
to be very well isolated and very small

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,750
and it took about eight nine days, and

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,810
it's just Translating quite well Yeah But anyway,

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,090
anybody could play with this kind of stuff.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,930
I rotated everything I rotated pointing north now,

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,710
so it's gonna make the block a little

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,330
more severe Then it'll just break it in

24
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,130
about two days.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,870
I know everything will reverse you'll get warm

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,030
weather I'm looking forward to it Mm-hmm

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,690
Yeah, like I said earlier are there any

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,130
questions or any comments or anything and not

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,770
much I mean This kind of talk is

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,090
not for this society or the people on

31
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,930
this planet But you know it happens to

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,310
exist You know and it happens to be

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,570
done so so you're mentioning something.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,550
There was a comment.

00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,170
Alex Anderson what a fascinating gent Yeah, the

38
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,690
the guy who the Swiss architect who wrote

39
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,730
about Schauberger's work.

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,030
I know this was one that was playing

41
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,530
with the beetle in levitating bow up right

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,890

43
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,570
and Alex and Olaf Alex Anderson is the

44
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,210
Swiss architect that Or from Sweden you're right.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:15,890
You're all right.

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,670
That's right.

47
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,610
He for different Articles and I might have

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,170
got that back for perendikov is the other

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,630
guy with the insect chitin Yeah, and he

50
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,650
made he made some shutters on a little

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,630
platform he's a little brown and Also, he

52
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,670
noticed that you know tubular Paper tubes painted

53
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,850
black you could bunch them up and Make

54
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,010
certain Let's say phenomenon right yeah the insects

55
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,630
were able to notice immediately right right Fascinating

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,550
guy Yeah, he talked about Schauberger a little

57
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,490
bit, but mm-hmm.

58
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,830
It's all it's all a mixed bag.

59
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,750
This is this is a broken Divided kingdom

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,530
you know it's a slave Kingdom you know

61
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,530
that the earth was given up to Especially

62
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,710
after the flood more than prior to the

63
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,770
various deities You know you know them as

64
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,750
patron deities right and They're not very they're

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,170
they're hostile, and they're in different hostile and

66
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,590
different Proactive and getting people to do the

67
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,230
wrong thing and make them allow them think

68
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,150
it's the right thing And this has been

69
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,770
going on for thousands of years That's why

70
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,010
if you just discuss a myopic version of

71
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,090
existence Which is you know what happened in

72
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,970
the past few hours or the last two

73
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,290
weeks?

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,690
Everyone's into it because that's part of the

75
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,130
censorship.

76
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,310
That's part of the The you know what

77
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,770
the effect of that you know so interesting

78
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,270
how that comes about and the many different

79
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,570
facets that are used to do it and

80
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,710
Quite quite interesting yeah to be a lot.

81
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,810
You know don't be rebellious.

82
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,230
Don't be stubborn, so if you had slaves

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,150
the which is expensive just like you know

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,150
people for example in the American especially Vernacular

85
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,990
or parlance discuss slavery as being a bad

86
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,590
thing because they're only taught about let's say

87
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,709
the American you know the the African Americans

88
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,410
or the blacks that were brought over here

89
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,250
Mistreated that's not true.

90
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,850
They were not mistreated Yes, they did you

91
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,910
know once they became more educated and so

92
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,530
it was going on popularly They didn't couldn't

93
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,170
have that kind of life, but slaves are

94
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,390
mistreated in the same way a Farmer today

95
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,630
would mistreat a quarter of a million dollar

96
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,550
Columbine harvester yeah, right If a farmer goes

97
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,850
out if you know any farmers, and he

98
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,150
goes out and spends 50 grand on a

99
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,890
brand new tractor He doesn't mistreat it no

100
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,230
right That's equipment You know just like people

101
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,210
in the military don't mistreat their equipment or

102
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,610
any you know a shoemaker doesn't mistreat his

103
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,630
tools They're the slaves are human tools.

104
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,670
You don't mistreat them right what the the

105
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,070
concept of mistreatment comes in on?

106
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,890
A subjective level depending on the actual concurrent

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,610
master because you have concurrent mouth you have

108
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,770
you know this plantation here as a master

109
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,130
Then they you know the next geographic area.

110
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,530
You know because slavery also has geographic Attributes

111
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,690
to it right if you're a slave in

112
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,910
South Carolina in in Massachusetts let's say you're

113
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,570
going to probably have different tasks than someone

114
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,430
down in you know in Louisiana right, Louisiana,

115
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,990
you'll be You know probably wet You know

116
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,630
and and working in a different industry Then

117
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,910
in the cold dry of Boston and don't

118
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,650
think that the north didn't have slaves So

119
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,650
they're not being mistreated other than what each

120
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,990
master decides for them right So again back

121
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,450
to the slave when you have slaves What

122
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,650
is what do you have to have for

123
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,570
them other than you know tasks right is

124
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,770
you have food clothing shelter?

125
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,110
Right so let's not this is a slave

126
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,970
existence, so don't be Dreaming about anything so

127
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,270
if you focus on food clothing and shelter

128
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,410
if you don't think you're a slave you're

129
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,890
an idiot Right because you're on a plantation

130
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,810
even the politicians say this politicians running the

131
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,290
country like a plantation This is you know

132
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,230
you could look this up.

133
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,110
I think Hillary Clinton said that that Bush

134
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,530
Yeah, so So food clothing shelter and minimize

135
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,810
oppression and the way you minimize oppression is

136
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,670
by minimal interaction By just it by by

137
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,830
choice if you have it some people don't

138
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,910
have a choice if you're a barista at

139
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,390
a cafe well Overtly you will not have

140
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,790
minimum interaction obviously because you'll probably be interacting

141
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,750
with no less than Several hundred people you

142
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,630
know and half part of your day at

143
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,570
least if it's a busy place not a

144
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,950
thousand But you don't have to interact with

145
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,510
them on the level that they're used to

146
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,390
interacting emotionally personally socially And it's difficult You

147
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,190
know it's difficult So but it still can

148
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,830
be done so Until it's over and later

149
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,010
on you're gonna notice the 50 70 80

150
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,390
90 hundred years whatever was nothing It was

151
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,370
a blink of an eye in in relevant.

152
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,110
You know time you know in terms of

153
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,750
Suffering something with people say oh, they're suffering

154
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,990
someone recently said oh, I'm suffering old suffering

155
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,310
what?

156
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,050
suffering means to voluntarily or Cognitively endure it

157
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,090
You know that's why if you ever know

158
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,210
you've been around any of these real smart

159
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,410
judges You know when someone sues a police

160
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,330
officer right and and the the attorney that's

161
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,470
defending the guy suing the state let's say

162
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,650
quote-unquote state and the quote-unquote police

163
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,830
officer they set up the The his client

164
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,490
sets up his client as a victim right

165
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,330
all right by the way there are no

166
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,950
good attorneys right there Semi-competent and incompetent,

167
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,170
but there are no good at you know

168
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,450
so anyway He'll put that he suffered You

169
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,610
know all these injuries and all this other

170
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,910
stuff well, that means it's voluntary And the

171
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,710
judge always s he sticks on that point

172
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,750
he'll ask the plaintiff.

173
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,190
He says did you suffer those injuries?

174
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,030
From the police officer allegedly says yes, I

175
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,130
did okay dismissed case dismissed right that means

176
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,190
you you know you were okay with it

177
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,929
All right yeah the word suffer means The

178
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,890
that you know it's what's cut it's like

179
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,429
the Greek tragedy They tell you what's going

180
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,010
to happen at the beginning of the story

181
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,490
right right they go, and then they go

182
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,850
through with it so Anyway, so when someone

183
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,530
says they're suffering.

184
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,310
I always ask what what are you suffering?

185
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,670
I know is what are you?

186
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,990
Deciding that you need to endure Yeah Anyway,

187
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,030
we could go look at etymology Oh Let's

188
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,650
see what etymology says it's obviously an origin

189
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,550
of some sort So if you're a slavery

190
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,390
is voluntary by the way, and this is

191
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,030
something that people don't understand because they're too

192
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,210
stupid of course But you know you could

193
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,530
look it up There's plenty of some what

194
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,190
they call the founding fathers America one of

195
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,710
them got famous He was an attorney because

196
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,190
he defended someone who claimed to be an

197
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,770
African King, and he never volunteered So they

198
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,490
quit they queried him on all the various

199
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,230
things that he did and he didn't volunteer

200
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,950
So they send him back with full fare.

201
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,410
You know mm-hmm Here suffer verb allow

202
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,410
to occur or continue permit tolerate fail to

203
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,500
prevent or suppress Pretty much sums that one

204
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,680
right up Yeah, another one that I asked

205
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,360
someone to look up Which I had read

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,320
somewhere was the word federal people think it

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,760

208
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,500
doesn't It's a term that's used to just

209
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
like justice has nothing to do with law,

210
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,600
but it's used to Okay, federal adjective.

211
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,640
It's a theological term and reference to covenants

212
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,760
between God and man guess what God they

213
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,880
What do you ever heard of something called

214
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
the apotheosis of?

215
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,360
George Washington where they got that moron up

217
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,880
in a throne looking down at you with

218
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
angels around him You know right feels is

219
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,420
when you raise a man to a godlike

220
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,540
level to be worried on a level of

221
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:28,460
worship Yeah, so anyway, it's a planet full

222
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,940
of morons.

223
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,440

about and time stuff or speaking on it

255
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
It's going to happen really fast once it

256
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,120
starts.

257
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,080
You know mm-hmm Everything is in place

258
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
if you know what to look for that's

259
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,220
why I always give all the details in

260
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,180
a way that I don't give details on

261
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,120
this on the actual events once they start

262
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,580
happening Just a you just need a generality,

263
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,100
but I give a lot of details on

264
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,920
what to look for now For it to

265
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:26,500
be put in place right So Sputnik news

266
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,080
is that the one you're talking about yeah,

267
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,840
that's what I was talking about yeah Chat

268
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,960
oh no There's a I got the guy

269
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,940
nailed to a cross wearing a diaper Yeah,

270
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,300
or a loin cloth or a girdle in

271
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,520
this case with the in that's the Eastern

272
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,480
Orthodox version of it Also, they're a bunch

273
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,960
of morons Are we gonna predict it as

274
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,880
Jews call for third temple to be built

275
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,200
yeah, it doesn't work that way well Armageddon

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,760
har Megiddo har Is they translate to arm?

277
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,160
And then Megiddo is the odd Megiddon, which

278
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
would be the Greek very way to say

279
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,200
it Megiddon Don't Megiddon or Armageddon Is a

280
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,360
place it's before the final battle.

281
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,280
It's a gathering place the battle is not

282
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,080
at Armageddon I mean obviously you know when

283
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
a battle starts it starts right, but it's

284
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,300
right.

285
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,220
It's it's the launching point for the battle

286
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,880
against Anyway Yeah these things that you know

287
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,560
there are articles like this in the 60s

288
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,260
Biblical conspiracy theorists Where's the conspiracy in the

289
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,580
Bible?

290
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,080
I mean this is really still who's the

291
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,180

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,300
product of the university system Yeah, they don't

296
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,320
even know how to write, and they're probably

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,480
interviewing idiots or you know right Yeah It's

298
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,660
not even worth reading yeah, I'm gonna look

299
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,660
at it, okay But no that that stuff

300
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,940
has been going on for a actually You

stupid predictions?

303
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,300
Mid 19th century there was forever the Millerites

304
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,920
the Millers You know he said you know

305
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,540
there would be you got everyone to sell

306
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,240
possessions and all that and took advantage of

307
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,640
prostitutes Right because you may get some free

308
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,660
a lot free tail He was a all

309
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,720
these people are horrible people that are public

310
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,580
figures.

311
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,180
I mean which Which one of these evangelists

312
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,520
is not a pedophile a satanist or whatever

313
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
which one is isn't now which one is

314
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,820
Right you get it right you know It

315
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,480
was oh this this is this guy came

316
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
out to be a pedophile and a satanist

317
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
this of a Christian evangelist Really which one

318
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,940
is not That's the one that should be

319
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,640
in the news not the one that is

320
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,600
because they're all they all are There's a

321
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,400
general rule this because they're they're part of

322
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,380
the system It's a state.

323
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,800
You know there's no form of evangelism that

324
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,940
will take place unless the state or the

325
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,380
legal society the Justice Society and the Owners

326
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,260
of the country put their seal of approval

327
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,920
on directly or indirectly acquiesce to it so

328
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,960
Yeah Make a long story short The Millerites

329
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,320
back.

330
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,060
I guess I'm the term was Miller.

331
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,860
He came up with the rupture.

332
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,580
I call it.

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,340
You know the rapture Okay, well at the

334
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,740
end wasn't it because the rapture has to

335
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,660
come first of the rupture.

336
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,020
There is no that words not even in

337
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,460
Scripture mm-hmm, so You're talking about you

338
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,000
know anyway There's not there's there's no relief

339
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
food clothing shelter.

340
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,260
Yeah, you're not gonna get any cognizant Food

341
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,620
out there anything that it's for the mind

342
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,300
Which by the way I was having a

343
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,880
conversation recently with someone who's censored about many

344
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,960
of the things that I say And I

345
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,340
was trying to explain them like all right

346
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,800
go do research this way You know like

347
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,060
even today the quote-unquote most advanced Scientists

348
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,380
cutting-edge and all that are looking for

349
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,640
the mind Right in the but they understand

350
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,280
the brain They Believe I mean they're constantly

351
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,100
researching it and evolving their you know mapping

352
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,360
out the biology and the chemistry and the

353
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,620
physicality And what it does allegedly But they

354
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,100
don't know where the mind is they don't

355
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
see the you know what animates you in

356
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
the brain They see certain motor function connections,

357
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,580
but you have motor function connections to everything

358
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,360
yeah, you know not just the limbs But

359
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
let's say if you damage the kidneys your

360
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,100
motor functions are damaged Right as a matter

361
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,060
of fact if you increase motor functions you

362
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,100
affect the kidneys from the adrenal gland right

363
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,160
mm-hmm, so anyway Yeah, they need to

364
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,420
listen to some girl they don't need to

365
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,079
cuz though you know, but anyway Yeah, there's

366
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,760
not much just not much going on This

367
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,500
is what's cool about it though is we

368
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,300
started another seven year period that the middle

369
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,640
of it.

370
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,660
Let's see will be Around 2020 2020 will

371
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,980
be about the middle of it, and you're

372
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,400
gonna see a resurgence Not necessarily as public

373
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,020
as it could be even though.

374
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,200
It will be like the idiot who wrote

375
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:33,580
that article about The biblical conspiracy theory I

376
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,180
mean what a poor choice of words like

377
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,200
someone says I'm suffering.

378
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,740
I was suffering what anyway There's gonna be

379
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,560
a resurgence in what I've spoken of they've

380
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,080
been speaking of for years and years people

381
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,560
are gonna go back to Basics enough.

382
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,580
I'm gonna say wait a second.

383
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
What is this supposed to be based on

384
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,660
and Obviously this is the time for the

385
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,760
gods, and it's going to be obviously discussion

386
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,940
on you know how come we're not even

387
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,380
Acknowledging the biblical text you know forget about

388
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,040
religion surrounded You know in the academia is

389
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,780
worthless academia is a prank You know you're

390
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,540
stupid enough to go beyond the eighth grade

391
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:07,720
now.

392
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,260
We got a really good prank for you.

393
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,060
You know And yeah, so there's gonna be

394
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,000
there's gonna be like a research this you

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
know the good thing about it You know

396
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,300
sometimes.

397
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,200
I'll go online do reference work and the

398
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,920
the AI or whatever you know the algorithms

399
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
be on YouTube We're trying to recommend things

400
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,040
they can't figure me out right.

401
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,940
I'm looking at stuff regarding audio You know

402
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,820
sometimes news items sometimes this Sometimes you know

403
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,560
electrical stuff or reference material They can't figure

404
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,400
me out and just to screw them up

405
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,720
sometimes.

406
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,800
I'll put in their Barbie doll molds.

407
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,540
You know or whatever and Pokemon I'll put

408
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,460
that just to screw them up sure you

409
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,180
know so because doesn't make any sense Oh,

410
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,360
maybe they'll think it's two people you know

411
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,200
using so anyway They send me stuff about

412
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,020
like some kind of secret space program or

413
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,740
whatever and most of it was kind I

414
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,560
looked into a little bit.

415
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,120
I was like all right secret space program

416
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,080
What was that these morons are talking about

417
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,040
they don't even know they can't tell the

418
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,700
difference between their ass and a paper bag

419
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,200
We're gonna talk about secret space programs, which

420
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,700
do exist by the way just like everything

421
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,020
is everything is a secret and space is

422
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,060
not what you think it is, but It's

423
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,580
a fluid, but a fluid medium like gas.

424
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,120
You know gas is a fluid man.

425
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,720
I'd say liquid.

426
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,880
I said fluid right Like think of the

427
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
ocean, but less dense.

428
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,020
I've been I said this for publicly a

429
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,860
long time ago I want to know what

430
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,020
outer space is like.

431
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
Do you know what do you know about

432
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,220
the ocean except?

433
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,040
It's not water Saline water, it's a gas

434
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,400
various gases and liquids there are liquids out

435
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,760
there by the way Yeah, and what do

436
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,380
you know about the the solar system?

437
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,980
You know they tell you there's nine planets

438
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
or eight planets or ten pilots or whatever

439
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,420
But do you know there's at least 20

440
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,780
dwarf planets that if you were aware of

441
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,860
that some of those planets would you know

442
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,060
be?

443
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,440
Pretty sizable.

444
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,140
I mean yeah people don't talk about this

445
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,080
about 30 or 40 planets out there Including

446
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,120
the major ones they're called planet toys or

447
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,260
dwarf planets, but they're sizable I mean they

448
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,380
approach the size of the moon if you

449
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,420
know half Half to half the size of

450
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
the moon, but you know it's sizable around

451
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,660
large enough Yeah, so yeah, of course.

452
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,480
There's a space program, but anyway look at

453
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,760
so just as predicted I don't focus on

454
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,780
these idiots, but they're they're at war with

455
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,220
each other I noticed Though some of these

456
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,060
videos were on YouTube were about them bad

457
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,300
-mouthing each other and fighting each other perfect

458
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,480
What a better way to get right rid

459
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,680
of a bunch of stupid people Than to

460
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
get them to just kill each other off,

461
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,960
and I'm not I don't mean that literally

462
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,020
They're going to be killing each other.

463
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,720
They will later, but right now.

464
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,680
They're just Destroying each other from internally you

465
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,740
know so a little catfish is a man

466
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
Yeah, a catfight between women or whatever yes,

467
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,500
I noticed so be aware of these Like

468
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,640
environmental groups, I'll be fighting each other.

469
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,560
You know these alternative media people.

470
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,440
I think they're already gone through several fights

471
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Right the political fight that you see going

472
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,920
on between Democratic and Republicans in America was

473
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,760
when the country was sold and you know

474
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,020
Bought went under privately and that's happened in

475
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,120
the 1800s, right?

476
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,780
So you just get them to fight amongst

477
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,160
themselves.

478
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,200
It's very efficient that way But look for

479
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,880
that because all this bullshit that people are

480
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,360
involved in not some of it all of

481
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,120
it is Got to go because they're going

482
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
to have to acknowledge a certain level of

483
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,440
lawfulness Before they're taken out as a society

484
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,700
you know like I've mentioned before the gods

485
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,420
will not execute judgment, or they will not

486
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,500
execute Let's say what they call apocalyptic mayhem

487
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,460
until people acknowledge why it's being done or

488
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,100
they from the Either the seat of their

489
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,220
pants or their their mouth or in writing

490
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,340
or thought they have to acknowledge that What

491
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,180
is lawful?

492
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,880
and whether they what it whether they Pose

493
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,460
it as a contrast to what they're doing

494
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,680
for repentance You know which is to reverse

495
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,380
what you're doing whatever is irrelevant he says

496
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,260
they just have to acknowledge it and then

497
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,280
the mop-up clues got the mop-up

498
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,620
crew has got the Yeah, do you have

499
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,420
a mop-up clue?

500
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,780
Yeah the mop-up crew?

501
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,000
has the green light Hmm and there's no

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,380
fix.

503
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,400
There's no one said Greek.

504
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,120
Would you stop them?

505
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,060
Hell no stop them up if I knew

506
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,920
the mop-up crew was coming later in

507
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,340
an hour.

508
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,060
I'd say hold on guys Come over.

509
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,680
I'm gonna make you some really good coffee

You know You see because there's no other

512
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,060
way to fix this you either want to

513
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,560
fix it or not It's like a dental

514
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,480
problem or whatever you do you want to

515
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,380
fix it or not right you're going to

516
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,600
have to quote-unquote suffer Yeah, if you

517
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,860
want to fix the the man's condition you're

518
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,740
gonna have to suffer the destruction Sorry Get

519
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,280
over it.

520
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,220
It's like it's like The pain that you

521
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,200
feel when you jump into a cool or

522
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,820
not and say cold, but cool pool of

523
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,580
water it is painful You know like the

524
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,780
first day at the beach.

525
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,680
Yeah, you know early summer first day at

526
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,060
the beach.

527
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,980
Yeah, yeah, it's pain Yeah, and then it's

528
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,200
okay, so So you learn either way real

529
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,590
quick yeah Someone mentioned the tablets of thought

530
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,730
worth discussing never heard of this net really

531
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,390
well The worth of it is you know

532
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,650
one man's Treasure is another man's junk right

533
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,030
yeah Go on the internet to me and

534
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,350
most of its junk except for reference material

535
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,390
Even current events you're gonna have to figure

536
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,050
out the rationale Behind it like California's burning.

537
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,190
I'm like well depends on who you ask.

538
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,730
It's a bad thing Yeah, you know there's

539
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,950
you know certain powers want it to burn

540
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,070
You know from a general perspective.

541
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,590
Well most of the planets going to be

542
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,490
burning Later anyway, but from the general perspective

543
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,170
the owners do want it to burn.

544
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,050
Why the fuck not?

545
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,630
The people on the ground are scratching their

546
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,450
head because they believe all the propaganda Through

547
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,330
some minimal correspondence with someone that recent fire

548
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,190
that burned really fast It was supposedly a

549
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,070
campfire, and then there it wasn't a camp

550
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,490
no one says there was no campfire.

551
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,370
You know who started It's like I've gotten

552
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,550
witnesses from Australia when they had those bad

553
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:32,950
fires.

554
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,790
It was started and people had witnessed it

555
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,930
being started You know what it took like

556
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,710
six hours for the fire crews to come

557
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,050
in there.

558
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,690
You know so it's just bullshit Let him

559
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,170
burn you know Tough, you know tough shit

560
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,630
isn't it so by the way if you're

561
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,630
if you're smart There are ways.

562
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,710
Let's say you live in in California or

563
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,450
near not in because you can't live in

564
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,930
California But what they call a forested area

565
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,590
that that's dry there are ways to quote

566
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,690
-unquote fireproof Your dwelling and you'll be like

567
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,190
the one that didn't burn down, right?

568
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,250
So I'm not going to get into they're

569
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,670
very simple ways, and it doesn't involve water,

570
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,470
and it doesn't involve clearing You know yeah,

571
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,030
but you're going to need you know even

572
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,290
a messy vineyard or a messy You know

573
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,430
any of this messy landscape area or place

574
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,890
where you have growth is easy to burn

575
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,130
So you don't want it to be messy

576
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,750
and you can clear a large area and

577
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,790
that won't really help either because the wind

578
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,210
can fly the ashes over and if Once

579
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,350
the fire starts to have something called convection.

580
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,730
You know like air convection and you can

581
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,530
have 50 mile an hour winds blowing Fist

582
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,310
-sized chunks of hot you know coals right

583
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,350
on your house, so how are you gonna?

584
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,850
How are you gonna fireproof that right?

585
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,710
but anyway You could there's things you can

586
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,610
do, but you know what I'm going to

587
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,430
say about that why bother Because here's the

588
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,590
thing the way the quote-unquote attorneys set

589
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,410
everything up for the owners You know what

590
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,090
they call the state the fake state, or

591
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,970
it is really the state You know the

592
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,970
way they set it up same way like

593
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,370
when you build a house without a building

594
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,350
permit they know you're doing it and they

595
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,130
They know you're fireproofing.

596
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,390
They know you're building a house up or

597
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,930
they wait Until you succeed and then they

598
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,410
come take it away from you because it's

599
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,690
worth more Yeah, you see it all the

600
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,370
time if someone's building a house without a

601
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,770
permit They'll wait for you to finish and

602
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,190
when you got the curtains up and the

603
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,630
you know Everything Yep, then they come and

604
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,110
take it because they can get more for

605
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,590
it than if they stop you in between

606
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,970
right yeah So when you prevent the house

607
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,510
from burning down the state will come and

608
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,510
take it away And say we're condemning it

609
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,470
anyway because it's unsafe to live in this

610
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,210
area That's the way the attorneys work.

611
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,550
You know yeah It's illegal it's demonic.

612
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,570
It's it's the typical and the people are

613
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,930
so Censored they can't see it.

614
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,230
That's why you can't fix it.

615
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,170
You can't help them Separate yourself, and then

616
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,970
just hope that they it gets cleaned up.

617
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,830
You know when you look at turds in

618
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,450
a toilet Do you hope they just turn

619
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,750
into sunflowers and strawberries and cinnamon sticks?

620
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,970
Is that what you do when you look

621
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,130
at turds in the toilet you say oh?

622
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,850
I when is this turd gonna turn into?

623
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,470
strawberry shortcake That's ridiculous.

624
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,430
It's never gonna happen you flush it When

625
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,850
you look at the current people in this

626
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,870
society that you can't fix them they have

627
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,010
to be flushed Sorry not my opinion not

628
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,510
my desire not my whatever.

629
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,110
I it's just the logical You know but

630
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,250
it is a rational desire by the way

631
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,030
It's not my desire, but anyone is rational

632
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,850
and knows the truth.

633
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,130
We'll see that as it is a level

634
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,250
way to do it Okay, do you hear

635
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,510
the music in the background should I turn

636
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,110
that down by the way just a smidge?

637
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,050
But you know actually I'd like it so

638
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:56,240
Okay Let's see as a concept here Okay

639
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,260
Yeah, that's Egyptian if I reckon the Egyptians

640
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,720
were Quite interesting, and if you want to

641
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,280
talk about the space programs and all that

642
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,700
if you anyone that studies Egyptology, you know

643
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,800
there's different types of Egypt also There is

644
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,700
the the original original which we have very

645
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,060
little about then there's the divided kingdom right

646
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,360
mm-hmm Then you have the old dynasty

647
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
which united them Right and then you have

648
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,180
the newer dynasties which incorporated the Greeks and

649
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,060
Whatever, but if you if you look at

650
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,760
across the board, you know later on you

651
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,840
know they became very secular Let's say, but

652
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,280
they're very cosmic in other words.

653
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,820
They're really looking into the the neaters you

654
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,940
know the gods and Space out there and

655
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,740
inner space also you know meaning the the

656
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,880
the levels of science that they got into

657
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,900
was The Symbology is is not about just

658
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,560
symbology.

659
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,140
It's about representing things that are intangible You

660
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,240
know something is intangible you have a symbol

661
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,460
for it and their accuracy was was astounding

662
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,020
to Their what their their accuracy on their

663
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,580
star stars and things and geometry yeah Sure

664
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,220
sure sure most cold, but I would say

665
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,120
the best were the Sumerians and Also the

666
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,680
known to be in other words Well there's

667
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,500
it's hard to be in if you're doing

668
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,020
star work or astronomical work It's hard to

669
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,940
be inaccurate Because you do use it's like

670
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,100
if you're looking at a clock.

671
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,320
Well.

672
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,740
You know the mechanical clock.

673
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,300
What time is it 557?

674
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,480
Well is it 557 or is it 556?

675
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,240
Oh, sorry.

676
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,920
It's 556 right, but there's not Why you

677
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,620
read in other words the accuracy comes from

678
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,740
are you reading it or not?

679
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,140
There's not there's not much Yeah, anyone who

680
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,300
studies Anything that is a highly refined.

681
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
You know reference system will always be accurate

682
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,140
but the ones that I Bring up on

683
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,740
the Sumerians is because perhaps we have more

684
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,720
records overt records of what was up there

685
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,860
From them rain and the methodologies they try

686
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,380
to pen certain Movements that were repeat repeatable

687
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,180
repeatable and rep repetitive and They also had

688
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,960
a higher thinking they use a lot of

689
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,260
math, but not solely math right so Yeah,

690
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,640
right now.

691
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,680
They just got a bunch of asshole mathematicians.

692
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,820
It doesn't matter if it's medical Philosophical philosophical

693
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,980
Scientific physics, whatever they're all just math.

694
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,980
You know based on math and mathematics You

695
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,040
know that's why they tell you about photons

696
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,520
or some of the photon.

697
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,160
You know how you spell photon fa ux

698
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,480
to n, right?

699
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,520
All right, there's not much going on I

700
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,860
see there's I've got a bunch of emails

701
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,300
believe it or not again stuff that I've

702
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,860
gone over Mm-hmm and a couple of

703
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,580
them are like if you don't feel like

704
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,120
discussed You don't think it should be discussed

705
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,040
and don't discuss it.

706
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm not You know Again, I've gone over

707
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,800
most of the stuff You know one question

708
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,580
here is like birds and trees and scripture.

709
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Well, what about it?

710
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,880
You know when you're communicating it Here's the

711
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,120
thing I've always said scripture says what it

712
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,240
means and means what it says But you

713
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,780
have to take it in context because there

714
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,260
are metaphors there So when you give a

715
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,720
metaphor or an analogy and it's taken as

716
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,900
such and illustrated as such does the analogy

717
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,740
mean what it's saying?

718
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
Say what it mean?

719
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,940
Yes You know and you know if it's

720
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,420
figurative literal and I mean an analogy and

721
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,040
a metaphor is literal because it's it's Presented

722
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,160
as such to be taken So the thing

723
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,140
is are you getting the communication or not?

724
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,720
And the answer to that is no most

725
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,360
people can't really Get the communication that's held

726
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,340
in the scripture and it's fine It's better

727
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,860
to be familiar with it though Then not

728
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,440
be familiar with it familiar means, you know,

729
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,260
you've read it once or you know It's

730
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,900
like when you download a program on the

731
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,660
internet, you know, you haven't used it yet.

732
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
But are you familiar with it?

733
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Yeah, I downloaded it because I need it

734
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,960
for let's say Video editing or whatever you

735
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,740
graphics or number credit.

736
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,020
Yeah, I know I'm familiar with that, but

737
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,320
I know I have not used it I'm

738
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,680
not aware of what you know the ins

739
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,820
and outs of it Right.

740
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,220
Mm-hmm.

741
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,380
So it's better at least, you know, say

742
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,760
you've downloaded it to a certain degree So

743
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,680
And generally again most the messages I get

744
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,900
are just you know, I'm not gonna say

745
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,340
stupid but they are I'm not gonna brand

746
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,300
them as stupid to disencourage anyone from sending

747
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,280
emails But if you think you're writing something,

748
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,100
that's not Whatever don't write it.

749
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,280
Just don't bother sending it.

750
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,420
I'm not, you know, trying to discourage anyone

751
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,820
but again, it's just typical human stuff, you

752
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,900
know, I Mean if I if I get

753
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,160
emails and messages, it's usually gonna be from

754
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
humans from planet Earth, right?

755
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,580
Right, so you expect don't expect much And

756
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,980
I don't want anything from Alpha fucking Centauri

757
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,440
either So, you know, I'm not saying that,

758
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,700
you know, I Don't know I don't see

759
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,560
much every Yeah, not much going on.

760
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,460
There's always something going on if you if

761
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,400
you've got mobility In very and you take

762
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,780
that term how you like it, you know

763
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,740
There means getting up off your chair walking

764
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,480
across the room or wherewithal, you know access

765
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,660
to things use it And just to pass

766
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,400
the time, you know that a certain degree

767
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,120
you want time to pass by fast Personally,

768
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,740
I'll tell you like the past 10 years

769
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,400
passed like a few months for me.

770
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,300
Yeah, I'm glad for it I hope the

771
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,140
next 10 years passes like a few days

772
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,000
and I'm out of here This is not

773
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,220
it.

774
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,000
It's kind of like when you're in the

775
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,320
waiting room Do you want it to go

776
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,600
by real slow or do you want the

777
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,140
waiting room to go by fast?

778
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,500
You say great, right?

779
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:14,719
This is a waiting room So Yeah, and

780
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm and yeah, it's not entertaining it so

781
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,020
so you're gonna have to find ways in

782
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,120
general The the waiting room is very cruel

783
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,900
and and whatever you could figure it out

784
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,800
So you and it's not entertaining and the

785
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,880
magazines on the coffee table aren't cutting it.

786
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,560
So you're gonna have to Entertain you have

787
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,840
to create forms of entertainment for yourself.

788
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,980
Mm-hmm Whether you're stupid enough to think

789
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,300
that what academia or the religious leaders or

790
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,100
whatever is going on out there is enough

791
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,780
to Take your attention and be entertained then

792
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,060
fine Go for it but if you're wise

793
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,960
enough to see that it's it's really low

794
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,420
-level crap, then you're gonna have to invent

795
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,440
your own entertainment and Invent meaning, you know

796
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,820
Put it together in the way that suits

797
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,280
a certain task You know, how much to

798
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,660
entertainment are you looking for?

799
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,020
Great, right?

800
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,560
Back, but basically I found out the the

801
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,620
more suitable the entertainment for the individual the

802
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,000
faster time goes by it does That's a

803
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,480
good thing.

804
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,080
Yeah.

805
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,040
Yeah Whether it's what quote-unquote a job

806
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,560
or a job that you like or whether

807
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,660
it's you know Whatever you do during the

808
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,920
day or waking hours and sleeping hours, by

809
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,080
the way It is possible to have a

810
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,660
night go by like it took a long

811
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,120
time You want your nights to go by

812
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,720
quick also, which is you know, comfortable sleep

813
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,440
and good sleeping manners, right?

814
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,500
Right, don't eat before you go to sleep,

815
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:37,720
right?

816
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,340
Don't eat chocolate Don't drink too much.

817
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,240
It's gonna knock you out like a sedative,

818
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,640
but you'll pick up the brunt of that

819
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,160
in the morning So it depends if you

820
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,040
know how to if you're masterful You know,

821
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,720
you know in what you do, you'll you'll

822
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
reap, you know some reward out of it

823
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
or some pleasure But I was telling someone

824
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,380
today if you want to be successful in

825
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,460
this society you have to master mediocrity By

826
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,900
the way, all these things that people that

827
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,700
look at as being successful organizations corporations or

828
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,520
individuals It's because they've mastered mediocrity like take

829
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,420
the for example the rich people, you know

830
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,660
You that are put in front of you

831
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,180
which are not rich at all But for

832
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,740
slaves they are like the Bezos guy who

833
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,880
does Amazon, you know is richest guy, whatever

834
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,620
and for you know, it's bullshit but Okay,

835
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,460
this this idiot He's so great because he

836
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,320
started Amazon.

837
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
That's like Mediocrity man.

838
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,400
I mean he mastered mediocrity people want crap.

839
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,580
That's a bit That's a that's known to

840
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,780
them through the marketplace and he organizes it

841
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,080
So you get it all in one place

842
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,920
and offers other tangible services along with it

843
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,640
I mean how freaking mediocre is that you

844
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,740
want to talk about mastering mediocrity?

845
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,700
Look at Microsoft?

846
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,760
Yeah, it's a mediocre crap and they mastered

847
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,140
it and they're huge Apple talk about mediocrity,

848
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:05,340

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,820
He was You know Right.

854
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,040
That's what Apple use is using by the

855
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,160
way.

856
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,460
Don't think Apple is so cool with their

857
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,760
designs They're just a bunch of freaking morons

858
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,060
You think some Lebanese guy?

859
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,240
Immigrant son or whatever came over here and

00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,180
just garbage That they've recycled for you to

863
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,340
absorb and you like it.

864
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,560

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,860
means they make it available to you the

884
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,720
moron and And they give you access to

885
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,300
it in a way that if you if

886
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,900
you didn't have wherewithal They also the other

industry or anything that people aspire to and

890
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,420
you'll see that the only reason they've aspired

891
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,920

Look at that shit.

926
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,660

930
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,160
and they'll praise you The why because if

931
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,200
you do anything, that's authentic and let's say

932
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,300
evolved, you know Completely opening the the field

933
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,240
and what's possibilities.

934
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,800
They're not gonna understand it Since it's not

935
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,520
gonna go anywhere so Master mediocrity and you'll

936
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,480
do well look at people in their job

937
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,460
positions Stick to your job description and you'll

938
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,340
be successful.

939
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,500
Don't try to innovate and whatever rate, right?

940
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,240
You'll be successful, right?

941
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,280
And then those that say they left because

942
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,360
they couldn't Eve would do whatever they just

943
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,320
adopted another they just met see at the

944
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,920
point when they left whatever they were doing

945
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,560
to do something That they got praised for

946
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,300
is because they just we're still mediocre.

947
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,180
They just weren't masters of the mediocrity, right?

948
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,540
So that open so there you go to

949
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,300
something new, you know, yeah, that's something new

950
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,400
it's just as mediocre as before But now

951
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,440
they've mastered the mediocrity, right?

952
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,240
Yeah, that's that's your industry human industry human

953
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,840
religion human society is mastership of mediocrity Just

954
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,720
junk, I mean I look at stuff, you

955
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,020
know, they they do promote, you know on

956
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,380
the internet and other places, you know The

957
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,060
new thing I'm like, that's garbage It's embarrassing

958
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,560
to say that this is where you are

959
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,960
right now state-of-the-art anything Embarrassing

960
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,860
but deep down they know why bother So,

961
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:18,000
mm-hmm, come on mop-up crew A

962
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,620
Good one for a t-shirt Yeah, they're

963
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,560
good The thing is that people will get

964
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,080
used to but the thing is they're not

965
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,620
at the state right now where the green

966
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,380
light can be given obviously and And we

967
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,560
were given an outline of how the things

968
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,360
will transpire.

969
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,960
In other words.

970
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,780
These are the events.

971
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,480
They're going to allow the green light You

972
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,300
know not specifically but yeah, you're gonna have

973
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,580
you're all going to be organized together You

974
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,440
know under a certain system and that system

975
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,940
will put will portray like a transparent outline

976
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,160
of what's lawful So, you know, you're aware

977
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,560
of it.

978
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,800
It'll be used improperly and Because of its

979
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,100
improper use Will cause destruction and to trump

980
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,200
that destruction and end the whole cycle the

981
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,260
mop-up crew comes because you've already acknowledged

982
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,500
the lawful Concept you see because you know

983
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,280
the the the not the new world order

984
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,040
But the one world order was going to

985
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,680
be a revival of ancient ways all the

986
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,440
way down to you know What people do

987
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,620
in there, you know every day?

988
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,940
All right, right or Bible of all that,

989
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,280
you know, not just the powers that that

990
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:37,230
means of the behind institutions So 13 years

991
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,490
left, you know give give or take I

992
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,870
mean a little bit but here's the thing

993
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,470
Let me just say, you know, if some

994
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,550
people say we've got 13 years.

995
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,850
I've gotten some messages back yeah, but what

996
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:51,950
people don't remember is the the the contours

997
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,950
and the contrasts That will be in those

998
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,790
13 years Let me just rephrase this when

999
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,330
I say 13 13 and a half years

1000
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,890
now, it's about 13 or so Or, you

1001
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,830
know, you can even say 12 and a

1002
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,890
half, but but I would say around 13

1003
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,830
still, you know, roughly but pretty close The

1004
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,250
contours and contrasts are such you If you're

1005
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,570
really thinking and you've got just one and

1006
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,690
a half But let's say two pencils in

1007
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,110
your pocket and one of them needs sharpening.

1008
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,470
You should have noticed by now That you've

1009
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,050
got less than seven years of the pleasantries

1010
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:32,010
that you considered as things being pleasant Right,

1011
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,450
you get it because the last seven-year

1012
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:38,590
put your peers gonna be extremely unpleasant at

1013
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:42,070
progressively You know, let's say today started the

1014
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,230
the beginning of the last seven-year period

1015
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,670
it may not be so unpleasant today But

1016
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,990
tomorrow is going to be a little less

1017
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,870
pleasant than today in the day after and

1018
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,270
then it's just gonna Eventually be pretty obvious

1019
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:56,310
to those that know So if you got

1020
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,110
one and a half sharpened pencils in your

1021
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,350
pocket, you know you've got less than seven

1022
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:08,190
years of Reasonable modicum of what you might

1023
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:14,490
consider to be pleasant Does that help yeah,

1024
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,710
I think I've stated the obvious there so

1025
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,150
much yeah When I say 13 years people

1026
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,230
think oh, yeah, I just mark off 13

1027
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,770
scratches on the bathroom wall.

1028
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,810
No Because the last three and a half

1029
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,570
year is going to be absolute nightmare on

1030
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,610
earth Proceeded by another three and a half

1031
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,570
years of just Rat the worst shit you

1032
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,610
can imagine not new but and in and

1033
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,330
done in old stuff done in a new

1034
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,750
way Like imagine Use as a metaphor, you

1035
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,830
know, they put in what kind of ancient

1036
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,330
military stuff They put in front of the

1037
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:48,970
Roman Army.

1038
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,170
Everyone's familiar with that With the breastplates and

1039
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,630
the skirt, you know the way they dress

1040
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,070
and all that.

1041
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:54,330
Okay.

1042
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,970
Well imagine that technologically advanced They'd still have

1043
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,650
the you know, the eagle they'd still wear,

1044
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,350
you know Maybe some kind of head helmet

1045
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,390
the headdress, but it won't be made of

1046
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:06,730
feathers.

1047
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,310
You know, it'll be it won't be bronze

1048
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,690
It'll be carbon fiber You get it.

1049
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,830
Mm-hmm So new and improved but all

1050
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:29,930
right Yeah DK

1051
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,910
justice was worshiped area show.

1052
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,330
Yeah, and by the way, you know Biblical

1053
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,230
studies a good thing, but I think the

1054
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,390
way I think I'll take credit for many

1055
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,810
people out there many 10 20, maybe a

1056
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,610
hundred or so Revisiting scripture because they listen

1057
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,350
to Greek speak.

1058
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,730
So you got to give some time, but

1059
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,950
there's still no Inquisitive enough inquisitiveness in scripture

1060
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,070
to start discussing things More because people I

1061
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,890
think if they already get it Even if

1062
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,970
you you have no intention to read scripture

1063
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,870
and never read it If you listen to

1064
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,990
enough Greek speak you can confront any biblical

1065
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,550
academic and blow them away You know, of

1066
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,390
course, you won't be able to do the

1067
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,090
two whole beef patty special sauce sesame seed

1068
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,070
bun thing Like they do they'd like to

1069
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,970
throw verses but you'll get the idea and

1070
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,170
Actually, you got the idea you got it

1071
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,070
But there's a lot to talk about, you

1072
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,050
know, like what's why the New Testament?

1073
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:29,910
What is that?

1074
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,830
You know who who really is show?

1075
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,770
You know or Apostle Paul who really is

1076
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,530
he you know, and it's there it's all

1077
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,090
there You know what what's going on?

1078
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:49,070
you know, so Yeah The reason why and

1079
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,830
I haven't stressed this enough and I haven't

1080
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,510
brought it up enough the first century, especially

1081
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,290
the the first Third I would say that

1082
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,730
between 20 ad what you call 20 ad

1083
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:05,810
and 60 ad is an important period Because

1084
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,770
there was certain things that were happening on

1085
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,470
the earth and at that time if you

1086
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,650
try to research that by the way on

1087
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,210
The Internet what you're going to get is

1088
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,270
strictly religious Christian garbage, right?

1089
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,390
There's no give on for early first century

1090
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,610
Information they have to attach it to that

1091
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,310
Christian Christian rubbish But if you understand let's

1092
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,870
say even the century prior to that But

1093
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,990
there was a peak of things happening between

1094
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,690
the spiritually between the 20 ad and 60

1095
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,770
ad Which you could say unleashed a level

1096
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,270
of?

1097
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,690
demonic Presence on the earth that was unprecedented

1098
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,210
Malevolent The same is going to have started

1099
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,210
already, by the way It started 20 some

1100
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,550
odd years ago, you know the end of

1101
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,790
what you call 1998.

1102
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,010
I haven't really gone into much.

1103
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,570
I Had a discussion recently, you know numbers

1104
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,430
are important in Scripture with someone and you

1105
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,230
know, why two thousand years of nothing?

1106
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,650
Well because you don't know the feast days.

1107
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,190
You don't know the ordinance You don't know

1108
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,510
the laws of the Creator then you'll see

1109
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,390
why everything is so neat and tidy Is

1110
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,150
how I started and I went over them

1111
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,570
why?

1112
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,890
2,000 years of nothing happening but that

1113
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,730
nothing if you were to consider the beginning

1114
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,750
and end of that 2,000 years the

1115
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,210
beginning being like 20 ad to 60 ad

1116
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,570
and Then from let's say the end of

1117
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:34,270
the 90s or beginning 2000 till now Though

1118
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,030
the two time periods you have an unprecedented

1119
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:40,390
amount of demonic like influx like imagine a

1120
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,670
Gate or a door where they start coming

1121
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,550
into this Reality in form of in for

1122
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:50,250
in form of attention You see because they're

1123
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,890
non-material so whether if they're what they

1124
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,730
say a million light-years away or right

1125
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,390
in your room It doesn't matter because they're

1126
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,710
immaterial right they they connect it differently What

1127
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,850
I mean is focusing on on this society,

1128
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:05,610
right?

1129
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:11,130
so, you know agenda a Influence and focus

1130
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,890
they're poised, you know, would you rather be

1131
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,910
watched by no demons or a million demons

1132
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,590
watching you?

1133
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,170
I think you should get a little nervous

1134
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,290
if a million demons are watching you and

1135
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,350
you could probably sleep better if no demons

1136
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,070
are Watching you you see but you don't

1137
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:23,850
know either way.

1138
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,290
You can't perceive it Unless you're you know

1139
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,950
Coupled in or you know to it so,

1140
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:37,810
mm-hmm But the 2,000 years is

1141
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,890
very simple at basically just a short of

1142
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,270
an hour and a half conversation a General

1143
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,550
generation because a generation could be 70 years,

1144
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:45,810
right?

1145
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:46,510
Right.

1146
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,550
Some even say generation could be over a

1147
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,670
hundred years, but Especially if you're speaking on

1148
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,910
an Adamic level That would it be more

1149
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,010
of a hundred because Adam in the year

1150
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:01,870
hundred and all that but General generations are

1151
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:02,690
40 years.

1152
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,350
When does a when does a cycle if

1153
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,570
you know the law a General cycle where

1154
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,470
things are reset the general social reset The

1155
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,890
term is known as a Jubilee.

1156
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,910
So at the end of the 49th year

1157
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,130
is the 50th year Which is when the

1158
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,950
Jubilee starts, right, right?

1159
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,350
The 50th year, you know the day after

1160
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,170
the 49th year you're into your 50th year

1161
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,170
So that is a quote-unquote Jubilee year,

1162
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,110
right?

1163
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,090
So what's 40 times 50?

1164
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,890
mm-hmm Yeah There you go 2,000

1165
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:49,910
years again So you see and why were

1166
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,030
the you know, there were 40 years there

1167
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,950
in the desert in the wilderness, right?

1168
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,630
When you're in the wilderness What's going when

1169
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,150
you say well, you know, I was camping

1170
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,530
I was in the wilderness or I was

1171
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,670
homeless is nothing It's the same synonymous really,

1172
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,410
right?

1173
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:10,270
Wandering of indigent Well, all those terms are

1174
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:10,810
synonymous.

1175
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,730
So if you said the Israelites were indigent

1176
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,910
for 40 years That's pretty synonymous with being

1177
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,410
in the wilderness, isn't it?

1178
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,450
Yeah Right.

1179
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,270
So 40 years now When you look at

1180
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,470
that last 40 years because it was the

1181
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,930
first 40 years that they were injured and

1182
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,410
also the last if you Only have one

1183
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,590
episode of a given amount Quantity if you

1184
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,030
can call it the first and the last

1185
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,490
and one right, you know it's only gonna

1186
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,730
happen one time if I say Bruce I'm

1187
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,150
gonna hit you on the on the Big

1188
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,550
toe with a 20 pound a 20 ounce

1189
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,510
lump hammer only once.

1190
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,310
Well, that's the first time I've ever done

1191
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,670
it It's also the last time I've ever

1192
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,850
done it, right, right Right, so what do

1193
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,490
you know about the 40 year in terms

1194
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,110
of social change?

1195
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,390
Not not just you know, when you read

1196
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,090
the book of Numbers, I mean Which is

1197
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,430
pretty good gives you direction They these idiots

1198
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,370
are still doing documentaries and we don't know

1199
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:10,210
where the Israelites were they talking about You

1200
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,790
know Mm-hmm.

1201
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,550
There's a corresponding each each time.

1202
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,710
They were They settled in 42 different places,

1203
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,770
that's why there are 42 generations in the

1204
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,330
book of Matthew.

1205
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,110
Mm-hmm You know, anyway, I wouldn't say

1206
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,370
that's why it doesn't say that's why but

1207
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,310
it's an interesting coincidence, right?

1208
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:30,710
So if you if you look at the

1209
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,190
happenings Generationally because the generations are types of

1210
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,650
people generations are mentioned.

1211
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:37,830
Mm-hmm.

1212
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:42,610
Well, you have to understand the application of

1213
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:48,630
geography To be a marker, you know, we

1214
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,830
watch Israel Jerusalem for certain things as a

1215
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,130
clock, right?

1216
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:54,610
All right.

1217
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,970
So what changed what changed in in let's

1218
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,010
say What what that generation that first and

1219
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,490
last generation that was in the wilderness?

1220
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,270
As they are as humans because they're going

1221
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,890
to be back in the wilderness, by the

1222
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,090
way, I don't know.

1223
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,410
That's another discussion You know, they're gonna be

1224
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,070
sent back.

1225
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:15,810
Yeah.

1226
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,550
Yeah after the return 40 years maybe not

1227
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,550
As it was the first time but yeah

1228
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,490
sequestered for teaching, you know, those are those

1229
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,330
those are the ones that are not resurrected

1230
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,590
But anyway just to cut to the point

1231
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,210
because I feel like I'm I'm not even

1232
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:36,970
getting to the point The they were not

1233
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,790
able to go into the land which is

1234
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,450
symbolic Also go when you're going into the

1235
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,170
land It's like you're achieving you're achieving a

1236
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,850
certain precedent or you're achieving something, right?

1237
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,090
Right, you know like even Martin Luther King,

1238
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,570
you know was saying a promised land.

1239
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,010
Well, what promised when you're ready here dummy

1240
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,450
The thing was was civil, you know to

1241
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,330
have rights to do things right in other

1242
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,070
words a certain freedom or whatever So until

1243
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,430
certain freedoms are granted which would be called

1244
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,110
privileges or whatever Which would be going into

1245
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,810
the land and settling and no longer being

1246
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,990
indigent what what had to take place?

1247
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:14,350
Well, the the fighting men all had to

1248
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,040
die Right in the book of Numbers.

1249
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,220
Remember there was no one left of the

1250
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,640
fighting men, right?

1251
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,040
You know, well who were the fighting men?

1252
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,000
Well, there were six hundred thousand of them.

1253
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,220
How do we know?

1254
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,680
Well, it says it says so there's six

1255
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,820
hundred thousand fighting men that have left of

1256
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,300
fighting age or fighting types that left Egypt

1257
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,260
Not six hundred thousand people but fighting okay,

1258
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,600
so those six hundred thousand had to perish

1259
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,980
before the only there was only a Small

1260
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,040
exception of who didn't which was Joshua and

1261
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,680
Caleb, right?

1262
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:48,680
Right.

1263
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,140
They saw the land right?

1264
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,760
They were actually ruling so if so Okay,

1265
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,960
so in modern parlance and in modern convention

1266
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,460
and in modern knowledge and what we know

1267
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,280
What do we know about fighting people?

1268
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,800
fighting men regarding modern wars regarding Israel right,

1269
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,080
so we have the ones that were in

1270
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,880
1947 48 49 and Then we have the

1271
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,020
ones and the several day wars and the

1272
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,220
wars in Jerusalem, right, right?

1273
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,200
So just to cut to the point When

1274
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,060
you read about like the six-day war

1275
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,540
or whatever it was five days six days

1276
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,240
seven day war What you know of several

1277
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
countries attacked?

1278
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,380
Jerusalem in Israel and was it 67 or

1279
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,560
something 68.

1280
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:36,940
Yeah.

1281
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,880
Okay, the people who fought in that war

1282
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,420
Need to die before the next level goes

1283
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,500
Before we get to the next level on

1284
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,800
a spiritual plane, it doesn't mean that there's

1285
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,340
gonna be other actions You know that you

1286
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,240
know, like people desiring the temple to be

1287
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,860
built the Israelis bombing the shit out of

1288
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,920
Gaza Strip and you know The newest Syria

1289
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,320
the Assyrians running around because you know, the

1290
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,400
Assyrians are not known as Assyrians, by the

1291
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,630
way They're known as Mideastern Christians, right?

1292
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,480
You know, they're the they're the predominant group,

1293
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,700
you know, there's this quote-unquote people stupid

1294
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,220
enough to follow that in every country there's

1295
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,020
quote-unquote Christians in everywhere except Saudi Arabia,

1296
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,500
I mean even there there are but however,

1297
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,590
they are but make a point here is

1298
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,830
The Group known as the fighting men of

1299
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,210
that war in 60 in the late 60s

1300
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,410
for Jerusalem when you start reading or understand

1301
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,450
eventually in the near future, there'll be some

1302
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:42,150
articles about All of these people that fought

1303
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,270
in the Jerusalem war in the 60s Whatever

1304
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,410
are dying and we have none left or

1305
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,230
there's one or two veterans like a Joshua

1306
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,490
type, right?

1307
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,150
Because remember that Joshua and Caleb, but they

1308
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,090
did they did they were the exempt from

1309
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,430
that statement.

1310
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,610
Mm-hmm you see so there are going

1311
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,710
to be some exceptions and exemptions made but

1312
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,530
in the near future one thing to look

1313
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,550
for in what's called the media is That

1314
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,990
all the veterans of this Jerusalem war thing

1315
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,810
that happened in the 60s are dying and

1316
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:14,910
they're almost all gone.

1317
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,250
I Know Yeah, I think I've discussed this

1318
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,390
before but I'm just saying it again because

1319
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,970
as we get closer I think it's more

1320
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:32,210
important to give more specifics So Old age

1321
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,070
would be taking its toll pretty pretty close

1322
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:36,210
now, right?

1323
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,150
Cuz that was over 50 years ago and

1324
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,790
let's say there were 20 and even then

1325
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,370
they recruited people that were as young as

1326
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,830
14 and 15 right Right, so they would

1327
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,790
be in their late in the majority of

1328
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,430
them are in the 70s and 80s that

1329
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,530
are notable right now Majority of them.

1330
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:52,890
Mm-hmm.

1331
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:53,910
They're probably some in there.

1332
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,890
I'd say it's very rare to find any

1333
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,090
less than 70 Years old because but then

1334
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,510
again there was something that were in the

1335
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,410
teens early teens I mean many times have

1336
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,570
you heard years ago people lied about their

1337
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,030
age to get into the military and they

1338
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:10,610
were let in Yeah But in many cases,

1339
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,810
you know wouldn't be if you necessity is

1340
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,910
necessity, you know If you if a 12

1341
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,410
year old looks like he's 16, you know,

1342
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,030
bring him in, you know so Yeah, watch

1343
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:22,590
out for that.

1344
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,970
You're gonna in the near future look for

1345
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,170
Stuff in the media regarding veterans of those

1346
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:34,930
late late 60s wars in Israel Being rarefied

1347
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:39,690
their numbers being rarefied That's an important piece,

1348
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,870
but not minor, but it's a gateway principle

1349
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,090
to understand those when you see that You

1350
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,810
know in the forefront as being talked about,

1351
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,730
you know, the time is really, you know

1352
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,770
being Communicated spiritually to society like hey, you

1353
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,390
need to do some study to see how

1354
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,450
everything is repeating, right?

1355
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,690
So watch that's something to something to watch

1356
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,350
for there mean there's lots of things to

1357
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,730
watch for of course, you know Many people

1358
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:11,410
know me as the guy who says watch

1359
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,190
for the new Assyria there's going to be

1360
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,570
You know the revived Assyria, yeah, and you

1361
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,390
know, and I'll just say this and we'll

1362
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:24,110
end the sonic, okay Not only is the

1363
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:28,870
new Assyria Geographic, right, you know, I gave

1364
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,550
a lot of details through the years about

1365
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,610
that, you know, it's northern Iraq Actually, you

1366
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,450
know, right.

1367
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,050
It's going to take land from Turkey and

1368
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,590
Syria and all these other things, right?

1369
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:36,810
Yeah.

1370
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:37,770
Yep Yeah, the idea.

1371
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,810
Yeah, anyone can research that maps and all

1372
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,610
the details that I've given in the past

1373
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,810
What people also need to understand is the

1374
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,710
mindset of the Assyrians will take place in

1375
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,510
the Middle East which is the mindset of

1376
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:50,790
what?

1377
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,770
conquest brutality Right pride.

1378
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,890
The Assyrians are very proud And you know

1379
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,290
how many times you read in like book

1380
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,530
of Isaiah Syrian King goes your gods mean

1381
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,370
nothing to me All right.

1382
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,130
All right.

1383
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,570
So who's ever which one of?

1384
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,490
So which society have we attacked whose gods

1385
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:11,110
have helped them?

1386
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,850
Right stuff like that you see about these

1387
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,550
things so look for that.

1388
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,470
That's what so that's part of You know,

1389
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,630
not only the formation of a new Assyria,

1390
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,110
but a revival of that mindset that is

1391
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:30,430
quote-unquote an Assyrian mindset Right, right Okay,

1392
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,990
so with that said thanks Bruce.

1393
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:32,750
