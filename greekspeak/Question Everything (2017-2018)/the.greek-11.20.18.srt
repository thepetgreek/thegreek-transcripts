It was around the first month.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,050
So Yeah, which was around springtime.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,490
So I don't know what's going on.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,430
Anybody got anything to just went into the

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,530
chat I think I was in the chat

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,230
yesterday and very early this morning.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,930
Yeah, I see You're up with I don't

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,270
know I Guess everyone's pretty much mastered everything

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,950
and they're become apathetic Either that or they're

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,810
not a very talkative bunch This is a

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,170
pretty this chat is the one new Greeks

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,030
be the new Greek speak chat tango one.

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,090
It's kind of like Inert almost, you know,

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,269
but it's alright, you know when I talk

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,010
about the chat being worthless It's not the

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,010
people in the chat.

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,650
It's just the chat itself This is where

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,130
the because I don't know who's on or

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,950
not, you know, really he was watching it

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,870
I know there's roughly 70 people that asked

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,010
for it when we flip to this one.

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,790
Mm-hmm But yeah, there's not much going

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,730
on which isn't a good thing because I'm

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,130
not if the chat was active in questions

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,550
and people were fastidious or at least doing

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,350
work Then I would have to be more

33
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,130
involved and take up my time for nothing

34
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,050
So at least I know if I go

35
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,970
to the chat, there's tumbleweeds and a you

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,470

46
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:07,710
It just it.

47
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,130

51
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,030
Yeah.

52
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,610
Yeah, you know even have a derivative like

cocaine or heroin is still lawful I'll tell

54
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,970
you a lot of the medicines that they

55
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,490
use the standard legal ones are not lawful

56
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,690
Because they have monkey pro testicle proteins and

57
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,610
pork and insects in them, you know All

58
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,590
the joy Yeah, the straight-up satanic, you

59
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,510
know mainstream, but you know, they're they're accommodating

60
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,570
the people you could go So anywhere out

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,150
your door it has to be part of

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,730
that, you know accommodating.

63
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,710
Yeah, they know what they're doing.

64
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,870
Yeah That's why I'm totally against whenever I

65
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,790
hear about protesters and this it's like I

66
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,830
just want to go and throw Like condoms

67
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,870
filled with sour milk at them Because you're

68
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,130
stupid the reason why things are the way

69
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,230
they are no matter how horrific it gets

70
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,590
it's because it's accommodating The typical surface-dwelling

71
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,090
inhabitant scumbag, whatever you want to call them

72
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,270
taboo human, by the way, not only you

73
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,650
know I might seem misanthropic which is actually

74
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,610
duly So it's appropriate but if you were

75
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,290
to go off-world by the way in

76
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,770
the spiritual realm or whatever Humans are like

77
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,090
the scum of the universe, right?

78
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,930
All right, so You know, this is we're

79
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,490
talking about triple-t rating truth truth and

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,590
truth We're not here to make friends that

81
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,890
you're not, you know, you're not going to

82
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,390
get better.

83
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,970
The earth doesn't need saving Yeah, you're gonna

84
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,650
get worse and he's just gonna get wiped

85
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,050
And and you know, there's going to be

86
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,690
a small remnant and it starts not all

87
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,010
over again But it definitely starts over on

88
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,350
a new foot let's say and literally on

89
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,130
a new foot you will you won't yeah

90
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,010
It won't be the same.

91
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,350
So, um Yeah, there's nothing wrong with the

92
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,530
truth Unless people have been so groomed that

93
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,510
they need to hear things the way they're

94
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,990
used to and then they don't like anything

95
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,510
else Like with Ocelli, you know, it's like

96
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,070
I agree with you on this or I

97
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,370
don't agree with you that so to see

98
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,910
Because you agree with me.

99
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,850
It's true, right?

100
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,070
You see the consensus.

101
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,470
I don't mean to pick on Chuck He's

102
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,790
a fairly decent guy, but he's a good

103
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,930
representation of you know What you hear out

104
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,610
there you hear all these people or I

105
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,710
call morons and they're like, oh, yeah, I

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,190

107
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,390
too.

108
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,830
And the poor sap that's listening to these

109
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,430
idiots is like, oh, yeah That's the truth

110
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,490
because they all agree with it.

111
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,590
Yeah You say so high mentality of some

112
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,070
sort, you know in conditioning Just baffles just

113
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,350
sometimes Okay here we got a question just

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,490
crew starts Well prior to okay, we will

119
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,270
need to I read ahead of myself.

120
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,690
We would need to be three days No,

121
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,690
you don't need to be three days walking

122
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,210
distance from our fellow earth inhabitants Do you

123
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,650
still think this is the case or is

124
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,090
it pointless is a serious question?

125
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,490
Thanks again I was looking forward to your

126
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,170
insight Cheers It's I would suggest yes for

127
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,750
sure even now three-day walking distance is

128
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,450
good And you notice I said walking not

129
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,890
driving because there won't be great cars Yeah,

130
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,150
you know three-day walking is what 45

131
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,490
minutes a half hour by car.

132
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,070
Yeah a comfortable 10 miles 10 to 20

133
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,270
miles depending on your fitness Five miles is

134
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,190
a pretty good walk.

135
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,970
Yeah, if you you know, if you were

136
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,170
to set your day Yeah, if you're gonna

137
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,130
set up for walking with a backpack food

138
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,130
and all that You're depending on your fitness

139
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,950
and your pace, of course, like you said

140
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,950
a slow pace fast You're out of shape

141
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,010
for something like that You're gonna knock you

142
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,110
know, you don't get to know it real

143
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,790
quick Five miles if you're out of shape

144
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,430
would be arduous 10 to 20 if you're

145
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,730
a fit and a high pace.

146
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,690
Yeah That's the mileage or you could do

147
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:05,360
the kilometers So I would suggest even now

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
look I wish I was three days walk

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I wish I was three days right driving

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
distance from people I really do not because

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,860
I'd never want to be around people I

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,380
do but not the sort that I see

153
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,360
on the planet right now So and they're

154
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
just like robots Which which is what makes

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,180
them dangerous, you know, stupid people large numbers

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,560
are dangerous, right?

157
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,760
And they're everywhere and don't be me.

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,220
Hopefully people that are listening.

159
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
I have not Still I'd have established not

160
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,420
to be misled by the entitled classes, you

161
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,620

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,340

163
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,600

Someone says they're a doctor Well, you're just

165
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,360
for those that are sort of a quote

181
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,460
-unquote entity of some sort It is the

182
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,960
season of winter still and it will be

183
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,980
approaching the middle of it soon By the

184
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,740
middle of the next moon Or so then

185
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,480
era, you know, then when the days start

186
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,160
getting longer people that are on the other

187
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
side of the hemisphere I'm speaking to them

188
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,220
as well.

189
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,520
They're in there, but in the opposite sense,

190
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,840
they're in their main growing part, you know

191
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,580
center of summer But it's a center season

192
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,300
type thing.

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,360
So basically what you're going to see is

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,160
more buildup of what you've seen the past

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,660
few weeks So anyway Middle East is what

196
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,300
you got to be watching if you're looking

197
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,040
for what real You know global or earth

198
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,460
changes are going to be that's been the

199
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,220
case for the past 20 some odd years

200
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,540
So if you see like a dramatic event

201
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,700
in Venezuela or Canada or the u.s.

202
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,920
It doesn't mean that it's going to That's

203
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
not what it's about.

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,060
That's not gonna it's it has to do

205
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,700
with the Middle East.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
Here's a good example 9-11 Where did

207
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,920
it happen, New York City USA, right?

208
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,960
Well, guess what it affected the most Middle

209
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,840
East now You see well, I have the

210
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,880
morons here, you know, like the Patriot Act

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,720
and the NDA all that stuff's already in

212
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,260
the Lieber code When they pass all these

213
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,600
draconian laws, you know where they could detain

214
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,380
you and hold you forever.

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,560
That's been around since the 1870s Just go

216
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,120
look it up.

217
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,520
The Lieber code was it's a army manual

218
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,460
for engagement of an you know Peaceful inhabitants

219
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,640
or belligerence in the field for army engagement

220
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,860
in the field So that's why you have

221
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,020
a credit-based economy.

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,500
You don't need money because we knew the

223
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,100
military you don't use money use what's called

224
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,440
script And you don't have medicine you have

225
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,900
military medicine Right, if you don't believe that

226
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,500
you ever heard of an emergency room or

227
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,020
a hospital.

228
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,880
Those are those are not civilian Yeah, that's

229
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
all military stuff.

230
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,100
So anyway, I Don't say see there's about

231
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
eight or nine people in the chat.

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,600
I don't know what else is going on

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,060
They haven't I've got a bunch of emails

234
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,560
general roundabout stuff.

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,280
Not much.

236
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,580
I don't think are worth addressing.

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay Yeah, I don't know what else to

238
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,760
say, I mean it's just the usual stuff

239
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,440
It does well once you know when something

240
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,460
is Unfortunately, it doesn't apply to scripture and

241
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,040
ancient writs But some of these codes and

242
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,120
things do the abridged version first find something

243
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,720
that's been written about it right, right and

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,340
Because it's not like if you want to

245
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,320
you know, the like the Bible is you

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,120
know scripture It's hard to get your head

247
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,680
around right don't I'm not suggesting you go

248
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,880
read something about it You could but but

249
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,960
that's a targeted propaganda piece Heavily censored so

250
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,560
you it's going to be incorrect all around

251
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
most of the time but something like the

252
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
Lieber code That's fairly unknown.

253
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,580
If something is written about it.

254
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,820
It's going to be fairly candid Yeah, it's

255
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,280
going to be and it may not it

256
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,040
may not give you a sense of the

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,740
severity of it like it's being applied right

258
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,800
now, but it'll give you an outline of

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,360
The severity the severity again, right?

260
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,420
But any any ancient writ by the way,

261
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,980
even Greek philosophy I was speaking to someone

262
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,740
a couple weeks ago That's studying Greek philosophy

263
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,380
says Greek man.

264
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,060
I kind of doubted you but now that

265
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm looking at Greek philosophy, right?

266
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,180
They never really did translate it Looking at

267
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,540
the words.

268
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,920
It doesn't mean what they're you know, I'm

269
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,280
like, yeah.

270
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Well, okay.

271
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,620
Well, I hope you You're getting in touch

272
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,000
with me to impart something new.

273
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,440
Don't don't just Get in touch for me.

274
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,080
Tell me I'm right.

275
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,220
I already know that you know about that.

276
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't be saying it I'm not

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,500
saying it to be right.

278
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm saying it so I can give a

279
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,380
report But that person didn't have much at

280
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,800
the time.

281
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,860
So we'll see what would comes forward in

282
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,900
the future I put a question about Mexico

283
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,720
and Other troubles are having their way the

284
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,700
missing people in the thousands.

285
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,460
Yeah, I saw that before.

286
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,760
Yeah, and there's also something Juice, did you

287
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,100
catch it?

288
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,200
I don't know if you read it or

289
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,000
not But you know here you got all

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,860
these people chanting for justice justice justice Oh,

291
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,480
yeah, and then you get a bunch of

292
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,700
them that are chanting to these other gods

293
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,320
Yes, you kind of sit back and wonder,

294
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,060
you know, well you're causing your own troubles

295
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,200
Mm-hmm But there but here's the thing

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,340
if you study scripture, they're supposed to go

297
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,260
to these gods Yeah, we're supposed to go

298
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,360
to these gods, you know at the time

299
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,680
of after the flood the the Tower of

300
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,660
Babel They were supposed to disperse right and

301
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,760
and But they didn't so that's another story

302
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,260
someone No one's asked could he will you

303
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,760
talk about the Tower of Babel or the

304
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,260
rest of you know?

305
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,640
So I don't I don't I don't volunteer

306
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,000
information anymore, right?

307
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,360
It's very easy to have an Agenda, you

308
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,140
know what they call academic agenda.

309
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,740
You make a list.

310
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,900
So we want to I don't do that.

311
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,660
I'm finished with that So the the thing

312
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,080
is the The gods and all that are

313
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,660
hostile.

314
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,800
In other words, they have changed also they've

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,720
gotten worse towards man Let's just say in

316
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,620
a nutshell, right?

317
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,720
So the God of Canada and that has

318
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
gotten worse now than it was let's say

319
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,380
a hundred years ago God of Australia, but

320
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,600
actually they might share the same one because

321
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,620
they're a part of the Empire, right?

322
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,400
But also there was a recent you're going

323
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,180
to be seeing more Normalization about cannibalism and

324
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,280
death like there was something I caught today.

325
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,180
I turned on the small one of these

326
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,360
small devices and it gave me a newsflash

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
a woman in Morocco cooked and ate her

328
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,560
ex-boyfriend and Served him up to his

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,260
friends in a rice pilaf type dish And

330
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,140
the way she was caught the police were

331
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,480
looking for him and they found one of

332
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,120
his teeth in the blender because she blended

333
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,960
Up his body.

334
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,940
I ate a piece by piece.

335
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh Yeah, she also asked the neighbor to

336
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,740
help her get rid of the body so

337
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,200
this has been going this is not like

338
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
oh look This woman was on the Pope's

339
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,860
work schedule, whatever it is, November, whatever it

340
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,640
did this No, no.

341
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,620
No, this is going on every day all

342
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,880
over all the time You know, it's so

343
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,280
many wonder how much of it's not getting

344
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
out, right?

345
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
It's as thick as the old telephone book

346
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
if you catalog how many people are eaten

347
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,500
just in one, you know country I mean,

348
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,740
it's it's many many many there's a what

349
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,500
eight million people go missing every year Yeah,

350
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,320
and on the planet generally, so it's like

351
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,240
really like 30 million people go made a

352
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,840
hundred Thousand children in the u.s. Under

353
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,900
the age of six and they don't get

354
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,100
investigated Yeah, I mean easily, you know, you're

355
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,240
eating human flesh It's being what do you

356
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,340
think Walmart is benevolent or malevolent?

357
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,700
Do you think when you go buy pork

358
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,140
at Walmart?

359
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,980
It's big Every every time I mean, come

360
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,140
on, you know, or you know can be

361
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,520
a chili that has pork in it You

362
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,060
think that's really pig pork?

363
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,540
You've got to be stupid and totally asleep.

364
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,020
You're not eating human.

365
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,400
They're not giving you human flesh based on

366
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,360
a prank You know, I caught my eye

367
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,660
when I got on here today was Six

368
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,380
of 18 there went and posted something and

369
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,200
it looked like a Walmart species a wall

370
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,980
Martian Well Martian.

371
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,320
Yeah.

372
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,900
Yeah, I wanted to oh, yeah.

373
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh the one with the double visual image

374
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,500
Yeah, that's one thing why people don't age

375
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,880
well and they don't look good when they're

376
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
out of shape I mean, I'm not saying

377
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
mother but they fall apart very quickly Yeah,

378
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,960
when they when they fall apart boy, it

379
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,680
does it, you know pick up speed.

380
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,100
So anyway Yeah, there's always a lot of

381
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,220
quote-unquote good stuff to talk about if

382
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,180
you're talking about developing food clothing and shelter

383
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,140
You want to avoid?

384
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,300
Anything that people are interested in Because it's

385
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,860
been corrupted so even let's say for example,

386
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,400
I remember back in the 80s, uh, you

387
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,060
know So I started seeing Especially in the

388
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,840
late 80s more mainstream talk about organic food.

389
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,740
I said, oh, that's it.

390
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,940
It's going to be corrupted Yeah in less

391
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,500
than a decade.

392
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,320
It'll be crap.

393
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,980
It won't be as good Well, it still

394
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,140
is good But you know so anything that

395
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
the populace gets into they have a so

396
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,220
many demons following them that they're gonna jump

397
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,260
in and wreck it so What I mean

398
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,040
by that is that's why I never talk

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,220
about new scientific discoveries politics medical discoveries You

400
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,080
know because none of those discoveries are really

401
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,560
discoveries.

402
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,060
They're just general academic pranks And also, you

403
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,980
know having some discussions recently with someone someone

404
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,560
in academia.

405
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,380
They fully admit They were nodding.

406
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,060
Yes to what I was, you know, basically

407
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,160
the Greek speak on academia, but they're like,

408
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
hey, you know I set myself up for

409
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,740
it and it's a job and I'm like,

410
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,040
yeah and Every one of them says that

411
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,920
when you get to know them Just like

412
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,580
just like every attorney that you know will

413
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,220
tell you the law doesn't matter You do

414
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
what the judge says and basically I don't

415
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,520
need to know the law When you get

416
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,480
to know them you call up an attorney

417
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,060
now, and you're just some, you know cold

418
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,640
call Whatever.

419
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
So of course we go by law.

420
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,300
No, of course.

421
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,920
I know the law.

422
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,680
Yeah, because you know, that's their facade, right?

423
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,180
Yeah, there is no doctor that is licensed

424
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,860
or works that knows how the human body

425
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,580
works and you and practices it openly Because

426
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,340
if he did he'd lose his permission to

427
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,580
be a doctor, right?

428
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,940
This is a horrible horrible condition, but you

429
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,500
know, I'm giving those as examples that what

430
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,140
people praise is Totally worth it belongs on

431
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,180
the bottom of you know, some giant shoe

432
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,720
but Doesn't mean that you can't How Would

433
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,400
you say when you cultivate something right when

434
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,260
you make something we discover something you yeah

435
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,300
You cultivate you make it grow food your

436
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
own food clothing and shelter the best you

437
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,480
can here's the interesting thing I've told you

438
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,780
know, I've said, you know in two years

439
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,000
won't be able to eat out anymore I

440
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,160
said that a year ago So I got

441
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,380
about another year because I've noticed it's getting

442
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,900
worse and worse and worse Right and I

443
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,680
won't be able to really get any meat,

444
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,099
you know animal In the next two or

445
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,859
three years, I will not be doing it

446
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,320
because it's going to be that poor, you

447
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,500
know I see it coming.

448
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,360
It's it's and the signs are very clear

449
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,940
to me They may not be to others,

450
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,020
but it all starts with anything that has

451
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,740
to be stewarded You know or controlled by

452
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,440
people is going to get worse and worse,

453
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
but at the same time You're going to

454
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
be building up a golden age.

455
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
So go figure how that works.

456
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,080
It's not a dichotomy when you understand scripture

457
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,400
You know, how many people think the cell

458
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,220
phones are a good thing, you know, raise

459
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,820
your hand everyone raises their hand well, and

460
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,600
then of course, you'll have someone that shows

461
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,740
you what damage it does and What it

462
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,280
you know?

463
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,880
Well, we could talk about the spying also,

464
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,300
which is something else, but right the eavesdropping

465
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,320
If you told people that we're not aware

466
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,680
of the technology the plot positive and negatives

467
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,480
They wouldn't use it because of the negatives

468
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,960
But the people feel that the negatives the

469
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,300
positives overcome the negatives and they still use

470
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,780
what I mean So like if you went

471
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,400
back to a culture a hundred years ago

472
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
and said these are the positives and then

473
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,180
there's a no way We don't want it.

474
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,600
It was negative.

475
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,660
The positives are not worth it, right?

476
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,060
You see So that's what I mean by

477
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,680
what what's coming you'll be used to it

478
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,180
and you'll take it now in terms of

479
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,620
the spying Like they say NSA government agencies

480
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,860
and there's no such thing as the NSA

481
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,980
It's a it's an agency, which is part

482
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,240
of the government not government.

483
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,120
It's part of the government a Semi-autonomous

484
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,480
and most of its clients are private people

485
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,460
and private dealings He just like you know

486
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,800
I knew someone that worked at the DEA

487
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,100
and he's like yeah for a hundred and

488
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
fifty thousand dollars in 90 days notice We

489
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,020
could move a satellite Anywhere to follow someone

490
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,100
or whatever or beam microwaves down to them

491
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,820
and fry their ass or whatever You know,

492
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,760
there's satellites more satellites than you know, and

493
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,580
I was like, wow, okay cool, you know

494
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,000
Not cool, but you know, this is it's

495
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,080
very common you they still have to pay

496
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,500
in other words If FBI goes to NSA,

497
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,960
they have to give the NS is a

498
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,180
bill.

499
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,960
They have to pay the bill So don't

500
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,700
think that they're been conglomerate and there is

501
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,600
nothing viable in what you're saying You know

502
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,720
what?

503
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, just like I speak to people

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
over the world I say oh you're completely

505
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,660
surrounded by morons and they all always agree

506
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,060
why I've never been to where they are.

507
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
They never told me It's freaking obvious right,

508
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,740
right So it's pretty obvious that there's nothing

509
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,120
anyone can say that they're the quote-unquote

510
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,980
You know eavesdropping on cell phones is being

511
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,300
used for because they know you're all a

512
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,160
bunch of idiots there what they're doing is

513
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
Categorizing it based on what you're saying or

514
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,300
who you are in metadata to monetize it

515
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,440
when it comes time to Mix it with

516
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,840
Department of Justice and their criminal side, which

517
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,000
is all monetizing, right, right So, for example,

518
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,720
you know how you think they monetize a

519
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,060
YouTube channel, right?

520
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
Based on activity and all this stuff, right?

521
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Sure When they when they survey someone the

522
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,240
more they survey them the more they can

523
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,120
monetize it It doesn't matter if you're talking

524
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,020
about crackerjacks, but obviously they're not tell you

525
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,100
that They tell you you know, it's evasive

526
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,960
and we're looking for terrorists There's no such

527
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,100
thing.

528
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,880
They invented determine the procedures for terrorism.

529
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,220
The whole thing is ridiculous It's all about

530
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,100
monetization and they will kill you for it

531
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
You are nothing because you'll end up in

532
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
a can of chili with pork on the

533
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,760
ingredient and everybody will eat it happen I

534
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,600
think it's pork This is the real existence

535

Internet film company they make films for the

546

Internet and you look for something called Raka.

547
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,260
I think it's r a k k a

548
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,480

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,080
and in the end Sporny Weaver's in it.

551
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,460
She did it.

552
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,420
She liked it so much She actually kicked

553
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,120
in her time She donated her time for

554
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,560
it because she's like the ultimate princess of

555
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,400
the alien and sci-fi, you know, so

556
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,460
Gordy Weaver, you know and she looks like

557
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,280
somebody's granny that's really fit and she She's

558
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,840
in the end the film there, but check

559
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,080
out Raka and that's what's really going on.

560
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,420
Hmm behind the scenes not over Oats studios.

561
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah, you'll be that's what is really going

562
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,020
on.

563
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,000
So But not not like they're sure but

564
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,780
you know, that's severity right now and it's

565
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,240
gonna get worse so Yeah, there's plenty of

566
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,540
stuff to do that that can make your

567
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,000
life.

568
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,080
Well Better, I don't know because it's gonna

569
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,280
you know, you're gonna be you know how

570
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,660
they say it's an uphill battle Yeah, you

571
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,480
know, it's it's more work, right?

572
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,460
So you're gonna have to invest more time

573
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,760
and energy and Effort I should say into

574
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,440
anything that you do if you want a

575
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,060
quality life so and Forgo a lot of

576
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,700
things like I don't do any banking Right.

577
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,340
I just you know use the Federal Reserve

578
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,200
note and I properly monitor, you know properly

579
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,920
recorded Indexing on title 12 section 4 1

580
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,620
so if anyone wants to talk to me

581
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,760
about you know Any authority or whatever about

582
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,380
it like hey, look, you know I'm redeeming

583
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,880
it for lawful money and this you know

584
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,220
But I know all you need to do

585
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,520
to redeem for all the ways make sure

586
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,900
that you're making a demand for it because

587
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,380
they're not Going to give you Yeah, I

588
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,940
can't engage in the it's so easy to

589
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,760
I mean any bank will open a bank

590
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,640
account for you and do whatever You don't

591
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,660
even have to go to a bank.

592
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,300
You could do it online, but I choose

593
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
not to because it's a criminal enterprise through

594
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,180
and through for a criminal society through and

595
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,580
through so You know might be another part

596
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,900
of it, yeah, yeah, I just rather I'd

597
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,040
rather Suffer the lack of it because it

598
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,220
is inconvenient in a lot of cases like

599
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
The other day I was at Home Depot

600
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
and they said no cash all the register.

601
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,740
They redid the registers They don't look like

602
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,540
registers anymore.

603
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,460
They look like counters.

604
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,300
Oh my and you don't even see a

605
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,380
drawer for money or anything And it's all

606
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,820
cards, you know, you know Yeah, so there's

607
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,440
all the things that can't take cash all

608
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,780
the drawers won't open There's only out of

609
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,380
all the registers at a Home Depot only

610
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,700
two or three take cash I was like,

611
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,920
you know screw this But who's the one

612
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,460
getting screwed because the local hardware store and

613
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,540
lumberyard now is a restaurant and they kept

614
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,760
the name Right also as a lumberyard and

615
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,240
it's like outdoor seating and music.

616
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,080
So there is no choice You see so

617
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,920
so what do I have to do cut

618
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,460
down trees or no trees here in the

619
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,060
desert to get wood?

620
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,360
So, I mean, I'm gonna have to figure

621
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
out it But if I had one of

622
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,360
those cards, I just swipe it and just

623
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,980
like me be on my merry way Like

624
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,880
all the other morons.

625
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,980
I'm not any better because I don't do

626
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,400
banking.

627
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,980
I just I just prefer not to today

628
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
For for different ways to approach the issue.

629
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,500
Yeah, it's easier to see what's coming and

630
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,480
the changes when you're not involved in something,

631
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:31,760
right?

632
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,440
it's like if let's say you worked at

633
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,000
a corporation and Someone is really good at

634
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,940
reading, you know Updates on that corporation they

635
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,160
find out that Chances are because of the

636
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,960
financial service they're gonna fire workers If you

637
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,440
work there and someone tells you that you

638
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,620
might lose your job, but now I don't

639
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,520
really haven't heard anything like that here No,

640
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm fine.

641
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,340
I so You're not going to be able

642
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,280
to see it coming if you're in it,

643
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,160
you know Not that anything's coming because there's

644
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,540
no money.

645
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,840
Anyway, I think someone does a custodian or

646
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,940
whatever he he's seriously obsessed with the credit

647
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,040
system and I I Know it through and

648
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,140
through and I know how to work it.

649
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,920
I mean, but I don't because it's unlawful

650
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,660
I'd rather not do unlawful stuff like that,

651
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,060
you know, look it's it's right in your

652
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,820
in the laws You go look up the

653
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,980
RESPA FTC PA and the FTC TPA Laws

654
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,560
if someone sends you a dunning or a

655
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,520
bill And it has to do with consumer

656
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:31,980
credit.

657
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,600
They have to validate not verify.

658
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,560
They use they try to trip you up

659
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,460
According to those federal laws.

660
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,720
They say one word.

661
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,360
They say verified.

662
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,760
They say valid verification and validation are two

663
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,600
different things Otherwise, there's there's no debt.

664
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,120
So you just deny that you owe anything

665
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,440
and it goes away I mean you might

666
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
have to actually threaten to sue them That's

667
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,080
the best way to do it and it's

668
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,740
five and it's every time they contact you

669
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,120
It's five hundred to a thousand bucks.

670
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,960
You let them contact you 25 or 30

671
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,060
times before you take an action There was

672
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,200
a guy that worked as a janitor and

673
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,940
a couple of other jobs a few years

674
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,180
ago that discovered this There's a group called

675
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,000
what lies in your debt.

676
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,640
They're pretty censored, but they're very good at

677
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,460
putting this stuff together I had gotten I

678
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,420
had already known and used this system in

679
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,560
the past Previous but when I found out

680
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,200
about them, they had really put it together

681
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,860
very neatly.

682
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,960
They made it more simple It doesn't mean

683
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,720
it's going to be easy But this guy

684
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,160
worked barely making it now All he does

685
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,760
is use credit cards and he and plus

686
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,140
he makes a hundred to a hundred fifty

687
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,960
thousand a year So you just run the

688
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,580
credit card up and say where's that, you

689
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,060
know prove you have a debt Oh can't

690
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,640
and it doesn't go on the credit report

691
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,540
And if they try to put on the

692
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,580
credit report You sue that you go after

693
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,060
the credit card company, you know, it's them,

694
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,200
you know, and then they take it off

695
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,120
So the credit report spotless Right So the

696
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,000
thing is they have an army of repossessors

697
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
when you try to do that with boats

698
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,820
cars planes motorcycles or homes They don't care.

699
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
They just run it through and take it

700
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
away from you It's kind of like you

701
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,380
go to a sandwich shop you pay for

702
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,520
it And before right before you go to

703
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,240
sit down they take it from you and

704
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,920
they get make someone else pay for it

705
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,760
and before They take a bite out of

706
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,960
it, you know, they might even take a

707
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
butter They take it away and sell it

708
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,720
to someone else the same thing over and

709
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:12,900
over.

710
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,680
That's what they're doing.

711
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,400
It's completely criminal enterprise, but the people Here's

712
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,440
like prohibition, you know, they did that by

713
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,320
the don't believe that they did prohibition to

714
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,600
think the nation be better to stop alcohol

715
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,080
It was to boost the black market and

716
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,940
see that if it would fall into line

717
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,360
The black market and prohibition wouldn't have worked

718
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,500
if the people you didn't want to drink

719
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,980
it, right?

720
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,300
If the people said well, it's country and

721
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,600
jurisdiction says no alcohol.

722
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,060
None of us will do it Then there

723
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,500
wouldn't have been no black market and we

724
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,400
probably still to have been in prohibition, right?

725
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
Right, but they found that the black market

726
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,240
wasn't as good as taxing it and they

727
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,840
couldn't control it Yeah, just like the war

728
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
on drugs They're just telling you that now

729
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,240
that they're getting into drugs and every time

730
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,460
they you know When they tell you, you

731
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,100
know the homeland security all this anti-terrorism

732
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,780
means that they're getting into terrorism now Everything

733
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,420
is backwards.

734
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,380
Yeah when they tell you FDA that means

735
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,460
they're going to start poisoning your food and

736
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,800
your drugs, right?

737
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,420
Right when it's like yeah, you see it's

738
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,980
so simple.

739
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,020
I mean, where do you think you are?

740
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,360
I mean, you're on planet Earth, you know,

741
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,340
this is how things work here Regardless of

742
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,520
what the people are saying, they don't most

743
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,740
people if you ask them where they are

744
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,880
None of them will tell you I'm on

745
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,940
earth They'll tell you the city or the

746
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,580
state whatever they're so brainwashed to think it

747
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,640
has something to do with something It's just

748
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,920
a district right very few people.

749
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,660
Where are you now?

750
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm on earth where you know, I'm on

751
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,700
this part of the earth No one thinks

752
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
like that That's that's why the they're being

753
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,820
treated the way they are and that's why

754
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,720
things are the way they are because they

755
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,680
don't see it on that level You know,

756
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,600
even when people Were you know horse and

757
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
carriage and walking on foot we're talking like,

758
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,240
you know, no tech or you know hand

759
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,640
tech I call it and pure analog tech.

760
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,520
They always considered what was around the earth

761
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,620
or whatever You you only hear about their

762
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,100
local nationalism or whatever because they had to

763
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,700
protect it Right.

764
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
That was a concern, but they're always Murdered

765
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,020
land Like in if you were in the

766
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,920
u.s. Most where you said China that

767
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,820
was a mythological place up until the 1800s.

768
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,540
Mm-hmm I know it sounds kind of

769
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,300
crazy now In other words in the early

770
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,340
black and white films They had white people

771
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,780
in films dress up like Chinaman because they

772
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,200
didn't want to put a real Chinaman and

773
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
scare the white people Because they had never

774
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,920
seen one.

775
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,080
It was mythological place, but known as the

776
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,500
Orient.

777
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:45,580
Yeah you see so Yeah, it's just a

778
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,600
pretty shitty place The place is great.

779
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,840
But what people and and the thing is

780
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,560
can you blame the people, you know, very

781
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,900
often say well They don't know Greek Well

782
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,820
it but I'm not I'm not giving the

783
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,480
reasons All of the veritable reasons why the

784
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,180
people are stupid and wicked or whatever I'm

785
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,980
just telling you the fact that they are

786
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,020
and you're not going to change it So,

787
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,760
you know what I mean?

788
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,660
So if you just act with the facts

789
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,060
as people are dangerous and evil and whatever

790
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,840
you'll be better off and saying well I

791
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
know they're they're capable of danger and evil

792
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,800
and all that but that's because they don't

793
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,780
have an education that Propaganda as you run

794
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,960
through the whole it doesn't matter because the

795
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,920
minute you interact with them the potential of

796
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,680
them Being the worst is higher than the

797
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,580
potential of them being the best So you

798
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,280
stick with the facts good kind of like

799
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,260
again like a court scene, you know, what

800
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,820
is the fact it's a fact you know,

801
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,480
they Just the facts the facts are that

802
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,240
Where I'm not talking about how or why

803
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,420
they are the way they are.

804
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,340
Yes So if they are intentionally it's a

805
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,340
first degree, but let's say they're all they

806
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
the majority of the people are of second

807
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,700
degree right Yeah, there isn't a good portion

808
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
of them that are first degree evil and

809
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,240
stubborn and wicked and stupid But the majority

810
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,460
doesn't matter a little nudge and they'll go

811
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,600
up a little bit.

812
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,620
Yeah, so And this is gonna just go

813
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,000
on and then you know There's not much

814
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,880
to talk about other than you know, as

815
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,160
anyone want get into anything Otherwise, we'll make

816
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,760
it a really short one again.

817
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,740
I mean, let's see.

818
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,480
We had a couple of At the risk

819
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,420
you something about the resurrection here At the

820
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,360
resurrection people will neither marry nor be given

821
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,820
in marriage I have always pondered on this

822
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,580
We'll go look at go look at that

823
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,480
word by word in the Greek The New

824
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,340
Testament is that you haven't is worthless has

825
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,860
no value in in the English it's been

826
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,180
so scared in other words read it, but

827
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,640
then go study it and You're not entitled

828
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,600
to asking questions on New Testament stuff unless

829
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
you've studied it and study.

830
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,300
It means an interlinear You can get away

831
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,120
with the what's called the Old Testament a

832
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,280
little bit better But any if you bring

833
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,700
up anything in the New Testament It has

834
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,320
to be looked at word by word in

835
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,060
the Greek because I'm telling you they've really

836
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,140
screwed it up It's has no value.

837
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,540
It has no value other than the place

838
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,320
Actually what's in the New Testament is tremendous

839
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,580
value But what you're reading has no value

840
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,040
unless you've validated it through the interlinear word

841
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,400
by word Sorry, and then you have to

842
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,600
go back and also ponder the law and

843
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,660
also ponder the Aramaic if it's available so

844
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,460
But anyway regarding F.

845
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,900
I don't know I'd have to go It

846
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,860
sounds like it's fairly fluent meaning, you know

847
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,480
from another thought prior to that That's the

848
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,760
other thing that these Christian demons like to

849
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,400
do the especially the the biblical ones that

850
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,660
say they use the Bible They take only

851
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,980
one verse out of context But if you

852
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,640
actually look at especially New Testament stuff You

853
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,020
you have to take it in chunks go

854
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,760
like three or four verses prior three or

855
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,480
four verses after to Create the context even

856
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,980
if it's at the beginning of a book

857
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,700
or a chapter believe it or not So

858
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,220
certain book in them and the one that

859
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,940
the people use oh, it's horrible It's a

860
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,200
joke that's why a lot of people that

861
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,740
are anti Christian or whatever they use the

862
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,920
New Testament Against them which they should because

863
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,780
you know because if you're gonna rely on

864
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,640
such a poor version, it's not even a

865
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,300
translation it's a poor version you deserve to

866
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,040
get hit over the head and over it

867
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,860
and disregarded But anyway, do you want to

868
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,700
want to just review that question again the

869
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,380
one or the Let's see if we go

870
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,940
work with it.

871
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,880
Yeah I'm not in front of a computer

872
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,400
right now, but I will be Get her

873
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,380
back up here Oh as a wreck as

874
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,700
the Resurrection people will neither marry nor be

875
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,000
given in marriage.

876
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,860
I have always pondered on this Afterwards yeah,

877
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,880
Mary.

878
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:21,139
Well, that's pretty interesting right well What's the

879
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,880
purpose of fidelity when you say marriage is

880
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,860
fidelity right usually even if it's multiple wives

881
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,540
ultimately, it's it's to continue the It's to

882
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,800
continue the species if you're resurrected.

883
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,340
Do you have any concern with that?

884
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,360
No, you don't Yep That's usually the the

885
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,639
entire resurrection because there are going to be

886
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,580
resurrected beings.

887
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,120
They're going to be running the scumbags that

888
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,120
are left All right, right, right because it's

889
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,760
not gonna this is the other thing that

890
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
the la la land Principle the people that

891
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,500
are going to be left are just going

892
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,760
to be a representative sample of the scumbags

893
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,440
that are here now Right.

894
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,400
I'm using the term scumbag as a Navy,

895
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,900
you know, if you're in the Navy, that's

896
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
a common term It just means like that

897
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,100
was a used prophylactic wasn't it?

898
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,200
Yeah, right Yeah, it means like you're you're

899
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,460

900
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,060
Yes.

901
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,840
Yeah, you're here.

902
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,060
You shouldn't be here You know, you know,

903
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,000
you don't know what you're doing, but we

904
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,260
got it.

905
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:25,880
We need bodies Mm-hmm Fairground sailors, especially

906
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,920
submarine people that comes out of their mouth

907
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,480
constantly.

908
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,440
Oh, yeah, they're on some submarine people They're

909
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640
like, oh this we had a scumbag coming.

910
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,560
I'm like, what did you say?

911
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,140
Anyway, I'm not in this is not a

912
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,640
Navy call.

913
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,020
It was a Navy called be normal.

914
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,120
Oh, yeah, but yeah, there's going to be

915
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,600
Representative sample don't think this la la land

916
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,720
that this this JES US creature is coming

917
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,040
back You know looking all effeminate and all

918
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,180
that and gonna do, you know, there's by

919
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,120
the way, you know There's gonna be no

920
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,500
churches and no Christianity in the future Thankfully,

921
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,700
but no Islam either or Judaism as you

922
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,180
know it or Buddhism all that shit's gonna

923
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,240
go Hope you guys will realize that So

924
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
none of that stuff's gonna be around.

925
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,800
We're talking real stuff.

926
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,680
You're gonna see real technology again Go back

927
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,800
to the question Think about it.

928
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,980
If you're a resurrected being like these these

929
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,840
idiots go around to call themselves born again

930
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,280
Christian or whatever Years ago.

931
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
I did like a Bible study thing a

932
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
couple times more than a couple of times

933
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,900
as long as I'm born again I don't

934
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,460
need that.

935
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,660
I'm like you're born again.

936
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,260
You see that parking lot across the street

937
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,500
I want to see can you show up

938
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
in that parking lot?

939
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,300
I just what do you mean?

940
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,180
Well, if you were born again, it means

941
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,820
you're resurrected.

942
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
You can just appear right there.

943
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,780
Go ahead Pop on over, you know, I

944
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,500
can test you up on or you can't

945
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,780
do it.

946
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:55,020
Oh, you're an asshole Imagine that Hmm They're

947
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,280
all like that all the all the groups

948
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,920
like for example If you go to university

949
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,900
and you look like there's a particular school

950
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,360
like physics school, right?

951
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,240
Mm-hmm.

952
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
The students come out the proof.

953
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,900
They're just a little carbon copies of the

954
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,800
professor They're they don't they don't have they

955
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,840
don't have one authentic creative thought in their

956
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,440
minds ever in their whole lives That's why

957
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:14,920
they're there.

958
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,960
They have no critical thinking none You talk

959
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
to them and they're all just like little

960
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,060
copies as they've just been told what to

961
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,080
say none of them are thinking That's why

962
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,700
you know when you look at the Internet

963
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,900
for example on scientific discoveries They're always showing

964
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,380
these teenagers in graduate school or you know

965
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,680
early 20s It's not head whatever repeating, you

966
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,840
know, and you're supposed to be impressed.

967
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,100
So a bunch of rubbish You're just trekking

968
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,840
along another words society This is like the

969
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,900
old there's a lot of poems written about

970
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,040
it.

971
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,280
The only reason society is around It's not

972
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,700
because of anything that you're doing.

973
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,600
Well, actually two things.

974
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,440
What is the Sun?

975
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,120
Rises and sets and you have the growth

976
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
cycle The other thing is that you've separated

977
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,120
your wastewater and your freshwater far enough not

978
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,800
to be sick.

979
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,740
All right In other words your sewer pipes,

980
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,440
hopefully are not running into your feed lines

981
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,200
and vice versa that was the case of

982
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,300
all these sicknesses not because of the and

983
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,740
On all these neurological diseases are called by

984
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,200
caused by insecticides and chemicals not by viruses

985
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,800
so That's it pretty much the rest of

986
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,520
you just trucking logistics day in day out

987
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,220
breath here breath there you know what they

988
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,600
give you out the Say the word grocery

989
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,420
stores And you that's my most people are

990
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,380
overdosing on all these different Additives that you

991
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,360
know vitamins and all this and you can't

992
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,980
oh, yeah, imagine a toxicology on that over

993
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,620
a period of time Yeah, and the degradation

994
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,080
that that does to one's self So it's

995
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,460
it's yeah, but it's a testament to the

996
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,900
robustness of the body Human body it takes

997
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,940
a lot of abuse now.

998
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,780
This is all done I was having a

999
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,800
conversation yesterday with someone About technology and force

1000
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,540
and power and who runs the world and

1001
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,640
all that and the military by the way

1002
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
It does not have any power unless it's

1003
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,060
attached to the spiritual realm Right.

1004
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,800
So every military in the world just like

1005
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,180
you're the Troy, you know Agamemnon sacrificed his

1006
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,040
daughter to get the sails, you know the

1007
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,500
wind blowing to move the ships This is

1008
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,540
still being done today.

1009
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,580
You're American.

1010
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,580
They call them Satanists, but they're really You

1011
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,080
can judge them as Satanists basically that category,

1012
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,340
but you know, if all your major major

1013
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,000
religions are satanic They're there.

1014
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,520
They're also satanic But they're what they're doing

1015
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,600
is specifically evoking demonic entities that are for

1016
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,740
fighting war elementals, right?

1017
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,980
US military all of them, you know Don't

1018
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,840
look at the generals and the people they

1019
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,380
put in front of you.

1020
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,600
Those are PR people Yes, they know what's

1021
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,420
going on you know, they have you know,

1022
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,220
and Yeah, you don't make four star or

1023
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
whatever unless they have pictures of you with

1024
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,840
a black penis in your mouth Yeah, you

1025
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
know, I'm serious or something.

1026
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,280
You know, you don't make those positions.

1027
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,140
Yeah, you know I mean, it's it's you

1028
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,740
know, if you're white and if you're a

1029
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,100
black general Then I don't know what they

1030
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,140
put in your mouth probably not still black,

1031
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,840
but I'm just being derogatory here This is

1032
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,440
the reality of of you know, the world

1033
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,320
you live in not not what I'm not

1034
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,660
making this stuff up Look up cherry marine

1035
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,320
By the way, if you know about that

1036
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,780
now you can't be in the higher ranks

1037
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,000
in the Marines unless you're you you they

1038
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,860
put you in gay porn or You know

1039
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,340
got you photographed with a child.

1040
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,100
I'm serious, right?

1041
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,240
This is not Fantasy this is reality.

1042
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,480
Just like your your Hormel can of pork

1043
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,840
chili.

1044
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,040
Do you think that's pork?

1045
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,520
You're you're an idiot you know, so I'm

1046
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,240
not saying that all of the pork on

1047
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,960
the market is not pork But I I

1048
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,580
know for sure these people are sick enough

1049
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,540
for sure That they're putting human flesh in

1050
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,180
the pork food supply for sure.

1051
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,700
Can you trust that?

1052
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,860
Yes Yes, it's actually been known for hundreds

1053
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,240
of years that to get rid of the

1054
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,680
body usually if you didn't have a seriously

1055
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,160
agitated You feed it to a pig or

1056
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,060
a pig farm nearby.

1057
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,420
Yeah.

1058
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,180
Yeah, that's how it was done.

1059
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,180
It still is done today But now you

1060
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,840
have the level of pranking That is beyond

1061
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,220
what most people can imagine you can be

1062
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,660
what they call an imagineer Just sit around

1063
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,360
all day and that's your job to imagine

1064
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,620
shit And you can't I bet you still

1065
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,840
won't be able to come up with anything

1066
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,880
that resembles the truth too much Right because

1067
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,200
that's how far you know removed you are

1068
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,680
from it.

1069
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,260
So Anyway, I'm gonna go back into the

1070
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,980
office here in a moment, and we'll see

1071
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,380
if there's anything else Bruce.

1072
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,080
Do you think or?

1073
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,580
short was wondering If sickness can be transposed

1074
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,220
like parents eating their children Can it happen

1075
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,660
that a child's actions transposed to the unknowing

1076
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,100
parent?

1077
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,720
Yeah, yeah, of course Well, yes based on

1078
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,400
susceptibility and Based on the and the element

1079
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,660
behind that disease if it's a very powerful

1080
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,620
one, it'll transpose for a three block radius

1081
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,900
If it's a fairly weak one, it won't

1082
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,960
be able to its individually target Yeah You

1083
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,180
know, it's possible You know to you know

1084
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,160
start a pattern of discernment based on this,

1085
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,140
you know, what's going on spiritually around a

1086
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,640
person also You know to answer that biologically,

1087
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:59,470
you know, okay Like parents

1088
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,370
eating their children can it happen that a

1089
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,570
child's actions transposed to unknown parents Oh eating

1090
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,650
their children I thought it was getting sick.

1091
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,510
Oh, I've been wondering if sickness can be

1092
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:21,150
transposed hmm,

1093
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,110
I Don't quite get that Say it reword

1094
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,840
that Take a few seconds to get down

1095
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:46,860
the stream Just

1096
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,820
made its way down Yeah, but the eating

1097
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,880
of children and child sacrifice is happens every

1098
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,680
day by the thousands or hundreds In just

1099
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,300
you know, pick a large country like the

1100
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,720
US or the European Union.

1101
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,000
Let's say which is a Union.

1102
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,600
This is normal I mean, I remember visiting

1103
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,180
Greece a while back and and I wanted

1104
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,700
to see this cave because I had a

1105
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,380
postcard of it They're like don't don't go.

1106
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,440
We don't want to go to that.

1107
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,000
The locals are no we don't want to

1108
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,600
go to that cave No, no, no, you

1109
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,460
shouldn't go I said why because that's where

1110
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,640
the priests take the children to rape them

1111
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,440
and it wasn't like that's where the priests

1112
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,480
Took the children a long time ago to

1113
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,740
rape him.

1114
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,160
No, this is currently where the priests take

1115
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,780
the children to rape them Whoa, I was

1116
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,080
like, whoa, you know, you still got these

1117
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,760
fuckers around you don't hang them Yeah, you

1118
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,000
know burn their houses down and all that

1119
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,380
stuff.

1120
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,680
If you know that's happening.

1121
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,260
You see what I mean?

1122
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,280
How they're culpable also, right?

1123
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,930
Yeah Yeah Yeah, the thing is now that

1124
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,730
the society, you know, just like with the

1125
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,850
homo the sodomites and the transgender and the

1126
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,090
violence Oh Violence a violent.

1127
00:44:59,210 --> 00:44:59,870
We don't want any violence.

1128
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,730
What are you talking about?

1129
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,870
If you do it so fast, it's not

1130
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,930
considered but define they can't define violence if

1131
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,630
you go up to a There's a trick

1132
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,810
that you the tablecloth pulled from underneath all

1133
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,690
the place setting sure, you know Set like

1134
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,450
that set a table for five people, you

1135
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,210
know, you could pull the tablecloth just right

1136
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,510
It leaves everything there right if it's heavy

1137
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,730
enough, but if you don't do it just

1138
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,470
right, it looks pretty violent, doesn't it?

1139
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,290
It does Right a well-placed blow Yeah,

1140
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,770
so years ago if they even today it's

1141
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,530
still going on today in the Midwest and

1142
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,510
places that are More rural when someone is

1143
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,690
a problem to them, you know their family

1144
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,430
or the society They follow there's certain people

1145
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,210
that are chosen and the sheriff's know about

1146
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,590
this the local the Leo's, you know, a

1147
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,970
lot local Law enforcement agency people know this

1148
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,810
and they just wait for the person, you

1149
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,070
know like maybe they will go out in

1150
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,230
the middle of the night to get smoke

1151
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,870
a pack of cigarettes or something and they

1152
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,630
never come Back and and then they're not

1153
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,590
missed It's not like well, he didn't come

1154
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,870
they might say well, he didn't come back

1155
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,510
last night, you know, wink-wink, you know

1156
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,570
big deal All right, and they're not missed

1157
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,550
and this happens all the time.

1158
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,330
I Mean in Colorado what they do is

1159
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,550
they just tie you to a tree and

1160
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,370
rub peanut butter all over you Same in

1161
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,010
Alaska, they have grizzly bears.

1162
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:15,430
Yeah.

1163
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,870
Oh, yeah, you're not gonna find anything Actually

1164
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,170
tying you to a tree is not very

1165
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,050
good because the way the bear attacks is

1166
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,470
they have to pounce on your chest and

1167
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,370
They eat your face off first.

1168
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,270
So but they'll still they'll find it.

1169
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,410
They'll get you off the tree Yeah, so

1170
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,750
anyway, this is normal human activity folks.

1171
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,070
It's not violence Like you've been brainwashed.

1172
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,170
I'm not promoting it because it's not gonna

1173
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,530
help anything No, wait, but it actually will

1174
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,150
because it's going to be extremely violent Oh,

1175
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,190
we've one of the gods do it when

1176
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,470
they eliminate 95% of y'all it's

1177
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,930
not going to be peaceful when they do

1178
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,190
it by the way and it's gonna happen

1179
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,530
over several a good poor a third of

1180
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,430
That's going to be done by yourselves to

1181
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,750
each other The other two-thirds a little

1182
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,150
bit more than that is going to be

1183
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,690
done by the gods and it's not going

1184
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,590
to be peaceful But it'll be swift.

1185
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,270
I Wouldn't say painless it could be I

1186
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:15,270
think to a certain degree When it's a

1187
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,290
form of accounting when someone has to be

1188
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,830
taken out by the gods, I don't think

1189
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,830
they make it painful We have some Evidence

1190
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,330
of that when the Assyrian army during Hezekiah

1191
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,290
was put to sleep 180,000 by an

1192
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,970
angel it didn't say they died violently or

1193
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:29,450
painlessly.

1194
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,030
They just all went to sleep and they

1195
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,850
never woke up I don't know but getting

1196
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,390
hit by it with an asteroid is that

1197
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,430
could be painful ouch You know, yeah.

1198
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:41,890
Yeah.

1199
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,190
Yeah Yeah So it's just that you know,

1200
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,770
it's it's not possible to speak as time

1201
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,590
goes on every day It's harder and harder

1202
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,890
to speak to people about real things Do

1203
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,490
you know just generally, you know?

1204
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:06,080
Mm-hmm like There's really nothing going on

1205
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,860
I mean other than the progression towards a

1206
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,720
Middle East Union you know and then a

1207
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,980
progression towards Normalizing wickedness through amongst the people,

1208
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,380
you know, like wickedness would just be normal

1209
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,680
sure and learning more about things that are

1210
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,240
hidden and doing things that you normally wouldn't

1211
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,760
do and Gathering, you know a biblical law

1212
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,560
being reinstated For a short time enough to

1213
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,080
get rid of all the sodomites and all

1214
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,620
people with tattoos You know I'm not saying

1215
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,580
you know, I'm just saying this is you

1216
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,520
know the scenario.

1217
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,560
Yeah so Yeah, this is a pretty crazy

1218
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,880
stuff, man And this is what's coming.

1219
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,500
Welcome to earth Mm-hmm Well, also, you

1220
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,820
know a lot of other groups are going

1221
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,780
to be eliminated And the ones that you

1222
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,020
will see the practices that are death offenses

1223
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,280
in Scripture or exile offenses Mm-hmm, you

1224
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,900
know what an exile offense if you're if

1225
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,440
there's an exile offense where you're exiled And

1226
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,820
if that law applies to as a constitution

1227
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,440
of a given area, well, the exile is

1228
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,180
quite possible You bring them to the edge

1229
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,760
of the border or whatever and you say

1230
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,880
you can't come back But if it's on

1231
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,480
the entire planet, where is exile?

1232
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:32,130
There is not it's you're finished So I

1233
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,470
don't think they're gonna send you up to

1234
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,530
join the Germans on the moon But anyway,

1235
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:50,300
yeah They wouldn't want them Oh,

1236
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,620
I see what he's saying The the spewed

1237
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,740
out vile words constantly one of their parents

1238
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,480
of terminal gastrointestinal illness.

1239
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:57,700
Yeah.

1240
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,680
Yeah, that's possible That's like I'm very you've

1241
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,540
heard of like even in the in the

1242
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,200
popular culture spells Mm-hmm.

1243
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,960
You know, they're actually people like that can

1244
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,300
master the The whole range of what's behind

1245
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,460
words and they're known as what's called witches

1246
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,280
or spellcasters, right?

1247
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,020
Spellcaster is just someone that is mastered as

1248
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,940
command of The way words apply to the

1249
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,720
spiritual realm which then comes back and applies

1250
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,660
to the physical realm.

1251
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,160
That's all it is that happens when you

1252
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,100
are You know projecting words towards people especially

1253
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,920
in a familial environment, you know, they'll read

1254
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,820
okay the reword the question I know of

1255
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,580
someone that spewed out vile words constantly and

1256
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,460
one of their parents developed a terminal gastrointestinal

1257
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:51,460
illness Mm-hmm Yeah, that's like just a

1258
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,640
general broadcast well because that person received it

1259
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,680
differently the way they were programmed or set

1260
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:05,840
up to receive it It's it's you know,

1261
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,140
what makes the gods the gods is their

1262
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,660
technology and it's not made in China No

1263
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,300
You know what I mean get the manual

1264
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,780
Well, we do have them.

1265
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,980
No, we don't have the manual on their

1266
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,760
technology we have the manual for us that

1267
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,300
gives us a roundabout outline of what's possible

1268
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,980
when through historic interaction and Also in history

1269
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,920
when I say historic meaning future see when

1270
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,620
you read stuff in the prophecy is history

1271
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,020
Meaning that it's so sure it's going to

1272
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,740
happen That you might as well call it,

1273
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,800
you know strike it as being done, right

1274
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,340
So it's basically later on after the resurrection

1275
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,140
even the resurrection itself is a technology and

1276
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,060
I don't mean there's a switchboard pushing buttons

1277
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,440
there could be but it's all Non-material,

1278
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,120
you know, it's not it's the same dimension.

1279
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,680
It's just within the dimension, right?

1280
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,080
So unseen to us so I I would

1281
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,180
Say one can investigate what technology the gods

1282
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,580
use but you've been blocked from it We

1283
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,080
know that it has to do with thought

1284
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,460
and all it has to do with intention.

1285
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,540
We know it has to do with words

1286
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:27,120
Yes so there you go, and if you

1287
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,140
Look at prior arts, which are dubbed negative

1288
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,080
and because they are negative In other words,

1289
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,400
if you use a knife to kill someone

1290
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,740
or use a knife to cut your dinner

1291
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
One is negative one is positive, right?

1292
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,660
So the prior art which has a negative

1293
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,200
connotation to it, which are spell casters, which

1294
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,140
is oracles, whatever They use it to gain

1295
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,580
power, you know, like the pagans do like

1296
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,240
the only reason Pagans are pagans is because

1297
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,820
they interact with their gods to get something

1298
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,640
done for them You know what I mean?

1299
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,440
Mm-hmm Whether it's battle whether it's food

1300
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,420
whether it's good weather, you know So it's

1301
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,000
hard Yeah, they know they it's for their

1302
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,880
benefit meaning either from personal one individual a

1303
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,980
family or a group all right, and they're

1304
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,320
dealing with low-level entities that are Basically

1305
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,800
not friendly and they know that you know

1306
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,680
all the time you're there's You know opposing

1307
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,440
groups working with each other for you know

1308
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,300
on a commercial level So, yeah, I mean

1309
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,000
this is there's a really I mean there's

1310
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,780
I think I've opened up enough topics over

1311
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,900
the years with Greek speak That any one

1312
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,660
of those topics whether you know, it's the

1313
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,240
human body timekeeping Scripture real, you know real

1314
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,180
physical sciences real physics Just the study of

1315
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,180
how we perceive all these things good can

1316
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,480
just be continued and and and I have

1317
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,920
continued them in many ways On my own

1318
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,000
study, but I don't see much reaction So

1319
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,460
why you know, I'm not going to be

1320
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,980
pushing and volunteering anymore.

1321
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,520
Like I said, that's why I always come

1322
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,180
on and ask for questions I mean, there's

1323
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,520
a ton of subjects that can be brought

1324
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,380
up that I haven't been that haven't brought

1325
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,680
up Like the other day I was discussing

1326
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,160
with someone.

1327
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,100
Why did why do people animals have to

1328
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,460
sleep?

1329
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,440
What what's this whole thing about sleep, you

1330
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,880
know, it's like wow, it's like no really

1331
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,440
talking about well you need to rest Well,

1332
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,880
I know that but why how why how

1333
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,900
did it you know, what would be the

1334
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,500
right you see?

1335
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,860
So I'm not gonna start a whole new.

1336
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,740
I mean guys got plenty to chew on.

1337
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,280
I Put out I put out more than

1338
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,560
some put out in the past 2,000

1339
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,980
years It's enough.

1340
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,100
This is lots of things to discuss and

1341
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,320
you know Yeah, but yeah, why guess what

1342
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,760
yeah, why bother yeah Let's see.

1343
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,420
I have noticed.

1344
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:55,760
Yes.

1345
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,240
There are a lot of demonic possession movies

1346
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,380
lately, especially this work Yes, it comes That's

1347
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,980
like I think part of the 40-year

1348
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,220
cycle like if you you know that there's

1349
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,960
a 40-year cycle on that There's a

1350
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,660
20-year and a 40-year cycle up

1351
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,140
on them Like when did the Exorcist come

1352
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,440
out, you know, it was about 40 years

1353
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,300
ago No more than 40 years ago like

1354
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,480
good.

1355
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Yeah, 45 years.

1356
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,420
Oh, and it was a big cycle and

1357
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,760
then it went away That's coming back now,

1358
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,080
but when it comes it's different now now

1359
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,280
it starts incorporating more symbolism about things You

1360
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,000
should be of known about You know, right

1361
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,940
or more Applicable to the common man where

1362
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,620
before the omen and the Exorcist were wealthy

1363
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,440
people or whatever exclusive Entitled now, it's it's

1364
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,240
gonna be more applied to the to the

1365
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,300
common Joe blue-collar, you know, right if

1366
00:55:47,300 --> 00:56:26,840
that makes any sense it does No,

1367
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm here I'm just muted out cuz I'm

1368
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,940
fiddling around with something that was noisy so

1369
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,120
oh, okay Yeah What's going on anything?

1370
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,920
Otherwise, we just call it a call that

1371
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,480
was pretty much the last of it there

1372
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,470
Yeah in the meantime, I mean, I don't

1373
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,370
know what people you know, everyone's got their

1374
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,170
own little thing whatever they're into It's just

1375
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,710
passing time Whatever you could do to pass

1376
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,070
the time You know make your life a

1377
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,010
little better in your life.

1378
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,210
I mean in a sentient way or in

1379
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,370
a in a Not philosophical.

1380
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,870
Well, I could tell you specifically how you

1381
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:06,830
should make your life better.

1382
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:07,750
You should eat better.

1383
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,450
You should sleep better You should feel better.

1384
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,070
You're you know Mm-hmm You're you should

1385
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,310
be comfortable in your clothes and in your

1386
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:23,050
dwelling Comfortable and clean That's pretty much it

1387
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,730
and then you die No, what that's like

1388
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,290
such a revelation, isn't it?

1389
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,430
That's it.

1390
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,930
There's nothing else to do man.

1391
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,250
You have other interests like for example Well,

1392
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,190
I have interest in model trains or studying

1393
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,810
this that's fine do it because time goes

1394
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,570
by faster when you do that, correct Yeah,

1395
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:45,870
this is Yep, there's not much to do.

1396
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,930
I mean depends, you know, if you if

1397
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,010
you think that, you know, even all the

1398
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,470
knowledge in the world that you can do

1399
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,330
or attain is Still gonna you're still gonna

1400
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:59,590
die and you're still susceptible to the resurrection

1401
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,630
and at that point You're at the most

1402
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,990
absolute minimum level.

1403
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,130
In other words after after that point you

1404
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,690
will see how little even the wisest had

1405
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:20,800
known right, so Pretty

1406
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,500
much sums it right up, doesn't it?

1407
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,580
Yeah Hey, yeah, it's just past the time,

1408
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,160
you know, obviously like, you know, if I'm

1409
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,460
still speaking publicly or we're still doing this

1410
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,760
In the future and things start forming, you

1411
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,100
know, what are we going to talk about?

1412
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,980
See I told you so Right.

1413
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,340
I mean, what are you gonna say?

1414
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,900
I mean, what would we okay?

1415
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,680
This is happening.

1416
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,460
That's so what?

1417
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,580
You know the the real reason for knowing

1418
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,280
really if you and I've mentioned this before

1419
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,680
Is to make it easier for the other

1420
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,640
side, which is a higher side by the

1421
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,820
way To do what they have to do

1422
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,320
and they will use you for it So

1423
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,140
like one of the example the reason I

1424
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,540
say what I do is to make it

1425
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,920
easier for the other side to do What

1426
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,200
they have to do So because they will

1427
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,940
not come and begin doing what they have

1428
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,120
to do meaning, you know To wrap this

1429
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,300
era of humankind up unless humankind has an

1430
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,140
inkling of why it's going to happen, right?

1431
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,380
All right, like when someone is lined up

1432
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,900
against the wall to be shot by the

1433
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,820
authorities They read this the the charges the

1434
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,220
counts and the sentencing all over again So

1435
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,520
they have to be a cognizant not like,

1436
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,840
you know, I don't agree with that.

1437
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,480
No at that point You're you know, you

1438
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,040
see what I mean?

1439
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,320
so mankind has to know why the asteroids

1440
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,580
are going to hit why their Population is

1441
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,060
going to be reduced to know, you know

1442
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,640
5% of what it is now Why

1443
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,100
And they don't have to know it and

1444
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,080
put up a billboard.

1445
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,020
They just have to admit it for a

1446
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,940
second not much So when I tell you

1447
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,740
that if this society is completely unlawful, basically

1448
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,380
you're run by criminals and which makes this

1449
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,680
whole society criminal Literally criminal not just a

1450
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,000
figurative adjective or whatever from a lawful perspective

1451
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,940
And I'll tell you why exactly why not

1452
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,740
just accuse it in accusatory tone But lay

1453
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,860
it out that now the guilt is on

1454
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,160
you You see.

1455
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,280
Mm-hmm So when you tell people, you

1456
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,040
know birthday cake represents eating human children Well,

1457
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,200
I you know, like I don't believe that

1458
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,980
well, and I'm gonna keep doing well Did

1459
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,740
you hear what I said the moment they

1460
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,540
say yes, what did I say?

1461
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,000
And they repeat it then that's it.

1462
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:31,820
Your job is done.

1463
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,860
That person is ready to go next You're

1464
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,820
not gonna in other words I haven't said

1465
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,680
it quite this way before When you tell

1466
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,260
people about lawfully and who the creator is

1467
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,020
and what real law is or what they're

1468
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,780
doing wrong Don't expect to change what you

1469
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,840
need to expect is some kind of a

1470
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,720
response.

1471
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,880
This is imperative This is why it's done

1472
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,380
that they acknowledged what you said not acknowledged

1473
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,140
the in a factual way in a repentive

1474
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,020
kind of way or any you know, in

1475
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,780
other words the terminus the the final point

1476
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,760
of the or of the interaction is that

1477
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,900
they understood and heard you You're done then

1478
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,820
that your job is to go to the

1479
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,300
next one because that one's ready to go

1480
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,820
now You know what?

1481
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,720
I mean, right?

1482
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,760
He's ready to go so, you know when

1483
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,740
the time comes it's fully, you know, it's

1484
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,780
fully up This one's got the green light,

1485
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,040
you know to get that, you know, the

1486
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,000
head cut off right you see right because

1487
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:37,000
he heard it Yeah, you just basically Letting

1488
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,840
them know what they're guilty of this is

1489
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,860
very it's in Leviticus, you know I said

1490
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,140
first chapter if you see your brother doing

1491
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,740
wrong and He doesn't know it he's not

1492
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,420
he's not culpable right he's not Responsibly, but

1493
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,000
once you tell him what he did and

1494
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,340
why it's wrong now, he's responsible so telling

1495
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,780
people About the birthday cake is you know,

1496
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,600
it's not good.

1497
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,540
That doesn't help All right, that doesn't help

1498
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:02,980
him is it?

1499
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:07,340
The birthday cake is humans resembles human sacrifice

1500
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,300
and it's not good It's unlawful and it's

1501
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,260
very negative very bad thing that you know,

1502
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,880
you right I've seen some people just say

1503
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,280
well, that's no I don't do that because

1504
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,460
it's not good and they kind of like,

1505
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,620
okay fine That that didn't do anything Right.

1506
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:20,840
Yes.

1507
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,300
Tell them why it's right What the what

1508
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,680
these religions are doing is demonic and why?

1509
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,440
Why because the demons are the ones that

1510
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,600
control the institutions and that's how they control

1511
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,900
the people through the institutions and the guy

1512
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,080
up There is lying to you every religion.

1513
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,440
They're all lying to the people Contrary to

1514
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,200
what's in them you tell them why and

1515
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,520
it doesn't matter what they say What matters

1516
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,520
is that you it's like the sticker There

1517
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,320
was a film that I saw where they

1518
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,500
put this red dot this this creature put

1519
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,180
a red whatever put the red dot would

1520
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,380
explode When he hits the button, all right,

1521
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,920
they had a red dot on it, right?

1522
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,080
So basically you walk around these red dots

1523
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,760
you just put it's okay, but the red

1524
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,800
dot won't stick unless they acknowledge What you

1525
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,840
said not if they change So they're not

1526
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,300
going to change They're they're horrible people not

1527
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,780
because I say so Scripture says so so

1528
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:22,880
anyway The reason why there's Greek speak and

1529
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,320
the reason why you should tell you the

1530
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,160
thing is follow through things I have very

1531
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,800
rarely.

1532
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,780
I mean like Bruce.

1533
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,080
I don't know you well enough I don't

1534
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,520
know what you do in your personal life

1535
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,340
But but generally the people that I have

1536
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:36,240
seen been around no one can articulate what

1537
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,100
I'm saying So that to me tells me

1538
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,000
it's time not time yet or whatever and

1539
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,460
even if you're when I say articulate I

1540
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,040
mean just regurgitation just repeating exactly what I'm

1541
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,360
saying.

1542
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,060
They can't do it.

1543
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,940
They can't follow through.

1544
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,700
I've seen people try it I'm like that

1545
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,700
didn't make any sense is what they look

1546
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,900
at me and they're like, well, you know

1547
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,040
what?

1548
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,520
I mean, I said, I know what you

1549
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,020
mean, but the person you just talked to

1550
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,620
doesn't you didn't articulate it This whole thing

1551
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,400
is a failure in terms of you know

1552
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,100
Promote you're not promoting but then not Greek

1553
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,160
speak but promoting what's in Greek speak, you

1554
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,580
know Yeah, the reason I was talking to

1555
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,220
someone says oh, I think you're better than

1556
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,240
me I said, no, I'm not better than

1557
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
you but my information and my knowledge definitely

1558
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,920
is for sure What I know is better

1559
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,840
than we what you know But I'm not

1560
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,140
better.

1561
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,540
You see if they can't just they can't

1562
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,720
separate that right?

1563
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,240
That's because they're stuck in the idolatry mode

1564
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,420
What I mean by that is like, you

1565
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,700
know When you when you have like a

1566
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,560
football star or a movie star walk into

1567
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,760
the room Mm-hmm.

1568
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,400
That person is better than everyone else to

1569
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,120
the pagan to the idolater, right?

1570
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,220
They're everything about them is better.

1571
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,720
So can I have your shoelace?

1572
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,740
well, you know they find out where a

1573
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,760
Movie star lives and they take some of

1574
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,480
his grass or some of his bushes to

1575
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,340
see that from his house, right?

1576
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,940
This is the stupidity the idolater, you know

1577
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,500
In other words the right proper thing is

1578
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,700
this movie star?

1579
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,620
Whatever probably makes more credits than you and

1580
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,880
is more known and more liked than you

1581
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,460
But he's not better than you but the

1582
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,120
average human doesn't see it that way.

1583
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,240
They're a star They're a god amongst men,

1584
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,540
you know, I mean, you know, I'm talking

1585
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,740
about like the president through or the whatever

1586
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,040
Kardashians or I don't know what the hell

1587
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,700
people or it does stupid shit.

1588
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,480
They idolize these days They're not better than

1589
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,720
you.

1590
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,900
They have a better social position.

1591
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,800
They have make more credits than you the

1592
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,720
various things perhaps But they're not better.

1593
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,060
They don't see it that way, right?

1594
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,040
You see so right away when you start

1595
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,760
Charlie they see what you're saying as a

1596
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,740
chance they think right away Oh, you're not

1597
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:38,620
worth being idolized You see no That's not

1598
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,620
the point the point is do you see

1599
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,120
You know a superior way of thinking a

1600
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,960
superior way of eating a superior way of

1601
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,280
speaking a superior way of acting or interacting

1602
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:58,840
Why bother Separation is so much easier Yes,

1603
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,140
but when you do interact with these idiots

1604
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,960
make sure you have some follow-through meaning

1605
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,860
right the follow-through means that when you

1606
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,240
say like for example, the This is unlawful.

1607
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,660
Do you have to tell them wives?

1608
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,380
It's a lawful.

1609
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:12,900
I don't do it.

1610
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,900
No, never mind that you didn't They didn't

1611
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,360
get that little red dot on them.

1612
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,260
That's gonna you know, you're not making the

1613
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,200
angels job any easier You know what?

1614
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,440
I mean?

1615
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,840
So the whole thing is to make the

1616
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,600
the the Let them understand what's lawful and

1617
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,200
unlawful.

1618
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,020
So the angels get the green light like

1619
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,620
hey, this guy's telling people what's off and

1620
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,660
unlawful So they're done already.

1621
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,460
We have the green light on these assholes,

1622
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,140
you know what I mean?

1623
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,500
Instead of we have to wait her but

1624
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,760
this is already pre time.

1625
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,080
I'm not saying that you're gonna change it

1626
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,560
I'm just saying, you know, this is the

1627
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,980
way it works, right?

1628
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,260
I don't really get that opportunity at the

1629
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:06,520
job So I Just stay separated from it

1630
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,020
all at that point I don't think it's

1631
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,260
an opportunity to be sought after but for

1632
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,060
several reasons One is you know, you have

1633
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,680
to interact with these idiots The other thing

1634
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,300
is, you know, you might get to your

1635
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,960
head thinking that what you're doing is More

1636
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,200
correct to the point that now you really

1637
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,400
start seeing them as inferior to you You

1638
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,000
know, it's a very slippery slope.

1639
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,800
It is it is no, I don't see

1640
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,700
people as being inferior I see them as

1641
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,020
being morons idiots scumbags assholes, whatever.

1642
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,700
That doesn't mean they're inferior You see what

1643
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:38,900
I mean?

1644
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,360
That's it.

1645
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,080
That's a deaf.

1646
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,640
That's a character problem that they have in

1647
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,260
other words You could rip out one person's

1648
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,480
kidney.

1649
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,860
Let's say if they have the same blood

1650
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,280
type and put it in another they're not

1651
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:56,300
inferior Right, right It's it's sad it's a

1652
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,340
very sad state But the facts are this

1653
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,540
is what it is that the higher on

1654
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,920
a higher level and if you want to

1655
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,560
get to the higher Level, which even makes

1656
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,760
you want to separate even more is that

1657
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,320
things are the way they are because of

1658
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,240
divine beings period Right the people.

1659
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,260
I mean, are you gonna blame a chess

1660
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:18,479
piece For being on the wrong square No

1661
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,640
But it does get taken off the board

1662
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,020
though.

1663
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,140
Oh You see it does it is the

1664
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,460
one that's making the moves and Eliminated or

1665
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,140
move forward.

1666
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,060
That's people.

1667
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,399
You're just chess pieces, but then again, I've

1668
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,420
discussed the the finer aspects I believe of

1669
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,580
what free will is Not ultra fine, but

1670
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,140
finer aspects of it right, so You do

1671
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,300
have free will enough.

1672
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:47,680
In other words people know so little that

1673
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,399
They know that they have free will based

1674
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,060
on what they know In other words the

1675
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,620
average human even a very smart human knows

1676
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,540
so little about reality That that little that

1677
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,040
they know which is a lot compared to

1678
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,700
others Let's say it's still not enough to

1679
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,120
let them know that there are constraints.

1680
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,460
In other words, they don't know about the

1681
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,660
gods They don't know real history.

1682
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:09,020
They don't know how the mind works or

1683
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,319
the body.

1684
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,680
So they see everything as being random Even

1685
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,439
if they're of higher education, let's say and

1686
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:17,939
they feel like they have complete free will

1687
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:22,300
or really you don't You see right?

1688
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:27,120
so in other words Look, the people that

1689
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,680
study scripture like to argue sometimes about is

1690
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,220
there free will or is there not and

1691
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,340
it's not an argument It's do let's examine

1692
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,359
The aspects that listed in scripture for example

1693
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,939
on what free will is now Let's examine

1694
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:42,939
the aspects of what predestination is and then

1695
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:46,560
reckon them together not oppose them one or

1696
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,220
the other Like it says don't murder.

1697
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,920
But how come there's so many death penalty

1698
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,040
offenses if you're trivial and Uneducated you're gonna

1699
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,560
see that as a schizophrenic psychotic thing You

1700
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,500
see right, but if you're if you look

1701
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,760
at it Why does it say don't murder

1702
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,520
and then why does it say have a

1703
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,240
death defense and you start analyzing?

1704
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,600
You know it the scripture is not going

1705
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,280
to tell you that they're opposing each other

1706
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,680
or they're for each other just The two

1707
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,060
realities co-exist Right, you see, you know

1708
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,240
I mean, why is there an animal sacrifice

1709
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,220
to be and why does it another place

1710
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,940
to say anytime you even just touch a

1711
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:25,420
dead animal?

1712
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,140
You're unclean.

1713
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,020
Well, how does that work out again?

1714
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,120
Not just take one blunt side on educate

1715
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,820
like the you know Religious people do or

1716
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,080
even the academics are bluntly stupid like that.

1717
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,140
That's why the people are stupid because they

1718
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,440
look at those morons So and then once

1719
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,360
you can ponder that and you could leave

1720
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,400
everything that you think you know about it

1721
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,260
at the door and start fresh Then you

1722
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,700
start then you're on the path of what's

1723
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,860
known as knowledge and wisdom Because the wisdom

1724
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,680
is to be able to learn how to

1725
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,800
regulate what you know And if it's useful

1726
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,740
or useless towards this new learning path, that's

1727
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,840
really the wisdom in it You know like

1728
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,180
a fool would say well, I thought they

1729
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,040
told me this in church.

1730
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,140
So this subject is closed I know it

1731
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,020
because they told me in church.

1732
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,160
Well, that's a fool Right, it's right away.

1733
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,780
He's using a foolish something that doesn't even

1734
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,040
belong a Church, right?

1735
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,600
This doesn't belong anywhere in the thing To

1736
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,380
garner you see where a wise person would

1737
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,620
say yeah, I know it's all I got

1738
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,640
a star all over I go I got

1739
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,520
to do when I have the time Where

1740
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,500
I got I can't do it alone.

1741
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,560
I have to do it with someone else

1742
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,020
or I better make sure that I You

1743
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:31,420
see get organized for it or whatever Most

1744
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,100
people are too foolish you know, I Mean

1745
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,280
they still have elections.

1746
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,680
I mean, what a scam.

1747
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,020
I mean you still have Christmas.

1748
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,060
What a scam.

1749
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,140
Yeah What a scam everything that they're doing

1750
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:50,480
it look so having elections Yeah, and Thursday

1751
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,160
that which is you it has to be

1752
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,600
every Thursday because it honors Thor you slay

1753
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,880
a winged beast Yeah, but the thing that

1754
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,780
still because they just had what they called

1755
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,540
the midterm elections in the US and all

1756
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,000
over the world I'm sure in other places

1757
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,580
that The very fact that the the governments

1758
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,700
are having elections is like they're rubbing your

1759
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,840
nose and shit and saying you are so

1760
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,160
fucking stupid That it's been over a hundred

1761
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,600

No schools Demonology for religion.

1770
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,240
screwed up?

1771
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,160
That is beyond you couldn't write a fantasy

1772
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,420
science fiction novel.

1773
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,380
That is as bad as a horror movie.

1774
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,080
It's that is what's going on Not just

1775
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,440
in the US every country.

1776
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:54,840
Yeah so Yeah, it's just yeah anyway Wow,

1777
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,140
and they're just accommodating the moron and the

1778
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:57,900
moron loves it.

1779
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,180
That's all that's what I observe You know,

1780
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,480
and the reason why they're a moron is

1781
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,220
not relevant at this point because they ain't

1782
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,980
gonna change You know why you fell off

1783
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,420
the bicycle and scrap, you know why you

1784
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,940
You know, you got a the child has

1785
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,180
a you know What a scab on his

1786
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:16,720
knee or whatever?

1787
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,600
Well, it's not as important as treating it

1788
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,080
once it happens, you know Did he get

1789
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,540
it falling down the stairs or off of

1790
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,120
the bicycle or he slipped on I so

1791
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,480
whatever it is It not as irrelevant as

1792
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,300
treating that so right now you see the

1793
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,280
morons around you.

1794
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,940
You can't treat them They're untreatable Right.

1795
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,740
That's what I mean.

1796
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,260
Now if you want to go back and

1797
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:38,360
rehash how they got there You're gonna see

1798
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,440
they're really untreatable.

1799
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,780
Yeah, you see pretty much a close It's

1800
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,960
a closed-loop thing.

1801
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,960
It's just yeah, just put it out on

1802
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,580
the curb Well for the garbage truck come

1803
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,180

years or less Okay, I don't know if

1805
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,460
there's anything else I mean that was the

1806
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,360
good news I guess yeah, and it seems

1807
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,940
to be very similar You know, why bother

01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,780
you pass the time Thanks gents got any

1811
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:17,500
good tips for making pierogi I do pierogies.

1812
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,860
Yeah, that's like a dumpling.

1813
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:19,560
Basically.

1814
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:27,600
It's a Thanks, yeah pierogies I like You

1815
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,600
can that's a flatbread recipe if you remember

1816
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,840
the just Basically liquid and flour of some

1817
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,420
type And a filling, you know roll it

1818
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,620
out obviously and they let it relax roll

1819
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,060
it out again and put your filling in

1820
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:46,500
there use a appropriate cutter and Fold it

1821
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,440
over pinch it roll it over and dunk

1822
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,340
it in water and pierogies are very simple

1823
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,660
Yeah, you get most of your flavors from

1824
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,260
like dumplings and pasta You know things that

1825
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,960
you cook in water and then strain out

1826
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,480
of the water when the water is flavored

1827
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,780
Like if I want to make a delicious

1828
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,620
pasta You know like regular, you know, that's

1829
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,560
different than rice because rice you're relying on

1830
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,360
the absorption All the whatever flavor you put

1831
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,340
in in rice water, let's say for cooking

1832
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,740
when you Are finished with the dish?

1833
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,420
There's no draining of the rice, right?

1834
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,620
It's it's in fully the liquids fully incorporated,

1835
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:24,980
right?

1836
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,120
right, but when you're doing pasta or dumplings

1837
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,180
or raviolis or Anything that's parboiled or anything

1838
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:36,120
like that What you're doing is You're using

1839
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,140
the water to cook it.

1840
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,220
It's a wet cook, right?

1841
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,380
Steaming can be done sometimes as well But

1842
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,200
in this case the water the liquid will

1843
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,260
impart flavor So what I do for example,

1844
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,460
let's say I want to make a delicious

1845
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,380
pasta whether it's store-bought dry pasta or

1846
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,500
fresh pasta We you know, which means a

1847
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,880
minute cooking two minutes cooking versus ten minutes

1848
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,320
because it's dehydrated What I do is I

1849
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,380
keep celery stalks around or cuttings from carrots

1850
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,940
You know if I and I just throw

1851
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,920
the veg the you just the celery stalk

1852
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,120
you just break it So it fits in

1853
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,980
the pot don't chop it up because then

1854
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,060
you're gonna have to try to fish it

1855
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,540
out But just throw it in the pot

1856
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,960
throw put the water and that whatever you

1857
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,060
put in there is gonna infuse flavor in

1858
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,360
the pasta Like if you have if you're

1859
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,100
doing a meat dish, you could throw bones

1860
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:22,840
in there, right?

1861
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,260
Lamb bones or whatever to infuse the water

1862
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:30,620
with something, you know Vegetable is the best

1863
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,280
for pasta.

1864
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,160
So Another thing you can do is if

1865
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,260
you have let's say an abundant amount of

1866
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:36,680
sauce.

1867
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,680
It's a doing a red tomato sauce Start

1868
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,780
with a lower level of water in the

1869
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:45,300
pasta throw a couple of tablespoons of tomato

1870
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,440
sauce in the water or tomato paste and

1871
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,740
Cook it like that and then add your

1872
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,900
water have a kettle or another pot on

1873
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,320
the side So as the pasta if it's

1874
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,200
not fresh pasta Begins to cook you you

1875
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,180
subsequently add more water to increase level, you

1876
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,940
know, you always add hot water to hot

1877
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:01,500
water, right?

1878
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,500
so if you have a Let's say you're

1879
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,140
cooking a stew or something need to add

1880
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,540
more water Don't go over to the sink

1881
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,500
or your bottled water and put cold room

1882
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,060
temp You bring it up to temp and

1883
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,380
then put it in right so it doesn't

1884
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,860
disturb the cooking cycle, right?

1885
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,360
It will taste different by the way.

1886
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,200
I've experimented years ago.

1887
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,620
Let's say you have a stew or something

1888
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,560
cooking You know do an experiment when you

1889
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,940
add the the non boiling water to it

1890
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,420
or simmered water it will change the dish

1891
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,140
So yeah hot to hot cold to cold,

1892
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,640
you know temp It's a form of tempering

1893
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,240
if you never if you're gonna add eggs

1894
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,600
to a dish make sure they're a room

1895
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,200
temperature or better You always add a tablespoon

1896
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,140
of the hot liquid to the eggs whip

1897
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,380
it again and then put them, you know

1898
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,280
tempering You know have the meat in the

1899
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,840
middle Instead of adding a cold liquid to

1900
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
a hot or a hot to a cold

1901
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,700
have them Gradually, you know meet in the

1902
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,120
middle a little bit more than just shocking,

1903
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,100
right?

1904
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,760
Yeah, yeah most of the Anyone can learn

1905
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,780
about cooking anything on what's called a recipe

1906
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,220
Mentality, but I found that it's like one

1907
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,340
of a thousand people are good at it

1908
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,800
at cooking You know, is it talent?

1909
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:10,260
Hmm?

1910
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,580
I don't know Jack Fresco does that really

1911
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,800
good with the drawing thing?

1912
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,100
You know, you could take a five-year

1913
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,000
-old and show them the technique of scale

1914
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,380
And he draws like an artist everyone should

1915
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,240
be doing because I see adults still try

1916
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,140
to do sketches and looks like children It's

1917
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:23,820
not to be blamed.

1918
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,520
Well, how dare you know, it looks shameful.

1919
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,980
You're an adult You can't drop but they

1920
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,880
never got the training and the worst thing

1921
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,260
you can do is the children when they

1922
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,780
just do their four Five years old in

1923
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:31,920
school.

1924
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,500
They pass out crayons and draw.

1925
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,320
What do you mean draw drawing is a

1926
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:35,620
skill?

1927
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,720
It's like they never they don't know what

1928
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,980
the game of baseball is and they just

1929
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,900
throw a bunch of bats and balls and

1930
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,040
Gloves in the middle of the field go

1931
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,680
play play what we don't know the rules

1932
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,240
of the game.

1933
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,200
What's going on, right?

1934
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,040
We don't know we'll play what so when

1935
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,380
they the worst thing is they give the

1936
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,160
children the crayon paper draw and they draw

1937
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,780

it.

They don't know about seasonality They don't know

1947
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,720
about skimming off the top of liquids.

1948
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,000
They don't know about tempering.

No, well, I don't know.

1952
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,260
No one ever showed me Like wow, it

1953
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,380
should be required within the society It should

1954
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,540
be part of the common parlance whenever you're

1955
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,780
communicating with someone or asking someone to do

1956
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,180
something You should have also integrated somehow in

1957
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:28,280
your society either even if it's written or

1958
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,780
not some training for it Yeah, I was

1959
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,860
always studies titles Yeah, I was always stunned

1960
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,400
and amazed how little training you get to

1961
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,220
do quote-unquote driving a car with you

1962
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,760
know A car is a five three four

1963
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,580
five thousand pounds of steel and glass hurled

1964
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,080
down the road.

1965
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,460
It's a weapon You know, it's a horrible

1966
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,880
thing If it goes out of control and

1967
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,780
the minute amount of training and the flakes

1968
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,780
literal Flakes and and just insane people that

1969
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:54,560
are allowed to do it.

1970
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,300
It's just shocking You know, I used to

1971
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,460
whenever it would I used to be on

1972
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,080
roundtables with Seth on that idiot radio station

1973
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,900
Whatever radio Not AFR the other one People

1974
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,380
who come in with comments Greek, I always

1975
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,080
wanna make a comment.

1976
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,160
I don't agree.

1977
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,120
But I said whatever the subject was Sometimes

1978
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,020
I'd say do you do you drive a

1979
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,280
car?

1980
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,360
And they're like, yeah, I do.

1981
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,380
I said well, that's freaking scary man There's

1982
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,780
someone what that mindset is behind a wheel.

1983
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:23,420
Never mind.

1984
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,220
So what does that have to do with

1985
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:25,680
blah blah blah?

1986
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,260
It is it has a lot to do

1987
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,700
with it It's scary that you're allowed to

1988
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,700
behind the wheel of a car with that

1989
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,620
kind of mindset so anyway Yeah, all right

1990
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:37,940
