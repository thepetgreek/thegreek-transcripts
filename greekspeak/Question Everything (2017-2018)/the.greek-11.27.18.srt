1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,140
Good evening folks, we're live with the Greek,

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,300
and good evening Greek, and how are you

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,100
doing tonight sir?

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,720
All right, good evening, it's another week, Teriyaki

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,520
Tuesdays, right?

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,160
Teriyaki Tuesdays, yeah.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,840
What they call the Pope's work schedule.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,740
You know, it's funny because I have, I've

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,280
got all kinds of animals, and the meat

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,040
eaters, on the meat eaters I do what

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,360
I call Teriyaki Tuesdays, it's literally, I just

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,140
go to Walmart and get a big 10

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,940
pound bag of chicken, and lightly cook it

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,940
with honey, garlic, ginger, and tamari, or soy

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,740
sauce, and just lightly cook it, slightly, and

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,560
feed it to the meat eaters, right?

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,480
So, it's kind of like a joke, yeah,

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,840
and they know it, when you say Teriyaki

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
Tuesdays, they're like, oh yeah, where?

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,320
It's not Tuesday, you know?

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,780
We don't use that crap, you know, that

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,080
time schedule anyway, so.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,660
So you know, whenever I'm doing the sonic

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,600
event, it's somewhere in the background I'm preparing

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,880
Teriyaki meat, animal meat, for the animal eaters.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,340
That's a hard thing, by the way, for

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,140
those that want to just be totally clean

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,160
all the time, scripturally speaking, if you have

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,880
a carnivorous animal pet, you're going to be

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,300
touching, you know, meat to feed them, on

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,560
a daily basis, so, unless you have someone

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
else feed them, and then you sound like

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
the orthodox Jews that try to get around

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,900
their days off by getting someone else to

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,960
do what they have to do, right?

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,780
But I usually, like the bird feeders, I

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,440
call them cat feeders, because you load the

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,460
bird feeder and the cats get fed, and

39
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,540
you don't put the bird feeder really high,

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,900
you put it like two feet from the

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,400
ground, right?

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,940
Sure.

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Because it's not a bird feeder, it's a

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,880
cat feeder.

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,840
Correct.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
And I've counted a couple of birds a

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,620
day, you know, and they eat the whole

48
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,360
bird, the entire thing, feathers, everything, you know?

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,720
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah, the beak, the bones, everything, completely.

51
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,500
Not very different energetically than when you eat

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,560
an egg, you're pretty much eating the entire

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
bird, yeah, energetically.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,820
So let's see, another week, what's going on,

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,200
we could make it a really short one,

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,720
I went back here, I posted something on

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,240
the tribal people, I think Apollo posted something

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,340
regarding a Christian missionary being shot up with

59
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,980
arrows by a protected island, a tribal island,

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,040
isolated.

61
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,460
Yeah, that happens all the time.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,100
By the way, I think I've discussed publicly,

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,360
or on Skype enough, a lot of the

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,120
African quote unquote continent, because Africa is not

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
a country, it's a continent, and a lot

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,460
of the brutal dictators were into that, okay,

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,140
a lot of the brutality, Sam's the ones

68
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,160
that were put on brutality by the Europeans,

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,740
the Dutch, the Belgian, French, and English, you

70
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,780
know, like, you've heard of the country Rhodesia,

71
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,680
that's named after Cecil Rhodes, right?

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,980
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,520
Rhodesia is from Cecil Rhodes, so you actually

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,340
have a private guy, wealthy guy, that actually

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,600
owns a country, you know, no big deal,

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:30,840
right?

77
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,240
Right.

78
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,360
But a lot of the other guys were

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,400
highly educated in the spiritual realm, and when

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,420
they saw Christian missionaries come to their country,

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,220
they knew what Christianity was, not what everyone

82
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,200
thinks it is, it's a form of demonology,

83
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,340
and they would just hack these missionaries to

84
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,000
pieces, right?

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Wouldn't you, if you had a demonologist come

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,700
into your country, and you were allowed to

87
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,180
do so?

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, so it's no big deal.

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,420
All the religions are based on demonology, and

90
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,680
people don't know that, that's why it's best

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,420
to set yourself apart, but I posted something

92
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,800
about the Rook tribe, because I was familiar

93
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,900
with...

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,720
Fascinating little subject there, wow.

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,100
Yeah, I knew those guys, well, from being

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,880
around Vietnamese people for years, and partaking in

97
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,340
some business with them, they're quite interesting.

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,000
By the way, Vietnamese people are quite interesting,

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,480
they're like, you know how you have that

100
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,900
superficial politeness, whenever they meet an American, they're

101
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,820
like, oh yeah, my father and grandfather helped

102
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,760
the Americans in the war, that's what they

103
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,480
tell everyone, but when you get to know

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,280
them, and you have, they love to drink

105
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,940
by the way, well, who doesn't, but you

106
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,320
know, you bring like expensive whiskey, and it's

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,900
like, oh yeah, we're having a party, well,

108
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,380
when you get a couple of drinks, and

109
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,680
they're like, oh no, we used to hunt

110
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Americans using the same tools we hunt pigs

111
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,700
with, we made bamboo spears, and traps, and

112
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,860
snares, and you catch them just like you

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,240
catch the pig in the forest.

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,920
Sure.

115
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,540
So anyway, so I knew, because I knew

116
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,500
something was fishy, but you know, a little

117
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,260
bit of honesty goes a long way, and

118
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,440
it's like, okay, great, that presumption is now

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,560
a fact, at least from them, you know,

120
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,440
so yeah, so there you go guys, with

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,200
that, so the Rook people are very interesting,

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,660
that article touches on a little bit, they

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,740
also do dream spells and all that, now,

124
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,320
here's the interesting part, when you read scripture,

125
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,280
you're supposed to avoid that, because you're protected

126
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,860
by Yahweh, and he's addressing the people that

127
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,640
he became a god for, where all the

128
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,440
other, well, he has no allegiance to protect

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,420
us in where we are now, because we're

130
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,260
not in that time, so you draw a

131
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,420
conclusion by, well, how much faith do I

132
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,360
have in him, or do I see that

133
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,520
technically he's not protecting me, and I need

134
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,320
to get witchcraft as a weapon, in a

135
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,020
modern day society, you see what I mean,

136
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,560
it's very tempting to think that, that's the

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,180
truth, by the way, you have to make

138
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,860
that choice, but what you're going to find

139
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,920
out is, if you do make the choice

140
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,720
for witchcraft as a weapon, in the modern

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,340
society, wherever you live, in Dakota, California, New

142
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,560
York, Arizona, it doesn't matter, Iraq, right now,

143
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
it will give you a tremendous amount of

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,460
power here, but you're going to be called

145
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,500
on it later, right now, you'll probably be

146
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,680
left powerless, literally, the creator has thrown pretty

147
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,820
much everyone to the wolves, you dog me,

148
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,160
but later, you'll be rewarded for it, so

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,040
I know, don't take my word for it,

150
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,740
I'm just saying it because that's the truth,

151
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,080
no one speaks about it that way, so

152
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,640
you have to make that choice, and it's

153
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,880
like Mishraq Shabnack and Abedinigo in the Book

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,260
of Daniel, when they didn't bow down to

155
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,480
the statue and they were threatened to be

156
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,520
thrown into the fire, they were like, yeah,

157
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,320
our god can save us from your fire,

158
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,180
but if he chooses not to, that's still

159
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,940
okay with us, right?

160
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,920
So, you know, that's the real reality, but,

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,960
you know, I've seen there are levels of

162
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
protection, but not directly like you do with

163
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,460
the magic, right?

164
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,340
And I'm not saying you should do it,

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,160
but hey, if you want to do it

166
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,900
and give a demonstration, by all means, I'm

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,720
not promoting it myself, or I don't think

168
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
anyone should really do it for the reason

169
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,720
I gave, but if you want to promote

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,460
it and put a YouTube video up instead

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,360
of all the crap that's on there, go

172
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,440
for it, you know, if you're already compromised,

173
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:24,820
you know?

174
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, that other video that you put up

175
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,500
a while back, there, Raka.

176
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,280
Oh, that you, I think you posted it,

177
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,480
I think I mentioned it, yeah, well that's

178
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,140
what's going on right now in reality, spiritually,

179
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,260
not physically, you're being destroyed spiritually by an

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,640
entities, entities, by the way, that have been

181
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,180
unleashed, but you don't notice it, you see

182
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,740
the results of it, I'll give you an

183
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,560
example, since we're on magic and all that

184
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,300
stuff, even on a pop level, a superficial

185
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,600
level, what they call Satanism, you know, it's

186
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,140
magic and human sacrifice, especially children and all

187
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,440
that, you go do the slightest amount of

188
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,220
research, when they do their rituals and child

189
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,900
abuse and all that, the assailants do gender

190
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,640
bending, gender switching, so if you're a male,

191
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,860
you dress like a woman, and if you're

192
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,920
a woman, you dress like a man, actually,

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,460
if you look up the Aquino and the

194
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,420
Anton LaVey, you know, the OTO, you'll see

195
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
photographs of them doing that, the man dresses

196
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,940
like a woman, okay, so when you see

197
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,460
these transgenders running around, guess what they're doing?

198
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
They're reviving that occult ritual, they don't know

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,539
it, but the occultists know it, you know,

200
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,340
the people that sacrifice children, the males dress

201
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,740
like women and the women dress like males

202
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,580
during the ritual, and when they turn on

203
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,280
the TV and they see the political system,

204
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,300
the administration giving permission for people to do

205
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,580
it and they'll protect them to do it,

206
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,040
they're clapping their hands, they're like, yeah, great,

207
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,140
finally, this occult, you know, quote unquote, which

208
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,860
is not Satanic magic, it's a form of

209
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,400
Baal worship, is now unleashed on society, it's

210
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,240
in your face, it's just no one sees

211
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,220
it that way because they don't, they're stupid,

212
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,940
you see what I mean?

213
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,480
It's very simple, I just said, you could

214
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,260
look it up, so the gays, the homos,

215
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,620
the sodomites, whatever you want to call them,

216
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,800
the transgenders are actually part of what you

217
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,380
call a modern Satanic cult, but it's not

218
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,200
really Satanic, Satan doesn't screw around like that,

219
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,700
it's various revived God and goddess religions that

220
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,140
are from various parts of the world, the

221
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,700
real Satanism, like the big governments, your institutions,

222
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,240
your medical industry, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, that's the

223
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,840
heavy-duty Satanism, the mainstream religions, you know,

224
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,240
the big juggernaut, the Titanic's class is Satanism,

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,460
you know, all your main things that you

226
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,240
subscribe to, the banking system is Satanic, right?

227
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,520
But the stuff that people call Satanic is

228
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,140
not Satanic, it's actually revived lower demons and

229
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,020
gods, right?

230
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,500
So anyway, right away you lose everybody with

231
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,360
that fact or truth of the matter, so

232
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,200
there's no escaping it, but there is a

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,240
way to exist, not even coexist, but you

234
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,680
exist by setting yourself apart from it, as

235
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,820
best you can, even though knowingly in the

236
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,360
back of your mind, just because let's say

237
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,980
hypothetically someone says, well, I study scripture and

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,020
I want to lead you to the Creator,

239
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,900
it doesn't mean you're still not dog meat

240
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,280
here, right?

241
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,780
99% of you will be dog meat,

242
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,140
I can almost assure you of that, but

243
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:45,240
by pure statistics, so if you want that

244
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,600
kind of power, it's all now, the greed,

245
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,240
need, fear and loss.

246
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,040
Greed, need, fear and loss is what you,

247
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,880
when you make an advertisement, you see the

248
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,440
old late night TV ads with the non

249
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,220
-stick pans, oh, don't you hate when you,

250
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,940
egg sticks to the pan, oh, no, don't

251
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,440
you want to always have a perfect egg,

252
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,640
yeah, you know, aren't you afraid of this

253
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,420
happening, no, so buy this right now, wait,

254
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,380
order now, and for the price of it

255
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,980
we'll give you two, right, greed, right?

256
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,840
Greed, need, fear and loss.

257
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah, and for five dollars, five bucks, I'll

258
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
give you yesterday's lottery numbers.

259
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,880
Exactly.

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,360
All right, we're going off the chat, which

261
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,340
is the new Greek-speak chatango, Nathan Brisk

262
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,040
podcast feed updated, okay, I see Nathan had

263
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,520
put up something regarding, oh, he's doing what

264
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,400
you're doing, but on a RSS or something,

265
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,140
is that what it is?

266
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,780
Podcast.

267
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll just click on it, yeah, okay, it's

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,460
a question everything, yeah, okay, would like to

269
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,200
get some new audio monitors, and you say

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
design some that will hit the market soon,

271
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,600
no, not really, yes, but no, it's really

272
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,860
the way of dealing with sound, what I

273
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,040
do is I do build loudspeakers, but loudspeakers

274
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,900
are like buying tires for a car, so

275
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,640
if you have like a Yugo or a

276
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,120
Ford Pinto, you get a different set of

277
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,020
tires than if you have a Ferrari or

278
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,540
a high-powered, right, so when someone says

279
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,060
they want audio monitors or loudspeakers, I'm like,

280
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,840
well, that's like buying tires for a car,

281
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,020
you have to tell me what the rest

282
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,520
of it is, right, what you need, what

283
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,200
you want, yeah, but what I do for

284
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,020
people, you put 500 bucks in notes in

285
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,720
an envelope, and you ship me the speakers,

286
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,000
and if they're really large, you got to

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,600
drop like five or six, 50 bucks more

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,500
for shipping them back to you, give me

289
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,900
about two weeks with them, and you get

290
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,360
them back, and you plug them in, and

291
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,780
you'll be like, holy shit, how come this

292
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,480
doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard before,

293
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,460
so yeah, that's what I do.

294
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah, you did mention that on one sonic,

295
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,300
what you were attempting to do, and it

296
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,380
was quite fast.

297
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,460
Yeah, yeah, basically, because it's not, sound is

298
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,380
not understood, it's not a wave, it's what

299
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,600
it, you know, and also it has an

300
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,140
inertial point, so it's like a magnet, basically,

301
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,460
you set up a field inside of the,

302
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,600
inside of the loudspeaker that makes everything completely

303
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,780
coherent, so you don't get that combing effect,

304
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,620
like, you know, like, you know how cheap

305
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,520
speakers sound like this, you know, they kind

306
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,260
of have a sub, right, and then they,

307
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,020
and then you, the real high-end ones

308
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,440
sound artificial, I mean, all here in mono,

309
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,840
and you only hear in mono, right, all,

310
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,920
well, all audio sources are in mono, you

311
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,540
don't have a left-right flute, right, like,

312
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,100
when you look at an orchestra, all the

313
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,180
sections are segregated, are all on one side,

314
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,200
you have all the strings together, right, you,

315
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,060
so ultimately, even with two loudspeakers left and

316
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,720
right channel, you're trying to make a single

317
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,180
image, right, but you have a lot of

318
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,180
problems when you have all this energy going

319
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,000
out into the space, the subsequent out-of

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,320
-phase is behind in the box contained, so

321
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
the louder you make it, the more distortion.

322
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,420
I've approached certain companies like Magico and Wilson,

323
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,260
they have some interest, and so that would

324
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,900
be on the market, but the cheapest little

325
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,040
tiny monitor Magico makes is 10 grand for

326
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,540
a little, like, computer-sized speaker, and their

327
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,640
speakers go, their average speaker is $80,000

328
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,020
for the house, and Wilson, their smallest speaker

329
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,700
is also 10 grand, about $8,000 for

330
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,040
a little speaker, and the floor standards are

331
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,100
$40,000 and $50,000, so that's what

332
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,320
would be hitting the market from that perspective,

333
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,560
so I don't know if you have that

334
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,940
kind of, you want to, and then even

335
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,640
then, if you were to buy a loudspeaker

336
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,880
like that, that's so secondary compared to the

337
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,680
electric, the amplification and the other equipment, so,

338
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,100
like, Futterman, and it doesn't mean a lot

339
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,420
of power, like, if you ever heard of

340
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,020
Futterman's, they were seven, when he came out,

341
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,680
there were seven or ten grand per amp,

342
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
it was a mono, so if you wanted

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
a stereo, you needed two amplifiers, and they're

344
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
only rated at one watt, they were huge,

345
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,140
though, because if you can't get the first

346
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,980
watt right, the rest don't matter, right?

347
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,340
Yeah, right, right.

348
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,380
In terms of distortion.

349
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,300
Correct.

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,420
To get one watt of, let's say, audio

351
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,540
signal at no distortion at all is very

352
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,480
difficult, right?

353
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,140
Right.

354
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,900
The other way to do that is with

355
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,460
Class A amplification, so, but Class A is

356
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,200
running full power all the time, right?

357
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,560
Correct.

358
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,900
It's a push-pull.

359
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:48,780
Right.

360
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,220
And that sounds really good, and usually good

361
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,860
Class A's don't have an off switch, and

362
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,840
when you play loud music, you'll notice the

363
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,580
lights in the house flicker.

364
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,840
Yeah.

365
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,240
So, I have a lot of experience with

366
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,000
Class A's.

367
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,520
A Class AB, if you can design it

368
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,220
to be super linear, so you don't, you

369
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,260
know, so the switching, you know, is very

370
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,060
good, and it's linear, symmetrically linear, on both

371
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,240
sides of the circuit topography.

372
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm not going to start explaining what that

373
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,140
means.

374
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,220
Then, then it starts approaching the power of,

375
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,400
approaching a true Class A, but the benefits

376
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,960
of an AB.

377
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,040
Right.

378
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,340
Which is just more efficiency.

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,340
And then you have a MOSFET amp, which

380
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,380
is an AB style amp, but it sounds,

381
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,820
some people prefer the sound.

382
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,860
I don't, for most of them.

383
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,260
Hafler made some good ones.

384
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,660
MOSFETs are, have a unique sound because they're

385
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
very high voltage, or higher voltage, just like

386
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,020
tubes or vacuums are.

387
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,420
Right.

388
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,840
Like, people like tube or vacuum amps, and

389
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,220
the reason why, well, because they're not solid,

390
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,940
you know, they're just vacuum tubes, you watch

391
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,460
the glow and all that, and you know,

392
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,500
if you listen to them all the time,

393
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,420
every year, you're gonna have to figure out,

394
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,420
you know, some kind of tube inventory, right?

395
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,180
Right.

396
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,940
And it's great when you walk in and

397
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,780
you start to see the tube starting to

398
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,460
get really bright, you're like, oh shit, that's

399
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,540
got to be changed, right?

400
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,020
But, but also see with a tube amp,

401
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,420
when it goes into clipping, it doesn't have

402
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,339
that harsh sound.

403
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,079
It almost has like this euphoric, like a

404
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,079
scream, you know?

405
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,500
It screams, but politely.

406
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,100
MOSFETs are the closest.

407
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm a big fan of the old tube

408
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,520
amps.

409
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,840
Oh yeah, they're so smooth, sound warm.

410
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,760
They don't have to be, depends on how

411
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,480
you design them.

412
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,140
Like, I had a, who was the, oh,

413
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,700
the real basic one that they sold a

414
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,400
million, more than a million of them.

415
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,700
I recapped it and rewired it with silver

416
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,420
wire, and it actually sounded like a, like

417
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,340
a transistor amp.

418
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,220
It got very bright sounding.

419
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,120
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah, but the MOSFETs are like tubes because

421
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,960
they run on high voltage, high rail, high

422
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
voltage rails, right?

423
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,040
The tube amps, they're like 70, 80 volts,

424
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,660
90 volts.

425
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,000
The regular transistors run on anywhere between 14

426
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,380
and 30 volt, right?

427
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,800
And the MOSFETs can go up to the

428
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,420
high voltage.

429
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,460
So there, anyway, there's your brief scenario amplification.

430
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,520
Then you got wire, your signal path, and

431
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
then you get to the loudspeaker in the

432
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,100
end, which the trends do.

433
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,960
There's also, I'm working on a voice coil

434
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,420
design, which is how a true inductor should

435
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,740
be.

436
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,340
So, actually, I'm looking at one right now

437
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,900
on the desk.

438
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll put it on the camera and show

439
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,280
you.

440
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,140
Should I start taking photographs?

441
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,700
But nonetheless, yeah, it's fun.

442
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,600
I mean, I grew up at the tail

443
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
end of the Radio Shack era.

444
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,840
Now, when I say Radio Shack, most people

445
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,360
think the store.

446
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,140
No, well, 1920s, if you said you're going

447
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,720
out to the Radio Shack, it was literally

448
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,420
a converted outhouse that had lots of wires

449
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,240
and crystal sets hanging out of it, right?

450
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,500
Or, and you didn't, you know, you probably

451
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,040
came in on the tail end of it

452
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,420
also.

453
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,520
It was really big in the 30s, 40s,

454
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,780
and 50s and 60s.

455
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,080
It got really commercial with Lafayette, Stereo.

456
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,880
They supplied the catalog.

457
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,380
I remember a bunch of those.

458
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,460
So, anyway, I mean, when I was nine

459
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,140
years old, the parents went on vacation.

460
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,240
I was about eight or nine, and they

461
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,020
left us with the grandmother, and they had

462
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,620
a big stereo council, a tube turntable, lots

463
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,080
of built-in.

464
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,020
And when they came back, said, how'd it

465
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,220
go?

466
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,280
And the grandmother says, well, he took apart

467
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,240
the whole stereo council, which I literally did,

468
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,360
and put it all back together.

469
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,560
And they're like, no, no way, because when

470
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,680
that thing breaks, we have to call a

471
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:44,980
technician.

472
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,260
There's no way he did it, right?

473
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,840
Well, she's like, seriously, he did it.

474
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,220
So, they pulled me aside and slapped the

475
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,800
crap out of me.

476
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,840
Don't ever do that again.

477
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,160
Even though it worked, even though it really

478
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,920
worked well, I took the whole thing apart,

479
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,580
looked at everything.

480
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,840
I tried to get eight or nine years

481
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,220
old, go to the library looking for vacuum

482
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,500
tube set topography.

483
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,360
Aren't you a little young for that?

484
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,760
Don't you want to go over here where

485
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,860
the children's books are?

486
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,010
Anyway, yeah.

487
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,710
So, okay.

488
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,670
So, basically, yeah, 500 bucks in the mail.

489
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,610
Send me the speakers.

490
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,090
Let me know.

491
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,990
Give me an email.

492
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,610
If they're really big speakers, it's anywhere between

493
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,610
500 to 1,000 each to modify.

494
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,530
And the shipping will probably be whatever.

495
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,110
But if you have like a tabletop or

496
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,130
a bookshelf or what they call a studio

497
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,610
monitor, ship it over to me.

498
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,510
Drop, put 500 bucks in notes in there.

499
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,910
If they're heavy, put another 50 for sending

500
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,370
it back.

501
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,390
And give me a couple of weeks, and

502
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,590
I'll modify them for you.

503
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,710
And I might even do some, if it

504
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,110
has crossovers or filtering, I'll upgrade it.

505
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,070
I'll properly wire it and install a periodic

506
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,570
acoustic inertial plane internally.

507
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,790
And you'll get it back, and you'll be

508
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,670
like, wow, what the hell's going on here?

509
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,390
The further away I go, the louder it

510
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,630
gets.

511
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,630
It's not supposed to be like that.

512
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
It's supposed to be like a campfire.

513
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,150
The closer you are, the louder it is,

514
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,310
right?

515
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,610
Yeah, it's really strange.

516
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,370
So, I remember once playing music, a modest

517
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,330
system, and the neighbor across the street says,

518
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,510
your music's too loud.

519
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,250
And I said, really?

520
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,110
He says, well, actually, I'm not saying it.

521
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,890
It's the neighbor behind me that said it

522
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,590
was too loud.

523
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,610
And it was the other side of the

524
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,570
street behind him.

525
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,650
So, it went through the street across, it

526
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,350
went the street across through his house, his

527
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,730
backyard, and the other neighbor's back.

528
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,390
So, he's telling me, I said, well, why

529
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:35,830
is it so loud?

530
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,030
He says, well, I'm coming to tell you

531
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,610
that the guy behind me thought it was

532
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,010
too loud.

533
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,650
I was like, whoa, and it wasn't that

534
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,110
loud at all.

535
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,570
So, what the hell's going on here, right?

536
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,030
I mean, I was playing a live, live

537
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,950
level, not, right?

538
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,130
So, yeah, I've got lots of sound stories.

539
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,650
Okay.

540
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,990
So, that's the thing about speakers.

541
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,870
It's like buying tires.

542
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,350
It's not.

543
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,450
Now, most audio, by the way, again, just

544
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,550
to finish up on the subject, there's a

545
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,130
big boom for a couple of years now

546
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,810
that you have self-powered speakers.

547
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,170
So, if you're not that picky and you

548
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,810
just need something to go and you can

549
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,510
get a pretty decent set of self-powered

550
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,330
speakers, albeit, you know, they're okay for studio

551
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,930
monitoring for 200 to, about 300 to 500

552
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,290
bucks.

553
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,010
They have the amplifier, everything built in.

554
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,350
Now, the NS10, the Yamaha NS10, do you

555
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,690
remember that?

556
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,490
It's a little bookshelf speaker with a white

557
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,250
cone, Yamaha.

558
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,250
Okay.

559
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,110
When they released that, it was a big

560
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,430
flop.

561
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,930
Nobody wanted to buy it because it sounded

562
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,390
terrible.

563
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,510
It was tinny and flat sounding, but it

564
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,490
became a studio standard because when they mixed

565
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,230
in the studio, if it sounded okay on

566
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,590
that, it means it would sound better on

567
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,490
anything else, right?

568
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,250
So, they balanced their...

569
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,370
Because most of the recordings didn't sound that

570
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,650
bad.

571
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,110
And by the way, when you get into

572
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,750
audiophile level stuff, you'll notice that it's really

573
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,910
hard to find...

574
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,990
It's no longer whether your system is good

575
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,730
or not, can you get good program material?

576
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,750
Is it well recorded?

577
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,110
That's why you end up sticking with older

578
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,890
records that didn't have a lot of equipment

579
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,090
to screw up the signal.

580
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,530
Or you go for labels like Deutsch Grammophon

581
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,890
or the CBS Digital or this other stuff,

582
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,110
right?

583
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:13,950
Right.

584
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,510
So, anyway, do you know about Deutsch Grammophon?

585
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,310
You know, I briefly remembered it, yeah.

586
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,590
It's a German...

587
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,930
Well, when you get their CDs, it has

588
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,950
a warning label on it.

589
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,230
It says, we do not use any dynamic

590
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,750
compression.

591
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,330
So, play at a low volume because you

592
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,410
play at normal volume and there's a high

593
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,550
crescendo, it could damage your system, right?

594
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,690
They don't compress anything.

595
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:32,690
Wow.

596
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,050
Yeah, there's always a little label on the

597
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,490
Deutsch...

598
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,090
That's why I like...

599
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,330
So, you know, you're going to get it...

600
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,510
Basically, it goes from the microphone to the

601
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,750
board to the master.

602
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,870
There's no buffering and no compression, signal compression,

603
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,250
uncompressed signal.

604
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,910
But basically, studios use like the NS-10

605
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,390
Yamaha, which is a crappy speaker, or the

606
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,350
Oritone, which is another crappy speaker, to make

607
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,770
music because that's what most people are going

608
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,030
to listen to in their car.

609
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,890
A lot of the early pop, especially the

610
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,610
hip-hop recording studios, when they would record,

611
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,410
they made a tape and they went downstairs

612
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,050
or outside.

613
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,770
It didn't sound good in the car, they

614
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,300
remixed it, right?

615
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,600
It had to sound good in the car,

616
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,740
right?

617
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,380
So, there you go.

618
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,160
There's the 10 minutes recitation on sound and

619
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,780
how the state of sound right now.

620
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,340
Okay.

621
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,780
White fellow tripping, all right.

622
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,100
Yeah, white people do trip all the time.

623
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,740
My country may look good on the outside,

624
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,080
but for a number of years and a

625
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,100
large growing number of pedophiles and incest, I

626
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,540
got to the point where they stopped reporting

627
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,080
the news.

628
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,180
Yeah, that's normal.

629
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,940
It's been going on for a long, long

630
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,340
time.

631
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,100
It's just coming out because we're at that

632
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,600
time where all things will come out.

633
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,880
It will increase also because, like I said

634
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,660
earlier, the revival of these ancient gods, you

635
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,920
know, when you see a tranny, that's not

636
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,100
a lifestyle or fashion thing, that is a

637
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,780
religious thing.

638
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,040
But they don't know it.

639
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,760
You know what I mean?

640
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,520
They don't know it.

641
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,140
It doesn't matter.

642
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,360
That's the fact as it is.

643
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,520
So, that part of that is a religion.

644
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,540
Hi, guys.

645
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,060
It was shocking to us last week, the

646
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,900
Greek mentioned the purpose of sleep.

647
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
Spent many years researching this with many dead

648
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,720
ends.

649
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,280
Yeah, of course.

650
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,280
I think even now, if you research, they

651
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,340
don't know why you sleep.

652
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,140
They don't know why your hands and feet

653
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,000
shrink when you're in water.

654
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,040
Okay, the answer is, I've answered it, but

655
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,780
I'd never gone directly into it and how

656
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,540
to improve that.

657
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,440
It'd be great if the, anyway, it'd be

658
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,740
great if the Greek could shed some light

659
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,700
on this subject someday.

660
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Yeah, good.

661
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm not going to do it now, but

662
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,100
I'll throw a hint.

663
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,260
The vacuum is, the body is under a

664
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,000
vacuum, right?

665
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,760
So, you know what pressure mediation is?

666
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,500
Like, when you move around, it's no different

667
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,020
than, let's say you have a bladder full

668
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,400
of water.

669
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,460
When you push on one end, it displaces

670
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,180
the fluid and creates a pressure on the

671
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,360
other.

672
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,800
You know, like imagine, you know, whether it's

673
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,660
air or an air mattress or a beach

674
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,160
ball or a water balloon or a condom

675
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
filled with water you're about to throw at

676
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,260
someone for saying something stupid.

677
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,000
Right.

678
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,860
But whatever, pressure mediation is constantly happening.

679
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,360
So, if the body needs to maintain a

680
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,420
vacuum and you're walking around and moving and

681
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,920
you have shock load on the bottom of

682
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,820
your feet and shock load, you know, you

683
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,600
don't notice the shock load of walking until

684
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,920
you break or hurt a bone.

685
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:37,760
Right.

686
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,360
Right.

687
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,940
If you had a broken clavicle, which is

688
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,680
a collarbone, you walk and it just, just

689
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,300
walking, it just tears you apart, right?

690
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,400
Why?

691
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,260
It's not, you're not walking on your collarbone,

692
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,380
it's the vibration that goes through the entire

693
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,220
skeleton, right?

694
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah.

695
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,800
You become sensitive to it.

696
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,860
So, all these shock loads that the body

697
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,700
is under every day and pressure differential, you

698
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,060
know, when you walk and you press the

699
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,740
bottom of your foot, which is soft and

700
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,720
gooey, not as much as your inner thigh

701
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,480
or your armpit.

702
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,160
Right.

703
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,680
But you're, you're creating pressure mediation, you're compressing

704
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
the bottom of the foot and then releasing

705
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,060
it.

706
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,640
So, you have all this super activity.

707
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,960
So, when you sleep, the body's vacuum, you're

708
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,940
not moving and what happens, that's why it's

709
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,300
very important to, to be on a bed

710
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,640
that is comfortable to you.

711
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,520
Right.

712
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,140
Right.

713
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,820
For your body, right?

714
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,620
Or what you like.

715
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,980
Like if I once had a Japanese roommate

716
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,680
and, and I would always trip on her

717
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,980
because I'd walk in at night late and

718
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,220
I'd turn, you know, look in, I said,

719
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,860
oh, nobody's home because the bed is empty.

720
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,120
And I walk in and I trip on

721
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,280
her because she never slept in the bed.

722
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,140
She slept on the floor always because they

723
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,600
sleep on what's called tatami mats traditionally on

724
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:52,980
the floor.

725
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,000
So, that would be comfortable for a Westerner,

726
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,700
that would be very uncomfortable, but I'm used

727
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,060
to, I could sleep on a picket fence.

728
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,900
It's no big deal.

729
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,560
So, but other people, you have to discover

730
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,280
what's comfortable.

731
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,160
So, once you get comfortable, you have a

732
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,760
sense of, there is no sensory displacement.

733
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,200
Right?

734
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,220
What I mean by sensory displacement is you

735
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,920
ever sit in a, on the edge or

736
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,380
side of a chair hastily and you're uncomfortable

737
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,700
and say, let me rearrange myself.

738
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,740
And you kind of rearrange yourself in the

739
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:23,880
chair.

740
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,090
Now you're sitting more comfortably because you display,

741
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,030
you know, you have a sensory displacement, right?

742
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,430
Right.

743
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:28,890
Right.

744
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,850
A lot of displacement just means to move

745
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,350
from one thing to another or one place

746
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,770
to another.

747
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:33,390
Right.

748
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,870
So, you have all these displacements that are

749
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,010
happening and how is the body going to

750
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,730
go into vacuum?

751
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,490
Now, it's in stable vacuum while you have

752
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,170
to sleep because in sleep you're not moving.

753
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,710
That's why people who sleep very lightly or

754
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,530
move around are not well healed.

755
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,590
Right?

756
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,550
What happens when you're sick or not feeling

757
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,910
well?

758
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,870
The first rule of therapy should be try

759
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,650
some sleep therapy, try napping, try resting more.

760
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,310
They know that.

761
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,950
That's about all they can tell you is

762
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,910
like, well, get some rest.

763
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,270
Right?

764
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,070
Isn't that what they say?

765
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,850
Get some rest.

766
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,630
Because there's, you've eliminated displacement.

767
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,790
So, what happens is you have built-in

768
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,230
system.

769
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,070
It's a download where you have to stop

770
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,350
and maintain that vacuum.

771
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,110
Now, I haven't, I don't know if I've

772
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,870
stressed the importance of the biological vacuum in

773
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,370
the body as much as I should have,

774
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,930
but I think enough people that have gotten

775
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,550
it and utilized it see that it is

776
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,130
the be-all end-all of all things

777
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,990
regarding the body.

778
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:30,890
Right.

779
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,490
Anybody who's ever, like I mentioned last week,

780
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,330
I got a pretty good burn and three

781
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,290
days later it was, there was no evidence

782
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,190
of it at all.

783
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,470
Right.

784
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,650
Where if I would have just, oh, I

785
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,250
got a burn.

786
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,950
Put some ice on it and some ointment.

787
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,370
Right.

788
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,950
I would still have a scar.

789
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,230
Right now, a week later.

790
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:50,510
Yeah.

791
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,290
There is no evidence of it at all.

792
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,050
So, and there are people you could tell

793
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,590
who's censored.

794
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,590
They don't understand a lot of these things

795
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,290
and you just, you know, you still, it

796
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,770
doesn't mean you can't explain it or still

797
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,830
re-explain it, but you have to be

798
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,750
kind of tentative, you know, and it's better

799
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,310
to work with people that understand it because

800
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,810
this is not about making the world a

801
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,370
better place.

802
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,490
It's about helping out those who want to

803
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:13,870
be helped.

804
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,250
And the creator or the spiritual realm will

805
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,030
let you know who want to be helped.

806
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,150
They'll give them understanding.

807
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:20,990
Right.

808
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,170
And there are a lot of...

809
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,150
Good.

810
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,050
Because there are people with good intent that

811
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,070
don't understand, but sorry, you still can't help

812
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,270
them.

813
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,990
If they're censored, you can't help them.

814
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,990
You gotta, it doesn't mean walk away and

815
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,650
leave them behind, but walk away and leave

816
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,870
them five steps behind or two steps behind

817
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,510
and try to find the ones that you

818
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,230
can develop.

819
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,430
Because the reason why I say that, because

820
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,150
if you need some help or assistance, you're

821
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,230
not going to go to the guy who

822
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,230
wants to learn, but is censored and hasn't.

823
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,170
You want to go to the guy who

824
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,370
is not censored and is working with it.

825
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:54,970
You see what I mean?

826
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:55,990
Right, right.

827
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,570
Sure knows.

828
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,730
That's the real reality.

829
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,250
It's not the bullshit reality that, you know,

830
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,430
the made-up reality or made-up perception

831
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,710
hearsay that people are told.

832
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,320
So, basically with sleep, the only thing I

833
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,740
could say about sleep in short, I should

834
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,640
do an entire sonic on it because I

835
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,140
could pull up notes that I have and

836
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,840
also I could give more direction on what

837
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,260
to look on the internet, but there's very

838
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,280
little done on it.

839
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,100
And don't believe in sleep studies.

840
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,220
Sleep studies are there to experiment on you,

841
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,180
capture your brainwaves and put a chip in

842
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,740
you.

843
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,060
Yep.

844
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,580
I know that sounds kind of crazy, but

845
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,980
the chips right now, you know, RFID chips

846
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,920
are so small that you could fit a

847
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,560
hundred of them on a grain of rice.

848
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,040
Yeah, yeah, nanotechnology and all that.

849
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,720
Yeah, it's above nano.

850
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,280
It's still above nano, but within it, nano

851
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,080
is overrated.

852
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:49,820
Right.

853
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,460
But they're small.

854
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,440
Like in the audio industry about nano pulp

855
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,760
paper and they sent me the article, they

856
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,940
made it seem so fantastic.

857
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,660
I said, oh, it's just a pulp hydroxide.

858
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,900
What you do is you dissolve something in

859
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,500
an alkaline, which is like Drano.

860
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,100
And of course it'll dissolve it and you'll

861
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,960
have sediment going to the bottom and stuff

862
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,500
foaming and going to the top.

863
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,280
What you do is you skim off all

864
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,260
the stuff on the top and you then

865
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,220
start lowering the pH down to seven and

866
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,260
you'll see more separation and the stuff that's

867
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,760
left on the very bottom is your nano

868
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,140
material.

869
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,680
Oh, that's so high tech, isn't it?

870
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:25,900
Right?

871
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:26,620
Yeah.

872
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,400
That's all.

873
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,960
So, it's basically the gluten part of the

874
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,320
fiber.

875
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,220
So, all the starch has been eliminated using

876
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,240
chemistry and you basically, you've left the skeleton

877
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,080
of the fiber with none of the starch

878
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,560
in between.

879
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,740
So, it still has the same strength, but

880
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,000
it has very little of the weight, right?

881
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:47,740
Right.

882
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,020
Just like your body.

883
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,240
If you took out all the bones in

884
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,420
your body, you have no strength.

885
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
The strength of what you can lift depends

886
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,800
on your skeletal structure.

887
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,500
Correct.

888
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,160
That's why the people that were on the

889
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,360
PCP, they got amazing strength, but they would

890
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,040
snap bones.

891
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,540
You told someone on PCP to try to

892
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,820
lift the car, he'd keep going and the

893
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,080
muscles kept contracting until he snapped the ligament.

894
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,200
He would actually start lifting the car.

895
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,660
I'm talking about like a 110 pound skinny

896
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,760
guy would do it.

897
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,120
Yeah.

898
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,900
So, it's this bone structure that gives you

899
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,880
the strength ultimately.

900
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,640
The actual movement and displacement is done by

901
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,160
the muscles.

902
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,720
So, anyway, yeah, that's about it on sleep.

903
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,920
Again, it has to do with the body

904
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,880
vacuum and all that and there's sleep therapy

905
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,820
and then the importance of sleep and we're

906
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,640
inherently, you know, have to submit to it

907
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,020
inherently.

908
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,740
Because three days without sleep is about the

909
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,640
usual limit that one can go safely.

910
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,960
Between three and five days, you can get

911
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,820
damage to your body the same that would

912
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,560
be like as if you passed out and

913
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,860
drowned for a few minutes.

914
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,560
And anywhere between six and ten days, you

915
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,040
can die.

916
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,700
No sleep.

917
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:12,000
That's like the main torture is sleep deprivation.

918
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,440
People are like, oh, sleep deprivation.

919
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,420
I get that because my neighbor's dog is

920
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,000
noisy.

921
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,580
No, it means that every ten minutes they

922
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,139
have a loud sound to wake you up

923
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,760
and or physically jar you to get up.

924
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,320
And you just keep doing it.

925
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,620
Because once you have more than ten minutes,

926
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,460
like 20 minutes is considered a power nap.

927
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,080
So, you can't let the victim go beyond

928
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,500
eight minutes or ten minutes.

929
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,159
Because it takes eight minutes or ten minutes

930
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,420
before the recovery starts.

931
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,400
So, even though it looks like someone's sleeping

932
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,840
for five or six minutes and you wake

933
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,260
them up, you know, to do the sleep

934
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,900
deprivation torture, it's like as if they fell

935
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,380
asleep.

936
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,340
And a lot of people have been killed

937
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,280
that way in prisons and government labs and

938
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,060
medical experiments and whatever.

939
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,300
Want to see how long you can go

940
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,780
without sleep.

941
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,480
So, after seven days, you get irreparable brain

942
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:58,800
damage.

943
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,160
Anyway, all right.

944
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,900
So, then the reason why is, again, it's

945
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,600
body vacuum, displacement.

946
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,700
And we've discussed, yeah, we get more into

947
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,820
the vacuum of the body because we maybe

948
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,140
discuss how it has to do more with

949
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,040
sleep and how eating seasonally has a lot

950
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,720
to do with it.

951
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,040
But when you talk about the body vacuum

952
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,660
and eating seasonally, then we have to also

953
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,060
discuss plants, plant life, seasonal plant life.

954
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,680
And plants are different during two parts of

955
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,560
the world and all that.

956
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,560
The one thing connects to the other.

957
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,640
And I'm not going to be like a

958
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,400
university for free.

959
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:36,740
Sorry.

960
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,800
It takes a lot for me to organize

961
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,240
that and for you and for me to

962
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,460
do it.

963
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,180
I'm not going to do it.

964
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,640
It's just these casual calls and stuff we

965
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,300
do are fine.

966
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,820
But I'm not serious about that.

967
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,680
You don't have enough time left to use

968
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,280
it anyway, unless you're just going to use

969
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,000
it day to day.

970
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,960
And if you're going to use it day

971
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,900
to day, what I mentioned on a clue

972
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,100
or hint level is enough for you to

973
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,860
take the ball and run with it if

974
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,280
you're the capable ones.

975
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,600
If you're one of the ones that might

976
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
be capable, then you should get together with

977
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,840
those who are more capable, which is why

978
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,620
the chat is there.

979
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,960
And if you're censored and not capable and

980
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,340
need a lot more training, tough shit.

981
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,660
Wait for the resurrection.

982
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,360
That's my view on this existence.

983
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,100
In other words, you're too fucked up as

984
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,400
a society to deserve good information as a

985
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,180
group, as a rule.

986
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,100
It doesn't mean that the exceptions don't exist.

987
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,640
But sorry, for the exceptions that do want

988
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,920
to learn more or whatever, tough also because

989
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,960
you're getting hints and clues that no one

990
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,900
ever gave me and I'm just handing it

991
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,840
over to you also.

992
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,640
So I don't want to sound like a

993
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,440
dick or be like this guy's a real

994
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,740
asshole.

995
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,440
What's his problem?

996
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,600
My problem is everything and everyone around me.

997
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,860
Just look at it.

998
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,880
What do you mean what's my problem?

999
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
It is a problem.

1000
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,280
So anyway, you're here to die.

1001
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,160
You're here to have X amount of heartbeats

1002
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,540
and then die and then be resurrected.

1003
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,460
So get over it.

1004
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,180
In the meantime, clothing and shelter.

1005
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,120
If you want real knowledge on how to

1006
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,980
mitigate things and make life better, hey, you're

1007
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,600
getting hints and clues here all the time.

1008
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,360
Right.

1009
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,400
Right.

1010
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:11,700
Yeah.

1011
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,680
So we'll see how it goes in the

1012
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,000
future.

1013
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,620
But I'm not going to set up an

1014
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,520
online university for the reality of what's going

1015
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,060
on at this point.

1016
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,040
I'm not inspired to do it.

1017
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,720
I'm not encouraged to do it.

1018
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,680
And I don't see the advantage of it

1019
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:30,900
either.

1020
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,120
So there you go.

1021
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,740
So we just best thing you guys are

1022
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,200
going to get or this week, once a

1023
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,840
week on this pathetic little sonic event or

1024
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,060
maybe a podcast with Sam in the future,

1025
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,980
maybe, maybe that's about it.

1026
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,320
Yeah.

1027
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,300
So let's see.

1028
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,300
Let's go down the line.

1029
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,360
So just to tie into that one more

1030
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,620
time, you know, people say they don't say,

1031
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,220
oh, you didn't even have any knowledge of

1032
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,320
it.

1033
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,880
They don't say that.

1034
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,720
People usually say as a comment, they say

1035
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,340
he didn't even have a clue of it.

1036
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,580
Right.

1037
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,220
You ever hear that?

1038
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,900
Oh, you don't have a clue.

1039
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,780
They don't have a clue.

1040
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
They don't say they don't have any knowledge.

1041
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,720
Well, you got all the clues.

1042
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,640
I'm giving you clues.

1043
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm giving you hints.

1044
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:10,940
Right.

1045
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,760
So people say, oh, it doesn't mean knowledge.

1046
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,840
No one says that.

1047
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,300
They do.

1048
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
You didn't even have a clue where you

1049
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,520
got more than enough clues, more than enough

1050
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,100
hints, more than enough suggestions voluntarily, just freely

1051
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,460
given.

1052
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,560
So that's my point there.

1053
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,140
Generously donated.

1054
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,680
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,700
More than a thousand times more than you're

1056
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,880
going to get anywhere else or ever else.

1057
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
You're going to find that anywhere.

1058
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,560
Nope.

1059
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,880
And then once you learn how to piece

1060
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
it together, you're going to start building it

1061
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,900
up and get on the rectangle, which is

1062
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,240
easy.

1063
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,100
It's easier than when I was growing up

1064
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,720
doing research.

1065
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,100
I had to make time to travel to

1066
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,700
the library.

1067
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,460
Then I had it when I got what

1068
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,720
when I got to the library, I had

1069
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,220
to travel within the library.

1070
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Believe it or not, the library is like

1071
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,020
a self-contained world of its own.

1072
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,620
Oh, yeah.

1073
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,640
And because sometimes if you get you need

1074
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,460
to develop a rapport with the people that

1075
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,600
run the library, i.e. librarians, and they

1076
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,360
have their own levels of staff.

1077
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,960
And when you get to know them and

1078
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,660
you let them know the subject matter, they

1079
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,060
have storage.

1080
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Also, they have things in storage that are

1081
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,580
not out.

1082
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,400
Right.

1083
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,540
Not everything in the library.

1084
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,600
And then you have them look in there.

1085
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,120
And then it gets really fun when they

1086
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,060
look in the area of storage that hasn't

1087
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,120
been fully correlated yet, where in other words,

1088
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,880
it hasn't been broken down in category.

1089
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,400
That's the real fun.

1090
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,440
Right.

1091
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,160
Especially when you're like a young adolescent and

1092
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,120
the librarians like in her early 20s and

1093
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,740
kind of hot.

1094
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,880
But anyway.

1095
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,300
So anyway, and then you're eventually going to

1096
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,680
find out that you need a bigger library.

1097
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,720
That library you're going to is not specialized

1098
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,760
or good enough.

1099
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,560
You see how what it was to find

1100
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
bits of information.

1101
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,460
But I'd say about 60 to 70 percent

1102
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,160
of what you could do could have done

1103
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,320
that.

1104
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,120
You get on the Internet almost instantly now.

1105
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,680
But what about the other 40 or 30

1106
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,980
percent?

1107
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,320
Not not on the Internet yet.

1108
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Sorry.

1109
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,720
I have proof of that time.

1110
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,860
You still have to go still even fairly

1111
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,020
decent universities, which are all crap, but the

1112
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,740
more better, more, more better ones.

1113
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,580
What they do is the new students, they

1114
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,620
in the book, they in their dorms and

1115
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,820
in the bookshops and stuff, they have these

1116
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,500
little cutouts they put out and they say,

1117
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
well, dear student, you know, you're new in

1118
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,060
our college or university, whatever.

1119
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,060
Don't rely completely on the Internet.

1120
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,760
Not everything you need to research is on

1121
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,160
the Internet.

1122
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:39,820
Right.

1123
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,680
So still and the danger of putting it

1124
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,720
on the Internet is changing it, just like

1125
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,800
George Orwell.

1126
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,320
Who was not George Orwell's fantasy, just like

1127
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,600
the guy who did Blade Runner as a

1128
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:53,860
fantasy.

1129
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,040
You remember the movie Blade Runner?

1130
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,800
Real futuristic.

1131
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,980
Well, guess what year that took place in

1132
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,920
the movie.

1133
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,980
Twenty nineteen next year.

1134
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,660
Hey, folks, just like I said, you ain't

1135
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,880
going to get no flying car.

1136
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,180
So, yeah, look it up.

1137
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,840
Blade Runner.

1138
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,260
The year is 2019, right?

1139
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,660
Well, yeah.

1140
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,260
Yeah.

1141
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,160
Well, the Pope's work schedule.

1142
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,620
You ain't got none of that shit, do

1143
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,180
you?

1144
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,680
Mm hmm.

1145
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,000
Right.

1146
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,160
None of that.

1147
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,500
And you ain't going to get it.

1148
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,040
Even if you went to the year three

1149
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
thousand nineteen, you're going to get nothing like

1150
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,340
that.

1151
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,080
You're going backwards.

1152
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,540
So the problem with most governments try to

1153
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,440
figure out how to get rid of their

1154
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,060
populations.

1155
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,740
And I mean, like most of the people.

1156
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,840
And I haven't gotten into detail because I

1157
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,820
in the discussions I've had with people that

1158
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,700
were hinting at this that don't want they

1159
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,960
I see the problem is surmountable.

1160
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,880
Let's say they had a scenario to, let's

1161
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
say, eliminate, you know, three quarters the people

1162
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,220
of the United States, which they want to

1163
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,680
do like 80 percent of the United States

1164
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,440
by 2030.

1165
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,420
Right.

1166
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,820
The problem is just picture either a city

1167
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,780
or a suburb.

1168
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,840
You got a house and a car, two

1169
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,200
cars, a house and a car and two

1170
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,380
cars.

1171
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,500
So you go and you wipe out a

1172
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:01,840
family.

1173
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,360
You got an empty house and two cars.

1174
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,020
Right.

1175
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,500
You wipe out the whole block.

1176
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,160
You got a couple of hundred houses with

1177
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,400
all these cars sitting there.

1178
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,980
Right.

1179
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,240
It's not getting rid of the people.

1180
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,160
That's the problem.

1181
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,140
It's how do you rework the infrastructure?

1182
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,760
You want to need no one needs cars

1183
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,000
anymore when you reduce the population by 80

1184
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,460
percent.

1185
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,020
So we can do all these hundreds and

1186
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,960
millions of cars in the U.S. So

1187
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,000
if you want a metal.

1188
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,200
Well, what you do, if you got more

1189
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,140
than two sharpened pencils or two iPads, figure

1190
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,520
out how to quickly dispose of cars without

1191
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,280
getting into environmental mess, because it'd be great

1192
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,680
to be able to throw an entire car

1193
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,240
into a muncher, but you have all these

1194
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,820
fluids and stuff could catch fire.

1195
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,080
Right.

1196
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,440
So if you have an invention on how

1197
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,340
to get rid of an automobile very quickly

1198
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,260
and efficiently, you'll do quite well in this

1199
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,520
world.

1200
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,880
Just send it to the appropriate parties and

1201
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,640
they'll prop you up.

1202
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,600
You'll just make their agenda a little easier.

1203
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,500
You know, getting rid of the houses and

1204
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,380
all that is easy.

1205
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,800
You could burn them down like they did.

1206
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,940
Most most houses are still flammable.

1207
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,780
Even brick houses are mostly flammable because the

1208
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,120
roofs with the inside timbers will burn and

1209
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,540
collapse.

1210
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,380
And once the collapse, you have something called

1211
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,840
roof thrust, which will take the walls down.

1212
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,200
Go watch go watch some old World War

1213
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,080
two movies when or whatever, when they have

1214
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,140
real life footage of burn buildings burning, even

1215
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,160
the walls are masonry.

1216
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,680
Once the roof burns in, you see the

1217
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,460
walls come down.

1218
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,320
You ever notice that because the roof doesn't

1219
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,400
come down evenly and they're pocketed into the

1220
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,280
masonry anyway.

1221
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,460
So if you have a inventive on how

1222
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,520
to figure out how to get rid of

1223
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,000
cars and houses and all the junk that

1224
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,560
people have quickly, you will probably be propped

1225
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,000
up in advance because you'll be viewed as

1226
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,280
being important in this hidden agenda, which is

1227
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,140
a very real agenda, by the way.

1228
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,320
Yeah.

1229
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,940
People working around the clock, how are we

1230
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,300
going to get rid of 80% of

1231
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,940
these morons?

1232
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,200
I mean, get rid of them completely.

1233
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
And the remaining morons will not be in

1234
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,080
a panic and also help us do it.

1235
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,200
Right.

1236
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,300
Not the government that because when you talk

1237
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,000
about the government, city, local, state, or Trump

1238
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,540
or whatever, those are the administrators.

1239
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,380
They're administrators.

1240
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,540
They're not the government.

1241
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,700
The government is the will of the shareholders,

1242
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,720
the ones that own the country.

1243
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:17,500
Right.

1244
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,820
Lock stock and all that.

1245
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:19,660
Right.

1246
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,720
So anyway, this is, you know, I'm not

1247
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,080
for them.

1248
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,520
If they said, you know, they got the

1249
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,320
plan in place and eliminate 80% of

1250
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,820
y'all tomorrow.

1251
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,180
Fine.

1252
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,840
Just let you know, I'm out of here.

1253
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,100
Or if I have to go to fine.

1254
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,580
Fuck it.

1255
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,020
But, you know, if they're not going to

1256
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,000
do it, that's fine, too.

1257
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,480
Fuck it.

1258
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:38,980
Right.

1259
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,760
Don't make no difference in the big picture

1260
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,160
sense.

1261
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,400
So either way, pair of walking shoes.

1262
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,480
Yeah.

1263
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,140
But I just brought up some of the

1264
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,600
logistics.

1265
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,000
So you hear all these idiots say, oh,

1266
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,160
they won't eliminate most of the people, but

1267
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,420
they never stop and think, oh, what are

1268
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,220
you going to do with all the stuff

1269
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:56,880
they have left?

1270
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,820
That's right.

1271
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,280
Garbage now.

1272
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,020
Well, obviously, you could redistribute on an equitable

1273
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,640
or semi equitable level to the survivors, but

1274
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,300
you're still going to have four times more

1275
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:09,760
than you need.

1276
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,280
You got to have to recycle it somehow.

1277
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,040
Yeah.

1278
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,400
So if you didn't have so much stuff,

1279
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,500
they would have gotten rid of you a

1280
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,660
long time ago, probably around, you know, 1950s,

1281
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:19,780
1980s.

1282
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,740
But anyway, that's stuff people don't like talking

1283
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:22,920
about.

1284
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,720
But anyone wants to brainstorm on that, I'm

1285
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,060
sure there's plenty of people who want to

1286
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,840
listen behind the scenes because you think they're

1287
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,100
smart.

1288
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,920
They're not that smart.

1289
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,400
The best way to get rid of cars

1290
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,740
and everything is with a big plasma beam.

1291
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,680
Literally, they use it for mining, by the

1292
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,380
way, where they it's very hot plasma being

1293
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,140
anything that goes in it, regardless of material,

1294
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,360
it turns to liquid or vapor and you

1295
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,220
have ashes going vertical.

1296
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,160
And, you know, anything like steel will turn

1297
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,100
to ash and rise like mashed potato flakes

1298
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,000
or or like laundry detergent flakes.

1299
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,640
Right.

1300
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,160
And anything heavier than steel or denser than

1301
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,840
steel or alloy will fall as slag.

1302
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,140
It looks like glass, like rainbow colored glass.

1303
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:04,720
Yeah.

1304
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,220
So, in other words, to get rid of

1305
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,560
the cars, you can have like an eight

1306
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,360
foot diameter plasma being two of them.

1307
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,180
You just drop the car in there and

1308
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,860
doesn't doesn't there isn't dwell time is not

1309
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,460
required.

1310
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,260
In other words, as long as it passes

1311
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,940
the beam, it turns to the plasma or

1312
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,220
very high.

1313
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,560
Right.

1314
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,480
And these are very various ways to generate

1315
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:24,940
the plasma.

1316
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,340
But anyway.

1317
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,740
Mm hmm.

1318
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,080
So there's your your little idea how to

1319
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,040
get rid of all the cars.

1320
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,620
They're ready to just get a guy.

1321
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,880
I figured this thing about cars.

1322
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,840
So they're really hounding this the CEO of

1323
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,140
Nissan.

1324
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,600
They got rid of him because he's using

1325
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,300
was just like 20 million in Japanese money,

1326
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,740
which would be two hundred million yen or

1327
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,480
whatever, two billion yen.

1328
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,100
Again, is about a penny.

1329
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,720
They all do that.

1330
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,420
So I wonder why they put him in

1331
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:52,680
the.

1332
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,600
You know, I wonder why they put him

1333
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:55,880
in the.

1334
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,980
Yeah, this is like, you know, no more

1335
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,800
cars are no good.

1336
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,000
Right.

1337
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,080
So anyway, no, they're not.

1338
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,040
So next time you're out there and you

1339
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,560
see all these people, you got to thank

1340
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,040
your car.

1341
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,720
And that's why you're all still here.

1342
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,580
It's not the getting rid of the people

1343
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,880
that's involved is we're going to do all

1344
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,760
these cars sitting around anyway.

1345
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,380
OK, off the subject.

1346
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,480
I don't see anything else going on.

1347
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,300
Any questions?

1348
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,320
You know, I should check out the email,

1349
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:21,800
maybe.

1350
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:41,790
All right.

1351
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,750
So but I haven't been I've been looking

1352
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,990
at the email for a while and I

1353
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,170
haven't been answering them.

1354
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,710
So if you send an email, I do

1355
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,830
get to it and I usually answer it

1356
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,250
within two or three days.

1357
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,570
But I think I see here some more

1358
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,330
than a week that I've not responded to.

1359
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:03,410
So a couple of real long ones.

1360
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,630
I have someone I think is a writer

1361
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,070
or writes very freely regarding free will.

1362
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,130
And I think people pretty much understand that

1363
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:14,870
concept.

1364
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,650
It's not free will as much as it

1365
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,070
is basically choices that you have within a

1366
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,310
confined setting like a ship going from London

1367
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,130
to New York.

1368
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,670
Everyone on there has free will to go

1369
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,190
wherever they want on the ship, but they're

1370
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,390
all going from London to New York, whether

1371
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,330
they like it or not.

1372
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,210
Right.

1373
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,630
But but while you're on that ship, I'm

1374
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,470
calling it free will.

1375
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,810
But is it really free will or more

1376
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,590
like choices?

1377
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,390
It is choices or choices.

1378
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,850
You're going to go sleep in your cabin

1379
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,710
place, whatever they call that game where they

1380
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,970
slide discs on the deck.

1381
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:49,730
Right.

1382
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,830
Shuffle shuffle board.

1383
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,030
Yeah.

1384
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,310
Or in the theater or, you know, go

1385
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:55,650
look at.

1386
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:56,950
Yeah.

1387
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,670
Go look at all the fake.

1388
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,630
Look at the women, all the fake implants

1389
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,790
and and tattoos.

1390
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,390
All right.

1391
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,790
No, whatever.

1392
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,450
You know, you guys movies.

1393
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,590
I mean, some of these I recently saw

1394
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,650
a video where it was like a vintage

1395
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,910
break dancing thing.

1396
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,110
These guys came out and this this vintage

1397
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,230
breakdance or a guy who was a breakdancer

1398
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,730
back in the 80s was an old now

1399
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,910
old, much older.

1400
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,770
He these people, young guys, modern were trying

1401
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,450
to do breakdance lesson to the white people

1402
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,270
on the ship and cruise.

1403
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,370
And I thought it was a mall, but

1404
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,330
it was actually a cruise ship.

1405
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,830
That's how big they look.

1406
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,070
It looks like the inside of a mall.

1407
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,170
Anyway, it was funny because the guy in

1408
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,310
the video, he comes out and he's giving

1409
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,230
the white boys instruction.

1410
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,570
I can imagine why they're trying to break.

1411
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,230
So he comes out.

1412
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,290
He just does incredible breakdancing because he was

1413
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,170
the breakdancing champion in Canada in like 1985.

1414
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,310
And they were like, oh, where'd this guy

1415
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:50,850
come from?

1416
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,710
You know, right.

1417
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:52,930
It was funny.

1418
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,290
But but the reason I brought it up

1419
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,830
is because I thought we were inside of

1420
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,010
a mall, a shopping mall.

1421
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,350
You know how the lobby, you know, the

1422
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,630
inside rotunda is looking.

1423
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,510
But it ended up being a cruise ship

1424
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,190
because they have these really fast moving glass

1425
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,130
elevators and all that.

1426
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,750
So I keep forgetting on how elaborate they're

1427
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,510
like basically cities that float.

1428
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,190
Right.

1429
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:09,710
Right.

1430
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:14,470
Floating cities, literally, you know, if you in

1431
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,630
other words, if you lived in a small,

1432
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,910
medium sized town and you went to one

1433
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,130
of the big malls, I like the one

1434
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:19,590
in Tennessee.

1435
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,130
What is it?

1436
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,730
The shopping mall of the Americas, the biggest

1437
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:23,450
one in the country.

1438
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,950
I've been in Nashville or something.

1439
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,970
It's been in that one.

1440
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,550
But anyways, it's it's it's more than so

1441
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,190
if you're on a week cruise is more.

1442
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,230
There's more.

1443
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,890
You can spend more than a week and

1444
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,310
still not see everything on the ship.

1445
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,990
Yeah.

1446
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,790
Yeah.

1447
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,110
That's how they're set up.

1448
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,170
So anyway, I'm giving that as a metaphor

1449
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,710
for life.

1450
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,050
So do you really have free will in

1451
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,890
the ship or do you have lots of

1452
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,290
choices?

1453
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:42,710
Right.

1454
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,770
Because your ultimate free will is to jump

1455
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,850
off and be shark food because then you

1456
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,750
wait for the resurrection.

1457
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:49,650
You'll be just fine.

1458
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:57,470
So anyway, I don't see much on the

1459
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:57,710
emails.

1460
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,110
Yes, there's quite a few emails.

1461
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,870
Let's say last week was what?

1462
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,010
The 20th, 21st or 20th.

1463
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,430
Let me see.

1464
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,670
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1465
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,850
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

1466
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,330
17, 18, 18 emails.

1467
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,650
I've seen them all since last week.

1468
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,290
So it's not much, but nothing much.

1469
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,430
Either answer back or I will get to

1470
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:26,630
them.

1471
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:27,430
Right.

1472
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,270
Nothing really to bring stuff I brought up

1473
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,530
already.

1474
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,490
Yeah.

1475
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,450
OK, if I don't know nothing else, anyone

1476
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:37,930
else?

1477
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,610
Nothing at all.

1478
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:40,930
No.

1479
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:41,870
All right.

1480
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:50,260
Well, oh, another thing I'm experimenting with.

1481
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,120
I think I brought up kratom before, right?

1482
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,020
K-R-A-T-O-M.

1483
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,700
It's an opioid.

1484
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,500
It's legal.

1485
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,920
It's an herb.

1486
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,240
It's in the coffee family.

1487
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,280
People that are trying to get off of

1488
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,500
prescription painkillers have a problem.

1489
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,740
Actually, I've gotten some emails since I've mentioned

1490
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,040
they've tried it and they got off of

1491
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,800
some medication that was real nasty without getting

1492
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,380
the side effects of withdrawal using kratom.

1493
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
And I recommend the green.

1494
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,740
It's also good for pains and other things.

1495
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,160
Some people, it gives them a higher sexual

1496
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,540
drive.

1497
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,300
Other people, it kills their sexual drive.

1498
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,080
So whichever, you know, you got to experiment

1499
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,340
and see which way it works for you.

1500
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,760
But there's another one called Moringa.

1501
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,500
It's M-O-R-I-N-G-A,

1502
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,100
Moringa.

1503
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,740
And it's a leaf.

1504
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,080
It's on its own genre.

1505
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,760
It's not like kratom, which is in the

1506
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,780
coffee family.

1507
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,360
And it's 24.

1508
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,200
Moringa, it's similar to kratom.

1509
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,560
It doesn't.

1510
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,100
It's not an opioid, though, so it won't

1511
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,520
have the pain killing properties.

1512
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,120
And it may not help with withdrawing from

1513
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,440
chemical opioids and heroines and things like that.

1514
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,440
But it is, giving an example, it's more

1515
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,000
nutritional.

1516
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,100
It does give a feeling of euphoria.

1517
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,440
It is antibacterial, antifungal.

1518
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,320
It is an organ stimulant, antioxidant, and it's

1519
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,820
25% protein by weight.

1520
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,340
Let me say that again.

1521
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,340
25% protein by weight.

1522
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,960
Let me give you an example of that.

1523
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,340
Chicken.

1524
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,180
When you eat chicken, I think you get

1525
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,000
15% protein by weight.

1526
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,140
So this is a plant, and it's 25

1527
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,720
% protein.

1528
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,180
Beans are like 7% protein by weight.

1529
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,340
I'll give you an example.

1530
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,800
So Moringa, if you want to type it

1531
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,500
in the chat, I'm not in front of

1532
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,620
the computer, and I'm going to make a

1533
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,380
coffee, either for the Sonic, if we're going

1534
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,540
to continue or not.

1535
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,260
But try it out.

1536
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,780
If anyone wants to experiment with it, it

1537
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,620
ends up being about $10 for a half

1538
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:44,980
a pound.

1539
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,520
It's cheap.

1540
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,740
It's like 20, I don't know, less than

1541
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,580
10 cents a gram.

1542
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,620
Give it a shot if you're looking for

1543
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,180
a supplement.

1544
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,100
It's a euphoric, it's an energy.

1545
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,680
Yeah, it does every organ in the body

1546
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,180
pretty much.

1547
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,700
Well, all the soft tissue, it aids soft

1548
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,300
tissue organs.

1549
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,520
And I just got some today.

1550
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,660
I've been playing around with it.

1551
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,460
And it gives you like a little bit

1552
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,440
of euphoria also, but it's not an opioid.

1553
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,260
It's not an opioid like Pratam.

1554
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,460
So that's another thing for the toolbox.

1555
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,240
I think I gave it a quick whirl

1556
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,860
on Amazon.

1557
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,660
I mean, Amazon shows up, they sell it,

1558
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,700
like 12 bucks for a pound of it

1559
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,200
or something, organic.

1560
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,900
Yeah, Moringa.

1561
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,200
So anyone want to try it out?

1562
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,060
What I do with that is when I

1563
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,300
try something like that, I have a Popsicle

1564
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,600
stick.

1565
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,360
You just get a pack of Popsicle sticks

1566
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,740
at the arts and crafts or the dollar

1567
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,040
store.

1568
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:40,680
Sure.

1569
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,800
And you just dip like a half inch

1570
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,460
into it, whatever comes up, scoop, put that

1571
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,780
on your tongue, have it with a warm

1572
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,180
liquid.

1573
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,680
You don't want to ever do that with

1574
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,140
a cold liquid.

1575
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,360
It's always a warm liquid.

1576
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,040
Right.

1577
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,440
Not hot either, just warm.

1578
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,940
And yeah, it smells like hay.

1579
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,140
I would recommend it's on the on the

1580
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,660
thumbs up list, like the Pratam.

1581
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,460
Sure.

1582
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,740
You know, for people that want to look

1583
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,320
for something.

1584
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,560
The Pratam actually has saved certain people's lives.

1585
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,960
And I've gotten that firsthand.

1586
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,880
People who are certain painkilling drugs that couldn't

1587
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,580
get off and had various body aches, backaches,

1588
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,560
injuries, mood swings, whatever.

1589
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,340
Wow.

1590
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:26,760
Yeah.

1591
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,500
The Pratam has actually saved people's lives, believe

1592
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,680
it or not, because, you know, withdrawal from

1593
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,220
certain a lot of these prescription drugs that

1594
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,280
are painkiller or whatever, like Prozac, even in

1595
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,960
the mind control, things can drive people to

1596
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,860
suicide or, you know, to the point where

1597
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,460
they don't want to.

1598
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,020
Right.

1599
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:45,900
Yeah.

1600
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,380
So.

1601
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,640
Yeah.

1602
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,420
And I'm not saying like suicide is bad,

1603
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,540
like when you see in the movies, you

1604
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,120
got a ship full of people and the

1605
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,200
alien is going to eat him and he

1606
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,760
says, well, I'll stay back with the alien

1607
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,620
and blow it up.

1608
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,280
OK, great.

1609
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,420
You know what I mean?

1610
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,100
Right.

1611
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,940
You know what I'm talking about, right?

1612
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,440
Right.

1613
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:04,760
Right.

1614
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,480
Yeah.

1615
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,180
We'll let the we'll let him come in

1616
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,040
and you guys get on the escape pod

1617
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,060
and I'll blow him when he gets in

1618
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:11,320
here.

1619
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,080
So, I mean, that's valiantry or whatever, you

1620
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,240
know.

1621
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,540
Yeah.

1622
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,740
But these people are all depressed.

1623
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,760
Of course, if you're not, you know, if

1624
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,820
you don't have the causality of depression, you're

1625
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,200
an idiot.

1626
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,820
You know, people say, I'm depressed.

1627
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,760
The world is unfair.

1628
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,600
Well, it's like you got to hear it

1629
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,580
from a depressed person.

1630
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:30,900
Shit.

1631
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,560
Of course, everything they say is true.

1632
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,340
If you don't know that you're a fucking

1633
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,460
moron, of course.

1634
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,820
I mean, it doesn't mean you have to

1635
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,380
be lethargic and complaining and whatever in a

1636
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,180
way that's, you know, some people say I

1637
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,540
complain, but I'm when I find it sounds

1638
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,280
like a complaint, I'm filling in the rest

1639
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,540
of it to make it edifying, you know.

1640
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,260
Right.

1641
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:49,840
Right.

1642
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,480
Exactly.

1643
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,560
So, there you go.

1644
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,540
Moringa kind of rhymes with moron, Inga.

1645
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,480
But anyway, Moringa, M-O-R-I-N

1646
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:04,940
-G-A.

1647
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,580
It's got the thumbs up so far.

1648
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,120
Look it up.

1649
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,740
The other one is Kratom.

1650
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,420
K-R-A-T-O-M.

1651
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,200
Get a green.

1652
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,260
I prefer I've tried the whites and the

1653
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,040
reds that don't do much for me actually

1654
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,100
makes me feel like part of the furniture.

1655
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,500
But the energy, the upper, the green Malay

1656
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,600
or green horn, I like.

1657
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,400
I enjoy that.

1658
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,180
Yeah.

1659
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,120
Fascinating.

1660
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,980
You could do them together.

1661
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,580
I think I just did some earlier, a

1662
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,220
little bit of the Kratom and then I

1663
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,880
waited and then did it actually about a

1664
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,660
couple of hours and I did the Moringa

1665
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,380
to try it.

1666
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:42,900
It's pleasant.

1667
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,240
You ever have a really good vitamin smoothie

1668
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,100
or whatever or vitamin drink and it gives

1669
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,860
you like that momentary, lasts about 20 minutes

1670
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,480
feeling of euphoria because you just got an

1671
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,460
energy drink or whatever.

1672
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,740
It's kind of like that.

1673
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,220
So, there you go.

1674
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,440
And it is tropical.

1675
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,780
So, if you're having problems with staying warm,

1676
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,000
if it's cold out, probably unseasonably cold by

1677
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,740
you, Bruce, right?

1678
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,500
Oh, yeah.

1679
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,540
Yeah.

1680
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,180
I'm still aiming north, by the way, with

1681
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,720
the weather guns for two weeks now.

1682
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,600
I haven't moved anything.

1683
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,760
I have a large gun that's just parked

1684
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,180
there open with water dripping in it only

1685
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,780
because the valve doesn't shut all the way.

1686
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,380
And remember, it doesn't freeze here yet overnight.

1687
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,060
Right.

1688
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,860
And I have another translator that's pointing north

1689
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,500
and it's creating a tremendous amount of weather

1690
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,000
on the entire northern conveyor all the way

1691
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,840
to the Middle East.

1692
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,100
It's just creating these large spinoffs because years

1693
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,080
ago, when I talked about certain things with

1694
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,580
Trevor, he says, oh, never block the north.

1695
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:47,880
Never.

1696
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,320
Whatever you do, don't block the north.

1697
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,960
So, guess what I'm doing?

1698
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,500
Blocking the north.

1699
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,360
Never block the north.

1700
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,740
So, good.

1701
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,000
What if I block the north?

1702
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,440
He says, no, don't ever do that.

1703
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,760
Well, it's given me great weather here and

1704
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,020
fucked up weather downstream.

1705
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:04,900
Sure.

1706
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,920
So, what me Wimmer Mad Magazine?

1707
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,720
What me worry?

1708
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,580
Yeah.

1709
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,700
So, I give it a nudge every day

1710
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,360
too, which is not fair because if you

1711
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,060
don't move it around just even a sixteenth

1712
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,200
of an inch, it gets ignored.

1713
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:18,960
Right.

1714
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,460
Right.

1715
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,560
But we'll turn it around maybe in a

1716
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,340
week and we'll make it really warm where

1717
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:25,760
you are.

1718
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,580
How do you like that?

1719
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,440
Do you want to do that?

1720
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,260
All right.

1721
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,320
You'll have to coordinate.

1722
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,200
I go, I always dress appropriate for it

1723
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,820
no matter what.

1724
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:36,600
Yeah.

1725
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,940
So, anyway, again, these powders and leaves and

1726
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:45,080
botanicals that I mentioned, they're technically botanicals, are

1727
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,080
tropical sourced, but they are dehydrated and ground

1728
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,220
up, which does change them not as much

1729
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,680
as a pickle would change something, but it

1730
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,440
is dehydrated, it is slightly changed.

1731
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,320
It will eventually catch up to you if

1732
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,820
you're in a really cold climate, no matter

1733
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:08,480
how processed or pickled or transmuted, in quotes,

1734
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,860
a tropical source food is, it will still

1735
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,300
have a negative effect on you.

1736
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:12,880
Right.

1737
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,160
Because I remember a couple of times I

1738
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,360
was out in the field and it was

1739
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,600
15 degrees during the day and like five

1740
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,240
degrees at night and everyone had coffee and

1741
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,900
I said, I'm having coffee too, and that's

1742
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,080
why I'm having such a hard time.

1743
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,100
So, I stopped the coffee and I felt

1744
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:27,960
better.

1745
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:31,550
Yep.

1746
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,150
I watch how much I drink during the

1747
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:33,410
winter.

1748
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,540
Well, it depends.

1749
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,000
Here, it's like 75 during the day Fahrenheit

1750
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,580
and as cold as 40 at night, for

1751
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,720
midnight, towards the morning.

1752
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:48,400
Right.

1753
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,380
But 75 during the day, so it's okay.

1754
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,300
Yeah.

1755
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,460
You're not breathing cold air every time you're

1756
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:55,660
outside.

1757
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,940
As a matter of fact, it's still, if

1758
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,020
you go into a closed car in the

1759
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,700
sun, it's hot, even in the winter.

1760
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,120
So, it's Southwest, right?

1761
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:04,960
Yeah.

1762
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,800
That's where all the old people go to

1763
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,160
die years ago.

1764
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,600
You know this, or does it go down

1765
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,860
as Florida or Southwest?

1766
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,020
Florida gets all the Jews and the Southwest

1767
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,140
gets all the white people from the Midwest.

1768
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,640
Oh my.

1769
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,840
All the Jews from the North Northern seaboard.

1770
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:28,820
Yeah.

1771
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,700
From Jersey and New York and Massachusetts go

1772
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,380
down to Florida.

1773
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,940
I mean, it sounds like I'm being whatever,

1774
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,500
but it's true.

1775
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,810
If you ever go down to Boca Raton,

1776
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,980
you ever go down to Miami, it's very

1777
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,140
strong Jewish presence.

1778
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,520
It was like many, as a matter of

1779
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,780
fact, the Duke place is called Hollywood, Florida.

1780
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,460
Anyway, as usual, not much going on in

1781
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,140
the chat.

1782
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:58,820
No.

1783
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:06,720
With the new Greeks chat and nothing in

1784
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,640
the emails that I see noteworthy.

1785
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,860
And I guess we'll just call it a

1786
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,100
Sonic.

1787
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,140
Alrighty.

1788
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,040
We can do.

1789
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,240
Okay.

1790
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,560
We'll see you again next week.

1791
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,080
Thanks, Bruce.

1792
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:22,560
Okay.

1793
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,460
You take care now.

1794
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,740
