1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,620
Greetings folks, we're live with the Greek, and

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,740
how are you doing tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,480
Greetings, okay, we're here.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,700
Yeah, another Teriyaki Tuesday.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,520
Yes.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,720
So, I just got in and looking at

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,620
some emails, I guess, and I don't know

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,860
if there's anything pressing.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,660
So, anything you've seen in the chat?

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,940
A little bit of activity in here.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,320
Okay.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,700
Yeah, there was a few, now that I

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,200
recall.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,500
Let me get this box out of my

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,980
way here.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
Actually, I'll open one up that is listed

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,140
questions here.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,860
But, yeah, not much going on other than

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,540
it's the winter season, and it's pervasive to

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,260
what to expect in the winter season.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,320
For the folks that are upside down, it's

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,080
the middle of their growing season, or beginning

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,780
of a hardy growing season, depending on the

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,120
crop.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,620
So, yeah, but everything goes cross-latitude on

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,440
the north in terms of prophetic stuff, and

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,060
what you might consider the ways of the

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,580
world, the seasonal ways of the world, is

29
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,480
where the northern hemisphere dominates.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,100
I don't think the southern hemisphere ever dominated

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,880
on any cultural or even phenomenal stuff.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,740
I can't recall anything either.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,940
Hey, I was going to ask you, anything

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,000
that you noticed with the rotting season this

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,620
time around?

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,160
Yeah, it came sort of like right before

37
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,980
winter and fall.

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,900
Here, it's very balmy and warm, and then

39
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,540
winter comes, which is still just cool, not

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,940
cold.

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,540
Rotting season for this part of the world

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,480
came around fall, end of fall like it

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
usually does.

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,560
There seems to be one that comes either

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
in the middle of the winter or towards

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
the beginning of spring for some.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
The rotting season is interesting because it is

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,880
really sustained by its geographical location.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,360
What I mean, sustained, it is in essence

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
part of the geography.

51
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,100
It's not like spring, summer, winter, or fall.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,720
So it would be in different places?

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,460
Yes, it's different.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,320
And again, the rotting season is, if you

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,820
kept, let's say, something perishable at a constant

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,380
temperature, it will spoil faster during the rotting

57
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:42,780
season.

58
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
Wounds don't heal as fast.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,040
Things that are fermented tend to over-ferment.

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,020
Interesting.

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,600
I've been keeping an eye out ever since

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,020
you brought that out, and it just kind

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,740
of periodically just crosses the mind.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,780
Well, at one point I was crazy enough

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,540
to do a basic yeast culture in a

66
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,400
jar with a single hole in it so

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,920
it could breathe.

68
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,340
You know how you put the insects in

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,380
a jar and you put a hole on

70
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,880
top, right?

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,080
With a ballpoint pen was the classic way

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
to do it back in the 60s and

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,060
70s.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Well, you just do a small yeast culture,

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,080
very little.

76
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,220
You don't need a colony, you just need

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,380
evidence of reaction.

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
With a tiny little hole, because a lot

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,160
of CO2 builds up, and you just watch

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,360
it.

81
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,460
And you have to redo it every week.

82
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,140
You can't just do it once and let

83
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
all the seasons go by.

84
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,640
You have to do it every seven days.

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
You dump it out, put a new one

86
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
in, and you just monitor it.

87
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,220
You'll notice during the rotting season it just

88
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,080
goes crazy, and you start getting multicolors like

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,360
purples and reds and blues, where at the

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,060
other time of year you don't get that.

91
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,580
Very interesting.

92
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,200
But you know what I have to say

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,880
about that, right?

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
Why bother?

95
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,620
Who are you going to tell?

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,660
You're not going to be allowed to do

97
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,920
this academically, and most people can't listen to

98
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,380
it anyway.

99
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,120
It's just good for one's own knowledge.

100
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, they're very small.

101
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,220
In other words, that's a good time that

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,940
if you were going to do, let's say,

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,480
pickling or preservation, or even wrap a bunch

104
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
of notes that you're going to bury in

105
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,080
the backyard or something, or something that you

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,380
want to put away for a long time,

107
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,520
don't do it during the rotting season, because

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,420
it will be more susceptible to decay when

109
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,320
you're putting it away.

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,840
Very, very interesting.

111
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,260
So there are a lot of reasons why

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,100
you want to understand that particular cycle for

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
the person that is considering those things.

114
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,120
When do you have more decay than others?

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,240
I guess the reason I brought that up

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,780
is I myself, I work basically with cardboard.

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,940
Opening this, taking that out, in a repetitory

118
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,680
kind of way throughout the day.

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,600
And throughout the whole year, not a problem

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,340
with the hands.

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,840
And then all of a sudden it's like

122
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,260
super dry, super cracked, super, what the H

123
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,960
is going on?

124
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,560
And I'm thinking to myself, boy, this is

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,980
just too winky dinky.

126
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,920
Okay, a very simple, considering your age, you're

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,220
older than 35, and considering where you are,

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,760
typical skin cracking, dry eczema, dandruff even, things

129
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,860
like that, or too much protein in the

130
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,000
diet, specifically animal protein, and or highly processed

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
oils, fats.

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,560
Not regular fats like olive oil or just

133
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,500
fat you'd have on meat, but processed fats.

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah, too much protein in the diet.

135
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,180
Which also causes inflammation.

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,800
I would use what they call macrobiotic diagnosis

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,440
on that.

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,640
You'd have to look at your face, you'd

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,840
have to look at your lower eyelid, your

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,160
lower lip, your chin.

141
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,920
Take a pulse in the abdomen, the various

142
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,380
glands, and to see your state.

143
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,380
In other words, whether you're typically constrictive and

144
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,460
forceful internally, or very relaxed and, let's say,

145
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,940
flowing.

146
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,220
If it's relaxed and flowing, then it most

147
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,360
likely is not a yang manifestation, and it's

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,340
just a manifestation through the skin alone.

149
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
But typically, like for example, in a lot

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,420
of the ancient healing arts, people who had

151
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,480
bad skin would go to these healers and

152
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
they'd say, what do I do about this

153
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,000
bad skin?

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,920
And they're like, are you joking?

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
That's a blessing.

156
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,380
Because people who have bad skin typically are

157
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:01,220
manifesting some sort of adverse reaction externally versus

158
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,960
internally in the internal organs.

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,680
It's an interesting coincidence.

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,640
Also, you could look at people who die

161
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,800
of severe cancers have beautiful skin.

162
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
Very interesting.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,780
Yes.

164
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,380
Right.

165
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,040
So people who tend to have bad skin.

166
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm not talking about a skin condition.

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,520
I'm talking about eruptions, manifestations that come and

168
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,580
go, whether it be called acne or sores

169
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,340
or whatever, that it's actually better to manifest

170
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,680
on the skin than have sores on the

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:31,920
liver.

172
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,780
You're right.

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,260
Exactly.

174
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,360
Typically, people who have really bad skin, not

175
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,140
bad skin, but typically because their skin looks

176
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,160
battle-torn because they have multiple manifestations on

177
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,080
it during their lifetime, have pristine internal organs.

178
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Very interesting.

179
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,900
It's very interesting that you brought that up,

180
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,200
though.

181
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,920
So if the diet was the same throughout

182
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,900
the year, so the winter months with the

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,780
coldness seems to bring out more of a

184
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,460
manifestation to the hands then?

185
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,940
It could be, but also the hands are

186
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,980
an extremity, right?

187
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,720
So it's furthest away from the core.

188
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,840
But also, even though the diet is the

189
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,580
same, is it?

190
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,220
Is it the same chicken or the same

191
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,600
hamburger?

192
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm not saying you eat that.

193
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,660
Or the same bean or the same rice?

194
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:15,940
No.

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,580
The crop changes.

196
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,880
So let's say you were on a veggie

197
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,820
diet and that happens.

198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,000
What's your source of food?

199
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,660
So someone says, oh, I'm vegetarian.

200
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,420
I eat rice and beans and potatoes all

201
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,840
year round.

202
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,940
Then I'm getting this, right?

203
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay, well, it's not the same crop.

204
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Most even organic.

205
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,679
You know, most food that you buy at

206
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,780
the stow is done cooperatively, meaning you have

207
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,180
the label, the big label, and they buy

208
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,500
from lots of different farms.

209
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,420
And then they take samples and then they

210
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,120
batch it all together to get a crop

211
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,260
quality that they want.

212
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,620
Makes sense.

213
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,460
It really does.

214
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:56,840
Yes.

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,880
Thank you for that.

216
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,880
That's where it pays to be a local

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,780
vore, to eat locally only, if you can.

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,780
If you can.

219
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,860
You know, there's an old photo.

220
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,680
I think I might have seen it on

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,740
the Rectangle a while back about eating whole

222
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:13,980
food.

223
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,840
They had two brothers that were separated at

224
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,560
young childhood.

225
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,900
The photo was about 80 years old or

226
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,880
50 years ago.

227
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,980
One of the brothers lived out in the

228
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,620
country where they were born, and the other

229
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,360
brother, they were separated at five or six,

230
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,020
was raised in a suburban and urban environment.

231
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,180
And then they show a picture where they

232
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,560
met.

233
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,000
And the guy that lived and ate off

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,340
the farm had all his teeth.

235
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,580
He had great skin, great hair.

236
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,600
The guy who had lived in the city

237
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,720
looked 10 years older, was missing some teeth.

238
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,420
I'm not saying, you know, he could have

239
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,840
gotten into a fight and lost his teeth.

240
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,640
But still, you could see he was weathered

241
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,580
and worn.

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,480
Right.

243
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,360
You know, that's funny you bring that up.

244
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,980
I was talking to my mom a while

245
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,260
back, and she mentioned all the people that

246
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,020
she knew that stayed on the farms and

247
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,220
lived are still living today.

248
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,760
The ones who moved to the cities, no

249
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,040
more.

250
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
Most likely, yeah.

251
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,440
It's not because cities are bad.

252
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,400
It's just the way that they're put together.

253
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,500
I think it's bad, meaning not good.

254
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,960
There's a lot of big changes from moving

255
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,380
from the country to the city.

256
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,920
Big, big changes.

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,360
You know, diet is definitely inclusive.

258
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,540
Well, there's many levels to it.

259
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,760
You know, the cities for the past century

260
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,800
have been experimental, like guinea pigs.

261
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,620
If you live in a city, you're a

262
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,820
guinea pig to the sovereign state, essentially.

263
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,240
I mean, how many times have you heard

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,960
of all the experimentation and all this that's

265
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,480
going on?

266
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,840
So, you can't control people if they're rural.

267
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,360
There are not enough bombs in the world

268
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,840
to get rid of people living in the

269
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,600
country, but if you pack them in a

270
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
city, it's easy to control them.

271
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,620
Easy peasy.

272
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,140
Yeah.

273
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Which is, you know, I mentioned the bomb

274
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,720
thing.

275
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,080
You know, they've been scaring people with, you

276
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,360
know, nuclear holocaust, meaning burning up the entire

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,000
world and all.

278
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
That can't happen.

279
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,580
They don't have enough ordinance to do that.

280
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,960
It can't be done from land-based operations.

281
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,780
No matter how much ordinance you have on

282
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,840
the earth, shooting it to another part of

283
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,920
the earth, you will never...

284
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,720
The most you can do is, like, maybe

285
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,660
1% damage.

286
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,840
The most.

287
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,980
In order to destroy a planet surface, it

288
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,120
has to be done from off-planet.

289
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,560
So, never bother about...

290
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,100
I don't think the people are stupid enough

291
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,240
that listen to this to go fall for

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,040
climate global warming and nuclear...

293
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,740
Destroying the whole world with nukes and all

294
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,840
this.

295
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,760
I think they're above and beyond that, but

296
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,040
I just wanted to make that point because

297
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,440
I don't think I've really said it before.

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,060
It's not possible to do that.

299
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,260
You know, one scenario...

300
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,480
I was having a discussion with someone at

301
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,140
an auto parts store recently about that.

302
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,040
And the reason why is, let's say America

303
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,380
launches a thousand nukes towards Russia and vice

304
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,740
versa.

305
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,900
The moment one or two nukes start going

306
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,760
off, it renders all the other ones useless,

307
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,160
right?

308
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah.

309
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,020
I mean, people are not too smart.

310
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,460
They just believe whatever they hear because everyone

311
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,060
else does.

312
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah, so anything I haven't looked at the

313
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
chat, I just kind of...

314
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:26,980
Oh, yes.

315
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,940
I have a couple of email things here.

316
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,360
Wes sent a bunch of questions.

317
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,780
This guy Dave sent a bunch of questions.

318
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,160
Lawful money questions I just got today here.

319
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,580
Someone sent a thing that says, Greetings.

320
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,980
I was curious if there's a way to

321
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,860
monitor internal health of the body without the

322
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,780
prankster-style monitoring, like EKG, blood pressure, etc.

323
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,160
My simple answer to that was, maybe living

324
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,780
it is better than monitoring it.

325
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,540
Right.

326
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,340
I was working in the bicycle industry years

327
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,540
ago.

328
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,080
There was a guy who was diagnosed with

329
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,980
testicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer.

330
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,200
He was given three months to live.

331
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,140
So he came in and spent five grand

332
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,260
on a bike and all the accessories to

333
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,360
do a cross-country trip.

334
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
He figured he'd rather die on the road

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,400
on a bike trip than in a hospital.

336
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
Comes back six months later.

337
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,420
There's no cancer, nothing.

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,540
He lost 40 pounds.

339
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,220
He feels great.

340
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,540
So what is...

341
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,060
Serious.

342
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,960
And he ate hot dogs and hamburgers all

343
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,460
the way there.

344
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,620
Yeah, that's a testimony right there.

345
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,580
I think I brought up on the Ocelli

346
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,940
about how diabetes has nothing to do with

347
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,620
sugar and insulin.

348
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,880
That was a fascinating little drop of info.

349
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,280
Oh yeah.

350
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
Although I've never really gotten into that.

351
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,020
I need to write it down or do

352
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,420
a specific sonics on just health.

353
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,720
We talked about food.

354
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
But I've got a whole list of approaches

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,640
to the causes of all these things that

356
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
people talk about in terms of diseases.

357
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,980
I gave the diabetes out because I was

358
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,740
working with someone on that case with success.

359
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,540
It worked.

360
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,860
It says nothing to do with blood sugar.

361
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,160
That's like you get a burn from a

362
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,460
heat lamp and you don't tell the doctor

363
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,380
what it is and he'll just say, Oh,

364
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,400
that's just a rash.

365
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,420
Here's some cream.

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,180
They don't know the causes of things.

367
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,340
I think someone posted in there a warning

368
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,780
about 20th century medicine.

369
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
These people are horrible people.

370
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,820
You should, by the way, read the writings

371
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,280
of the Rockefeller Center, turn of the century.

372
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,380
Their whole purpose was to enlist people that

373
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,980
were cruel and powerful and whatever because the

374
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,040
law of the jungle and they need to

375
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,320
inflict whatever they feel like on the society.

376
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,860
The stuff is just amazing when you read.

377
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,240
The sick people, the medical people and the

378
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
legal people.

379
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,520
For example, you know how they did the

380
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,320
CIA torture years ago with the Bush administration?

381
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,540
You need to torture people.

382
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,580
No, you don't.

383
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,840
Because they have all the telephone conversations recorded.

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,380
They already know everything about you.

385
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,420
The reason they're torturing people is because it's

386
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,280
part of their religion.

387
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,320
They just like cruelty stuff.

388
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,960
Just like animal testing, they don't need to

389
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,240
put acid, straight up acid, into a rabbit's

390
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,060
eye or a dog's eye to find out

391
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,780
how bad it is.

392
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,140
These are sick people.

393
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,860
I'm not saying this because I read something

394
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,220
online.

395
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,060
I've actually run into people that worked in,

396
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,100
let's say, testing or something of food products

397
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,820
and makeup.

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
These people are sick.

399
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,760
They just hurt animals just for the sake

400
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,420
of hurting animals.

401
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,320
They're sick people.

402
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,140
Just like when you run into people in

403
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,600
the military.

404
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,420
I know Vietnam vets and they're like, man,

405
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,280
I'm glad I got out of there.

406
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Those people were sick.

407
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,180
They just wanted to kill people.

408
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,700
It didn't matter.

409
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Even just now, I've read letters sent home

410
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,780
from the Iraq war around the 2003, 2004,

411
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,660
2005 period from colonels, officers.

412
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,560
We're not talking about infantry grunts.

413
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,320
They're saying my own men are killing each

414
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
other more than the enemy is, so-called

415
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,580
enemy, and I'm more afraid of them.

416
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,200
You hear a lot of that.

417
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,740
Oh, yeah.

418
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,440
We're talking about the psychiatric society, which is

419
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
crazy themselves.

420
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,940
They've declared 28% of the American population

421
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,620
as insane.

422
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,700
I think it's in the 90% range.

423
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,220
The 30% should be locked up or

424
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,160
put on a boat and sunk or whatever

425
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,680
you've got to do, institutionalized.

426
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,980
So in a sense of discussing things in

427
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,000
a sane manner, considering that you're going to

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,300
be going out into a neutral environment and

429
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,240
practicing sane, healthful, and productive things is ridiculous.

430
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,420
Because you're surrounded by just crazy people.

431
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,460
You can go into the spiritual side, and

432
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,040
of course they're being oppressed demonically, but eventually

433
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,420
the root cause may not matter in this

434
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,200
case because either way it's best to stay

435
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,940
away from them.

436
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,540
Whether it's just chemical, spiritual, or cultural.

437
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,900
So on one aspect, I think that it's

438
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,339
good to share knowledge, really, about all kinds

439
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,380
of subjects that we've done.

440
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,640
But on the other subject, I think it's

441
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,800
best to do it on a need-to

442
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,220
-know and when it's asked.

443
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,079
If you start putting out too much, you

444
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,480
might actually become a target.

445
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,839
Unfortunately, I don't do YouTube.

446
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,859
The business world, they have a thing where

447
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,860
I know 10 years ago, or a little

448
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,040
bit more than 10 years ago, if you're

449
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,880
a company and you started getting above $150

450
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,340
million a year in earnings through the IRS

451
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,520
monitors and all that, they infiltrate you.

452
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,600
It doesn't matter what you are, even if

453
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
you made clothes hangers.

454
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,000
They put someone in there to watch you.

455
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,520
So everything is controlled.

456
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,000
YouTube with 10,000 subscribers, you start saying

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,900
stuff, you're a target.

458
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,220
By the idiots.

459
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,820
Because they're afraid of their position.

460
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,700
They're afraid of the people because their position

461
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,520
is very weak.

462
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,060
If I ever speak about any kind of

463
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,020
leadership in a negative way, that's not because

464
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,560
it's negative on its own.

465
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,420
It's because the people want it that way.

466
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,500
It's the masses that are wicked and evil

467
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,040
and corrupt, not the leadership.

468
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,100
And you might say, well, Greek, that doesn't

469
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,020
make sense because it is.

470
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,660
Yes, it is.

471
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,560
But if the masses, let's say, were not

472
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,000
wicked, evil and corrupt, 90% of them,

473
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,400
if not 99%, the current leadership would not

474
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,660
last more than a few days in anything,

475
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,800
whether it's the medical, legal, religious or whatever.

476
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,840
It doesn't matter.

477
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
They can't last.

478
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,940
There's no way.

479
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,100
A few days and they'd be gone.

480
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,980
It doesn't matter how big they are.

481
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,840
People talk about the Federal Reserve or the

482
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,720
FBI or the CIA or the Queen or

483
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,200
the Pope.

484
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,800
None of that.

485
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,280
The Pope would last a week if the

486
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,020
people knew what it was about.

487
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,020
Oh, not even.

488
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Not even a week.

489
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
A week maybe underground.

490
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Maybe a day on the surface and a

491
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,300
week underground.

492
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,260
They'd still fish around.

493
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah.

494
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,480
It's not them.

495
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,200
People are like, oh, what are we going

496
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,060
to do about this corrupt people?

497
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,260
What are you talking about?

498
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,460
That is a product of the general society

499
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,120
and every society is that way.

500
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,620
You might even have a condition where a

501
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,940
smaller group, like 20%, right, will grab the

502
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,160
power and hold it.

503
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,100
But even then, they have to maintain the

504
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,580
others in ignorance and acquiescence.

505
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,020
The National Socialist Party, what they call the

506
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,820
Nazis in Germany, the most they've ever had,

507
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,340
I think, was 21% of the people

508
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,940
acknowledging their right to rule.

509
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,280
The most they had, right?

510
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
And they didn't last, obviously, right?

511
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,160
Right.

512
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,040
They had to leave.

513
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,340
You know, I think I mentioned with Ocelli,

514
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,980
oh, boy, I don't want to say this.

515
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,540
You know, Ocelli, I like him.

516
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,200
I really do.

517
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Yeah.

518
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,400
But it's just like after a while, it's

519
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
like, oh, man, okay, I've got to get

520
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,100
off here because it's just I'm losing him

521
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,420
and I'm losing the audience and it's just

522
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,780
the wrong whatever.

523
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,260
But I do appreciate all this stuff.

524
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,740
I think you did a very fine articulated

525
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,100
piece of work, this last one with him.

526
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,300
Very fine.

527
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,520
Yeah.

528
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,640
You know, I don't have anything prescripted, so

529
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080
I have to think about what I'm going

530
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,680
to say and have a flow.

531
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,340
And then he comes up with things that

532
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,820
are just like, you didn't just say that,

533
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,020
right?

534
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
You know, you didn't just say that, did

535
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,320
you?

536
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
But you didn't let him bother you and

537
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,580
you just ran through it, which was good.

538
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,040
I ran it a couple of times because

539
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,620
there's got to be someone out there with

540
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,920
a couple of brain cells to get.

541
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,440
But anyway, the whole thing is, you know,

542
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,220
and actually, believe it or not, here's the

543
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,960
thing about Ocelli.

544
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,760
We make a good team, by the way.

545
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,560
It's like Abbot and Costello, who was on

546
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,060
first or whatever, but in some cases better,

547
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,000
in some cases worse.

548
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,180
But in a sense, like some moron listener

549
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,120
said, you know, Jordan Maxwell said about the

550
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,860
Nazis and the Nazis.

551
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,360
Anybody makes a reference like that?

552
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,960
There is no such thing as a Nazi.

553
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,380
That is a pejorative term written that was

554
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,600
created by a journalist named Haydn.

555
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
I think it was Haydn.

556
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm not in front of a computer.

557
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,160
Look it up, H-E-I-D-E

558
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,420
-N.

559
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,900
He was a journalist, and he was a

560
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,860
harsh critic of them in the 30s, and

561
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,840
he called them Nazis as a pejorative.

562
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,220
Right.

563
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,060
When that was brought up, I was like,

564
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,840
give me here the niggers.

565
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,060
Well, the niggers are a tribe, N-I

566
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
-G-A-R, in the Netherlands.

567
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,260
Right?

568
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,180
Right.

569
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,500
So is that a valid term?

570
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,660
Yeah, as a tribe.

571
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,640
But if you say nigger regarding black people,

572
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
that's not a valid term.

573
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,000
So why are you using Nazis?

574
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:47,960
Right.

575
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,040
That's the same thing.

576
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,860
It's like saying gooks, bick, nigger, kike, whatever.

577
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,560
Why are you?

578
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,780
And the academic community is using it.

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
It just shows you how stupid people are.

580
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,640
Look it up.

581
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,640
The term...

582
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,780
Hold on.

583
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,840
Let's see if I can get it up.

584
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,360
Who invented the term Nazi?

585
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,800
I think it was Haydn.

586
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,240
He was a journalist.

587
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,970
Nazi invented...

588
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,060
See, it even tells you, even in Wikipedia,

589
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,060
that it was a derogatory term.

590
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,620
Yeah, Haydn.

591
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,320
Conrad Haydn.

592
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
K-O-N-R-A-D-T-I

593
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
-D is the one who invented it.

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,580
A little mealy-mouthed whatever guy.

595
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,340
Here, there's a little thing here.

596
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,720
It says, meet the Jew who created the

597
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,260
word Nazi.

598
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,960
The term Nazi along with Nazism is a

599
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,620
political epithet invented by Conrad Haydn during the

600
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,480
1920s.

601
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:49,720
Okay.

602
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,620
The means of denigrating Hitler.

603
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,020
Okay.

604
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,260
The term Nazi is a variation of a

605
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,400
nickname used to reference...

606
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,500
Okay.

607
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,780
So anyway, it's just like, you know, it

608
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,640
doesn't make any...

609
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,660
I mean, just the path of humanity is

610
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,140
absurd.

611
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,120
So, you know, you should look like you're

612
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
going with the rest because they're dangerous, you

613
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,420
know.

614
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,520
You ever watch a good spy movie and,

615
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,560
you know, he has to create a distraction

616
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,240
to get out because they're on him, right?

617
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,900
Mm-hmm.

618
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,520
And then when he gets into the crowd,

619
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,060
he kind of acts like everybody else.

620
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,300
Right, right.

621
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,380
You know, it's just, yeah, this is the

622
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,240
real reality.

623
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,100
So, yeah, there's a couple of ways to

624
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,840
approach any subject, but unfortunately this is not

625
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,980
the society to do it in a way

626
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,100
where it's exceptionally truthful or outgoing.

627
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,440
Outgoing in a good way.

628
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,900
If you're going to be outgoing, you better

629
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,180
look like everyone else.

630
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,380
So, and I'll go through a bunch of

631
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,440
other questions here, I think.

632
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,980
There was a fellow asking about families being

633
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,100
broken up.

634
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,620
Of course.

635
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,220
You mentioned that before, and he was wondering

636
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,680
if that was found in the Bible, that

637
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,200
particular...

638
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,880
The Bible, yes, it is, actually.

639
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,240
Father against son, mother against daughter-in-law,

640
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,800
brother against brother, and children will rule over

641
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,040
you.

642
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,840
Yeah, but here's the thing.

643
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,140
I've talked about something called a mindset, right?

644
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,600
Mm-hmm.

645
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,720
It's part of the operating system and part

646
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,700
of the program, not the information.

647
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,660
You have so many people being fed information,

648
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,360
whether they remember it or not or have

649
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,300
access to it, they can't discern it.

650
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
So when you discern Scripture, basically what you

651
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,240
get out of the whole thing is there's

652
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,180
a time limit to why things are going

653
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,700
on, and it tells you what's going on

654
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,760
and how it's going on, and not a

655
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,580
lot of the why.

656
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,460
Very often the why is a very general

657
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,940
statement, because they're unlawful, because they're greedy, because

658
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,480
they mistreat widows and orphans, and you get

659
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,820
all that.

660
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,920
But if you put it all together, you

661
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,760
basically see that the historicity of Scripture shows

662
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,800
you that humans are divided and ruled by

663
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,140
patron and matron deities.

664
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,700
The chief creator takes on one country as

665
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,580
an example, right?

666
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,860
And then when this example is set, you

667
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,760
see that there's a recurring theme of the

668
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
people chasing after other gods, which means other

669
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,660
laws, other culture, other...

670
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,360
And now, okay, what's wrong with that?

671
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,420
Well, what's wrong with it is the nature

672
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,680
of it is wicked and evil.

673
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,740
It's based on human sacrifice, child sacrifice, lying,

674
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,120
stealing, this, that, and the other.

675
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,860
Now, if you look at, for example, from

676
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,380
a corporate sense, whether it's a business or

677
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,340
a family, meaning the bodies coming together, one

678
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,280
of the promises that are given, general and

679
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,060
specifically, that these corporations, meaning the family, you

680
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,220
know, corporeal, meaning people coming together, or nations,

681
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
or groups, or religions, are going to be

682
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,400
broken up because they're basically practicing demonology.

683
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,020
Makes sense.

684
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,900
So, if you can look, when is it

685
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,800
important for families, you hear about them traveling

686
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,880
and coming together cross-country all over during

687
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,260
the holidays, and the holidays are 100%

688
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,080
demonic, right?

689
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,800
Right.

690
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,480
So you're not going to stop, you're going

691
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
to keep doing that?

692
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,960
Well, okay, so if we break up the

693
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,900
family, now you can't come together because there's

694
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,240
no family to come together to.

695
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,040
Right.

696
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,520
Right?

697
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,840
Yep, makes sense.

698
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,500
You know, like they want to take away

699
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,820
the guns, I'm like, well, just take away

700
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,440
the ammunition.

701
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:42,820
Right.

702
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,400
It's like, take away the cars.

703
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,020
No, don't take away the cars, take away

704
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,400
the fuel.

705
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,820
Right?

706
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,600
Yep.

707
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,720
So, you want to get rid of people,

708
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,620
take away the food.

709
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,720
Done.

710
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,440
And the water.

711
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,920
Don't go after the people.

712
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,580
You want to kill a monster, don't go

713
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,180
try to kill the monster, especially when it

714
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,020
has impervious defenses.

715
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,300
You just go after its food source.

716
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
The source of what makes it go.

717
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,560
So what's making families go?

718
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,560
There are these wicked holidays, so they're not

719
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,220
going to stop.

720
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,160
So, okay, it has to stop.

721
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,540
So if they're not going to stop, then

722
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,760
we have to get rid of the family,

723
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,260
you see.

724
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,380
This is not direct in scripture, but it's

725
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,580
part of the scriptural mindset.

726
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,820
It's very simple, like, you know, where does

727
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,020
it say in the Bible that anybody who's

728
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,160
got tattoos is going to be killed?

729
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,420
Well, it doesn't say that exactly, but if

730
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,920
you understand the premise of the law and

731
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
when it becomes severe, what happens?

732
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:37,900
Right.

733
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,260
Right?

734
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,040
It's very obvious.

735
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,360
Only one outcome.

736
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,960
You do understand that the current world powers

737
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
in the future will use biblical law as

738
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
an international law.

739
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,260
So if the entire earth is under a

740
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,960
misused and overly applied law form, when the

741
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,120
law form calls for exile, where do you

742
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,700
exile them to?

743
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,500
Right.

744
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,300
Nope.

745
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,300
Six feet under, or in a furnace, or

746
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,580
whatever, in the ocean.

747
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,860
So, there's a mindset that most people lack

748
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,620
in anything, any subject.

749
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,860
You want to look at the legal community,

750
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,920
they don't know any law.

751
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,860
The medical people don't know any medicine.

752
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,040
I've had many conversations, for example, with doctors

753
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,040
of senior level, and instead of discussing and

754
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
being inquisitive about the actual conversation we're having

755
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,200
about biological vacuum and many other things, they

756
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,980
just constantly refer to their training and education.

757
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm like, leave that aside for now.

758
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,140
Let's just have a free conversation.

759
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,500
And if I bring that subject up, they'll

760
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,720
say, well, they taught us this.

761
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,480
We always do this.

762
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,580
It's like, okay, I know.

763
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,120
Just stop for a moment.

764
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,920
And we're not talking about young students.

765
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,040
We're talking about people in their 50s, 60s

766
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,340
that are still practicing medicine.

767
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,300
Wow.

768
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,560
They can't handle it, because what does that

769
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:57,940
tell you?

770
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,260
It tells you that they're relying on their

771
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,680
training.

772
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,580
Yeah, they all are that way.

773
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,440
And the ones that aren't have left the

774
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,280
industry.

775
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:06,760
Yeah.

776
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,900
It's really sad.

777
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,020
Yeah, once they've got that nudge in them,

778
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,920
you can't shake it from them.

779
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,040
No, or when they figure it out, they

780
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,240
leave.

781
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,020
They can't stay in the conversations that way.

782
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,460
That's why I want to make a statement.

783
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,940
That's why I want to make a statement.

784
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,800
The Supreme Court justices don't know any law.

785
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,280
They don't.

786
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,760
Because if they did and tried to use

787
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,240
it, they'd die in a car accident or

788
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,380
suicide or whatever.

789
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,540
Or they'd have to quit.

790
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
All the district attorneys, all the people, they

791
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,000
don't know any law.

792
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,840
Because the moment they do and they try

793
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,960
to apply it, they're out of there.

794
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,600
All of them.

795
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,360
There is no exception to that.

796
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
That is a hard fact and truth.

797
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,960
Same with the medical doctors.

798
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,500
The moment they figure out how the body

799
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,840
works and they try to use it, they're

800
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,320
out of there.

801
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,260
Not a one is in there that does

802
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,360
that.

803
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,840
Not a one.

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,380
You can't.

805
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,580
Not only is the system set up to

806
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,980
do that covertly, but their own colleagues are

807
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,520
trained to do that covertly.

808
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
And overtly.

809
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,600
The same with the police, the Leos.

810
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,780
None of them know any law, law enforcement.

811
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,220
None.

812
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,360
The moment they do, they're out of there.

813
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,600
Two weeks or six months, they're done.

814
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,200
They're finished.

815
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,680
Done.

816
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,820
It sounds like Greek, that sounds extreme.

817
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,840
Yeah, I know, it is extreme.

818
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,460
That's the truth.

819
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,200
This is the same with all your subjects.

820
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,640
None of the priests, none of the ministers,

821
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,700
none of the pastors, none of the whatever,

822
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,760
know the Bible.

823
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,400
The Scripture.

824
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,680
None of them.

825
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,340
And the moment they do, they quit, or

826
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
they have to be out of there.

827
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
None of them do.

828
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,300
It's very simple.

829
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,480
That's not a general statement.

830
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,080
That's a very specific, that's like gravity.

831
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,000
You know, or air.

832
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,780
Here's a question.

833
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,820
Is there anything you can discuss regarding self

834
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,100
-defense against an immediate threat of another human

835
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,440
being?

836
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,260
Well, that's an oxymoron, because most human beings

837
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,220
are an immediate threat.

838
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,800
But, yeah, Bruce Lee was asked that, he

839
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,300
says, run.

840
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,180
Distance is the best, right?

841
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,880
Self-defense is an interesting thing, because if

842
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,000
you're moving, you don't have to defend yourself.

843
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,440
Defense means, it's like when I hear about

844
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,020
defense, like you're cornered, and you can't go

845
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,420
anywhere.

846
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,120
That's a whole different subject.

847
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,020
Then you need to defend yourself.

848
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,940
Right.

849
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,520
There's very little defense, by the way.

850
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,380
It's always offense.

851
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,420
That term is in competition and defense.

852
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,780
Those things are completely misunderstood.

853
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,920
There is no such thing.

854
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,560
Even on the playing field, when I say

855
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,900
we're playing defensive, they're not.

856
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,120
Because it's a psych-out.

857
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,400
In other words, if someone, if you know,

858
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,360
let's say you have two opponents, whether it's

859
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,720
sports or military or just individuals or whatever.

860
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,400
When someone puts up such a strong defense,

861
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,020
the other person doesn't become offensive, because they

862
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,660
view the defense as being so great to

863
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,260
their offense, that it's futile.

864
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,860
So it's the same as them being offensive.

865
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:09,520
Right?

866
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,760
And usually a defense requires firing back or

867
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,220
blocking or disabling in some capacity.

868
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,400
So there is no self-defense.

869
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,120
So movement, separation, distance.

870
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,500
Okay.

871
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,900
Are there also subtle preventative measures to consider

872
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,940
regarding one's vibe when willingly giving off to

873
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,420
other people via communication, eye contact, posture, pace,

874
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,820
that affect the chance of one being targeted

875
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,860
as an insidious onlooker in the first place?

876
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,220
Yes.

877
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,300
Because you're there.

878
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,020
If they can perceive you, it's not good.

879
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,200
You should walk like a shadow unless you

880
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,100
want to make yourself known.

881
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,280
Don't peacock around.

882
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,880
We can get into this a lot in

883
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,500
discussion in terms of vibe.

884
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,140
Like how many times have you, anyone rhetorically,

885
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,340
gone traveling and you stop at a motel

886
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,080
or a hotel, they give you a perfectly

887
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
clean room, and you're like, no, I don't

888
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,960
like this room.

889
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,500
I'm not sure what's wrong with it.

890
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,780
I'd like another one.

891
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,140
Or you walk into a conference room that's

892
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,580
clean and empty, and you're like, this doesn't

893
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,040
feel good.

894
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,980
Well, maybe if you find out what had

895
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,320
just happened in that room, like just two

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,260
people arguing that left, they leave a vibe,

897
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,700
a lingering vibe like that.

898
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,920
Right?

899
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,840
So that's the subtle stuff.

900
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,400
If anyone wants to do more research on

901
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,440
like Emoto, you know, where you, Misoro Emoto,

902
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,500
the water, where he cursed one glass of

903
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,600
water and blessed the other with rice and

904
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
various things, and the one that was cursed

905
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,900
was, you know, okay.

906
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,900
If anyone wants to do more of an

907
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,440
objective outlook on that, because, you know, he

908
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,800
had to sell it to the new age,

909
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,320
and he was kind of new age himself.

910
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,420
But if you want to figure out how

911
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,720
the vibe works and all that.

912
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,580
His experiments did speak wealths of information.

913
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,720
But, unfortunately, he handled it a little cockeyed.

914
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,780
See, when I hear people saying love and

915
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,780
hate, they don't even know what that means.

916
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,639
So even though the outcome is positive when

917
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,560
they say love, and the other thing is

918
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,100
hate, and the negative outcome, that's still just

919
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,920
description-based.

920
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,020
It doesn't help anyone.

921
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,719
Right.

922
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,520
In terms of furthering it forward.

923
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,960
They can just do these little petty experiments.

924
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,420
They say, see, it works here, too.

925
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,980
Yeah, but they don't know why.

926
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,100
How do you develop that?

927
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,300
Because they don't know what love or hate

928
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,699
is.

929
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,580
And why that change in that structure, given

930
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,780
those things?

931
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,080
I mean, are we influencing, or is it

932
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,400
just a natural phenomenon within the water?

933
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,020
Yes, well, it's more than natural.

934
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,560
It's esoterically natural.

935
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,120
That's why when I say love, most people

936
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,860
feel they can't define it, but they like

937
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,020
it.

938
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,440
Because it's the esoteric emotion, meaning you can't

939
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,960
explain it.

940
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:55,560
It's measurable.

941
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,580
It's an esoteric thing, too, you know.

942
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,840
Right, it's an esoteric.

943
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,980
Another thing is to take it out of

944
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,460
the esoteric and make it practical.

945
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,420
Like a touchscreen 40 years ago was esoteric

946
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:06,620
technology.

947
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,800
Now all the rectangles have them, and it's

948
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,140
normal.

949
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
If you took it away, what happened to

950
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,820
this normalcy, right?

951
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,640
So in other words, when I say taking

952
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,300
it from an esoteric point and making it

953
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,260
practical, no one's doing that.

954
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,180
They're stuck.

955
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,480
They're censored.

956
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,620
Because that's very important to understand.

957
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,520
The censorship limits man's development until it's time

958
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,220
to develop.

959
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,060
And you can't do it on your own.

960
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,540
Like if a 10-year-old wanted to,

961
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,040
let's say, get in a car or whatever,

962
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,480
it can be done.

963
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,180
It's best done with an adult around.

964
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,560
I wouldn't just give them the keys and

965
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,480
say go, right?

966
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,220
Right.

967
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,480
Right.

968
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,300
So, I mean, we've done that.

969
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
By the way, I was maybe seven or

970
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,000
eight and a whole bunch of us at

971
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,660
a gathering, and there was a bunch of

972
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,920
Cadillacs and Jaguars outside with the keys in

973
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,340
the ignition.

974
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
And all the adults are by the pool

975
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,720
party, and we're like, hey, let's grab a

976
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,100
car for a joyride.

977
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,420
And it was scary because you couldn't really

978
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,040
barely see over the dash.

979
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:06,920
Barely.

980
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,860
I mean, especially those older cars with the

981
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,560
bench seats.

982
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,340
You sunk in, and you're like, oh, shit,

983
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,040
I can hardly see, but I can fly.

984
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,460
I could fly this thing, you know, like

985
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,780
a boat.

986
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,760
It was like driving a ship, you know?

987
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,460
Yeah.

988
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,260
You know how when you're on the bridge

989
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,520
of a ship, it has a very narrow

990
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,820
window?

991
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,600
Big old boat.

992
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,020
Yeah.

993
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,540
So, I mean, you can do it.

994
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,760
It's not I don't recommend it.

995
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,720
So that's the thing.

996
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,520
People just won't have it until the time.

997
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,300
This is like stuff for the next society.

998
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,660
Again, because if you did substantiate why saying

999
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,460
love into one thing makes it helpful and

1000
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,720
hate in the other degrades it, when that

1001
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,040
becomes more practically based and explained, obviously it's

1002
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,020
going to be used negatively against people.

1003
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,720
It's going to be weaponized against.

1004
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,980
But I think there are people that know

1005
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,420
about that, but they're limited also.

1006
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,620
I think the weaponization and the stuff that

1007
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,800
is available to those that do know and

1008
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,640
the owners of all the nations or whatever,

1009
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
they have a tremendous amount, not of it

1010
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,960
necessarily being new, but of most of it

1011
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,980
being things that you've heard in legend, you

1012
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,680
know, like even like the Vamanas that you've

1013
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:19,980
heard of.

1014
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,640
You know, there's evidence of the Vamanas as

1015
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,980
recent as 800 years ago, which are the

1016
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,140
flying, you know, craft that were around, and

1017
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,120
there's evidence of them 2,000 years ago.

1018
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,460
So, you know.

1019
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,880
That's interesting, yeah.

1020
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,240
Yeah, so.

1021
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,580
Oh, there was an interesting thing you dropped

1022
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,340
in the channel about Tatara.

1023
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,360
Tatara, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,620
The mud flood.

1025
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,720
That's kind of a dummy load, that's like

1026
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,280
flat earth.

1027
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,440
Okay.

1028
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,860
Yeah, that's like flat earth, but the thing

1029
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,540
is, the part about flat earth or mud

1030
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,540
flood or all these other things, that what

1031
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,440
I do enjoy about that, right, is that

1032
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,040
basically, except that everything you've been told is

1033
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,660
a lie, and then we have to revisit

1034
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,260
it, right?

1035
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,620
Right.

1036
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,780
I found it interesting with the pictures with

1037
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,140
all the absence of people.

1038
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,880
That was kind of eerie in itself.

1039
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,480
Yeah, but I've seen that in Manhattan, living

1040
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,120
in Manhattan years ago also.

1041
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,180
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1042
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah, on a Sunday, what they call in

1043
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,160
the Pope's work schedule, Sunday morning anywhere in

1044
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,740
Manhattan, it's going to be pretty much no

1045
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,280
one around.

1046
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,780
You can go online right now and look

1047
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,100
at Manhattan empty streets, and there's tons of

1048
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,780
photos, any major city.

1049
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,560
I mean, I like to, like when the

1050
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,360
pagans have their holidays, I like going out

1051
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,380
in the morning and traveling through town.

1052
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
It's like a ghost town.

1053
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,580
Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,360
That's pretty simple to do.

1055
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:49,900
Yeah.

1056
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,520
But again, what I do like about that

1057
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,540
and the flat earthers and whatever is that

1058
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,020
instead of presuming that we are informed, they

1059
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,420
presume that everything is a lie, which it

1060
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,580
is, but they don't have the tools or

1061
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,440
the discernment or the mindset to see through

1062
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,460
it quickly and come to a more holistic

1063
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,140
conclusion that can help anyone.

1064
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah, okay.

1065
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,880
Yeah, they lack that, but that's fine.

1066
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,660
When I see flat earthers and mudflat and

1067
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,040
all that other stuff, it reminds me of,

1068
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,480
what's the book written about where the children

1069
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,720
are shipwrecked on an island?

1070
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,120
Lord of the Flies.

1071
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:26,780
Right.

1072
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,120
Yeah, so here you have a bunch of

1073
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,260
five-year-olds to 11-year-olds that

1074
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,880
could start a society, you know, and they

1075
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,160
can't.

1076
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,400
They'll just end up being the worst, representing

1077
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,280
the worst of.

1078
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,160
So in essence, part of the flat earthers

1079
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,360
and mudflat and all this other stuff and

1080
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,860
a lot of the JFK read 9-11,

1081
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,900
in one essence, researchers, represents the worst possible

1082
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,060
alternative thinking, right?

1083
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,140
Okay.

1084
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,260
Because they just jump to conclusions, and if

1085
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,640
you don't believe this, you're a government agent

1086
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,500
or you're screwed up or whatever, you're a

1087
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,880
shrill or whatever.

1088
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,740
Yeah, so they're pretty – it's like Lord

1089
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,200
of the Flies.

1090
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,980
They're too immature.

1091
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:03,980
Yeah.

1092
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,000
As a general rule, there might be some

1093
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,780
exceptions, like Dmitry Kalazov is one exception that

1094
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,360
I can name.

1095
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,620
And then there's others that have done good

1096
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,660
work, but they can't get out of their

1097
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,480
own way, you know, and then you just

1098
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,520
got to – that's where you pick the

1099
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,140
corn out of the edible poo, and after

1100
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,400
a while, you're like, you don't want any

1101
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,640
poo at all, so then you got to

1102
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,500
leave that also.

1103
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

1104
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,480
Research.

1105
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,900
Let's see.

1106
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Greetings.

1107
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,300
If there is a sonic tonight, I wondered

1108
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,840
if the Greek would expound on what's going

1109
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,260
on with the vacuum when hiccups occur.

1110
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,340
Diet appears to be a cause and a

1111
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,220
solution, but wanted to inquire for the sake

1112
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,940
of better understanding the vacuum.

1113
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,840
As always, thank you.

1114
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,660
Yeah, the hiccups are electrical, just like digestion

1115
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,440
is electrical.

1116
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,880
So remind me about the hiccups.

1117
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,700
Another question here.

1118
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,240
I just want to finish this particular email.

1119
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,820
Okay, go ahead.

1120
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,100
Is stigmata just another example of demonic entity

1121
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,820
screwing with humans?

1122
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,760
Nothing I'll see here.

1123
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,740
Or dummy load both?

1124
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,720
Yes.

1125
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,300
If people could see what's around them.

1126
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,760
Right now, anyone listening, if you had the

1127
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,360
spiritual vision, you might see anywhere between 5

1128
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,600
,000 to 5,000 demons around you.

1129
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,640
I mean, that's how populated they are with

1130
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,100
humanity.

1131
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,860
There's trillions of them on the planet right

1132
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,120
now, especially after what they call 1998.

1133
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,640
They're unleashed on the world, right?

1134
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,540
What are thoughts and what is thinking?

1135
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,340
How are they different?

1136
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,760
How important is to know the difference?

1137
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,960
I haven't really gone into this much.

1138
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,200
I brought up the concept of external input.

1139
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,020
You know, there's really nothing inside of you.

1140
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,300
Even scripture, you know, the kingdom of God

1141
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,940
is near you.

1142
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It doesn't say it's in you.

1143
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,860
There is no God in you.

1144
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,480
That would be like a nightmare for a

1145
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,180
God to be inside of a human.

1146
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,040
You know, only demons do that to an

1147
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,440
occasion.

1148
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,640
So everything is external, by the way.

1149
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,080
So thinking is very simple.

1150
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,300
And thoughts are one thing and thinking another.

1151
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,360
A thought that comes in or occurs is

1152
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,260
like you go online and you download something.

1153
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,900
That's the thought.

1154
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,260
The thinking is when you start working on

1155
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,320
the monitor or on the computer what you've

1156
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,780
downloaded.

1157
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,620
It's executed.

1158
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,460
So, yeah, the thinking is on the hard

1159
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:18,760
drive.

1160
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,980
Like, one is, you know, and the thought

1161
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,660
would be RAM.

1162
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,660
You know how thoughts escape people?

1163
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,580
I change the thought.

1164
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,500
Okay, the thought is the RAM on a

1165
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
computer, random access memory.

1166
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,120
And the thinking would be what's on the

1167
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,960
ROM, what's on the hard drive.

1168
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,510
Or chewing the cud.

1169
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,390
You know, thinking would be walking the aisles

1170
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,130
at a supermarket, let's say, or a store.

1171
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,270
And, I mean, thoughts would be walking the

1172
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,230
aisles in a supermarket or a grocery store

1173
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,810
and thinking would be in your pantry.

1174
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,030
Okay, right.

1175
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,090
Thoughts are optional.

1176
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,870
And the thoughts are external and the thinking

1177
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,110
is the processing internally, which is still not

1178
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,790
really internal.

1179
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,930
It's just that you're on your cloud server

1180
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,670
that's dedicated to you.

1181
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,330
And I have many thoughts on that.

1182
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,110
Like, the beings that operate the cloud server

1183
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,430
that you interpret as thinking have to be

1184
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,850
neutral.

1185
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,690
They're not benevolent or malevolent.

1186
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,210
They have to be neutral because if they

1187
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,310
were all, you know, by order having to

1188
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,590
work only for the benevolent, then they would

1189
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,350
filter out and prevent bad thoughts and evil.

1190
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,610
So they're neutral.

1191
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,610
They're like in a total neutral zone.

1192
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,670
But I don't have a handle on that.

1193
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,330
Greek prove that.

1194
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,550
I don't, but there's a pretty good thesis

1195
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,190
that can be written up about it once

1196
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,450
you understand external input.

1197
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,230
But I constantly tell people, all the scientists,

1198
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,630
they know a lot about the brain, but

1199
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,190
they know nothing about the mind or the

1200
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,470
spirit.

1201
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,290
Right.

1202
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,080
So that, you know, even though I say

1203
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,780
it's internal, it's not internal.

1204
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,280
It's just like having, if you had an

1205
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,720
external server somewhere that you were accessing, you

1206
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,300
still have the random surfing and then you

1207
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,360
have the stuff that's downloaded on the server

1208
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,040
to work.

1209
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,760
Sure.

1210
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:16,940
Right?

1211
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,620
I think Max Tom Browser is all external

1212
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:19,880
now.

1213
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,620
Whenever you bookmark something, it's not really on

1214
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,280
your computer.

1215
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:24,700
Right.

1216
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,680
Unless you dupe it somehow.

1217
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
So the question about hiccups.

1218
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,080
If you ask any gastrointestinologist, pathologist or whatever,

1219
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,300
any people that work with internal organs, they'll

1220
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,960
tell you it's all electrical impulses to keep

1221
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,460
them going.

1222
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,340
I mean, the hiccup almost feels like an

1223
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,560
electrical impulse, doesn't it?

1224
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,200
Think about it.

1225
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:47,800
Yeah.

1226
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,170
Huh.

1227
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,590
So it's like a short circuit of some

1228
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,150
sort then.

1229
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,230
Yeah.

1230
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,410
They say drink water.

1231
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,230
It's not really the water that does it.

1232
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,130
There's a technique where you drink the water

1233
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,990
from the opposite side of the glass or

1234
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,770
something that someone does that always works with

1235
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,210
hiccups.

1236
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,710
I'm serious.

1237
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,670
You drink it from the opposite forward leading

1238
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:12,930
edge.

1239
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,050
Usually when you drink from a cup, it's

1240
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,930
the trailing edge.

1241
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,290
You tilt it towards yourself.

1242
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,750
But this time you try to drink from

1243
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,470
the opposite side of the glass.

1244
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,230
It's very awkward.

1245
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,610
And what that does is it starts firing

1246
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,950
up nerves and muscles in a way which

1247
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,170
are also electrically not used to.

1248
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,590
It creates this ball of extra static electricity

1249
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,730
in the body and it shorts out the

1250
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,070
hiccup.

1251
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,350
That's interesting.

1252
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:38,370
Yeah.

1253
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,270
Some people have hiccups and they can't get

1254
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:40,690
rid of them.

1255
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,510
It could be life threatening, very rare, but

1256
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,030
it can be.

1257
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,290
Oh, yeah.

1258
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,550
I would go for an electrolyte, salt water

1259
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,450
or something.

1260
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:48,430
Yeah.

1261
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,090
Or literally if you are set up for

1262
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,990
bioelectric medicine, do some of that, which is

1263
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,110
sitting in a chair, barefoot, copper plate on

1264
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:58,790
the left foot.

1265
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,650
Are you familiar with certain setups where you

1266
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,050
have the copper plates on your feet?

1267
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,410
You're talking bimetal here of some form?

1268
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,750
Yeah, it could be bimetal where you have

1269
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,750
a galvanized pipe of iron on the right

1270
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,450
hand connected to a copper on the left

1271
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:18,750
foot.

1272
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,530
And vice versa.

1273
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,130
Yeah, I mean, again, that's a whole other

1274
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,550
sonic.

1275
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,930
I mean, that could be, you know, it's

1276
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,070
like, why bother, you know?

1277
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,610
I mean, any of these subjects, I could

1278
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,930
stand up in front of an audience and

1279
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,670
speak for eight hours on them without repeating

1280
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,450
myself once.

1281
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,450
But it's like, you know, and I look

1282
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,130
around and I'm like, this world, nah, not

1283
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:41,710
this planet.

1284
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,550
So I think the only way it would

1285
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,910
be done is for other people to come

1286
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,450
around and, you know, writers and just put

1287
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,250
it together and sell it.

1288
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,110
It should be sold.

1289
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,590
It shouldn't be just given.

1290
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,950
It should be given freely, but not in

1291
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,530
the sense that people consider it.

1292
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,070
It needs to be part of, let's say,

1293
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,010
an agenda that goes to those that work

1294
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,590
in the field, not just, you know, the

1295
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,210
common person.

1296
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,890
Oh, that's going to be a good thing.

1297
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,010
Because it's ultra premium stuff.

1298
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,210
But on the other hand, you know, the

1299
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,470
best things in life are free.

1300
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,330
And, you know, that's why we do these

1301
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:21,710
sonics.

1302
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,930
I mean, here's the thing.

1303
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,110
When I give out the thing about what

1304
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,110
diabetes is or the hiccups, I mean, that's

1305
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,470
like more than a major hint or a

1306
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:31,630
clue.

1307
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,070
It's actually a statement that anyone who's interested

1308
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,330
can take that and build on it.

1309
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,670
That's like you want to build a house

1310
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,290
and here comes like five cement trucks and

1311
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,150
they pour all this concrete.

1312
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,430
Well, you got your foundation done.

1313
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,330
All the heavy work is done.

1314
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,390
So if I come out and speak for

1315
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,830
30 seconds on something, you've got 90 percent

1316
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,210
of all your foundation to go.

1317
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,790
Go.

1318
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:52,630
Fly.

1319
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,330
Go, birdie.

1320
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:53,730
You go.

1321
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:54,910
You're ready.

1322
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,230
There's no need for me to do a

1323
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,030
one-hour explanation on it.

1324
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,430
You've gotten a thousand times more than anyone

1325
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,770
ever gave me, I should say.

1326
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,030
So go for it.

1327
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,070
That's all you need.

1328
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,870
Actually, because when you give a lot to

1329
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,410
someone, they get lazy and complacent and then

1330
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,030
they want more.

1331
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,290
Then they're pencil pushers, you know.

1332
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,430
They're not getting any dirt under their fingernails.

1333
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,790
And it's not for this society anyway.

1334
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,630
Let's say someone wanted to back this up

1335
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,230
and put a million bucks behind how the

1336
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,130
body really works.

1337
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,430
You'll all be dead in six months if

1338
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,730
you push it through all the channels.

1339
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,970
If you push it too far.

1340
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:33,530
Yeah, yeah.

1341
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,410
It'll be shorter than what I'm thinking.

1342
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,330
Is that where you want to go?

1343
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,030
Yeah.

1344
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:37,410
Yeah.

1345
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,030
Those accidents on trees are just that.

1346
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,230
Yeah.

1347
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,450
Speaking of dead, I wonder why they've probably

1348
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,470
been meditating a little bit on the news.

1349
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,430
There's some Navy moron, the Admiral, that they

1350
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,370
say committed suicide.

1351
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,030
Do you know how rare it is for

1352
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,210
that to be in the publicity?

1353
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,470
Yeah.

1354
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,550
For the Navy Admiral to commit suicide in

1355
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,030
Bayron?

1356
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,170
Now, if you need to translate that into

1357
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,650
plain language, what they're really saying, well, there's

1358
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,470
no information on how the suicide took place.

1359
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,630
So it could be two or three bullet

1360
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,730
holes in the head, right?

1361
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:12,590
Right.

1362
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,150
The other thing is, if it was a

1363
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,190
suicide, and they always call it apparent, what

1364
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,850
they're telling you, okay, let's say it was

1365
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:20,890
a bona fide suicide.

1366
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,490
What they're telling you is a degradation to

1367
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,390
the Navy, because in this culture, when you

1368
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,610
say suicide, it usually refers to a coward.

1369
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,330
Couldn't handle it.

1370
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,290
He broke, killed himself.

1371
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,310
So what they're telling you is the Navy

1372
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,730
is run by cowards, or that branch of

1373
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,430
the military are cowards, worthless.

1374
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,110
Right?

1375
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,710
Now, on the other hand...

1376
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,070
That's a slap.

1377
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,210
Oh, yeah, big time.

1378
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:46,930
Because cowards only...

1379
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,250
By the way, there's nothing against suicide in

1380
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,970
any of the ancient texts.

1381
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:52,410
Right?

1382
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,390
It's just people, the religions frown on it,

1383
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,510
but none of the...

1384
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,370
It's not unlawful to do that, by the

1385
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:58,550
way.

1386
00:49:59,170 --> 00:49:59,750
Checking out.

1387
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:00,950
Right?

1388
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,970
The religions tell you not to do it

1389
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,690
because they want to keep you around because

1390
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,910
you're a pretty good slave.

1391
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,470
But there's nothing in scripture about it, there's

1392
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,530
nothing in any ancient text, or holy writ,

1393
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,530
that says you shouldn't commit suicide, by the

1394
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:13,670
way.

1395
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,390
So don't be confused with the demonic religion

1396
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,730
stuff.

1397
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,790
You forgot to mention prophet.

1398
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,830
Yeah, prophet as in F-I-T.

1399
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:24,810
Right.

1400
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,450
So, in essence, they're telling you that this

1401
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,810
guy is a coward, his Navy is run

1402
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,970
by cowards, they're worthless.

1403
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,390
Right?

1404
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,430
Or they're degrading it.

1405
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,090
Okay.

1406
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,850
On the other hand, if it was a

1407
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,070
suicide...

1408
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,510
But on the other hand, if he was

1409
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,050
taken out, that also doesn't look good, because

1410
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,690
why did they take him out that way?

1411
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,250
Why couldn't they get him to step down

1412
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,810
and retire?

1413
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,230
Well, there's two ways.

1414
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,950
You know, taken out meaning three bullet holes

1415
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:52,930
in his skull.

1416
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,450
He shot himself in the mouth with a

1417
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,230
shotgun after he crushed his skull.

1418
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,650
Right?

1419
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:58,590
That kind of stuff.

1420
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,010
Right.

1421
00:50:59,570 --> 00:50:59,870
Right?

1422
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,810
Or he jumped out of a window, or

1423
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,430
he was locked in a duffel bag with

1424
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,970
three holes in his head that was zipped

1425
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:07,270
up.

1426
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,490
That kind of stuff.

1427
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,890
If it was like that, which I think

1428
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,550
most likely it is, is because...

1429
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,050
Remember how I said that all the people

1430
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,390
in power are blackmailed, right?

1431
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:16,110
Right.

1432
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,570
All of them.

1433
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,650
They're not going to let anyone in more

1434
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,450
than a few months...

1435
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:21,830
That is not.

1436
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,610
I need some leverage.

1437
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,050
He probably...

1438
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,190
The other thing is he probably figure...

1439
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,730
I says, you know what?

1440
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,990
Screw this blackmail stuff.

1441
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,510
So what if they got a photo of

1442
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,730
me with a penis in my mouth?

1443
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,390
Right.

1444
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,950
Or screwing a young boy or whatever.

1445
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,250
I don't care about that.

1446
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,650
I'm just going to tell people that's how

1447
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,170
it works, and I'm going to go out

1448
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,550
and give them this, tell them what's going

1449
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:38,830
on.

1450
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,290
And they got rid of him that way.

1451
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:40,870
Yeah.

1452
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,620
So...

1453
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,800
And they're all like that.

1454
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,500
And it's so stupid.

1455
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,540
It's funny when people that like TRUMP and

1456
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,620
other people that don't...

1457
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,900
And it's just funny to watch them.

1458
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,900
And I'm thinking what photographs do they have

1459
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,420
of this guy?

1460
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,560
Is he humping a donkey?

1461
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,320
Is he humping a boy?

1462
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,840
Is he filleting a black man?

1463
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,120
I mean, what's going on?

1464
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,420
How is this guy up?

1465
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,720
You know, there's none of them are there.

1466
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,260
None.

1467
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:07,800
Zero.

1468
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,480
Without being compromised.

1469
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,560
So when they're taken out...

1470
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,880
The same with Kennedy, by the way.

1471
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,260
Kennedy was compromised.

1472
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,120
All of them are.

1473
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,080
It goes all the way back before, you

1474
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,480
know, up to the Civil War, by the

1475
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:19,640
way.

1476
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,460
Lincoln was also.

1477
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,480
So anyway, Micka...

1478
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,180
And actually, what I'm saying Lincoln was compromised

1479
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,660
is not a secret, by the way.

1480
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,980
He was a whoremonger and many other things,

1481
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,400
and they did have cameras in those days,

1482
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,300
and testimony was more important than photographs.

1483
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,020
But the interesting part is that if he

1484
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,740
broke out of the deal, which is, you

1485
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,980
know, we've got the dirt on you, ultimately,

1486
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,100
one needs to consider that's in a position

1487
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:52,560
that is compromised, that blackmail means nothing, because

1488
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,980
when you break out of it, they're just

1489
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,160
going to kill you anyway.

1490
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,380
Because they don't want you to say, well,

1491
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,120
I'm repenting.

1492
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,420
So in essence, it's a really bad...

1493
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,440
So when you go into power, like in

1494
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,180
any, you know, medical, legal, military, political, you're

1495
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,420
screwed.

1496
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,000
You have no way out.

1497
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,260
And the blackmail is not what keeps you

1498
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,840
in control, because if you repent from that

1499
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,460
act, and even though it is subversive to

1500
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,100
your character, when it's brought out, you say,

1501
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,200
well, that's okay, but I'm also bringing this

1502
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,320
out.

1503
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,640
You're going to be killed anyway.

1504
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,680
So you see...

1505
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,420
Do you see?

1506
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,160
I hope I did a pretty good...

1507
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,680
You did.

1508
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,440
I think I gave a pretty good translation

1509
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,660
of this whole story.

1510
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,480
So you're either...

1511
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,160
It shows you they've got you in lockdown,

1512
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,760
there's a problem with the Navy, and the

1513
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,160
people have to know it back in their

1514
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,920
minds, or the guy's a total coward and

1515
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,560
the Navy sucks.

1516
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,700
That's what they're putting out in front of

1517
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:43,800
you.

1518
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,940
It's all controlled, by the way.

1519
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,040
There are people being taken out in many

1520
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,660
positions on a daily basis, you know, people

1521
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,680
in power, in the military, legal, medical, political,

1522
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,360
and you don't hear about it, though.

1523
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,440
Right.

1524
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,540
Ever.

1525
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,820
But why would they put...

1526
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,700
Remember, everything that you hear publicly, especially on

1527
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,940
the Internet like that, it's a show.

1528
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,340
It's like they're trying to create some kind

1529
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,880
of...

1530
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,640
There's no...

1531
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,480
It's so controlled right now, it's like a

1532
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:12,980
B-movie.

1533
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,500
Right?

1534
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,360
Worse.

1535
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,920
Yeah, I mean, that's why...

1536
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,640
I mean, I'll never do a YouTube channel,

1537
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,020
never do any of that stuff, because it's

1538
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,780
just rubbish.

1539
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,740
It's just like you dirty yourself to go

1540
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,360
there, you know?

1541
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,280
Actually, I found this years ago with YouTube,

1542
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,540
I was speaking to someone, I was at

1543
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,660
a cafe, this was back in six, seven

1544
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,760
years ago, maybe more, and he was talking

1545
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,040
about all this stuff he's...

1546
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,960
Anyway, I don't want to give this a

1547
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,840
whole other subject, but it turns out he

1548
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,760
was working for YouTube and Google.

1549
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,200
I was like, that sounds bizarre, you know?

1550
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,540
You know, it's like real bizarre shit going

1551
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,500
on there, you know?

1552
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,440
Yeah, in other words, not a smart individual,

1553
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,080
but an individual that was not in the

1554
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,040
best interest of what people think is how

1555
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,700
it's presented.

1556
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,540
And I wish I would have spent a

1557
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,840
little more inquiry, but at the time I

1558
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,120
was like, no, I would never do any

1559
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,160
of that stuff, you know?

1560
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,620
So I didn't really care, I kind of

1561
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,580
pushed it to the side.

1562
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,260
Sure.

1563
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,260
But I was like, oof, this is a

1564
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,380
really bad organization.

1565
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,980
A proof of it is there's a couple

1566
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,280
of YouTube videos, ironically, of the CEO of

1567
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,480
YouTube, this bizarre woman, you know, like a

1568
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,660
pre-menopausal, she's like in her 50s or

1569
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,180
60s or whatever, real nutcase, feminist.

1570
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,900
I'm not saying, you know, feminism or masculinity,

1571
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,220
you know what I mean, like the radical

1572
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,620
idiot type.

1573
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,360
Right.

1574
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,080
Right, bizarre.

1575
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,680
It's like, oof, and this is the norm.

1576
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,480
All of your leadership is like that right

1577
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,100
now, because the gods have a sense of

1578
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,360
humor.

1579
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,260
So basically when you put a bizarre group

1580
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,280
of people to lead in any field, the

1581
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,980
other people, those that can see that are

1582
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,260
like, oof, we're really screwed.

1583
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,920
Any hope and optimism around this just wipes,

1584
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,680
you know, not in the way that people

1585
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,340
think what hope and optimism is, is ever

1586
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,460
manifest with what you have in place.

1587
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,100
That's why it's got to go.

1588
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,340
That's why when you listen to a Greek

1589
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,240
sonic event, you know, an optimistic must happen

1590
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,160
is the cleanup.

1591
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,520
So you can't fix it.

1592
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,940
You know, most people still anticipate, well, give

1593
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,220
it enough time, it'll correct.

1594
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,760
No, it won't.

1595
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,660
It'll just get worse and worse and worse.

1596
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,240
You know, I've watched like entropy setting, like

1597
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,500
if you have a car or a house

1598
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,940
or anything that you don't maintain, it just

1599
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,800
keeps falling apart.

1600
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,520
You're not going to pull up one day

1601
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,940
and all of a sudden everything's fixed.

1602
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,200
Right.

1603
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,060
Right.

1604
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,360
So the level of entropy that's kicked in

1605
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,240
and everything humans do is at a maximum

1606
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,700
point that it could still sustain some cohesion.

1607
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,620
And tomorrow, that's why, I mean, today's a

1608
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,760
little worse than yesterday, but not as bad

1609
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,920
as it's going to be tomorrow in a

1610
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,700
very small increment and continual.

1611
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,380
That's not a bad thing.

1612
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,760
It's a bad thing if everything was purely

1613
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,700
random and up to chance, but there are

1614
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,580
higher forces controlling it and it has to

1615
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,140
be this way.

1616
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,520
So you just have to know where you

1617
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:12,760
are.

1618
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,500
Yeah.

1619
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,840
Yeah, you have to know where you are

1620
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,420
in that timeline because you just have to

1621
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,000
be patient.

1622
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,360
And, you know, like I said, you'll probably

1623
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,960
run out of life before you run out

1624
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,480
of patience.

1625
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,080
Right.

1626
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,460
Like if you knew, for example, you know,

1627
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,880
the end was going to come in 500

1628
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,360
years, well, no matter how patient you are,

1629
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,280
you're not going to see it.

1630
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:33,700
Right.

1631
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,220
Right.

1632
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,040
So you'll probably run out of life.

1633
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,140
But, you know, the benefit of being around

1634
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,820
now is you'll probably see the end before

1635
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,660
you run out of life.

1636
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,280
And, of course, the gods have a sense

1637
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,700
of irony.

1638
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,760
It's always the opposite.

1639
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,820
When you look at, for example, the Christ,

1640
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,300
he came at the worst possible time, quote,

1641
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,900
unquote, of Israel.

1642
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,000
Right.

1643
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,860
Actually worse than when they were during the

1644
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,520
time of judges because at the time of

1645
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,160
judges, you know, they were basically able to

1646
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,200
revolt and rebel.

1647
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,900
You can read about it.

1648
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,620
You know, he says, well, go to this

1649
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,740
guy, you know, and stab him in the

1650
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,880
heart and I'll support you.

1651
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,760
You know, Yahweh said to the prophets, right?

1652
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,400
And they did that.

1653
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,580
But he didn't say, go stab the Caesar

1654
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,920
in the heart and I'll support you.

1655
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,200
Did he?

1656
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:23,700
No.

1657
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,720
Came at the worst possible time.

1658
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,520
You know, the Christ also came at a

1659
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,760
time in Scripture where historically, if you understand

1660
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,680
history, there were many Christs running around, so

1661
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,800
-called Christ, people calling themselves the saviors of

1662
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,100
Israel.

1663
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,640
Like, I'm going to bust us out of

1664
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,400
this Roman occupation and I won't let, you

1665
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,260
know, the Easterners get us either, you know.

1666
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,240
Kind of like a Christian.

1667
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,680
And restore Israel.

1668
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,420
Yeah, yeah.

1669
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,220
It was a big deal.

1670
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,420
You can read about it in the New

1671
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,120
Testament where, you know, Nicodemus was pleading with

1672
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,400
the council to let him go.

1673
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,080
Don't we have a lot of these guys

1674
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,800
saying and doing what this guy does or

1675
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,100
saying what this guy says, you know.

1676
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,800
I mean, when they just chase him away,

1677
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,040
they run to the mountains, they don't come

1678
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,480
back.

1679
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,280
It was very common, you know.

1680
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,440
So, he came at the worst time.

1681
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,240
So, the end is going to come at

1682
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,900
the best time, if I were to sum

1683
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,160
it up.

1684
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,820
The end of man's society, meaning every culture,

1685
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,140
is going to come when they're at their

1686
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,640
best, having their best time.

1687
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,740
Which is, you know, world government, world currency,

1688
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,980
harmony, peace.

1689
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:33,250
It's kind of hard to fathom if you're

1690
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:33,890
uninformed.

1691
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,870
But if you study and are informed, and

1692
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,990
you know timekeeping, and you know prophecy, and

1693
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,870
you know the law, and you know what's

1694
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,210
written in scripture, and all other cultures as

1695
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:44,930
well, they're rich.

1696
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,950
It's as clear as anything.

1697
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,350
It's razor sharp.

1698
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,590
Well, sans the cosmic censorship.

1699
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:52,710
Correct.

1700
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,570
If you're censored, then you'll never see it,

1701
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,610
and it's best to just go watch Netflix

1702
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,210
or something.

1703
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,810
Which I've been doing also, you know, just

1704
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:01,350
to escape.

1705
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:02,350
And there's not much on there.

1706
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,570
I find myself watching the same movies once

1707
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,610
in a while, over and over.

1708
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,490
Just to, whatever.

1709
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,070
Or go through a couple old sets.

1710
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,390
Yeah, it's vegetation.

1711
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:13,730
It is.

1712
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,290
In my case, I want life and patience

1713
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,250
to run out.

1714
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:23,510
You know, it's just like, yeah, waiting around.

1715
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,410
There's nothing you can do.

1716
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,050
My list of things to do never seems

1717
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,770
to grow short, so I'm always keeping busy.

1718
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,130
Of course.

1719
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,590
And if you don't, entropy sets in, or

1720
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,430
someone nagging you about it.

1721
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,210
But here's the interesting part.

1722
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,790
What there is to do, there is something

1723
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,110
to do.

1724
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,870
And I'll take it back, waiting for patience

1725
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:42,670
and life to run out.

1726
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,110
That too.

1727
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,390
But what is precedent over that is very

1728
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:47,770
simple.

1729
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,830
When there's nothing left to do, you have

1730
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:51,550
to give warning.

1731
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,570
Imagine a ship going down.

1732
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,950
You can't plug up the hull.

1733
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,390
The best you can do, other than running

1734
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,790
and saving yourself, is yelling out and letting,

1735
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,850
knocking on the door as you're running down

1736
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:05,670
the hull, all the cabins and people, get

1737
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,890
up, the ship is sinking, right?

1738
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,530
Why run down the hull towards the stairs

1739
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,190
for the upper deck silently?

1740
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,130
Right?

1741
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,150
You should be running down the hull towards

1742
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,330
the stairs for the upper decks, shouting, the

1743
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:20,850
ship is going down, the ship is going

1744
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:21,210
down.

1745
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,740
That's all there's left to do, right?

1746
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,060
You're going to still get, but then maybe,

1747
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,040
the ship is not a good analogy here,

1748
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,280
because now if you excite more people, your

1749
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,040
chances of getting a lifeboat or a vest

1750
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,820
are diminishing.

1751
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:34,780
Right.

1752
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,180
Right?

1753
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,020
Right.

1754
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,980
But this is not that type of thing,

1755
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,180
because there's an infinite amount of lifeboats, and

1756
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,380
actually everyone's going to get a life vest.

1757
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,460
You know, it's interesting, I was listening to,

1758
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,020
I was mentioning to someone, the best thing

1759
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,640
that came out of church were black gospel

1760
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,420
singers, and then they become background singers for

1761
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,840
bands.

1762
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,020
And it was a whole genre.

1763
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,380
If you look at the entire folk movement,

1764
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,760
it all came out of the churches.

1765
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,860
That was the best thing that ever happened.

1766
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,620
But I was listening to some of the

1767
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:07,420
songs that the gospels, and Christianity has mind

1768
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,080
-fucked them so bad, they think when they

1769
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,800
die they go to the pearly gates of

1770
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,040
heaven.

1771
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:11,740
Right.

1772
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,500
You notice how the Christians completely bypassed the

1773
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:14,940
resurrection?

1774
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,480
Completely.

1775
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,620
They think when you die you go to

1776
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,820
heaven or hell or whatever.

1777
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,760
Instantaneous gratification.

1778
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,040
Yeah, they completely bypassed a little detail known

1779
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:27,760
as the resurrection.

1780
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,120
Because everything else they've done has bypassed anything

1781
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:32,600
true.

1782
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,300
So, anyway, yeah.

1783
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,180
If you run into a Christian and say,

1784
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,020
so you guys bypassed the whole purpose of

1785
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,300
the Christ, which is the resurrection.

1786
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,720
That's all you've got to say.

1787
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,100
They have no comment.

1788
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,720
They're idiots.

1789
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,240
So you were at the gospel music.

1790
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:49,880
Myself?

1791
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,860
No, you were talking about the gospel music.

1792
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,440
Oh, the gospel music is the best thing

1793
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,000
they can add to the circus, the church.

1794
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,100
Right.

1795
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,260
The black gospel singers.

1796
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,620
You know, a lot of white singers try

1797
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,540
to sound black too.

1798
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,360
Talking about the 60s and 70s, like Joe

1799
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,380
Cocker, Rolling Stone.

1800
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,120
Right.

1801
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,260
There's a lot of wannabe in that kind

1802
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:10,600
of thing.

1803
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,800
A lot of white people trying to incarnate

1804
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,300
themselves.

1805
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:17,940
But hold on.

1806
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,060
The black gospel is very specific because you

1807
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,780
don't get it in the African continent.

1808
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,860
And you don't have it in other parts

1809
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,420
of the world.

1810
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,540
You only have it in the American South.

1811
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,900
So it's the particular tribes that were brought

1812
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,400
over here that had that in their culture.

1813
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,460
Western North and Western African people.

1814
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,200
And by the way, when you talk about

1815
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,760
slavery, one thing you have to remember.

1816
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,540
Always, people are enslaved by two ways.

1817
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,960
One is by conquest or volunteered by your

1818
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,480
own people.

1819
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,680
So typically slavery is you conquer a people

1820
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,220
and you enslave the remaining population.

1821
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,140
Or your own people sell you off.

1822
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,600
Your own people sell you off.

1823
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:00,260
Right.

1824
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,000
That's why, for example, I was having a

1825
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,960
short discussion about this.

1826
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,220
Well, Greek, how come they took informant off

1827
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,500
the birth certificate now?

1828
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,080
Like the mother being an informant.

1829
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,160
Right.

1830
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,780
Because they've been doing that for four generations

1831
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,100
now.

1832
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,760
They don't need to presume you're a slave.

1833
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,920
They know you're a slave because they have

1834
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,480
four generations of slaves now.

1835
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,140
Right.

1836
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,920
So of course the woman having a child

1837
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,880
is going to be a slave.

1838
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,140
They don't have to do it anymore.

1839
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,940
So you're going to see, if you're paying

1840
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,960
attention to the legal demonology, they're changing their

1841
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,560
paperwork in the past 20 years, most likely

1842
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,720
five years the most.

1843
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,040
So in that point of view, they would

1844
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,540
have had to change the premise for that

1845
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:39,750
earlier.

1846
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:41,260
Right.

1847
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,240
To smuggle that in.

1848
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,620
Well, in other words, the earlier paperwork, 20

1849
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,420
years and beyond, they had to always capture

1850
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,700
you on paper, get you to like the

1851
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,280
same paperwork you fill out when you donate

1852
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,360
a couch to Goodwill.

1853
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,040
Right.

1854
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:54,440
Right?

1855
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,520
Now they don't have to have you say

1856
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,680
that you're giving this or pledging this for

1857
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,420
the good of the state or the mother

1858
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,560
is an informant, meaning the child is a

1859
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,880
product of a criminal act.

1860
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,000
They don't have to do that anymore because

1861
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,900
your parents were enslaved, their parents were enslaved,

1862
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,080
and their parents were enslaved.

1863
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,540
So they don't have to produce the presumption

1864
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,240
anymore.

1865
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,600
A preponderance of evidence.

1866
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,360
Yeah, because you're all enslaved now for so

1867
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:20,860
many years.

1868
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,300
Of course we don't have to give him

1869
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,880
unconscionable contracts to state that he's giving away

1870
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,340
all of it.

1871
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,380
Because he can't.

1872
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,120
He has none.

1873
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,760
Because his parents and his parents and their

1874
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,200
parents and their parents were enslaved.

1875
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,620
So of course he's a slave.

1876
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,640
There is no other way.

1877
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,160
That's why the paperwork is changing.

1878
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,490
So anyway, it's very simple.

1879
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,410
Lots of ways to cross-reference that, I

1880
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:43,950
would think.

1881
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,170
Yes, and if you don't have the mindset,

1882
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,270
and if you don't have the mindset, you're

1883
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:50,650
going to start knocking on doors and asking

1884
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,110
why do they take informant off, and you're

1885
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,510
not going to find an answer because the

1886
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:54,750
people you're asking don't know either.

1887
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,570
It's very, very simple.

1888
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,490
Three or four generations.

1889
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,230
Has it or has it not been three

1890
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,050
or four generations since the Federal Reserve started

1891
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,750
telling the governments to monetize, you know, IMF

1892
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,690
monetize your own people?

1893
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,490
Of course it has.

1894
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,190
Been three or four generations.

1895
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:10,950
Easily.

1896
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,490
And I don't mean in a strict biblical

1897
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,810
sense where each one is a separate 40

1898
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,050
years.

1899
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,250
I'm talking about having three or four generations

1900
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,750
living under one roof, like children, parents, grandparents.

1901
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,570
See, that's what I mean by that.

1902
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:27,310
Of course the grandma who was enslaved and

1903
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,470
doesn't know it, her children are slaves.

1904
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,570
They didn't really know it, but now the

1905
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,470
children of those, they don't have to ask

1906
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,910
anymore.

1907
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,770
If the grandparents are slaves and the parents

1908
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,030
are slaves, you don't have to ask if

1909
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,170
the children have been enslaved.

1910
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,490
But if you just brought this on to

1911
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,630
society, yes, you have to maintain the presumption

1912
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:45,270
constantly.

1913
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,330
And you cannot live in a country that

1914
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,190
has that system as a non-slave by

1915
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,250
preponderance of they can just tell you, we

1916
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,750
own everything, even the air, up to 100

1917
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,970
feet up, so you have to leave.

1918
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:57,890
They can do that.

1919
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,850
So I like that because Dimitri says that

1920
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,350
on some of his videos, you know, like

1921
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:04,850
what if Trump does this or what if

1922
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,530
this guy does this?

1923
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,550
It's okay, we'll just kill him.

1924
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,430
He's our property.

1925
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,110
He's a rebelling.

1926
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:09,850
He's our property.

1927
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:12,370
We have every right to do that.

1928
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:16,710
That's the thing I even told Ocelli in

1929
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:16,870
private.

1930
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:18,470
When they killed Kennedy, they had every right

1931
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,030
to do that.

1932
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:24,800
Whoever did it, you see?

1933
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,540
Martin Luther King, all these assassinations, they have

1934
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,220
every right to do that because those people

1935
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,880
are beyond preponderance of a doubt registered with

1936
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,660
the state legally as property.

1937
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,360
Why?

1938
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,320
You throw Kennedy's rocking chair in the fire,

1939
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,000
no one complains, but you shoot Kennedy in

1940
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,680
the head, you complain?

1941
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,400
What's the difference?

1942
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,100
Legally, it's the same exact thing to them

1943
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,040
because it's just property.

1944
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,420
Actually, the man has more production value because

1945
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,460
the chair is inanimate.

1946
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,120
But all that aside, ultimately, common denominators are

1947
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,260
both property to be disposed of at will

1948
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,280
of the owner, period.

1949
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,460
That's why many times I've said all the

1950
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,220
stuff, the worst stuff you've ever read on

1951
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,980
the internet, the reality is even worse than

1952
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,640
that, much worse than that.

1953
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,439
That's why it's best to know.

1954
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:21,080
That's why I think the best credo is,

1955
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:21,700
you know what?

1956
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,380
Why bother?

1957
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:23,439
Why bother?

1958
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:26,939
You're going to know more than you think

1959
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:28,840
you should know, so you can lay in

1960
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,979
bed before you go to sleep at night

1961
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:30,939
and all of a sudden the whole room

1962
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:31,640
starts spinning?

1963
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,819
It's best that you don't.

1964
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:40,680
Be hopeful, but unfortunately, what most people can

1965
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,779
put their hope in is false.

1966
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,640
It is a very, very bad situation.

1967
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:49,640
So, you go back to food, clothing, shelter.

1968
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,439
Are you comfortable?

1969
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:52,160
Were you comfortable yesterday?

1970
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:53,040
Are you comfortable today?

1971
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,420
Do you think you might be comfortable tomorrow?

1972
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,620
Beyond that, it's foolishness.

1973
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,880
Okay, I don't see much else.

1974
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,060
I think we're just going to wrap it

1975
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,240
up unless you've got something else.

1976
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,359
No, I'm all out on this end too,

1977
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,779
yes.

1978
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,439
Let the madness accelerate.

1979
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,040
I think that's a given.

1980
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,479
All right, so we'll see you again next

1981
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:18,640
week.

1982
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,120
Thanks, man.

1983
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,420
Okay, you take care now.

1984
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,439
Thank you very much.

1985
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,720
