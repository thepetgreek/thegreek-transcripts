1
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,420
And live here with Greek, and how are you doing tonight?

2
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,460
Greetings.

3
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,140
Doing okay.

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Yeah, let's do another Sonic, I guess.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:58,880
I've noticed most of the stuff that's ever been said is beyond most people's comprehension, and it's very safe to say they'll probably never understand most of this stuff, but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be voiced.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:11,620
You know, I've been finding out that just by replaying some of the old events, which I do, and I keep them rebroadcasting out there for folks in case they want them, and I catch myself doing it, and just little things, you know.

7
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm still fascinated by Genesis.

8
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,060
Just can't get that book out of my head, Greek.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,120
I revisit it over and over.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,080
It's funny you said that, because I revisited it today, and it's so obvious once you start to...

11
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, let me just say it this way.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,280
It's very obvious why Genesis, especially when I say Genesis, the first chapter, the first four chapters really, why it is the way it is.

13
00:01:42,380 --> 00:02:00,660
And if you just drain the mind of everything you've been told about it, and what you've been told about the Bible or any religion, and you observe it in context as you proceed through the rest of it, it makes total sense why it's done and the information is given that way.

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,420
I think I've ventured to give information little bits and pieces here.

15
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,500
I like to just do, like someone says, Greek, you speak in parable, but that's okay with me.

16
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,140
And I said, well, there's no other way, because

17
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,860
you don't want to cast pearls to swine, and on the other hand

18
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,680
it doesn't matter in terms of

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,340
giving the whole story out clearly, because the background, in other words, it matters

20
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,380
ultimately, but at this time it doesn't matter, because

21
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,260
even if you gave the background

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,500
about what is meant in Genesis, it is so contrasting to the way

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,700
people think, and the rationale that's employed, that it wouldn't matter

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,900
you see, because it's very contrary.

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:59,740
That's why I put the Dimitri Kalasov, the 9-11 sadistic, seditious I still love watching him.

26
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:17,260
He is one of the few people You know, in pursuing that a little farther I see why you're held back on some things, but there's a lot to be gleaned.

27
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,120
Well, I always found it interesting when they said the word Saddam

28
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
Well, that's

29
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,520
I make fun of white people usually, because

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,920
they represent the degradation of human culture, really

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,380
In other words, if you go to a place,

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,120
a venue, and it's leadership, whether it's de facto or

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm not talking about politics now

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,660
If the rulers are the leaders

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm talking about fashion trends and all that, trend leaders also

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,520
are influencing the degradation of society, well, you can easily point a finger

37
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,120
Why are you following this group?

38
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,360
Because look, they're making everything worse Oh yeah, I see it now.

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,980
That's what I mean about that aspect

40
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,279
When I said that to you, I was talking about the

41
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,900
S-A-D-M

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
That's the standard ordinance, small, that's the real small

43
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,060
That's the little boy

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,080
Or way little, it's literally only about 40 pounds, 20 pounds

45
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,860
And that was around the 50s, by the way

46
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,980
And what I wanted to get to was, east of the Mississippi, it's nuclear

47
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,640
West of the Mississippi, it's nuclear

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,740
What is that bomb that went off in Japan?

49
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,800
What kind of bomb is that atomic bomb?

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,720
If they say nuclear, you're west of the Mississippi

51
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,820
If they say nuclear, like nucleus, they're east of the Mississippi

52
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,860
That's an easy way to know where someone is from

53
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,200
No, it is funny, but I put that up about Dimitri because he's one of the few gems that just speaks plainly

54
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Most people, even those Dimitri, I read some of the comments and videos

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,220
The recent ones that were put up, something to the effect of not a lot of seditious questions

56
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,280
I found his book very fascinating

57
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,200
And the way he laid it out, and the way he even put passwords in there to make sure that you read through

58
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,080
Got to the end, and then could use the passwords in order to go to the next one

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,960
I thought that was pretty clever

60
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,040
To verify, yeah

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,600
What's interesting, I mentioned to Dimitri years ago, is one thing that no one has spoken about, even him

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,120
And he laughed and agreed, because what am I supposed to do?

63
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,780
He could have easily done a hundred hours, or a four thousand page book

64
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,940
But one thing that everyone has sorely missed, which is important, is the walk like a duck

65
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,480
Looks like a duck, smells like a duck principle

66
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,980
There's very little discussion, but easily verifiable by looking at things that were written

67
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,440
I even found something, 1946, August, New Yorker magazine

68
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,740
And one of the things they spoke about being around an area where a nuclear device has been detonated

69
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,260
I.e. Hiroshima, was the smell

70
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,160
The smell is what everyone misses

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,220
Thousands of people in New York, which was the original Manhattan Project

72
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,820
Was in Manhattan, and then they moved by the Woolworth building

73
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,280
And then again, what they call 9-11

74
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,880
I had spoken recently, 5, 6, 7 years ago to someone in New Jersey

75
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,760
And he kept calling the EPA, like what's that smell, I can't sleep at night

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,940
I have my windows open, and it smells like electrical fire, and it's constant

77
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,520
I know it's coming from ground zero area, and they told him, well there are a lot of electrical wires in those buildings

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,940
There's some writings written, annals about

79
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,360
The American military that was experimented on, during the Nevada testing

80
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,100
The atmospheric atomic bomb testing

81
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,160
So they started coming out and putting out their journals, and one of the things was the smell

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Of ionization, and there's just, I wouldn't say a lot of it on the internet

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,740
But there's enough from the Hiroshima detonation, there's even a book called 7 Hours to Zero

84
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,940
I believe was written about the accounts

85
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,820
And the one over in Russia, they had a lot of, there were some mentions, I should say

86
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,980
It was liberal at best

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,200
So if they tell you it's a car bomb, and it smells like a very high powerful industrial ozone machine

88
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,620
Or an electrical wire fire, you know, burn

89
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,720
It's not CDX, or dynamite, or TNT

90
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Or Cordex, which is a pre-igniter

91
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,780
Or oil, yeah

92
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,540
Oh yeah, the fertilizer bomb

93
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,980
So it's really hard to describe what an apple tastes like, it's really hard to describe what strong ionization smells like

94
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,559
But if you've been around, it smells like bleach

95
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,340
Chlorine bleach, if you do laundry with the sodium hypochlorite

96
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,580
Chlorox, pretty much

97
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,080
She's distinct at best, very very distinct

98
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,680
And I would say for those people that are not around devices like ozone machines and corona discharge

99
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,980
You know, fresh lightning strikes

100
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,540
Get yourself a bottle of bleach, and if you've ever remembered that smell, that's what it smells like

101
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,720
Working with TVs way back in the day, you know

102
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,020
Corona discharge, and the high voltage cage, and horizontal

103
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,140
And if you've got dust and other things in there, they burn up and add to the smell

104
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,820
Yes they do, you know I had one time where the guy complained of this strange odor

105
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,740
Coming out of his TV, it was one of them big old brown tubers

106
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,280
26 inch, and it came in there, and here's this mouse

107
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,740
Stuck in the high voltage cage underneath the circuit board, I don't know how in the hell it got in there

108
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,380
But man

109
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,120
Hey

110
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,760
So were you, just for the listeners, circa 70's?

111
00:09:50,800 --> 00:10:26,860
Yeah, mhm 60's, 70's With the 7355 pentodes or whatever Yeah, well you're bringing up some memories There were some real common ones that everyone used and they thought they'd make the tubes better But yeah, so diodes, triodes, pentodes, you know whatever Based on the cathodes, how hot the cathodes were Cold cathode, hot cathode, we just lost everyone right?

112
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,200
Yep, I think so

113
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,760
If we start talking about Gameboys and Nintendo, they all perk up

114
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
Anyway, yeah

115
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,460
That got me onto Genesis and all that kind of stuff and the Ether

116
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,160
And a little bit of discussion from last times conversation

117
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,980
Just got me going, but I always seem to fall back to Genesis

118
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,140
There's just so much in there that piques the curiosity

119
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,200
Well let's spend a little bit of time on it, I'll maybe say things again differently

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,240
How many times have you heard me say when you read anything in the Bible, it's not for you?

121
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:21,980
Right Let me just equalize here I'm making a big step outward, I'm going out to the back, outside the house Am I still audible?

122
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not written for you because if you actually read it, it says who it's written for

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,320
And those people, their job was to hold the gist of the message

124
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:44,060
For everyone and or use it as a way to show how you're set apart from the rest of the people

125
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,320
And or the rules of a nation, how to run a society

126
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,060
And or history

127
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,780
So when you look at Genesis from it's historicity point of view

128
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,220
Not just the order of how things were laid out historically from beginning to end

129
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,660
Because there's a timeline there

130
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:11,540
But the historicity, that was penned by Moses, not written, but penned by Moses and his crew

131
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,560
Because if you read Exodus and Numbers very carefully, he had people helping him all the time

132
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,060
That were surrounding him, many

133
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,160
It was penned thousands of years after Adam

134
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,260
Roughly 2,000 plus years after the fact of the things that are mentioned in the first 4 or 5 chapters

135
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,140
6, 7, 8 chapters, 9 chapters really

136
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:41,260
Actually the whole book, everything that's mentioned in the book came at least 500 years before him from the end

137
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,660
So it's a recap, it's a rehash, it's a recap

138
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,380
And what is it there to do?

139
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,520
What do you notice, what's interesting about scripture and the narrative

140
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,960
It doesn't tell you everything that's going on or went on or will go on

141
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:04,020
But it offers information and the narrative offers the correctiveness that's required to have a fit and proper mindset

142
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,420
I'm going to say that again, different way

143
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,480
You notice there's no iPhones in there or man is going to fly with airplanes

144
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,380
Or the way the Romans are going to do this or that

145
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,920
Or the Egyptians, what their medicine was about

146
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
Or anything like that, no

147
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,020
The narrative of the scripture again is to offer a corrective, almost in a remedial sense

148
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,460
Contrast, corrective information on how to establish a fit and proper mindset

149
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,200
It's kind of like a supplemental manual

150
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,140
When you study, you were talking about TVs

151
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,580
Let's say you work with TVs or electronics and you're registered with the people that manufacture

152
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,920
And they know you're part of the service agencies

153
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,780
They update you, they'll send you a newsletter or an update on a service tech

154
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
And the updates on the service manuals

155
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,600
Are so you maintain a fit and proper mindset as you continue in the field

156
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
So when you read Genesis and all that

157
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,520
You use that as your main reference and also to your rudder or your compass

158
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,240
To maintain the fit and proper mindset

159
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,340
So this way when you

160
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,500
That's why it doesn't have everything in it

161
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,060
Actually I'm not going to go there right now, I'll save that for the next few years if I'm still around

162
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Let's just skip that topic

163
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,600
So it's about using it as a moral correction

164
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,100
And a basic supplemental

165
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,600
Because if you want to know about man's history for the first few thousand years in the society here

166
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,200
There's so much that can be discovered, well even though it's been secluded and hidden away

167
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,120
And very often you're shown something and told it was 50,000 years ago when it was really just four or five

168
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,900
So you're using Genesis to supplement things

169
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,080
Like you'll know the plants came before the fish and the birds and the animals

170
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,020
And they came before man, right?

171
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,040
So it gives you that proper order so you comprehend things properly, quickly and efficiently

172
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,540
There's so much more to discuss there and I've done it in private

173
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,360
Actually not so much lately in the past four or five years

174
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,960
But in the future maybe I think an open discussion on Genesis will be more pressing

175
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,660
Let's just say appropriate

176
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't think it's appropriate yet

177
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,360
In other words the questions have to be urgent enough

178
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,340
So I would suggest that when you find stuff

179
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,020
Well okay, let me just say this

180
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,360
When you find things in the scriptures that you can apply to your life

181
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,540
It's not just what you apply, what you look at is what is forbidden

182
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,300
And if it's not mentioned as something that's forbidden you can almost say that it's expressly encouraged

183
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,700
But when I say that I mean you don't legalize, don't try to twist it

184
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,680
It's very clear, use rationale

185
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,200
That's why it's so difficult to suggest doing what's in scripture because you need to have what to be able to do it

186
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,680
You need to be able to have a rational mind

187
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,840
As I can see and hear as I can hear

188
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,860
Have you booted the correct operating system I believe would be a good terminology

189
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,060
Yeah, but you do it backwards

190
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,020
Because you know you haven't been booted when you approach scripture

191
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,079
Because no one is really teaching scripture

192
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,060
Most people that really know scripture did not come from a culture of it

193
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,660
Or even a familial culture where their parents did

194
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,200
Most, not all, I would say most

195
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,920
So you were probably booted with the wrong operating system

196
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,820
With eyes to see and ears to hear

197
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,100
Do you ever see those geometric patterns that appear to be moving but there's nothing moving

198
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm not talking about a gif image

199
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,260
It looks like a kaleidoscope, it's a series of squares in a circular pattern

200
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,860
And when you start pairing them up you look at it and it looks like it's moving

201
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,740
But it's not

202
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,320
And those are also things that are going to be done with sounds

203
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:59,860
So most people will fall for that, including anyone, because that is specifically designed to thwart perception

204
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,240
Whoever you show that pattern to, no matter if they're rational or irrational, will see something moving in it

205
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,460
Even though there's nothing moving

206
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
So now you have to overcome that

207
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Because how many times have you heard people see things in scripture that are not there

208
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,240
And or say it's in scripture and it's not

209
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,480
Continuously

210
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,120
Even recently

211
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,660
I'm not going to mention any names, usually when I say that means I am going to mention the name

212
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,640
But someone said, oh that and the lunar calendar, again

213
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,760
You know there is no such thing as a lunar calendar, right?

214
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,900
That's the dummy load again

215
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,100
That's someone who spends too much time on the internet thinking they're going to find something that's going to make their lives better

216
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,740
Might want to clean that corn off a little bit

217
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,380
Yeah, there is no calendar, sorry

218
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,980
As soon as you hear that it's like, oh boy, they've got just enough information to make themselves dangerous

219
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Not better

220
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,380
So yeah, there is no calendar, that's the other thing

221
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,280
Let that sink in for a minute, I'll give you a moment of silence on that

222
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,820
There is no calendar, lawfully

223
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,980
Clearly written in the book

224
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,200
Well, a calendar is a pre-planned schedule

225
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,860
For time alone

226
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,560
What I should have said

227
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,940
Like saying that this day here will be that day is pretty fucked up

228
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,000
There is no calendar in lawful calendars, no such thing

229
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,560
Because it's observation

230
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,000
And being a society of headhunters or bloodthirsty cannibals that we're addressing

231
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,280
They usually associate themselves very well with the Aztecs and the Mayans

232
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,820
Who one of the reasonings for doing human sacrifices was to appease the sun god

233
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Because if we don't, the sun may not rise tomorrow, what do we do if the sun doesn't rise

234
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,360
The mentality, goodness

235
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,840
Well, the thing is to say that this day here will be this day of the month here

236
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,300
If from the past it is negating observation

237
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,480
One thing I wanted to bring back on the Dimitri videos I put in is

238
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,080
How many people understand what a sovereign state is?

239
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,500
Raise your hand

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,900
So it's a new creation or a corporate government, it's a front

241
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,300
Here's the thing that the mob does all the time

242
00:20:52,300 --> 00:21:00,800
They acquire influence on a company to have it change so they can acquire the company

243
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Meaning at a better price because if you just approach a company

244
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,420
There's negotiation and the bargaining can go either way and you're probably not going to get it for a good price

245
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,160
But if you influence the company then you can drop the asking price

246
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,680
Then you acquire it, you see

247
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,480
And then you bankrupt it and liquidate it

248
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,040
But in this case what they did is they didn't liquidate, some countries were liquidated

249
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,020
They bankrupted it and then they knew they just had to give everybody monopoly money

250
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,020
And it's called a credit line known as a birth certificate and the funny money

251
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,980
All your credit transactions that you're doing, so you're really living in a nightmare

252
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,960
Well I should say it's a lawful nightmare but fortunately most people are too dim in terms of wit, intelligence

253
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,920
And I say literally intelligence in this time in the meaning

254
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,060
Because everyone has the same intelligence potentially

255
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:00,580
And intelligence has been dimmed and their perception has been dimmed and their spirit has been twisted

256
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,800
And perverted enough that they cannot notice that there's nothing lawful anymore

257
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,540
Other than what the nature is doing, like rain

258
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,540
I just don't think the generations it was ever brought up to question

259
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
I can't remember any time, no

260
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,660
I was just thinking about that as you said that and I was like

261
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,520
It just accepted it, it was there

262
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,060
What you do is you eliminate the generations that are aware of it through war, famine or disease

263
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,200
Or starvation, depression

264
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,020
It's controlled

265
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,640
Amazing

266
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,640
There's a full on control, it's best that most people don't realize what's going on

267
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,020
But I think they should realize enough that they should stop having children the way they do

268
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,700
I don't mean no children at all

269
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,500
I am for the human race continuing but not in this spiritual condition

270
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,180
That it's in, all child rearing should stop

271
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,140
Not absolutely, in an absolute sense

272
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,380
We actually did a sci-fi film where no more babies were being born, I forgot what it was called

273
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,840
Children of Men or something, a movie a while back

274
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,080
I don't mean like that, but there should be

275
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm not talking about a chemically induced thing, I'm just saying where people start saying

276
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,820
Take control of themselves

277
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
Here's the thing about child rearing, that's what they focus on

278
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,980
Do it for the children

279
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,220
Whenever they want to get sympathy calls, they show someone holding a baby that was injured or something

280
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,400
Like on the Murrow building in Time Magazine

281
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
A fireman holding a dead baby

282
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,360
Once you eliminate the possibility of creating a family like that

283
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,720
Then you can focus on more responsible adult things

284
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,820
Because when you're focusing on children, you have to be a responsible adult

285
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,260
But you're not focusing on responsible adult things, you're focusing on rearing a child or raising a child

286
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
The other thing is when you have a child in this society, that's when you become more of a target

287
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,020
Medically and institutionally

288
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,560
You have to send the child to school, right?

289
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,780
Also it degrades the financial system because each child is another piece of property added

290
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,120
The more property you add, it thins out the credit system

291
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,440
So if everyone just stopped having babies for a year or two

292
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,460
I'm not saying trying to have babies, no, you should try that every day

293
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,480
But either way, if you're not shooting blanks, use the proper protection

294
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,020
Or do the old-fashioned way, pull out for the guys

295
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,580
Or the women, pull off

296
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,300
That is one of the keys, by the way, to showing

297
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,280
Do you remember how there used to be strikes?

298
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,620
There's no more strikes, have you ever noticed that?

299
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,720
Very rarely

300
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,920
Maybe one or two mention of or something else

301
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,340
That's the way that you show your disapproval of the quote-unquote system

302
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,320
Is just stop having children

303
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,420
That and protesting has went to an all-time low

304
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,900
Occasionally you get some groups up there hugging each other

305
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,260
No, you don't need to protest at all

306
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,640
The protesting doesn't scare them at all

307
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,480
If they expect the protesting and nothing happens at all, it gets really quiet

308
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
That's when they're terrified

309
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,100
Like voting, if no one ever showed up, and I mean no one to vote

310
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,680
They would be completely terrified, anyone in any official capacity would leave the country within a few days

311
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,160
Because they'd say, holy shit, something is going to happen

312
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,800
They've figured it out

313
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,480
It's all backwards

314
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,840
Essentially what's really backwards is the forces that have been leased

315
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,220
The leaseholders, I should say the leasees, not the leasers of this planet

316
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,920
Or the evil spirits

317
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,820
They're operating on an IQ of 2 million

318
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,920
What's being discussed here is not even still contrary to what they're doing, it's minor

319
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,880
But I'm just saying how simple it is from a human perspective

320
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,840
Because it works two ways

321
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:59,240
The spirits influence mankind to act a certain way, and if the mankind is strong enough spiritually to resist that

322
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,520
If they can, if it's put out in a way that they can resist

323
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:10,040
If they put it in you in a way that they know will really get in, then you can't

324
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,680
But if they put it out in a way that you still have not only the appearance of choice, but the possibility to act on it

325
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,920
You still can change things

326
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,820
But I'm not saying that you will or should or anything at this point

327
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,840
But it's so simple, all these things are very simple

328
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,440
Anything going on?

329
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,900
I don't have any messages coming in Questions or anything?

330
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,020
I was just going to say, we will take calls or anything

331
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Questions, that would be fine also

332
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:54,780
I've gotten emails recently, it's like if you never did another sonic event, it's still 50-100 times more than anyone else has said on the rectangle

333
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,820
Oh easily

334
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,560
Unfortunately people are not sending me links of approval, I haven't gotten any in a long time

335
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,620
That's a good start

336
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,680
It's really a good start

337
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,520
And I entertain some of them, I have to laugh my ass off when I see what people are trying to do on the internet

338
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
The rectangle

339
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,380
You see they're coming from the same old institutional mindset

340
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,000
They're so far removed from reality

341
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,340
That they have to talk about all the fictions and make it real

342
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,780
One thing that should be something you cite right away

343
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,180
When someone says you have to worry about this, or what do we worry about

344
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,900
That word worry, when you see that come up

345
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,240
Or what can we do

346
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll put that on my list of things to do

347
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,680
You don't fight

348
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,380
It's even shown again in the fictional movies

349
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,500
When you have the superhero show up, you have all the soldiers or whatever

350
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,680
He's trying to help out, they're fighting their asses off unloading all their ammo

351
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
He shows up, what does he do?

352
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,720
Stands there

353
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,420
A little observation

354
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:21,080
So if you just stopped everything, that would be a very clear signal in many ways

355
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,480
But that's not going to happen, too many

356
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
But here's the thing

357
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,700
When I say people will never comprehend the meaning of the ever that they have left

358
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,200
Because when things are opened up completely

359
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,500
What they don't comprehend will be so obviously

360
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,220
In front of them that they're going to ask to learn to comprehend it

361
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,020
Well right now, even if it was in front of them

362
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,140
They don't even see what's right in front of them

363
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:01,260
So there's no way of comprehension at all of anything, any subject at all

364
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,980
Of humans as a whole

365
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,600
But anyway

366
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,560
The thought was fleeting

367
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,980
But the thing is, because they have no comprehension of any subject, anything at all

368
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,880
They have to just go through it

369
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:27,160
Like most people, you can look at a various consensus and say, well if these people are really old

370
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,220
They don't have a long way to go, and if these people are really young, they potentially have a long way to go

371
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,040
That's how usually the thought goes, right?

372
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,120
And it doesn't matter, because it doesn't matter if you're going to live for a thousand in this state or five days or five years

373
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,460
Or fifty years, if you have the chances of comprehending what's going on in any capacity

374
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,180
Whether it's who you are, society, money, medicine, anything

375
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,300
Any subject at all

376
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,040
When you're so closed off from a comprehensive point of view, where you don't understand or comprehend anything

377
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,520
It doesn't matter how long you're around for

378
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,140
So it's not any longer a condition of, oh well, you're older, you know more

379
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,300
No, you don't know shit, because it's the same old mindset

380
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,820
For example, I went to this sushi restaurant once

381
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,100
And I kind of knew the guys there, and I said, who's the old guy?

382
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,120
And he said, well he's got thirty years experience

383
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:33,420
In other words, he shut down after a year and he still makes sushi the same way that he did when he first started

384
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,400
And the answer is the second half, they all broke out laughing

385
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,320
So a history, and just by looking at anyone, any human

386
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,300
You'll see that experience means nothing

387
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,220
In the grand scheme of things, and actually even in the middle scheme

388
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,940
In a minor way it does, in some cases, people are just too, let me say the word, stupid

389
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,340
For experience to make a difference

390
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,240
In other words, they see so little of what they're interacting with, and I mean anything

391
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,700
Whether it's personal relationships, anything in the sciences, anything in the spiritual arts

392
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,880
Mental arts, same thing, cosmology, any subject at all

393
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Well when you looked at Dr. Day's work

394
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,660
From 1969, and how controlled that was

395
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,080
And what the repercussions of it were

396
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,220
And then you factor that in with low food quality

397
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Oh yeah, environmental toxification

398
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Spiritual toxification

399
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:50,260
Well they have no concept of history, they have no concept of the natural sciences at all

400
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,200
Very little, only on a chemical basis

401
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,480
That's useful for industry only

402
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,960
Like all these engineers and scientists, what they say is science is not science

403
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,340
It's industrial science

404
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,080
How do we stamp it out and make it for manufacturing

405
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,040
And then once it's out in the field, how do we maintain it or

406
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,960
Discard it so we can have another version, a newer version of the same thing

407
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,940
I speak to people in industry, and some of the older people are like

408
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,860
Yeah, just because it's newer doesn't mean it's better

409
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,740
And they'll get into some rationale, but they still don't see that the science that they're using is strictly industrial

410
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,360
It's not physical, in other words it's a form of fiction

411
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,740
Like if you know anyone that's a medical technician, aka a doctor

412
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,340
I'd say more than 90% of what they think they know is medical fiction

413
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,300
The 10% that is not medical fiction is the undeniable part

414
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,500
That you don't have to be a doctor to know

415
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,900
Because essentially if you take any doctor and press him

416
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,580
To the core foundation of what healing is

417
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,920
Or recovery or health, he says the same thing grandmas do

418
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,320
Or little children do

419
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,800
Just get some food and rest and the body will heal it, that's all they say

420
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,659
Well you don't need a medical degree for that

421
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,120
And usually orbiting around that and beyond that is all fiction

422
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,239
They know that, that's what makes them, to me they're offensive and vile

423
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,699
The medical people, and in the future fortunately they will also be considered criminal

424
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,600
See right now some of them are not considered criminal as a whole

425
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,840
That's why not much is being done by the people, but I'm telling you they're a criminal

426
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,600
What they're doing, and of course the legal community also

427
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,420
And also the teachers, the education community

428
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,380
The political community, the religious community

429
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,860
In the future just bear in mind what you either accept or not accept or want to laugh at

430
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,020
Or point a finger at, because maybe you've heard some Greek speak

431
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,600
Might offend you or you might find it vile or laughable now, but I'm telling you in the future it will be criminal

432
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,960
And they will be dealt with very harshly, what you see as the norm right now

433
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,400
Not because I say so, because the gods say so

434
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,180
And you can check up on that

435
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,160
So, in the meantime when you bring up such contrasting analogies

436
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,400
Meaning contrasting to what will be and what is, what do you do?

437
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,720
And the answer is very simple, nothing

438
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,540
You don't do anything about all these esoteric concepts

439
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,220
What makes them esoteric is things are not as you're told they are

440
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,840
And once you figure out what they are they kind of become beyond esoteric

441
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,620
When you try to explain it to the common moron

442
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,840
So that's where it goes back to the old credo food, clothing, shelter

443
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,000
And even the common idiot says that, what does that have to do with the price of tea in China

444
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,480
Well guess what tea in China is, it's food isn't it

445
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,300
Very often you might bring up something that is dismissed

446
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,520
And they usually give a food analogy, an economic analogy which is shelter

447
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,820
So there's really not much to say or do

448
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,540
It's actually been rather quiet newsworthy wise

449
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,460
Little things sure enough

450
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,300
Growing season, yeah

451
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,500
Growing season is the most activity and that means it's quiet

452
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,980
Because in contrast, let's just translate that into language that people understand

453
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,180
There's a lot going on but they don't know how to report it to the morons at large

454
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,540
And in other words there's so much going on

455
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,420
That they don't even want to refer to it so it's kind of quiet

456
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,460
I assure you the summer is the time of growth

457
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,080
There's tons going on but it's just not on the rectangle or on what's called the news

458
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,740
What will happen usually during the fall

459
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:28,820
Is a burst of things going on because you just can't contain them

460
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,640
And they are reported in their twisted manner

461
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,420
Here's the thing, how can you actually give people the truth when they wouldn't recognize it

462
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,800
I've said in the past, you can't have real education

463
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,560
It's not possible, it's not at this point

464
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,520
It's a Nazi moron

465
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,460
Well if you provided it no one would go because they wouldn't recognize it

466
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,420
That's why I've said they're unrehabilitatable, you can't fix it at this point

467
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,160
It's like the old car analogy

468
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,180
You can't fix it, so what do you do?

469
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,020
You just drive it until it dies and that's exactly how humanity is going to go

470
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,900
But it's not going to die, it's going to be influenced

471
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,740
I had an old Volvo, a 68, I think it was a 4L or DL

472
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,860
And we wanted to junk it and I said let's see what happens

473
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,120
We took the oil out of it, there might have been less than a quart

474
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:37,000
And we ran it for a week, not constantly, but drove it and then it finally seized

475
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,700
Has there ever been an engine that seized?

476
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,680
And I was like wow

477
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,000
This was 35 years ago and the car was 30 years ago, 35 years ago

478
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,150
Or something like that, or 20 something years ago

479
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:04,080
It was more than a 50 year old car and if I would have known that and just maintained it I would still have it

480
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,480
Right

481
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,040
There were some small ones that I fell in love with back then

482
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,620
So humans will be fine, and you don't need many of them

483
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,820
You could start off with 2 and then finish off with 8, but there were more than 2 before that

484
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,360
There were millions before the 2, but that's part of the other discussion

485
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,920
The other thing is you started off with 8 again that we're told about

486
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,300
There were more than then again also

487
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:43,100
In the next two decades for sure there will be less than 500 million people on the earth

488
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,400
If not less than that, on the whole earth, which is still a pretty big number

489
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,520
When you think about it

490
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,080
It's still a very large number

491
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,090
We've got 16 in the stream

492
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,910
We can make this a real short one, 40 minutes or so

493
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,430
What's in a name?

494
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,110
I just came into the office again, let's see what's going on

495
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,210
Sunburn remedy, not really

496
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:31,710
You did have an interesting observation on light, internal light and external

497
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,890
That's going on to the ether discussions which I've never done

498
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,690
Remember once I said let's do something on the weather, it would be 90% about the ether

499
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,910
But the sunburn remedy, yeah

500
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:51,170
You could use intense blue light if you're familiar with chromotherapy

501
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:56,030
You look up chromotherapy, C-H-R-O-M-A therapy

502
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,890
Dinshaw Gaudiality, if you're familiar with that

503
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,170
Using color and light to heal

504
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,970
You did put that in a link a long time back

505
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,610
Dinshaw Gaudiality, he's one of the few people, he had a house in New Jersey

506
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,850
He was running a clinic out of it in the 20's and 30's and the army bombed it

507
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,150
And they said in the newspaper the lab exploded and had a fire

508
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,010
But all the neighbors were like no, an army airplane flew over and dropped a bomb on it

509
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,070
So this is still going on today

510
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,090
Have you ever heard of Waco by the way?

511
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:41,190
Sunburn remedy, just get yourself some blue light bulbs or if you have some blue mylar

512
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:47,710
Like the film gels, are you familiar with theatrical lighting, they're those big high wattage lights

513
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,610
And they use gels in front of them

514
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:55,490
Or blue glass, you can take a blue glass bottle and put a spotlight behind it

515
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,470
And for a few hours you take a nap in a room with the shades drawn

516
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:06,030
I'm here in the office, one of the windows is tinted out completely blue because I'm in the high desert

517
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,570
Blue is a general overall good color for that

518
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,410
Yeah, that would remedy a sunburn or a burn

519
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,450
Green would regrow skin back, yellow is for the internal organs

520
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,690
You can look up Dinshaw Gerialdi or Chromotherapy

521
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,110
That's a good topic

522
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:34,670
Yeah, it's very basic, you just have to be patient with it and you have to be diligent with it

523
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,810
I haven't had a lot of success with it other than the sunburn remedy

524
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,250
Yes, and that does work, if I had a sunburn I would do the blue light for sure

525
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:50,230
In three hours that should make all the pain go away and if you do a few more sessions in a few days

526
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,310
Or within that same day it should probably reverse it

527
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,770
And don't eat food that makes you photosensitive

528
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,650
Like parsley and there's a few others

529
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,730
You could look up what foods make you photosensitive

530
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,750
Obviously chemical foods, artificial sweeteners and things like that, processed foods

531
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,550
Basically it's a standard American diet

532
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:24,350
Yeah, the color of one's skin is dependent on the internal ether light that they have, which is not a visible light

533
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,790
That's why you get a tan

534
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:38,150
When you expose the exterior of the body to let's say a light load, an ethereal load

535
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:45,510
That starts to overcharge the interior, the skin gets darker to filter that out

536
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,390
To preserve the level of internal light for that being

537
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,950
I've been around someone who's Northern European

538
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,150
And if I go out in the sun I tan very quickly and they don't

539
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,570
You'd think they'd tan faster because their internal light is much higher than mine

540
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,480
And I did a long talk about this years ago and people were crying racism

541
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,340
Like you're trying to say black people got a low internal light

542
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,620
No, I'm not trying to say it, I just said it

543
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:23,160
It has nothing to do with it, it's just to do with the internal ether

544
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,780
And eventually you've got lots of phrenology or something

545
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,880
No it doesn't, it's provable

546
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:36,040
This harkens back to water and air and all the constituents to it

547
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,100
And also you can understand skin ailments more

548
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,080
And then the reason for lawful clothes or fibers

549
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,580
There's a lot of connection between that

550
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,300
There is, but they always go astray

551
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,680
Ultimately, for not eating pork

552
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,160
Because they didn't have refrigeration or pork tends to have more parasites

553
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,600
So does rabbit also

554
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,540
But that's not necessarily true either

555
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,640
Because you can segregate and inoculate in a way in the womb

556
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,180
Of baby pigs to not have that

557
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,060
Even though it gets transferred, but they will develop it

558
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,260
Ultimately the reason why you do it is because my dad said so

559
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,680
I hate to bring up this analogy because it's really a play on Simon Magus

560
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,560
But it's not that

561
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,100
The main reason why you should do it is out of respect

562
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,260
For example, when I used to have clients that were from other parts of the world

563
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,100
And they lived in America and they spoke very little English

564
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,500
I spent a week or so learning their language

565
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,460
Whatever language it was so I could communicate

566
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,020
Not because I would be a successful communicator in their languages, but out of respect

567
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,600
So when I'd greet them, if I had a Korean client

568
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,820
I'd say, annyeonghaseyo, bangapsumnida

569
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,180
And they're like, wow, thank you

570
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,460
Out of respect, obviously my Korean sucks

571
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,920
But it starts you off on the right foot

572
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,560
And you do it out of respect

573
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,700
Which isn't really taught much these days by the way

574
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,220
No, and it shouldn't because there's no reason for it anymore

575
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,940
But many people always try to go back to a scientific reason

576
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,500
For you doing biblical, let's say what's fit and proper or lawful

577
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,280
You could, but that should not be something you should even lean on a little bit

578
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,660
For several reasons.

579
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:17,120
One is the science is flawed Two, the science is purely material, where in scripture it's beyond material You know what I mean?

580
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:40,440
I'm not saying it's not possible to lean on what's called good science But the science that is taught is so material based that it's almost It's just not going to work So ultimately you do it because it's the right thing to do That's the moral and ethical question.

581
00:47:40,560 --> 00:48:02,860
If you study morality and ethics There's very little direct tangibility to those things But the tangibility to having morality and ethics is something that develops After you establish the morals and the ethics So let's say you go to a society and you instill bad morals and ethics Well, we just instilled these this past week.

582
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,380
How are we doing?

583
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,100
We're still doing fine Oh, but go check on that society a year from now or five years or ten years from now.

584
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,800
How are they doing then?

585
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:20,680
Tangibly terrible, you see So let's say you discover what's lawful, fit and proper The right thing to do.

586
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:45,380
It doesn't change much and you're not going to find much tangibility in it right away That's why I tell people you could learn this stuff, but if you don't live it, it means nothing Because that's where the tangibility comes in It's the same thing, for example, when you work Even back when you had a good possibility, not even that it was good A possibility of a good education.

587
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,320
When you got to industry, what did they tell you?

588
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,980
Oh, you're just out of college, you don't know anything

589
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,620
Now it's kind of going back and forth because so many people have realized

590
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,780
It's like the birth rate or something now

591
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,520
Well, yeah, because they realized it was bullshit

592
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,040
During the times of Jimmy Carter, people had a lie on their resume that they had a Ph.D. because no one would hire them

593
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,160
They had a lie that they said they only had a high school diploma so they could get a job

594
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,360
And they were over-educated with nothing

595
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,280
But for them to keep the lie going, now they're putting emphasis on it, but it still has no emphasis

596
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,120
But the meaning of the tangibility of knowledge only comes through in practice

597
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Just like, again, the college graduate that's fresh out of school

598
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,700
He goes into industry and they have to show him how we do things in industry

599
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,140
Yes, he can use what he learned in school, but until he learns to tie what he learned in school together

600
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,620
What's in industry, does he get the tangibility out of it?

601
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:59,060
There are people that refuse to make their knowledge tangible and they just stick and become teachers In the conventional sense You see what I mean?

602
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:08,040
But in regard to doing things, you would do it because it's the right thing to do How many times have you heard that?

603
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,940
Well, you know, back in the day when Dad used to say, don't

604
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,920
You agreed, but at the same time, later on in hindsight, you got to understand maybe the reasons behind it

605
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,240
Which usually gave you a lot more information on it

606
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,580
I guess in some ways I find that the same respect

607
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,100
It gets you to understand who you're respecting

608
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,240
The reasons behind it

609
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,900
To understand them is quite puzzling sometimes

610
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,060
But the little pieces that you do get are quite fascinating

611
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,420
Behavior

612
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,000
The last comment, I just came in the office again

613
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,040
This is food, this is not

614
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,900
Well, no, it doesn't really say that either

615
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,940
It goes under the category, because you can eat anything, you can eat human

616
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,220
That's food

617
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,800
It's what you do, remember that when you read the Bible, that's not written for you

618
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Out the box, you have to decide, here's the thing that people miss

619
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,620
The people that the scriptures were written for are long dead

620
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,180
Or some of them are just very young right now

621
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,120
I know it's kind of a harsh statement, right?

622
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:54,240
Anybody in between, it's really not written for them, really And the prophets included And I had a discussion with someone recently from Israel And I was saying, you ever notice the prophets were not popular people?

623
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,320
Because if they were, there would be a hint that they were

624
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,540
It doesn't say that they were liked or popular

625
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:05,840
The way you deal with someone that you didn't want to hang out with when you were in high school

626
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,780
Right, the ditch

627
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,780
What's interesting in scripture is that it's voluntary

628
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,440
Once you learn about this, you have to think about it and decide

629
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,300
A yes or a no

630
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:29,360
And this is the part that proves, in my mind at least

631
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,680
This is an opinion from a theoretical, let's say academic point of view

632
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,740
That man is not finished yet

633
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,140
You ever notice when things are being tested in industry, like cars or airplanes

634
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,880
When they test them for durability, they don't really care about whether it has the finished paint job on it or not

635
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,080
Like planes, they're tested green

636
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,860
It doesn't matter

637
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,840
If you're going to bench test a TV, it doesn't have to have the walnut cabinet on it

638
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:05,060
You just needed the chassis assembled

639
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,360
And it's grounded

640
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,040
And back then they didn't care about grounding too much, it was two pronged, remember?

641
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,660
It was all isolation

642
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,880
And you found out real quick when you weren't

643
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:32,720
So what's interesting about it is there's a higher way of doing things

644
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,380
And then there's the way of doing things

645
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,220
Notice I didn't say lower

646
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,620
The lower, like I said, I've looked high and low for you, but I couldn't find you

647
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,660
So I didn't look low enough

648
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,720
Recently I watched, just to get off of this a minute, I watched a thing about the Holocaust

649
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,220
I think it was a Netflix production

650
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:59,800
It was about making comedy out of it, because what happens when you have a bad situation

651
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,320
If enough time goes past, you can laugh about it

652
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,660
And it was interesting, they had these old comedians

653
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,480
And there was two Jews and they wanted to kill Adolf Hitler

654
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,100
So they go where Adolf Hitler lives and they're waiting around

655
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,780
They were told he'd be back home by 8 o'clock so they could do their deed

656
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,980
So 8 o'clock comes around, Hitler doesn't come around

657
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,620
Another hour goes by, still no Hitler

658
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,100
Another two hours go by, no Hitler

659
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,620
Another three hours go by, Hitler still doesn't come home

660
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,940
And one Jew looks to the other and he says, I hope he's okay

661
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,520
Anyway, it's a joke, right?

662
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:06,100
The interesting thing about all of these things, if you're going to deal on the higher level

663
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,980
You have to understand, things are the way they are

664
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,140
Because how can you give out a leasehold to the earth, to a malevolent being

665
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,360
And then impose what's right to do

666
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,240
That lease would be defunct, it would invalidate the lease

667
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,080
And even if it didn't, I don't see those conditions in the lease

668
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,220
It says you can do this to set yourself apart

669
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,040
Or my people will do this

670
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:46,460
Because it's implied, more than implied, that this reality has been given over to the malevolent beings

671
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,660
Period

672
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,380
So wouldn't that mess up the plan if you had to eat or had to wear or had to do this

673
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,080
Well, the decision was already made

674
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,100
Right, so what happens is the lease is given to the earth to these beings

675
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,820
That influence mankind indirectly and directly

676
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,660
And then the option is still visible

677
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,040
That's why in scripture it says this is how you make yourself what?

678
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:29,800
That's good, no, that's how you make yourself set apart Or my people versus the other guys people You see the point?

679
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:39,280
And up until now, I can say this comfortably and with confidence also

680
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,060
There hasn't been this kind of talk in over 2000 years

681
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,260
And there's some people that have tried doing it in the past

682
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,960
But the moment they say G-O-D and not God's, right

683
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,200
God is not accurate, God's is

684
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Or J-E-S-U-S, creature, they use that all the time

685
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,540
Not only to me, but spiritually that wipes away the rest of what they're doing

686
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,620
You get it?

687
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:27,260
Or Christianity, when they bring up a good Christian or a real Christian They've wiped away that is all work of the adversary I've done the experiment with people in public I told them, close your eyes, I'm going to say something The J-E-S-U-S, do you get an image?

688
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:37,360
They all raise their hands And I told them it was a guy wearing a diaper nailed to a cross Now if I say, Joshua, what image do you get?

689
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,860
And they're like, I don't know, I don't really get one, do you still get the same image?

690
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:46,820
And they're like, no, I don't get the same image Right, you see?

691
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,500
The Greek speak has actually been the first time in thousands of years

692
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,040
Publicly where you have this kind of talk that's been done at all so clearly

693
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,140
And it's kind of sad and pathetic, I should say

694
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,280
You've got so many people and only one place where you can get it pretty much straight

695
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,800
It's kind of sad, but at the same time it is

696
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,740
There's people in the past, again, for thousands of years that have tried

697
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,920
But what do they do?

698
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,020
They go right back to the territory

699
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,140
They have to be comfortable in the territory, they always say the Christian thing

700
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,280
Or the Jewish thing, or the J-E-S-U-S thing, or God thing, there's no God

701
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,980
If you're going to use that term, it must be plural

702
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:43,640
Or if you're referring to one out of a plurality, but the one cannot be necessarily plural

703
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,680
Then you should name it

704
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,840
Then if you start dealing with plurality, it's like, give me the tools from the shed, you know the tool?

705
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,140
Yeah, that one, for the tire, no not that tool, the tool I was talking about for the windshield

706
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,740
That tool, that tool, no the tools, you know where the tools are, the tool, just get the tool

707
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,620
Come on, let's work, how about screwdriver, hammer, open end socket

708
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,400
Why don't we start getting more accurate, you can't, not allowed

709
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,520
And by the way, like Dimitri said in one of his comments

710
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,720
The rulers, the people behind, their God is the adversary by the way

711
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,980
That's why at a recent sonic event I said, if anyone's flying by the planet

712
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,120
And you pointed to the earth and said, this is where the sons and the daughters of the adversary live

713
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,100
That's a very accurate statement

714
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,280
It's on the billboard, on the other side of the moon

715
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,800
When you hear stuff like lunar calendar, or the J-E-S-U-S, or Christianity

716
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,880
Or real Christian, or messianic, or all this stuff

717
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:54,440
That's still talk and rationale and reasoning within the lease

718
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,700
The lease holder, if you know what I mean, within the adversary

719
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:04,020
They're trying to just, what they're doing is, they're creating a negotiable territory

720
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,140
Or a negotiable realm within the adversary's realm

721
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm not saying there's a way to revolt against it either

722
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,200
The only thing to do is set yourself apart, and that's what scripture does

723
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:20,120
It doesn't say do anything, does it?

724
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,440
Respectfully

725
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,480
And I mean on a social scheme

726
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,420
Not on a personal scheme, there's always lots to do

727
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,900
Well on a personal thing, the thing to do is study

728
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,920
And that's the thing that people that are always looking to someone else to tell them what's in scripture

729
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,400
Are never going to figure it out

730
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:54,310
I don't need to explain that, that's obvious

731
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:59,130
If you don't handle the scriptures directly

732
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:04,690
And you're waiting on someone else to tell you what's in it, you're never going to get it yourself

733
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:07,810
Not because there's dependency or anything like that

734
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,130
But because you're just not going to get it, it doesn't work that way

735
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:19,790
Well as I mentioned before we went on, I'm just always drawn back to Genesis

736
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,250
And this has been for the last four or five months easily

737
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:29,530
After getting done in different parts of the book

738
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,790
Especially when I touch other subjects

739
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,630
Especially one with Ether and everything

740
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,730
Well it's non-material

741
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,970
Yeah the issues of counter space

742
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:51,230
I did that one with the grandson about the dot on the paper

743
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,870
And gave him an analogy that way about that

744
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:55,790
And he got it

745
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:00,850
Good, and I'm not saying that's what it is, that the dot on the paper is the end of a line

746
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:07,490
To massage, to start flexing the mind into that possibility

747
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,090
Because we can't really go into counter space

748
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:13,690
Because the very nature of our perception is materially based

749
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:18,130
And I've given you an example that if you didn't have that round organ in your head called an eye

750
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:23,210
You wouldn't see things, and I mean that eye that humans have

751
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,130
You wouldn't see things the way that you do

752
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:30,370
If you had the eye of an insect or an animal or no eye and you're a spiritual being

753
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:33,950
What you call light appears very very differently

754
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:40,450
And you can prove this very simply by using methods of diffraction and filtering

755
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:48,090
There are sensors that you can use, you've heard of different filter sensors or frequency sensors that only see infrared

756
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:53,690
For example, you're not going to necessarily use that to determine the color of wallpaper

757
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,610
There's no color in most of the perceptions that exist

758
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,290
Only we have this sense of color that we have

759
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:06,690
And a dog has a sense of color that he has because his eye is different

760
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:12,830
And we can see how things, no pun here, how other creatures see by dissecting the eye

761
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:20,590
Cryptochromes and various aspects of structure and layout

762
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:25,890
We can hypothecate and infer how sight would be to that creature

763
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:35,390
But one thing that we cannot infer is what would sight be like to a spiritual creature that has no material sense of sensing light

764
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:42,250
They sense it beyond, or they don't see, like the gods don't see, for example, a green wallpaper like we do

765
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:47,850
Well, the fact that in Genesis, at the beginning, he separated light and dark

766
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,150
Right, well there's also the concept of

767
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:56,490
The concept of, let's say, attribute

768
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:02,790
In our world, darkness doesn't have an attribute, it's just the absence of light

769
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,510
That's the most we can attribute to darkness

770
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:10,790
But in Scripture, there's actually aspects of darkness where it's substance-based

771
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,190
So that means it's counter-spatial

772
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,590
Counter-spatial reference

773
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:25,570
So when things are mentioned in Scripture as a substance, or inferred to as substantive

774
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:31,270
That are without substance or attribute in our world, that's a counter-spatial reference

775
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:35,530
I have a short list of those, a short list of about 20 items

776
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:39,210
And I have not talked about those publicly or privately much

777
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:48,430
And here's the other thing, in privately, it has been over 12 years or so that I've discussed some of the stuff in Genesis or Revelation

778
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,890
Even privately, I used to have calls with people on a regular basis

779
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:55,370
And I would not discuss the book of Revelation and other things like that

780
01:04:55,370 --> 01:05:01,130
So I really don't discuss many of the stuff at all for a very long time

781
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,550
And I've actually tried to increase my awareness of these things by meditating on them

782
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,350
And perhaps even, I should say, begin to study again

783
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:14,770
But it doesn't mean that there is a time coming that, you know, there has to be a demand for it

784
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,150
And it has to be appropriate.

785
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:36,770
It's not appropriate, either for me or anyone, I believe To just come out and start running their mouth on the, what I would call, even though I don't think they're respectable The ancient sages would say that, if you understand something, good And if you don't, just be happy with what you do understand You know what I mean?

786
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:48,130
So in other words, it's not for you to need to know basis But there is a time where if the, let's just say there's an insurmountable demand Then that demand must be met.

787
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:53,510
Or if the equation becomes so large That it needs to be equalized, then you do it.

788
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:58,630
But otherwise it's fine to go to your death And not reveal it.

789
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:07,190
But on the other hand You can say it's neither this or that because knowledge and knowing is its own reward And that's satisfactory.

790
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:11,830
Since when do you get a reward and you share it with others?

791
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,530
Then it's not your reward.

792
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:27,970
Then it's a communal thing And what I'm saying is knowledge, what people, you can infer this It may not necessarily be the whole aspect of it, but knowledge is a personal thing It's not a communal thing.

793
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,230
And that can be proven logistically

794
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:35,930
In other words, you can get a hundred people in a room and give a base of knowledge

795
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:40,950
And if you interview the hundred people, they're all going to give you a version of it

796
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:46,370
But the one who gets it may not be able to communicate it

797
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,690
But he got it, so he did get his reward

798
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,990
Give an example, we're in Exodus, you know

799
01:06:54,490 --> 01:07:01,030
How was knowledge a reward on the community level when they were being led out by supernatural and paranormal forces

800
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,850
And they were still grumbling and complaining

801
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,430
Why is this going on?

802
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:32,550
We'd rather be in Egypt where we have the leek and the garlic In our comfort So that proves right there that having an even overt display is not a reward for the community And it's right in front of them Since when has a depository of a great library been a reward to the community?

803
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:33,570
Since when?

804
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:33,830
Never.

805
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,650
Only to those that actually go in there and find the gems that are held within

806
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,010
So knowledge is a personal reward

807
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,130
Just to consider that

808
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,650
And you don't have to share it

809
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,890
And even if you tried to share it, you may not be able to

810
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:55,910
Right, you may not be able to communicate all the fine points

811
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:03,550
That's why I go back to saying, like I said earlier, there are many still that rely on others to tell them what's in Scripture

812
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,330
Without, let's say, an onward assault on the Scripture themselves

813
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:12,130
And yes, you're going to have to assault it, meaning assault as being an affront

814
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:18,270
Because when you start in the society that you're living in, you're going to have to go through all the layers

815
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:21,569
In a very almost militant way

816
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:28,310
The first thing they throw at your feet is aversion, and you're going to have to assault it

817
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,890
You're going to have to say, this is crap

818
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,130
Then you go to an interlinear, and then you assault that

819
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:40,990
You keep going back and back, and then you find things that are said are preserved, and you find out there's things missing

820
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,710
I had a conversation with someone

821
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:47,890
I'm not going to mention names recently, usually when I say that I mention a name, but I won't

822
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:54,590
And I said, do me a favor, this did not exist by the way a few years ago, it exists now

823
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:56,050
On the internet

824
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:01,670
Go look up, just do a regular search in whatever browser you use

825
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,569
Verses removed from the New Testament

826
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:09,990
I'm serious, there's some good study, I did that a few months ago

827
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:15,210
And actually there's a few people that in a scholarly way said these verses were in and now they've been removed

828
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:19,090
And they give you the history of when they were removed and maybe why

829
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:22,890
And then do another search, a total separate search

830
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,609
Verses that were added to the New Testament

831
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:32,850
Just put that, verses that were added to the New Testament

832
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:38,870
And you're going to see at least 10 to 20 verses that were added in the versions that you have that were not

833
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,109
In the Aramaic or Greek even

834
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:44,270
Or you'll see ones that were added in the Greek later

835
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:48,970
I have three Greek New Testaments and they're all different, what does that tell you?

836
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,330
I'm doing that as we speak

837
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:57,650
You'll see there's a couple of websites out there where they've actually done the work

838
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:03,830
And they'll cite, especially most of them tend to go around the Erasmus, the Texas Receptus

839
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:08,930
That's like around the text that was used to give you the versions that you have today which is really screwed up

840
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,830
Around that time you'll see the discrepancies

841
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:19,970
But again, the homework might be for anyone inclusive of what I'm saying in terms of being a militant assault on the Scripture

842
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,730
That you have to perform in order to get close to it

843
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:28,330
Is do a search in the browser, verses that have been removed from the New Testament

844
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,990
And then do a separate search, verses that have been added to the New Testament

845
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:35,870
And you'll see lists and lists and lists

846
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:40,530
And you tell me if you have a valid document, and I'm telling you you don't

847
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:46,970
Somebody asked a question about, do you know something about the three brains of the body?

848
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:56,470
I'm familiar with the concept of brain tissue in the heart Right?

849
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:04,770
And then there's a part of the brain that's in the mouth, actually brain tissue on the roof of the mouth Are you familiar with that?

850
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,090
With this I'm going to have to lean on the ancient Egyptians

851
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:17,830
When they mummified people they had special vessels for all of the organs and all that

852
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:22,110
But if you ask them, where's the vessel for the brain, they say that's completely useless

853
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:26,990
They would just put two rods, like knitting needles through the nose

854
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:29,770
And stir it up until it became liquefied and then pour it out

855
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,910
That's how they got the brain out without opening the skull

856
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:39,810
They'd just stick a bunch of knitting needles through the nose and keep stirring for a few hours

857
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,950
Until it goes into liquid state and they just pour it out

858
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:50,230
Yeah, I just repeated myself to give a more accurate thing

859
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:52,850
So people, I guess they do the Halloween thing, but anyway

860
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,410
Yeah, you pagans out there might figure some technique

861
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:04,010
Anyway, so I think it's useless for many levels, the brain

862
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:09,670
Because it's a receptor, you can see it's basically an embedded folded transmission line

863
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:11,690
You know how the intestines are all bunched up?

864
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:24,450
If you look at all the folds in the brain, just stretch that sucker out I'm not saying that you can, but you see how it forms I can tell you that most people can live a pretty normal life without a brain right now You get it?

865
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,350
Like Jack Fresco said, normal just means fucked up

866
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,010
Adjusted

867
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,470
Yeah, so I don't think there's much discussion about the brain

868
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:37,290
I tend not to go there because most people don't need it

869
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:45,010
And even if you want to go on the other level, it receives from the external input

870
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:49,430
And we've already established what your input's going to be like

871
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:55,550
And your output will be the same

872
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,670
Otherwise, unless it's set apart

873
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,290
And then if it's set apart, you realize the brain is just the condition of your antenna

874
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:07,150
And of course there's motor functions that extend into it

875
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:11,710
Just like all the organs, if you go to some medical practitioners in other cultures

876
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:15,350
In the western, they only look for a heart and lung pulse

877
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:21,230
Breathing is actually a pulsing in the heart, but in other cultures, each organ has its own pulse

878
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,290
And it does, you can measure it

879
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:27,250
It's very faint, some are actually pretty prominent

880
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:30,930
Different rhythms

881
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:37,650
I think in this society, for the past several thousand years

882
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:40,030
The discussion about the brain is irrelevant

883
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:44,230
But nonetheless, is there anything provided about the three brains?

884
01:13:45,050 --> 01:14:14,340
Let's see, I'll go back to there I'm not near a computer now, so I'll be short Nope, changed on to something else Gurdjieff's teachings I'll have to look them up Anything else?

885
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:40,100
That's about it Park used to be storage in the old fattened barrels When the old timers didn't have refrigerators, at least in Cuba For people in the countryside We lose you?

886
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:51,000
Stirring in some coffee I guess if there's nothing else, maybe we'll just Any other thoughts?

887
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:57,940
Like I said before, it's a neat little ritual once in a while

888
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:03,480
The weeks, by the way, by doing what we call a pagan Tuesday

889
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,520
Is not once a week, but it appears that it is

890
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,660
It appears, yes

891
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,520
And we will take call-ins

892
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,780
If you'd like to call in with your questions, that would be good

893
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:24,600
Stir up the conversation, or screw up the conversation

894
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,720
Stir it up

895
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,860
I usually see it as a screw up, but that's okay

896
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,680
Did you have something good to eat, at least in the past few days?

897
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,600
Because there is that concept

898
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,460
The chances of having something really good to eat every day

899
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,520
Is quite rare for most people, by the way

900
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,680
Especially in the Western culture, or actually anywhere

901
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:04,320
I'm actually very hot up this way, so I've been eating rather light

902
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,940
It's interesting how that works

903
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,640
It really does

904
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,560
Are you dressed for comfort, are you dressed lawfully

905
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,740
Are you dressed in a healthful way, and the same with your surroundings

906
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:24,140
Are you comfortable in your shelter, are you warm when it's cold out

907
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,000
And are you cool when it's hot out

908
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,080
And other than that, there's not much to do

909
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:35,060
Wait it out, I think the real fun in this whole thing is going to be after the resurrection

910
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,240
Other than getting caught up in all the machinations and all the bullshit that's coming

911
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,340
There's plenty of dummy load out there

912
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,820
To keep you occupied

913
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,020
Okay, I see here

914
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,720
In regard to ground zero, you mentioned three terms, I don't know what that means

915
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:00,140
Well, ground zero is in a technical sense

916
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,400
Let's say you work in that field

917
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,620
You work in that field

918
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:13,260
Which is the nuclear technology

919
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,980
When it comes to devices that detonate

920
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:24,100
You have ground zero definition, which is the location on earth, above the earth or below the earth

921
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,080
Or the water where the device is detonated

922
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:32,600
The device itself is called a zero box

923
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,260
It's not called a nuke, it's not called a bomb, it's not called a whatever

924
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,640
It's called a zero box

925
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,000
It's like, hey man, where's the zero box?

926
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,400
And then when the device goes off, that's called zero time

927
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,380
And for civil use and peaceful use, most

928
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,640
I'll say it, most detonation mechanisms

929
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,260
I wouldn't say it's directly for international treaty

930
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:09,520
But most detonations, especially in the civil use, are structured

931
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,340
To be 2959 zero time, so 30 minutes

932
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:18,760
So you have 29 minutes 59 seconds and then on 30 it's called zero time

933
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,040
So you have ground zero as the location on the earth

934
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,400
Zero box is the device itself and zero time is when it goes off

935
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:32,480
For the car bombs and the other forms of terrorism that they're using

936
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,800
The zero time would be when they trigger it

937
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:44,280
They tell you it's a terrorist car bomb and then it has a yield of 200 tons of TNT

938
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,960
Well, it was a milk truck

939
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:51,700
Well, let's just see, a railroad car holds about 50 tons

940
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,700
And that's about four times or three times the size of a milk truck

941
01:18:54,700 --> 01:19:02,560
And you need the equivalent of four railroad cars to meet the 200 ton yield

942
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,640
So how do you put that in a milk truck?

943
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:16,100
Yeah, but not that much Not even 50, but still 50 to a railroad, where is it?

944
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:29,800
The stuff that you can get away with on people is just unbelievable Don't even try to wrap your mind around it and rationalize what people believe You know what else I found fascinating?

945
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,840
Is that back in the day when you used to watch these quote-unquote news programs

946
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:41,660
Even local stuff, you used to have a place on the website where you could leave comments

947
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,320
You don't see that no more, period

948
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,080
They'd have their own little websites

949
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:55,040
They don't want you feeding back and putting your two cents out to the people

950
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,600
Here's a good reason for that

951
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,440
Go read the comments on any YouTube

952
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:06,180
So stupid, any YouTube

953
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:12,860
Even if you go to a fairly sane, benign subject

954
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:16,600
You can see their brains are mush already

955
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,260
But at the same time, cutting off the communication

956
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,780
Another form of it, I just found it interesting

957
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:30,080
And that's been the last 10 years easy, 15 if I wanted to go on a limb

958
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,400
Interesting how that's cut away

959
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,740
What could people possibly say that matters?

960
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:47,060
Well under a subject of a man breastfeeding his child

961
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:52,860
Which was an interesting one in today's little piece of trivia

962
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,120
Oh God

963
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,680
I'm getting a question in Skype, it's fairly long

964
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,100
It's regarding the Elohim and the Elim

965
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,300
Well that is a deific

966
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,660
Different Elohim, Elim, it's basically a language thing

967
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:23,720
The different gods that you see calling on the name of Yahweh

968
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,560
When they began to call the name of Yahweh

969
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,900
If you read that in context, it's actually more than just calling on the name of Yahweh

970
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,780
Because we're talking about an early population on the earth

971
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:41,640
But in Genesis, this is going to have to go into that discussion I didn't want to do

972
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,880
But if you, for example

973
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,820
The various forms of El, Elim, Elohim

974
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,100
Are the various language and dialect as well

975
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:58,140
If you try to find the oldest preserved text of the book of Daniel

976
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,480
It's not in Hebrew, it's in Aramaic

977
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:06,480
Because it was penned along the Babylonian cognate

978
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,340
Or the Akkadian Aramaic cognate

979
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,440
Now, El, you'll see

980
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:19,080
El, El-Yi or El-Allah

981
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,340
You've heard of Allah, right?

982
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:27,860
El-Ah is God or The God, El-God, The God

983
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,800
The God of Gods, El-Allah

984
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:35,500
So you know how they give you the typical Arabic cognate of Allah, Allah

985
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,880
It's not Allah, it's El-Allah

986
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,440
It's the God of Gods or The God, so there's no name even with Allah

987
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,740
I've pressed several Muslims and said, yeah we don't know his name

988
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,520
They literally tell you that, it's not his name, yeah we know that

989
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,260
Most Muslims, they're like Mormons, they don't know anything

990
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,840
Or whatever, Catholics or take your pick, any religion, they don't know anything

991
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:05,140
But if you try to structure a rational definition around what people are using

992
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,420
It's basically language changes

993
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,040
I think I've mentioned this before

994
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,400
When you hear the Muslims say Allah, that's Al-Allah

995
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:25,580
That's an Akkadian cognate, old Arabic cognate for meaning the God of Gods or The God

996
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:32,040
There's no name there, so that's interesting how that is also negated

997
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,400
What I liked about that is Dimitri brought that up

998
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,780
How Taurah is Torah in Arabic and that's really fundamental Islam

999
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:46,480
I haven't gone through too much discussion on that

1000
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,300
But what you had in the Middle East up until what's called

1001
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,980
The Islamic Movement 1500 years ago or really less than 1000 years ago

1002
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:03,720
It wasn't until the Ottoman Empire kicked in that it really started becoming more formalized

1003
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:09,140
But all the descendants of Abraham and thereof

1004
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:15,000
They came within the concept of law that we consider the concept of law that's Biblical

1005
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,660
Even if you listen to these Patriot idiots

1006
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,400
They'll tell you, oh America, well it's Biblical law

1007
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:28,040
If you understand the UCC code, the 72 hours of writer refusal

1008
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,440
Commercial laws go back to Biblical law

1009
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,840
The entire world at one point was under Biblical law

1010
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,160
The known world let's say

1011
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:45,440
But that overlapped or was overlapped over it depending on how you want to look at it

1012
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,020
The pagan stuff

1013
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:54,440
So that's why very often when you look at the various aspects of Islam, it's territorial

1014
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,620
Just like the various aspects of Christianity, it's territorial

1015
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,480
Because those are the regional pagan traditions

1016
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,280
And they just eventually say, well just make it another form of Christianity

1017
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,760
For example, American Christianity, you have the Baptists here, you have the Mormons here

1018
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,840
In Utah, Arizona, Colorado

1019
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,680
You've got the Catholics on the East Coast, typically

1020
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:25,120
And in Rome, you've got the Catholics and that part of Roman influence

1021
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,260
Western and Eastern, you've got the Eastern Orthodox

1022
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,580
Then you've got a different form of Catholicism in Mexico

1023
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,720
And then a different one in Asia

1024
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,080
So basically, they adjust

1025
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,840
In Islam, different parts of the Islamic world have different parts of Islam

1026
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,160
That are based on whatever political thing was overlapped

1027
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:52,160
Over the pagan local geographic entities

1028
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:59,960
It gets kind of complex, and I think I've gone through these analogies before

1029
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,740
On various sonics, but not in detail, there's no reason to

1030
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,720
Because what is needed is to equalize the stupidity

1031
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,760
There's almost no depth to the level of stupidity that's in the world

1032
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,080
So why not just try to balance the equation

1033
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,760
By just making a short, succinct, clear, rational way to look at what's called the truth

1034
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:30,460
But with the analogy I gave about all of the various religions

1035
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,540
You can see through historically what's known as

1036
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,880
Like Demetri said, God's law

1037
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:44,580
Meaning the one that we find given to Moses, codified

1038
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:49,660
When I mean codified, meaning it has a pattern

1039
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:54,200
It has a meme and a story behind it

1040
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:58,780
Like Leviticus, the first five books of Moses centered with Leviticus for law

1041
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,460
That was known, not in its entirety, and not in its whole

1042
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:09,660
Maybe in part, but maybe in some places throughout the whole world, especially the Middle East

1043
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,420
And actually I've also mentioned before

1044
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:19,560
There's over a dozen mentions, direct mentions to Moses and the biblical law in the Koran anyway

1045
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:26,400
Well it's good that you gave the history on that also, that helps a lot

1046
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,620
Sure, and again, when you speak about

1047
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,400
I think Demetri in his video was talking about the western world

1048
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,220
One thing that people don't understand is

1049
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:42,080
There is no safe place, there is no better place

1050
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:46,820
How many times have you folks heard me make references, well it's earth

1051
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:52,240
The whole earth is under this negative lease

1052
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:56,420
There's no place to go, there is no place geographic

1053
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:00,480
Dirt under your fingernails place of safety, it's a spiritual one

1054
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,120
This is what people don't understand

1055
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:08,780
There was a big movement from the 19th century to the late 20th century that there was a place of safety

1056
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,160
That you have to find, and that's like the wrong, again that's

1057
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,240
Has to be in accordance with the stupidity that's been put out

1058
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,580
And that's why I think it's important to, if you've never heard of counter space

1059
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:28,580
Get a, I wouldn't say familiar, sometimes there's people

1060
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,980
Years I've discussed this, I still don't understand it

1061
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:38,040
In other words a reality where none of your reality works the way you comprehend reality

1062
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,620
Is the reality of the gods, the spiritual world

1063
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:47,860
That's where the safety is, and that non-physical world controls the physical world

1064
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:54,990
All right, so I'm going to dip, I think we're at about an hour and a half

1065
01:28:54,990 --> 01:29:00,830
That's an old word, remember dip means I'm going to go right, so thanks everyone

1066
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:03,170
Anything else Bruce, otherwise we'll just close it right here

1067
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:06,270
I think we've ran out of questions

1068
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:13,610
We had 19 in there tonight

1069
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,030
Oh that's fine

1070
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:23,730
Three or four people is enough to balance the equation on a planetary level believe it or not

1071
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,590
That's four times more than we need

1072
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:32,290
You take care sir, and thank you very much
