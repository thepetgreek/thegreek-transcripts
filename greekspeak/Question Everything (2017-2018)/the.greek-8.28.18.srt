1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,840
Greetings, folks, and we're here with the Greek.

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,500
And how are you doing tonight, Greek?

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,540
Greetings.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,360
OK, good.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,760
I just want to wish everyone a happy

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,540
seventh month.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't know how many of the species

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,420
that are listening, the various species, I should

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,500
say, understand what the seventh month really even

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,120
means, because most people don't know how to

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,380
study.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,540
They have to get their information from someone

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,920
else.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,280
Someone else has to tell them what the

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,240
scripture says.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,400
Someone else has to tell them what this

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,840
is.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,340
Someone else.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,640
Right.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,140
So giving them hints and having them go

21
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,660
off and looking at source material, heaven forbid,

22
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,680
that's not going to happen.

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,760
Not out there tonight.

24
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,460
It's getting worse and worse.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:54,840
Yes.

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Oh, yeah.

27
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,780
It's going to get.

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah.

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,420
The speed.

30
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,940
Well, you know, the species is set up

31
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,540
for destruction right now, which actually I was

32
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,740
listening to something, well, more than just listening,

33
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,700
researching and trying to find how many people

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,200
understand external input and very little, even those

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,480
that have researched, quote unquote, demonology.

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,320
And what I mean by demonology, a demon,

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,660
a demonion in ancient Greek just meant a

38
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,540
spiritual being.

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,180
But in Western civilization, that means something negative.

40
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,380
Well, usually it is.

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,760
And I could get into it a little

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,000
bit.

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,560
You know, it's the seventh month, which is

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
one of the highest months.

45
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,280
What's interesting about that, just for a moment,

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,980
and I'll get into what the demonology and

47
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,320
all that stuff really is.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,780
You know, the first month is a high

49
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,480
month because of what happens with man.

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,520
And the seventh month is a high month

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,760
where that happens with the divine.

52
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,960
If you notice all of the appointed things

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,440
for the most high appointed days in the

54
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,540
seventh month are geared towards him, where when

55
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,140
you look at the first month, it's geared

56
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,860
towards man.

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:07,700
Right.

58
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,120
You know, and then you have.

59
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,000
So this is a very different mindset.

60
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,020
Most people don't understand, again, why they do

61
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,440
things.

62
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,460
They'll mouth off, well, because of this, but

63
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,060
they really don't get it because they think

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,980
that it's black and white, cut and dried,

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,440
right and wrong.

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,500
There's because of the culture that they're in.

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,940
You know, it depends on what culture you're

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,100
in.

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,360
Right.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,600
So let's go back to the what they

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,580
call demons.

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,060
And when you look at it from that

73
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,640
perspective, it means it's a it's a Latinized

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
Greek word, which means spirit, basically.

75
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,220
But what's interesting is when you put that

76
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,280
together with, you know, the Septuagint, which is

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,600
a Greek witness of the ancient Masoretic texts,

78
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,280
well, they weren't really like you call Masoretic,

79
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,740
not really, but the Hebrew cognate, because remember,

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,840
the Hebrew cognate was Akkadian Armenian, Aramaic, Canaanite

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,400
languages also.

82
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,120
So it was a cognate, just like Latin

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,700
cognate romance languages back then.

84
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,600
So so the only other witness to that

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,560
that we have is maybe some Egyptian, maybe

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,740
and but mostly the Greek Septuagint.

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,000
When you how many times you ever heard

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,900
me say, that's not what it says.

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,400
And you go actually look at it.

90
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,540
And even sometimes in an interlinear, they they'll

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,460
mess it up, too.

92
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,240
But if you study the word, it's not

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,920
what it says.

94
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,580
You know, like Moses, for example, comes down

95
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,140
off the mountain.

96
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
He has horns on his head, but they

97
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
put that his head was shining.

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:43,880
Right.

99
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,320
So what's interesting is, I think if you

100
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,960
listen to Greek speak till now, most people

101
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,740
understand that what I've said, can be followed

102
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,620
through with source material and references.

103
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,740
And what I mean by that, well, what

104
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,080
did I say that can be followed through

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,380
with references and source materials, that there's a

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,300
society of gods, it's not just one God,

107
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
and all this, right.

108
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,200
And he rolls around with an entourage, he

109
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,700
has agents and all that.

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,240
Well, one thing that is has been brought

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,880
up in the past is like, from apocalyptic

112
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,839
writings, the four horsemen, the four workmen in

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,360
Zechariah, the book of Zechariah.

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,020
One thing that isn't really discussed are that

115
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,040
there are four types of beings that do

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,740
follow him around because that he rolls with

117
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,280
that are not necessarily part of his character,

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,820
but do attend where he is in many

119
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,100
cases, just like a shark with pilot fish,

120
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,820
you know how they're stuck on him, right?

121
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,420
Okay.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,060
Now, if you look up, for example, these

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,060
things keep showing up and they're very vague,

124
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,280
but they're clear once you know what to

125
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,700
look for.

126
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,200
There are four entities that accompany the Most

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
High when he's dealing with people.

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,060
And remember, if you understand good and evil,

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
both good and evil come from the Most

130
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,140
High.

131
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,860
See, Satan is not good or evil, he's

132
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,500
just a deceiver, a liar, a murderer.

133
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,140
He's basically everything, it's his world, everything you

134
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,860
see in the world.

135
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,080
But, you know, good is, you know, pleasure

136
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,700
and prosperity and pleasant trees, pleasant things, you

137
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,860
know, food, clothing, shelter.

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,100
And evil is basically destruction, pestilence, and all

139
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,040
these other things, right?

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Terrors.

141
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,360
And those words are key words because one

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,380
of the entities, you'll find this in the

143
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,700
Psalms, you'll find it in Habakkuk, and you'll

144
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,740
find it in other places if you find

145
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,180
the words.

146
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,420
I think it's like Psalm 90 or Psalm

147
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,880
91.

148
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,020
There is an entity, he's known as the

149
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,920
night terror entity, the terror of the night,

150
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,220
right?

151
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,460
I think it's Damuk Laila, right?

152
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,060
There's another entity that accompanies the Most High

153
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,760
when he's dealing with civilizations, and he's the

154
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,700
day, the spirit of the midday, and he'll,

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,660
they translate that into arrow quite often.

156
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,680
There's a prayer where it says that I

157
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,980
miss the arrows and the midday arrows, okay?

158
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
Now, if you look up the words for

159
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,040
the terror, the midday arrows, those are Canaanite

160
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,540
gods.

161
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,840
Literally, one is a demon or a spirit

162
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,420
that brings terror by night.

163
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,400
You know, like very often people understand that

164
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,760
bad things come at night while they're sleeping

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,720
or while they're doing other things, whatever the

166
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,460
culture is.

167
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,440
Even the ones that try to appease or

168
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,900
summon, you know, they do rituals at night,

169
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,180
right?

170
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,180
Then you have the other one, which is

171
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,960
midday, which is literally the midnoon day one,

172
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
and he brings arrows.

173
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,260
Then there's another one.

174
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,580
The Hebrew and Canaanite names vary, but they

175
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,540
basically mean the same thing.

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
These are four different things.

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,080
The other one is the pestilence.

178
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,340
He's the spirit of pestilence.

179
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,860
When you look at the word that's used

180
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,540
for pestilence and find it in the Hebrew,

181
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,120
then you'll see that it's a Canaanite god

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
also.

183
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,520
Then you find the other one for destruction.

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,640
There's a spirit that brings destruction.

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,460
When you find that word in an interlinear,

186
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,420
you'll see that is also a name of

187
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,160
a Canaanite god that brings destruction.

188
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,780
Here we have four gods that follow the

189
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,380
Most High.

190
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,140
They're like in his toolbox.

191
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,640
To bring terror by night, terror by day,

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,340
or basically peril by day, then you have

193
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,500
one for pestilence and then one for destruction.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,640
They're in his toolbox, and they're evil.

195
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,020
Obviously they're not there to do good.

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,240
He unloads them on people based on societies

197
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,920
and individuals, depending on what he sees fit.

198
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,180
That's a little advanced for most people, but

199
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,880
I think if you understand Greek-speak, this

200
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,780
is not a black-and-white, cut-and

201
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,300
-dried thing.

202
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a very elaborate society, very elaborate, meaning

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,420
there's a lot of variety and many levels

204
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,900
of hierarchy and power.

205
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,240
You can keep going and finding what these

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,200
words mean, and you'll find them very often.

207
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,000
I think Sam tried to touch on some

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,880
of this notion with Canaanite gods.

209
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,240
There's a lot of people trying to say,

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
Yahweh is a Canaanite god, and this and

211
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,299
that.

212
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,299
No, just because he shows up in Canaanite

213
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,400
writings, it doesn't mean that he's a Canaanite

214
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,780
god.

215
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,380
Just because these other guys, the pestilence, the

216
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,840
night terror, the day danger, let's say, and

217
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,060
the other one is the destroyer, shows up

218
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,760
in Canaanite writings, Phoenician writings, let's say, doesn't

219
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,880
mean that they're their gods.

220
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,100
These gods are cross-national, by the way,

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
so they can be adopted by people, they

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,860
follow people.

223
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,360
So anyway, I just wanted to bring that

224
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
up because Seventh Month is a good month

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,460
to get into the spiritual side studies, by

226
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:18,740
the way.

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
It's also the breaking down period, harvesting this

228
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,340
whole month, so watch for things breaking down

229
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,940
in the media and the news.

230
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
If you know a place that's important, let's

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
say, I'm going to go wireless, I'm going

232
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,320
to unplug these wires, hopefully I won't lose

233
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,620
sound.

234
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,500
Let me know if I do.

235
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,140
I will.

236
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,720
Okay.

237
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,620
Alright.

238
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,940
Let's say, how to watch the news, let's

239
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,420
say you see your ends in the news,

240
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,700
right?

241
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,220
All the time about this, that, and the

242
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,400
other.

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,780
Give an example, Persia.

244
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,280
And then all of a sudden it's not

245
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,760
in the news.

246
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,120
Well, that means they have nothing petty to

247
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,440
say.

248
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,320
That means there's some serious shit going on.

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,360
Because it's the opposite.

250
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,800
Remember, these are liars, right?

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,700
Everything that's ever been memorialized to the populace

252
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,600
is a lie.

253
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,540
Even food, when you go to the food

254
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,000
aisle, look at the grocery store, it's all

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,380
a lie.

256
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,740
I was talking to someone recently, I said,

257
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,580
well, if it was a society of engineers,

258
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,020
they wouldn't have the label of the food

259
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,820
or the name of the food out, they

260
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,440
would have the ingredients enlarged, and the ingredients

261
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
would be the label.

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,020
So the engineer is walking down the aisle,

263
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,380
and he says, oh, water, soy, maltodextrose, red

264
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,160
color, okay, I'll take that.

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,580
But, you know, they call that American cheese,

266
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:36,980
right?

267
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,580
Right.

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,480
You see, so for the idiots, you call

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,340
it Cheerios, or McDonald's, or American cheese, but

270
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,200
for the engineer, he's not interested in what

271
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,220
you call it, it's what's in it.

272
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,640
You should have in big letters all the

273
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
ingredients, and just very pronounced, bold on the

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,220
front of the package, right?

275
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:52,900
Right.

276
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,220
So anyway, you see, so this is the

277
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,260
elements of Greek speak, is try to bring

278
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,840
out what's in it and make it bold,

279
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,840
versus what people talk about.

280
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
You know, they still, yeah.

281
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,040
People lack the mindset within their realm, meaning

282
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,460
the realm that they understand.

283
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,200
Like Dimitri says, there's something called, he uses

284
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,980
the term a lot, I forgot what he

285
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,680
was using, Kalazov, ideology.

286
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,920
Okay, yeah.

287
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
There is someone like, for example, on a

288
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
local Craigslist, answering back to the people complaining

289
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
about the Air Force jets' noise, and he

290
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,380
says, oh, you're a bunch of pussies, you

291
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,100
know, these guys are defending your freedom, you

292
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,900
should appreciate it.

293
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,360
I mean, oh boy, because they're not.

294
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,820
You know, the military has nothing to do

295
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,220
with defending your freedom, they work for the

296
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,260
oligarchs, and they, yeah, they're weaponized morons.

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,020
So someone like that doesn't understand what freedom

298
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,780
is, obviously.

299
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,840
So what I mean by that is, people

300
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,120
that say they're spiritual and religious don't know

301
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,820
anything about that, you see?

302
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,140
Like people who say they're defending, the military

303
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,620
is defending your freedom, don't know what freedom

304
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,220
is, they don't know what the military is.

305
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,540
Even if they do it, even if it's

306
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,680
their job to say that.

307
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,020
Obviously they lack the ideology of what freedom

308
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,260
is.

309
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,640
The minute you see constitutional, republic, or justice,

310
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
prepare to be enslaved, hopelessly.

311
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:16,480
Right?

312
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Amen.

313
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
So, yeah, so that people that say that

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,320
they know scripture, or know spirituality, know about

315
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,700
that, be prepared that that is just a

316
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,160
farce.

317
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,420
Right?

318
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,020
Because if, the reason why it has to

319
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,740
be a farce, is because if it wasn't,

320
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,840
no one would listen to them.

321
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,320
Right.

322
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,880
Right.

323
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,180
In other words, what's popular is not true,

324
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,260
and what's true is not popular.

325
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,280
So anyway, I'm going to make some coffee

326
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,560
here.

327
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,760
Hopefully, I'm going to mute out if I

328
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,280
have to grind.

329
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,200
I want to thank the fellow in the

330
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Northwest who sent still a great variety of

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,620
coffee, a couple of kilos almost.

332
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,300
Light roasts, very delicious, so I've been enjoying

333
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,580
them.

334
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,560
And a really long letter.

335
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,520
And I also want to thank the fellow

336
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,140
on the East Coast that sent a contribution

337
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,160
a few weeks ago.

338
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,180
Again, I just want to thank them again,

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,560
those two.

340
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,640
So much appreciated.

341
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,920
So okay, anything in chat?

342
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,260
Anything?

343
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,280
I'm just going to go back into the

344
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,040
office here shortly, and I will see if

345
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,600
there's anything else.

346
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,040
Otherwise, we'll make it a real short one.

347
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,620
Okay.

348
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,980
Let's see, there was one from someone here.

349
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,840
I saw on chat just a couple of

350
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,040
people realize that it's the seventh month.

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah.

352
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,900
Well, at least compared to...

353
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,880
If there's anasonic event...

354
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
And there was a question about weight loss.

355
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,440
Yeah, weight loss.

356
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Let's see, since we don't understand the container,

357
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,020
we can't possibly understand weight loss and proper

358
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,800
how-tos.

359
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,900
Also, is there a better exercise regime than

360
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,360
others?

361
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,800
Thank you in advance.

362
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,520
Not really.

363
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,200
Fasting, weight loss, the best way to lose

364
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,500
weight is to get stressed out.

365
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,080
That'll do it.

366
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,400
Depends on the emotional state, the feeding emotional

367
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,800
state.

368
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Some people get stressed out, and they hide.

369
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,980
Typically, fat people will have a stash of

370
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,280
candy bars, and they'll gorge themselves with it.

371
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,180
Or something, potato chips, fast food, they'll hide.

372
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
They won't keep it, especially if they live

373
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,380
with other people, they won't keep it where

374
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,200
the food stuff is.

375
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,740
They'll hide it in a shoe drawer, or

376
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,380
a closet, or a garage.

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Get outside and work hard.

378
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,120
For your average of the species for losing

379
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,740
weight...

380
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,800
I don't know, that's a very conditional statement,

381
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,720
conditional question to ask.

382
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,660
I don't think weight is a problem if

383
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,400
the individual is balanced with their weight.

384
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,080
Like, for example, I think women should be

385
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,100
thick, not bony.

386
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,960
You know what I mean?

387
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,260
Let me just...

388
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,000
everybody close their ears.

389
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,760
Thick women, I didn't say fat.

390
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,420
You know, if they're from the Midwest.

391
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,860
Yeah, like in Midwest America, you know, corn

392
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,920
-fed mama, you know.

393
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,620
Corn-fed.

394
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
Yeah, healthy.

395
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,740
Healthy, yes.

396
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:24,860
Healthy.

397
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,460
You know, healthy.

398
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,720
In the ghetto, it's not healthy, it's healthy.

399
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,400
Healthy.

400
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,580
Healthy, yeah.

401
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,420
She's healthy.

402
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,900
Yeah, so you don't want to lose weight

403
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,680
if you're healthy.

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,220
You know?

405
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,840
So anyway, skinny chicks came about with the

406
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,640
modeling when the sodomites, the gays, got into

407
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,400
it, the homosexuals.

408
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,180
It's scary sometimes to look at.

409
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,460
You know, you look like...

410
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Because they hate women.

411
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,780
You just want to give them a sandwich,

412
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,240
you know.

413
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,840
They're that thin, and I'm like, holy...

414
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,960
Yeah, and it came from the Shakespearean days

415
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,620
where the women were not enacting.

416
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,120
They would use paramours, young 13-year-old

417
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,480
boys.

418
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,520
So it's a pretty sick society.

419
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't bother with anything on the internet about

420
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,960
pedophilia or human trafficking and human sacrifice.

421
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,040
That's not going to go away until kingdom

422
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,220
come, because the idiots in this human society

423
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,940
do birthdays and Christmas, and their holidays are

424
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,580
based on human sacrifice and pedophilia and eating

425
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,400
of babies and destroying children.

426
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,280
That's a whole massive culture.

427
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,300
It's just like the Pope, the gay Pope

428
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,460
in Ireland, and the Irish are protesting.

429
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,940
That's like a bunch of pigs getting up

430
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,900
on their hind legs, you know.

431
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,820
It's like, what are you talking about?

432
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,080
You do birthdays and Christmas, and you're protesting

433
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,620
the Pope raping boys?

434
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,320
Yeah.

435
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,440
I mean, come on.

436
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,880
If you're gay, if you're a homosexual like

437
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,380
that, and you're strung up on coke like

438
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,860
that for two days in a row, they're

439
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,940
going to want a young boy based on

440
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,460
their religion, because that is their religion.

441
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,920
And you've got the population protesting that?

442
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,480
Well, they themselves do Christmas.

443
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,880
What is it, Irish?

444
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,339
Who's the greatest Irishman?

445
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,240
You've got to make fun of them a

446
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,579
little bit.

447
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,760
Bobby Sands, who did the hunger strike.

448
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,560
And Jesus Christ himself, greatest Irishman that ever

449
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,960
lived.

450
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,640
Good Irish accent you got there, Lottie.

451
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,060
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,619
So, I mean, talk about a bunch of

453
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,060
idiots.

454
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,260
That species has just got to, oh.

455
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,780
So, you see, before you get into weight

456
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,960
loss, you've got to look at it like

457
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,120
that.

458
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,500
Is this like weight loss because it's for

459
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,320
fashion reasons, or is it for health reasons?

460
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,540
By the way, if you go all veg

461
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,880
and dairy, you're going to lose weight if

462
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,840
it's meant to lose weight.

463
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,560
If you're skinny, and you're unhealthy, and you

464
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,260
go all veg and dairy, you might gain

465
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,580
weight, because that's where you should be.

466
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,120
Right, right.

467
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,700
If you have a tapeworm bigger than the

468
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,580
state of Cincinnati, and you lose it, you're

469
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,240
going to gain weight.

470
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,560
So, weight loss, other than chopping off heads.

471
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,900
Yeah, heads are eight pounds.

472
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,380
Arms are three or four pounds.

473
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Legs are six pounds.

474
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:09,940
I don't know.

475
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,500
What do you mean weight loss?

476
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,900
But, anyway, yeah.

477
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,900
I don't understand what that means.

478
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,160
Most Americans are overweight because they're in starvation

479
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,520
mode.

480
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,540
It's horrible.

481
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,660
Well, what happens is the body, you'll see

482
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,720
this with Native Americans, when they get into

483
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,440
the American food, they get fat, because the

484
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,460
food has no nutrition.

485
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,860
So, the body says, we're working this digestive

486
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,760
system, which takes up most of your energy

487
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,100
when it's working, and there's no nutrition in

488
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,200
it.

489
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,260
So, we go into starvation mode, which is

490
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,220
storing fat.

491
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,100
So, it means Americans are the way they

492
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,860
are because their food has no nutrition.

493
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,720
It's denatured.

494
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,520
That's a very common thing, is if you're

495
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,860
eating a lot, to look bloated.

496
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
And the body produces fat.

497
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,060
The body produces cholesterol, by the way, and

498
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,400
all that.

499
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,440
So, the Americans are lost.

500
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,760
They're lost.

501
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,140
This is Satan's world, and America is Satan's

502
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,920
armpit, if you know what I mean.

503
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,540
I was going to go for the crotch,

504
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,160
but okay.

505
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Yeah, the crotch, too.

506
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
So, either way.

507
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,220
So, I don't know.

508
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,400
It's kind of hard.

509
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,740
Depending if this is, I can address an

510
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,420
audience outside of America, let's say, or the

511
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:25,900
States.

512
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,620
You know, go back to your traditional foods

513
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,600
and traditionally prepared and traditionally stored and grown,

514
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,020
and you'll be fine.

515
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,560
Yeah, the French drink more wine and smoke

516
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,180
cigarettes more than anyone, and they have no

517
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,260
cancer until recently.

518
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,540
Speaking of that, going back to the guy

519
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,840
who cries freedom and Americans, the Psychiatry Society

520
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,080
says 26% of Americans are mentally ill.

521
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,860
Now, you know how they fudge the numbers.

522
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,660
It's got to be double that, right?

523
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,420
Easily.

524
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm surprised they didn't jack it up so

525
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
they could get some extra pharmaceuticals out, you

526
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:02,820
know.

527
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,420
Yeah, in the water, at least.

528
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,260
Yeah, right.

529
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,140
Well, it's already in there.

530
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,700
You got enough chemicals in there to start

531
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,840
your own little pharmacy.

532
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,970
Weight loss could start, well, gaining weight could

533
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,270
be liver problems, right?

534
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,170
Because the cholesterol is produced in the, you

535
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,150
know how many people don't know that cholesterol

536
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,490
is actually produced in the body?

537
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,510
You can't eat cholesterol.

538
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,230
There's no such thing.

539
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,010
Right.

540
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,390
It's like saying brains, you know.

541
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,150
You don't eat brains.

542
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,270
Well, some people do, you know.

543
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,270
But, yeah, it's not something that you eat.

544
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,830
It's something that's in the body already.

545
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,850
Yeah.

546
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,850
And the way the cholesterol drugs, all they

547
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,650
do, it's a dumb drug.

548
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,090
It's a hormone and some kind of other

549
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,290
antihistamine mixed with something else.

550
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,110
I may not be accurate, but it's a

551
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,890
very dumb drug.

552
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,650
It's not highly developed.

553
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,270
And all it does is retard liver function,

554
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,190
which then affects pancreas, kidneys, and all.

555
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,390
So, basically, they're poisoning your liver so you

556
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,610
go, that's all right.

557
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,550
The people that own the countries that you

558
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,050
live in are tired of your asses.

559
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,270
So, too many slaves, too many animals on

560
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,130
the ranch, time to thin it out.

561
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,650
Not because it's naturally not whatever.

562
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
They're just tired of it.

563
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,530
And they don't see, they see the owners,

564
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,950
the oligarchs, they see that the people are

565
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,830
very well entrenched into their system.

566
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,330
So, meaning they have children and they send

567
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,030
them to those schools.

568
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,070
So, the oligarchs know 99.99% of

569
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,530
the idiots having babies are still sending them

570
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,190
to our schools.

571
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,850
So, we know we're just going to have

572
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,390
another generation of scumbags and so on and

573
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,810
so forth.

574
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,830
So, I think it's time to start calling

575
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,550
these idiots out.

576
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,610
And they're behind schedule.

577
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm just saying this because it's true, not

578
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,050
because I, you know.

579
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,090
But the thing is, see, they're shooting fish

580
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,610
in a barrel.

581
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,990
See, at least the oligarchs could have some

582
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,350
fun if you had a civil war or

583
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,450
revolution here or there.

584
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,810
They say, oh, 2% are resisting, let's

585
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,630
just go kill them.

586
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,970
At least we have some fun.

587
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,650
We could do some death pool betting on

588
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,870
them, you know, while we do it.

589
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,370
But they're not even doing that.

590
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,690
I'm not saying you should, you know, because

591
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,830
you're not, they're too irresponsible.

592
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,630
They don't even know.

593
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,530
You know, they want freedom, freedom.

594
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,170
The Americans will say it was the greatest

595
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:34,030
Americans, Ronald Reagan, John Wayne, and Jesus Christ

596
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,750
himself.

597
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,350
These are talking about people that are beyond

598
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,090
stupidity.

599
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,090
I mean, there's no help.

600
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,110
So, at this point, the food is the

601
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,770
biggest thing.

602
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,430
I don't know if you've heard warnings through

603
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,310
many channels through years.

604
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,730
Do not eat pre-prepared foods, you know,

605
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,550
like the frozen foods, pre-prepared meals.

606
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,910
You know, the big name brands, those are,

607
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,950
they have specific things in there to keep

608
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,730
you, you know, so.

609
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,150
Also, when you say weight loss, most people

610
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,070
think, well, the easiest way to lose weight

611
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,290
is to cut off large body parts, right,

612
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:12,930
obviously.

613
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,150
The second easiest way is to stop eating.

614
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,910
You go into fasting mode, semi-starvation mode.

615
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,330
But starvation, when the body indicates a starvation

616
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,570
mode, it's a complex process, and you can,

617
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,930
your body can go either way.

618
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,110
You can actually get damaged, or you don't

619
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,810
recuperate from, like, you know, places that don't

620
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,870
have spring water or good food.

621
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,030
The people have, let's say, a lower IQ,

622
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,170
right?

623
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,930
That's why Americans have such a low IQ,

624
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:41,730
for example.

625
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,550
Like, they never had real milk, real bread,

626
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,530
real good water.

627
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,810
There was a test done in South Korea.

628
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,030
The IQ went down, and the children got

629
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,230
bigger within 10 years by introducing different types

630
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,510
of dairy, synthesized dairy, you know, like powdered

631
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,390
milks and changing the diet.

632
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,710
So, the IQs went down, and the bodies

633
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,190
got bigger.

634
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,270
So, the third way of losing weight is

635
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:13,190
to go veg, and high quality, and seasonal.

636
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,070
So, that's all pretty much.

637
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,090
And when you go veg, you also have

638
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,810
to consider when you have what they call

639
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,030
carbs, grains, rice, cereals, they need to be

640
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,050
as whole as possible, not stripped or processed.

641
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,530
Like, white rice, avoid.

642
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,870
Not prohibit, but avoid.

643
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,270
If you have no choice, have the white

644
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,630
rice.

645
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,370
But if you have a choice, get the

646
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,390
unprocessed rice.

647
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,690
And a cereal.

648
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,150
You know, wild rice is not a rice,

649
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,010
it's a cereal, right?

650
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,250
Oh, we lose you.

651
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,850
I think we lost a Greek.

652
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,050
Oh, you're almost there.

653
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,070
Oh, we lost him.

654
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,010
We'll see if we pick him back up.

655
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,990
There we are.

656
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,430
Call dropped.

657
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,910
Yeah, I've seen that.

658
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,090
Yeah.

659
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,650
You've got a lot of Skype, huh?

660
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,410
That's fine.

661
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,110
It's free and it's deplorable.

662
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,450
Yeah, exactly.

663
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,350
All right.

664
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,170
Not much on weight loss.

665
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,790
Are we on again?

666
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,010
Yes, we're on.

667
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,430
Okay, so not much on weight loss other

668
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,190
than cut your head off, cut your arms

669
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,190
and legs off, or go into fasting mode.

670
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,110
That's the fastest way.

671
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,890
And we said weight loss, so just pure

672
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,430
weight loss.

673
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,350
And then there's obviously changing the way you

674
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,610
eat.

675
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,070
And purpose, examine the reason that you're doing

676
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,450
this.

677
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,230
Some people going to a better diet gain

678
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,850
weight, depending on, you know.

679
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,650
Like, for example, if someone has irritable bowel

680
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,950
syndrome and they're a meat eater, and they

681
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,450
switch to vegetarianism, they gain weight.

682
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,770
I've known a couple of people like that,

683
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,030
and they kind of freak out.

684
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,710
They're like, oh, I'm eating too many starches.

685
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,110
I'm like, no, you're not eating too many

686
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,590
starches.

687
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,110
That's how you really should be.

688
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,350
You're getting back to where you should be,

689
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,630
yeah.

690
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,770
Yeah, you're getting back to where you should

691
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:08,970
be.

692
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,730
So either way, why bother?

693
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,530
I mean, and if you have so much

694
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,790
weight loss, need weight loss that you can't

695
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,670
fit through the door, that's, I think you're

696
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,630
listening to the wrong, need to go to

697
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,010
the regular Western route, get parts cut off,

698
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,250
you know, put a vacuum cleaner with an

699
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,450
eighth-inch or quarter-inch needle under your

700
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,670
body, and they suck it out.

701
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,270
What's that called?

702
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:34,890
Liposuction.

703
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,970
Liposuction, yeah.

704
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,670
Yeah.

705
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,870
Or Jenny Craig, you know, she makes money

706
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,190
too.

707
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,850
Which is food, yeah, yeah.

708
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,110
Yeah.

709
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,050
Which is the prepackaged food that'll kill you,

710
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:46,910
will cause cancer.

711
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,490
Right, right.

712
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,310
Which you're going to, you know, they want

713
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,890
to get rid of most people, so why

714
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,550
not have them go by cancer?

715
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,450
They'll suck.

716
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,170
If you're going to do it right, get

717
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,590
them in the hospital.

718
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,210
They could monetize cancer more than anything else.

719
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,190
Heck yeah.

720
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,050
That's very high monetization for these morons.

721
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,550
So there's a spirit behind all of that.

722
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,150
So nothing else?

723
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,530
Yeah, that looks to be it there, Greek.

724
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,950
Nothing really much else than that.

725
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,270
Yeah, nothing much on the emails, just some

726
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,610
sort of personal stuff.

727
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,870
Other than catching up on the seventh moon,

728
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,870
that was about the highlight there.

729
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,450
Yeah, it's a quick year.

730
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,450
It's a breaking down period now, so it

731
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,290
should be quiet because things are getting more

732
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:35,650
serious.

733
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,230
The building up is interesting too.

734
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,770
Oh, we lose you again?

735
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,210
Uh-oh.

736
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,950
I think we might have lost you, Greek.

737
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,010
Logan?

738
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,810
We keep dropping.

739
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,390
I'll let somebody go plug in.

740
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,890
I think there might be some maintenance work.

741
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,510
Ah.

742
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,030
Yeah, we just dropped you again.

743
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,890
This might want to be one of those

744
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,350
events.

745
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,890
Usually things are kind of...

746
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,410
There we go, we got your back again.

747
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,790
Oop.

748
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,470
And he's gone.

749
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,850
Thank goodness for editing.

750
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,190
Log in.

751
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,590
Okay, it keeps dropping.

752
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,750
We'll try again next week.

753
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,630
We'll see you.

754
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,170
Thanks, Bruce.

755
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,710
Okay, you take care, Greek.

756
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,090
Take care.

757
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,410
Good night now.

758
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,110
Bye-bye.
