1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,520
And greetings folks and greetings Greek and how

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,460
are you doing tonight, sir?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,500
Good, how are you doing?

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,600
Excellent.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:07,940
You ready?

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,660
Yes.

7
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,520
Oh, good.

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,560
I don't know if I've ever really been

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,000
excellent on this planet.

10
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,720
I think the excellence will come later.

11
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,780
It's very difficult to achieve that.

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,260
No one wants that.

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,640
You know how people say, I want you

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,760
to do well, and really what they mean

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
is just don't do better than me, right?

16
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,840
Right, right.

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,420
So when you tell people you're doing excellent,

18
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,840
it's kind of like, oh, why is he

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,100
doing excellent and I'm not?

20
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,120
But, yeah, and they hate, I was having

21
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,300
a long Skype conversation yesterday, and people really

22
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,940
hate knowledge, you know, and if they didn't,

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,880
you wouldn't see people portrayed as nerds in

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,240
Hollywood or people made fun of because they

25
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,140
like to study, right?

26
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:49,840
Right.

27
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,300
And so if people hate knowledge so much,

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,520
what are they teaching in universities?

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:56,840
Nothing.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,160
Yeah.

31
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,820
Just a rite to passage.

32
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,400
So I got an e-mail that basically,

33
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,360
I think it was this morning.

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,240
Oh, and by the way, before we get

35
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,340
to any of this stuff, let me see

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,000
the chat.

37
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,840
There's a question there.

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
I don't know how much I should scroll

39
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,740
back, but okay, we'll look at the chat

40
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,120
in a minute.

41
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,900
But it's the 7th month, and we had

42
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,180
the 10th day recently, according to Reckoning, and

43
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,400
it was a day or two ago, right?

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,220
Right.

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,000
So, yeah, just to mention that.

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,200
I don't know if that means anything to

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,500
anyone out there, the 10th day, the 7th

48
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,680
month.

49
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,480
By the way, that was also the day,

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,820
if you go back to September 11th, 2001,

51
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,620
I think it ended on what they call

52
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,440
Monday noon.

53
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,900
Yeah, that's when they nuked, they did the

54
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,920
450, almost half a megaton of underground nukes

55
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,800
in Manhattan, right?

56
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
So 300.

57
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,520
Yeah.

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,540
Actually, they were pretty big nukes, you know,

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
to do that.

60
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,460
Yeah, something of that size, yes.

61
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,060
Yeah, so that was a couple of days

62
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,220
ago.

63
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,700
So these idiots, they think it's coming up

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,620
in a week or so.

65
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,100
But anyway, yeah, it's the 7th month, and

66
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,500
this is Reckoning also, the year change, I'd

67
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,880
say around 20 years into the 7th millennium,

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,480
roughly.

69
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,820
I could say 21 years into the 21st

70
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,400
year, 20 years for sure, as far as

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,360
one can reckon, into the 7th millennium.

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,940
So 6020 plus, right?

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,920
Roughly is where we're at.

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,520
So, let's see.

75
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,160
I'll go just through some questions.

76
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Greetings, Greek.

77
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,600
Hope all is good with you.

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,440
Thanks for your continued efforts.

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,340
And skip through that.

80
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,860
Let's see.

81
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,300
I've tried.

82
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,740
Okay.

83
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,760
Here are some points that might be worth

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,220
addressing.

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
The Onoff, the mothership left at the time

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,860
of the flood cloud, written in Exodus.

87
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,160
Another thing is the Tower of Babel.

88
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,380
Definition of evil in concordance relates Hebrew word

89
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,660
ra.

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Does this relate to the ra used in

91
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,060
the pantheon of Egyptian deities?

92
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,120
Chronobiology is an area of study.

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,760
How it relates to Sabbath, scriptural Sabbath.

94
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,460
Actual functions, purpose, design of organs, practical ways,

95
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,500
you know, human body organs.

96
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,220
Other practical ways beyond water and eating seasonally

97
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,960
to improve them.

98
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Fixed appointments, current moon cycle.

99
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,260
Explanation, moon, stars, planets actually are.

100
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,680
Things of note occurring where it is quiet.

101
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,120
Thanks again for all you do.

102
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,680
All the best.

103
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Okay.

104
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,860
That's interesting.

105
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,500
I've covered a lot of that.

106
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,300
I think I've covered quite a bit of

107
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,320
that in the past, but I'm not in

108
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,740
a bullet form, you know, going through a

109
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,240
question and an answer is, I think, more

110
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,180
succinct, right?

111
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,800
So, I don't know.

112
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,880
Let's see what's in the.

113
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,900
So, the answer to that email is, yeah,

114
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,300
we could.

115
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,460
That's basically a redo and maybe fill in

116
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,700
a little more detail.

117
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:08,880
All right.

118
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,220
So, if we go back.

119
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,740
Weight loss.

120
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,640
If there's a sonic tomorrow, maybe topic can

121
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,899
be about weight loss.

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,200
I think that was last week.

123
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,180
That was last weekend.

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
What's going on here?

125
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,280
It was quick.

126
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,520
Let's see.

127
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,980
I think I did an answer there regarding

128
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,220
some caribou custodian 33 year old about the

129
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,920
beast in Revelation.

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:37,820
Yeah.

131
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,400
And this is the thing I've been having

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,560
private discussions with.

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
When it hits people that what you read

134
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,740
in scripture is real, you have a different

135
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,380
way of processing the information that you get

136
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,340
than if you think it's just something that

137
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,340
it's religious or mythology, which is what society

138
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,220
puts on people.

139
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,640
And there's a big difference between saying, well,

140
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,540
I know it's real.

141
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,700
And, yeah, we've been misled and we need

142
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,800
to reexamine the scriptures.

143
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,260
There's a big difference in that and really

144
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,200
realizing when it hits you that it's real,

145
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,220
you know, like you ever heard of like

146
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,460
a bunch of people going to do something

147
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,980
dangerous.

148
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
And one looks at the other says, don't

149
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,320
don't be afraid.

150
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
He says, I'm not afraid.

151
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,080
But he really is.

152
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,680
You know, still saying he's just saying I'm

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,980
not afraid, but he's full of fear.

154
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,520
OK, so people are still full of I

155
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,200
don't know if this is real.

156
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I don't know enough about it.

157
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,460
You know, I don't know.

158
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,580
It's religion and mythology.

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,860
So when you put that when you really

160
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,700
it could take a week, a month, a

161
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,880
year or never, or it could take a

162
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,840
long time for some to realize that this

163
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,660
is real stuff.

164
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,060
Right.

165
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,020
You have to realize that you're not going

166
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,160
to find anyone that's going to convince you

167
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,500
of it.

168
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,280
If you have the reality of these things,

169
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,640
unless you internalize that they're real, you know,

170
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,640
and then you have something to work with.

171
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,820
So let's see other questions here.

172
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,260
Why bother one place plan to receive this

173
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,760
information?

174
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,520
OK, electrical tape, LX tape work agreement.

175
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,320
Really convenient for nicks and cuts.

176
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,680
Thanks.

177
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,640
Oh, that's compression.

178
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,780
OK, 618.

179
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Anything that you see in here worth noting?

180
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,120
There's a sonic.

181
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,540
Today's possible topic.

182
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,200
What can be known about the character in

183
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,700
the car?

184
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,400
The atmosphere, the adversary.

185
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,160
Oh, well, look around you.

186
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
Even if you don't know scripture, the more

187
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,760
you study, you know, everything's fake.

188
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,740
But you know, it's it's dazzling.

189
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,520
Right.

190
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,020
Like the medical establishment.

191
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,840
Oh, these guys are so high tech.

192
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,980
Look at their equipment and their hospitals.

193
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,660
It's all bullshit.

194
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,420
It's all fake.

195
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,720
Right.

196
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
The money system.

197
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,900
If the if the U.S. dollar is

198
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,940
worth zero, what's a billion times zero?

199
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,400
Right.

200
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,120
Zero.

201
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,740
And then the other part of that was,

202
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,700
could there be some discussion on that?

203
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,880
Nana or Nahash mentioned in Samuel, who was

204
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,440
the men.

205
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:06,960
Yeah.

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
Bass wanted to covenant with.

207
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,720
Yeah.

208
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,040
That was a northern part of the territory

209
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,380
there.

210
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,180
And they ended up fighting him or avoiding

211
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,480
him.

212
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,360
OK.

213
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,760
Also, tips and who's quieting the mind, thoughts,

214
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,300
et cetera.

215
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,520
Hmm.

216
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,070
All right.

217
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,550
Well, go to the email or the Nakash

218
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,190
is very simple.

219
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,610
The reason I had brought up someone had

220
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,670
mentioned reading.

221
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,210
I think it was Samuel Kings.

222
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,210
And I brought up the name.

223
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,610
The reason is because these names come up

224
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,170
and descriptions and a name is a character.

225
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,390
Also.

226
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:49,690
Right.

227
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,610
Like I once knew a medical person I

228
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,590
visited once a long time ago and his

229
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,230
name was Baker.

230
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,490
I said, well, you might be a doctor

231
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,670
now, but your ancestors were baking bread.

232
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,530
Right.

233
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,290
If you run into someone whose name is

234
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,070
Smith and they're, let's say, you know, working

235
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,750
in an office.

236
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,470
Well, guess what?

237
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,490
Your your ancestors were probably Smithies, which is,

238
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,590
you know, working with metal.

239
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,930
Right.

240
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,670
And figure metal and or machines at the

241
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,050
time.

242
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,630
So the character is in the name as

243
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,890
well.

244
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,510
Nicknames tend to be one's character.

245
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:22,830
Right.

246
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,490
You know, if you call someone hiccups, you

247
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,970
know, as a nickname, here comes hiccups.

248
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,050
Well, guess, you know.

249
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,430
Yeah.

250
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,230
Says a lot.

251
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,809
The nickname says a lot, doesn't it?

252
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,010
Right.

253
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,429
Yeah.

254
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,230
Hmm.

255
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,830
So anyway, what's interesting about that is that,

256
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,409
again, if you is what you're reading in

257
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,330
scripture real or not, and if it's real,

258
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,250
what are you reading?

259
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,790
What can when you read scripture?

260
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,010
You know, here's the thing.

261
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,590
We can go through and answer all these

262
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,830
things point by point, but that doesn't really

263
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,470
help anyone.

264
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,130
How do I know?

265
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,490
Well, I've been doing this kind of stuff

266
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,870
for a decade and a half and I

267
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,090
see the result of it.

268
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,390
Right.

269
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,150
And I'm not surprised.

270
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,870
I just, you know, see the result.

271
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,010
And the result is, do you have the

272
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,210
proper mindset to handle any information?

273
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:08,630
Right.

274
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,590
That's the difference between, like, the grunts and

275
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,810
the special forces in military settings.

276
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,330
The grunts, if it's not part of their

277
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,070
boot camp or their training, when they're confronted

278
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,870
with something, then they have to rely on

279
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,570
common sense that they learned on their own

280
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,950
or they don't know what to do.

281
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,650
They panic.

282
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,970
Right.

283
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,910
Or they're like, you know, we need to

284
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,270
call someone to tell us what to do.

285
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,530
Where the special forces, their mottos are improvise,

286
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,470
adapt, overcome.

287
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,490
So usually when you say improvise or improvisation,

288
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,690
it means to make things up.

289
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,730
But this is not the way I want

290
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,490
to say improvise.

291
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,590
What I mean by improvise is, well, first

292
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,030
of all, it doesn't matter if it's scripture

293
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,090
or what it is.

294
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,710
If it's information, what is it?

295
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,810
You know people say, I'm getting information, I'm

296
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,310
getting knowledge.

297
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,330
Well, really, what is it?

298
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,690
Communication.

299
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,700
Right?

300
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,560
Okay.

301
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,480
If you're going to a library and you're

302
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,940
looking up a subject that you want to

303
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,000
know more about, you are seeking communication on

304
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,020
that subject, are you not?

305
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,480
You are.

306
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's say you want to learn about, let's

307
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,900
say, radio, how to set up radio transmission.

308
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,660
Okay.

309
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,600
And you walk into the library and all

310
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,020
the books are in Russian and you only

311
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,960
speak English or read English.

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,120
Well, you have all the information.

313
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,960
What's wrong with you?

314
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,280
The communication isn't happening.

315
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:34,760
Right?

316
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,480
Because you don't recognize the language.

317
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,880
It's all you're holding in your hand.

318
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:38,880
Yeah.

319
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,800
You know, if you're an American and I

320
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,780
drop you in the library, let's say in

321
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,140
Athens, and you want to look up a

322
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,660
subject, we can't deny the material is not

323
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:48,940
there.

324
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,720
Of course it's there.

325
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,860
You're just not having effective communication.

326
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,820
Right.

327
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,420
Right.

328
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,260
You need a translator.

329
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,660
You need to get into a form that

330
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,280
you can use.

331
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,780
So when you read, for example, scripture, since

332
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,040
a lot of these questions are scriptural, regardless

333
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,320
of what it is, and this will answer

334
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,180
the character of the Nakash and all this

335
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,720
other stuff.

336
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,060
Well, what's being communicated in the five books

337
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,640
of Moses?

338
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,800
Well, Greek, that's pretty obvious.

339
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, we can do an outline of

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,640
what it's about.

341
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,740
You know, people try to wrap their heads

342
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,260
about the information.

343
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,140
You know, well, it says, well, this is

344
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,020
odd in creation.

345
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,520
Look at day one, day two, day three.

346
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,440
If you focus on just that, like a

347
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,880
laundry list or a recipe, you know, a

348
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,820
pound of sugar, a pound of butter, a

349
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,060
pound of flour, if you're looking for that

350
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,900
type of thing, even then, if you've never

351
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,440
baked before, regardless of the recipe, it's going

352
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
to be pretty screwed up the first couple

353
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,540
of times.

354
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,960
You know that, right?

355
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,360
If you've ever done any baking.

356
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Because baking is more, like if I said

357
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
make mashed potatoes, well, you're not really going

358
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,200
to screw it up.

359
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,720
It might be less tasteful.

360
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
It may not be as good as other

361
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
mashed potatoes from someone.

362
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,480
But if you try baking, you're going to

363
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,840
burn it.

364
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,840
It'll be underdone.

365
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,600
It'll be, right?

366
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,280
Right.

367
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,940
So the recipe, again, doesn't really, you need

368
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,520
to develop the skill on what you're looking

369
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,700
at.

370
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,100
So if we look at, for example, the

371
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,260
first five books of Moses, most of these

372
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,200
questions in the chat and the email are

373
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,720
in regard, I would go back to either

374
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,260
the first five books of Moses or what

375
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,860
Zechariah, I keep, I haven't hammered it too

376
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,120
much.

377
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,800
Like I've hammered Assyria a lot.

378
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,080
You know, watch for a new Assyria.

379
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,880
But the book of Zechariah is very important

380
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,980
in understanding Scripture.

381
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
I think I might have mentioned this a

382
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,020
few times.

383
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,380
And he says, if you want to know

384
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,780
what's coming, I'm paraphrasing here in the book

385
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,700
of Zechariah, look at the prophets of old.

386
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,240
That doesn't mean the latter prophets.

387
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,240
That doesn't mean Ezekiel, Isaiah, Habakkuk, and all

388
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
these other guys, right?

389
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Who are the prophets of old?

390
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,520
That would be from Moses and after, right?

391
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,660
It would be Samuel, Joshua, right?

392
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,440
Elijah, right?

393
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,360
Eliyahu, right?

394
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,700
It won't be Isaiah, Jeremiah.

395
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,880
Those guys are later.

396
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,540
Okay.

397
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,680
All right.

398
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,620
So when we go back and look again

399
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,100
at the first five books of Moses, what

400
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,580
are you looking at?

401
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,920
What's being communicated there?

402
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,080
What's the setting?

403
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,940
Very simple.

404
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,320
Well, we know that it's penned by Moses.

405
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,200
Well, when, where, and how, and who?

406
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,520
Well, who is Moses?

407
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,060
When?

408
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,800
Well, it was around, I'd say, 1500 B

409
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,580
.C. around there.

410
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,660
Who was it?

411
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,260
Who were they?

412
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,580
They were basically post-exilic Egyptian slaves or

413
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,740
freshly exiled Egyptian slaves.

414
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,300
Were they not?

415
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,480
Yes.

416
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:45,940
Right?

417
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,780
We're talking, yeah, we're talking 1,000 years

418
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,160
after the flood, roughly.

419
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,400
Mm-hmm.

420
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,800
Mm-hmm.

421
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,760
So right there, there was a lot that

422
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,700
happened before that.

423
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
You know, we had the height of the

424
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,440
Akkadian Babylonian Empire.

425
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,160
We had the flood.

426
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,240
We had the pre-flood civilization, Adamic civilization,

427
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,200
pre-Adamic civilization, before you even get to

428
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Genesis and the first five books of Moses.

429
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,740
So when you actually look at the five

430
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,840
books of Moses, they're pretty down the line.

431
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,740
I mean, not completely down the line, because

432
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,280
they're still a millennia and a half away

433
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,080
from the Christ, you know, first century and

434
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,340
all that.

435
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,460
There was a big influx of interest in

436
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,040
this, again, for 200 B.C. So what's

437
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,140
going on, this is what they call historically

438
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,620
the end of the Bronze Age also, which

439
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,620
there's no such thing, but, you know, when

440
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,700
they say Iron Age, Stone Age, Bronze Age,

441
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,520
what that really means is a bronze-based

442
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,580
society, right?

443
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,540
Right.

444
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,140
So, you know, this is not the Information

445
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,960
Age, because if you go to Chad, right,

446
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,800
or places like Burma, whatever, you wouldn't think

447
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
you're in the Information Age, right?

448
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,880
People walking around with machetes dragging palm trees.

449
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,720
Right.

450
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,860
Essential, still.

451
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,380
So it's an information society or not, mostly

452
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,260
you can say so.

453
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,240
All right, so what's going on when you

454
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,880
read Genesis?

455
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,640
It's a recap, and it holds particular information

456
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,180
regarding how the people that are chosen to

457
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,020
carry this information are going to regard their

458
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,420
deity.

459
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,980
Should I say that again?

460
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,680
No, I think that was pretty clear.

461
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:33,780
Yeah.

462
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,000
The reason why Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers,

463
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,720
is written the way it is, Numbers, Deuteronomy,

464
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,620
is written the way it is, is because

465
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,940
it's to develop a mindset that was dictated

466
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,060
at the time for how the people that

467
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,000
are to hold this information, and also chosen

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
to be their deity, how they're going to

469
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,700
view that deity, which happens to be the

470
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,100
Creator.

471
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
Because I think I've mentioned in a previous

472
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,440
Sonic that the Creator brought himself down to

473
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,400
the level of the sons of gods, or

474
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,880
the patriarch deities that rule over the nations,

475
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,300
to actually take one nation for himself.

476
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:06,680
Right.

477
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
It's kind of like if you see a

478
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,580
family of children, and they're all playing, oh,

479
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,240
what's some game that everybody knows?

480
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,420
I don't think people play family games anymore,

481
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,340
but it was Twister, Risk, Monopoly, right?

482
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh, yeah.

483
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,040
You ever see when a whole family's playing

484
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,300
a game?

485
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,580
Okay.

486
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:23,980
Yeah.

487
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,720
And here comes the dad, and he says,

488
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,040
well, I'm going to play with you guys.

489
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm going to play with you guys, right?

490
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,180
You ever see a parent?

491
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,480
He comes, and he takes up either a

492
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,420
game piece, or he gets into the game

493
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,580
just like one of the children.

494
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:37,760
Right?

495
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Right.

496
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,500
Instead of going up and reading the Wall

497
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,940
Street Journal, or TV, or doing something, or

498
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,580
smoking his pipe, or whatever, he comes down

499
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,500
with the children, and he takes on a

500
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,360
level with them.

501
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,640
This is what's going on.

502
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,980
Very important to consider this, right?

503
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,060
Okay, because when a parent comes down and

504
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,260
plays a game with the children, even though

505
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,400
this is not a game, I'm using that

506
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
as an analogy, he can't use his full

507
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,619
will and exercise all of his power.

508
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,280
He still has to kind of play in

509
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,839
a level that fits in and doesn't overpower

510
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,760
the rest of the people.

511
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,419
Right.

512
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:15,900
Right?

513
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,880
So when you have the Creator grabbing a

514
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,819
nation, later on, of course, because this doesn't

515
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,599
happen until later, right, around this time that

516
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,839
we're discussing the five books of Moses periodically

517
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,600
in history, or the historicity of it, when

518
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,080
he, let's say, grabs these people, and they

519
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,660
decide to also have him as his patriarch

520
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,140
or national deity, he's acting still the way

521
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,860
the other gods that are over other nations

522
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,300
act.

523
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,020
He's not showing his full power.

524
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,880
You know, he's not like playing Twister, you

525
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
know, the game, and he picks up the

526
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,220
child from the scruff of the neck and

527
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,280
throws him across the room.

528
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,540
Right.

529
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,360
He'll just nudge him like everyone else does

530
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,720
in the game, because they're all eight-year

531
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,520
-olds, let's say, right?

532
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,380
So when you're playing a game with a

533
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,480
bunch of six- or eight-year-olds,

534
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,060
you don't use all your full adult power.

535
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,400
You tone it down, and you just kind

536
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
of nudge someone like an eight-year-old

537
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:10,940
would.

538
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,580
So what you're looking there is, how much

539
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,380
information do the gods of the nations provide

540
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,600
for their people, or the people that they

541
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,640
have auspices over?

542
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,120
Very little.

543
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,660
You ever notice that?

544
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,040
What they do is they set up a

545
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,940
temple complex or temple area, usually in a

546
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,260
city that's given geographically, and they make offerings

547
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,480
to their god there, basically.

548
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,600
This is what happens through all, let's say,

549
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,520
quote-unquote, pagan societies.

550
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,600
So that's why you had something similar in

551
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,100
Egypt.

552
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,700
In Egypt, yes, and in Israel, you had

553
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,180
the temple complex and all that.

554
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,180
All right?

555
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,080
I mean, if you look at the temple

556
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,220
complex for Yahweh, that is not much more

557
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,340
elaborate, even though it was considered more elaborate

558
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,780
than the pyramid complex, believe it or not,

559
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,860
because it was a site to behold at

560
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,140
the time.

561
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
People don't understand that today.

562
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,440
But it was not more elaborate than in

563
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,140
most of the other temples you saw.

564
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,520
He could have commanded a temple that was

565
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,060
one square mile at the base and a

566
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,220
thousand stories high, made of stone.

567
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,140
You can do that, reaching beyond the clouds.

568
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,980
But why?

569
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,920
Because he's playing Twister or Monopoly with a

570
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,820
bunch of six-year-olds.

571
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,820
And these six-year-olds are not the

572
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,060
people.

573
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,220
These are the other gods.

574
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,050
Have I ever gone into this analogy of

575
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,690
why things are the way they appear to

576
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:34,890
be?

577
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,270
I think in pieces, right?

578
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,570
In pieces, yes.

579
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,590
Okay, so how many times have you heard

580
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,930
me say, how easy would it be for

581
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,590
the gods and the Creator to pop in

582
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,230
and say, these are my laws, everybody do

583
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,390
it, everybody on your knees.

584
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,670
I'll be back in 50 years.

585
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,450
Yeah, to check on you.

586
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,550
How easy would that be?

587
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,170
Could they do that?

588
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,570
Of course.

589
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,090
Well, they don't do it.

590
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,370
There's a plan, right?

591
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,490
Hands off.

592
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,950
All right, so when you go back and

593
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,150
you look at something, what can be known

594
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,350
about the Nakash, right?

595
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,450
I'm presuming that's the Nakash that's in the

596
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,190
Garden of Eden, he's asking there.

597
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:13,970
Right.

598
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,590
Because when I read stuff like that, usually,

599
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,530
you know how many times I've said that

600
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,950
most people's spiritual father, you know how the

601
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,870
Catholics call the priest father, because you get

602
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,830
your spiritual lawyer from whoever you get your

603
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,330
spiritual law from is your spiritual father, right?

604
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:32,670
Right.

605
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,050
So when I see people asking about the

606
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,050
devil, I'm like, yo, man, you want me

607
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,150
to talk about your pops?

608
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,970
You know?

609
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,010
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,750
Because I'm not saying that this is this

611
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,830
person specifically, his pops, but what I'm saying

612
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,010
is that's the position he's taken, no one

613
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,750
thinks about it.

614
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,370
But if you were to think about the

615
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,630
information that's given, you can also deduce, you

616
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,070
know, there's a saying that says half the

617
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,250
truth is still a lie.

618
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,810
But if what you see is all true

619
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,230
and it's not really fully embellished, you can

620
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,390
still develop the truth because you have enough

621
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,950
of the basic meaning, right?

622
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:09,850
Right.

623
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,410
So what I mean by that is if

624
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,850
you go back to the setting of the

625
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,850
Garden of Eden, did Eve say anything or

626
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,090
was it written, holy shit, man, holy shit,

627
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,370
Adam, man, right, instead of Batman, holy shit,

628
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,610
Adam, man, look, the snake, there's a snake

629
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,990
is talking to me, wow, that's freaky.

630
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,650
Did you get any of that?

631
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,910
Well, you know what's really weird about that

632
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,930
is you have that one particular species advancing

633
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,590
quicker than the others, taking on a dialect.

634
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,930
But it's not a snake.

635
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,090
Correct.

636
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,530
If you look at, just like I had

637
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,010
a discussion recently with someone that Nephilim doesn't

638
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,510
mean the fallen ones, it doesn't.

639
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,210
Nakash is a term that's defined as also

640
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,910
meaning shiny, bright, it also means divination or

641
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,030
Prudent?

642
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,770
Well, yeah, sharpish, like the British might say.

643
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,990
It means serpentine-like.

644
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,550
You know how someone says business don't lick?

645
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,950
Yeah, you know how in the business people

646
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,470
say don't do business with him because he's

647
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,330
a real snake?

648
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,750
Right, right.

649
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,690
What does that mean?

650
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,390
I mean, you know, well, they're into detail,

651
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,530
they look for weaknesses.

652
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,570
Loopholes.

653
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,690
Flattery, whatever.

654
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,910
Strong in character but not high esteem, morally.

655
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,610
Okay, but if you go back and look

656
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,090
at what's going on with Eve, I mean,

657
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,430
obviously she probably saw creatures or beings, this

658
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,070
is a celestial cosmic being, anthropomorphic.

659
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,230
If you look at other writings within the

660
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,510
time, there's allusions to these serpentine beings that

661
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,770
are still anthropomorphic and the serpentine is in

662
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,690
character, right?

663
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,470
But then again, are you reading Genesis and

664
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,770
is it real or are you so full

665
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,230
of iconography and imagery from society of Adam

666
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,570
and Eve, these two naked people with a

667
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,230
fig leaf and you see a snake and

668
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,590
an apple, right?

669
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,930
I mean, that's just as far as removed

670
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,790
from the text as you see this guy

671
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,010
nailed to a Roman cross wearing a diaper

672
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,210
with long hair with a crown of thorns.

673
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,990
That is as far removed as that, right?

674
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,150
Or anything, or the flood where the seas

675
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,250
will be in the middle of the waters

676
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,390
lift up and I mean, that is, right,

677
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,090
okay, so forget all that stuff.

678
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,190
And the thing is people say, yeah, I

679
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,390
know, but do you really?

680
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,930
The answer that I say is no, people

681
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,310
don't.

682
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,570
People still think this is something, some kind

683
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,690
of a mystery, which it is.

684
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,290
It's a secret, by the way.

685
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,390
I've argued back and forth with people.

686
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,590
There's no such thing as a mystery in

687
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,810
Scripture.

688
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,490
It's a secret.

689
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,310
We have used the word mystery to mean

690
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,090
unknowable or unknown until it is.

691
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,350
These are secrets.

692
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,070
That's why, for example, when you read about

693
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,650
the end times, there's something called a mystery

694
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,050
of Babylon the Great, secret Babylon the Great.

695
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,050
In other words, there are secrets held within

696
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,870
the Babylonian community, you know, archivally, that are

697
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,690
being used against men and they don't know

698
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:15,870
it.

699
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,310
Like, for example, in modern times you could

700
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,290
look at chemtrails.

701
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,930
Well, we know it's happening.

702
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,110
Those are not natural contrails, but it's a

703
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,350
secret.

704
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,470
We don't see any information on who's sponsoring

705
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,710
it, who's flying it, exactly what's in there.

706
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,890
It's not advertised.

707
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,290
But I assure you somewhere, in secret, there

708
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,030
is an entire logistical plan, an entire financial

709
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,650
plan, an entire, you know, you could see

710
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,430
what's been stitched together from logistics, design, all

711
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,530
the way to practical, all the scheduling, finances,

712
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,490
and chemical, and a list of whoever's involved

713
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,230
somewhere, that exists.

714
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,530
But we don't have access to it.

715
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,970
All we see is planes making lines in

716
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,590
the sky that we know are not clouds,

717
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,410
for sure, natural, or water.

718
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,590
But that just doesn't happen randomly.

719
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,390
There is a plan, and with a lot

720
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,750
of detailed information, somewhere.

721
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,470
So when you read about Mystery Babylon, that's

722
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,870
what it's really talking about.

723
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,790
There are secrets, Babylonian secrets are held, which

724
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,350
ties back into the Tower of Babel.

725
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,190
But if we go back to the Nakash,

726
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,910
who he is, you know, there was no

727
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,150
problem with Eve and this being, right, at

728
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,390
all.

729
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,050
In other words, this was a common thing.

730
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,090
This was common to see, that type of

731
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,470
being.

732
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,150
It was actually so common, that the conversation

733
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,090
was struck up without much introduction needed.

734
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,450
Right.

735
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,210
You notice that?

736
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,290
So that means this was a common being.

737
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,990
It's kind of like, you know, if you've

738
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,350
ever been in a big city, you see

739
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,630
the people emptying the garbage cans of maintenance

740
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,510
people, or whatever.

741
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,290
Sure.

742
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,450
And, you know, it's easy to say, hey,

743
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,650
good morning, and you have a short conversation

744
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,130
with one.

745
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,890
You know, it's not like some alien came,

746
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,850
you know, if you see a guy in

747
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,150
a reflective fire suit, you don't, it's really

748
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,250
odd, you know, you're like wondering something odd

749
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,490
here.

750
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,590
These were very common beings.

751
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,450
Now, how do I know that?

752
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,790
And how do I know that for sure?

753
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,230
Well, because this detail is begged.

754
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,630
In other words, when you read about the

755
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,270
interaction between the serpent, Nakash, this being, divine

756
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,050
being, with Eve, the interaction between Eve and

757
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,170
this being is as common, and as relaxed,

758
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,490
and as ordinary as ordinary can be.

759
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,630
Right.

760
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,270
Right?

761
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,610
And that's how I know why I'm saying

762
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,930
what we're saying.

763
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,270
And also, later on, I mean, if you

764
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,090
even read in what's called the New Testament,

765
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,290
the Christ actually encounters this being again, before

766
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,210
the being takes him up to the mountain,

767
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,650
right, to make all these offers.

768
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,430
He encounters him almost in an anthropomorphic form,

769
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,270
like he's walking with him, like he's encountered

770
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,190
with the Nakash.

771
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,210
Like he's walking in the valley, and this

772
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,030
being comes up to him, you know, anthropomorphic,

773
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,550
and says, hey, you, I want to talk

774
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:11,830
to you.

775
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,350
Okay.

776
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,250
No big deal.

777
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,090
Right?

778
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,690
So the character there, well, the character is

779
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,750
very interesting, because it is a level, it's

780
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,710
not a very low-level character, it's actually

781
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,750
a pretty high-level character, which dictates a

782
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:33,050
lot of, dictates some level of authority or

783
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,050
credence to the other divine characters.

784
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,610
And he's against mankind, basically.

785
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,850
There is a war in heaven, there are

786
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,290
serious problems there, just like there are anywhere

787
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,230
you can encounter, you know, from getting the

788
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,190
more information you gather about whether it's a

789
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,610
heavenly society or earthly society, there's always conflict,

790
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,070
let's say.

791
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,210
But he's not a low-level being.

792
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,530
And he's slick enough to have an entourage,

793
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,010
right, or millions or billions of other beings

794
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,350
go along with this plan.

795
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,790
Which, when you study Scripture close enough, you

796
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,570
actually see it's not just this character, the

797
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,610
sons of gods are also against man.

798
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,870
For example, if you look at this justice

799
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,570
goddess religion, that is not a positive thing,

800
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,970
because, you know, people fear that.

801
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,290
You know, if you look at all of

802
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,070
the gods, they think very little of man.

803
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,170
They don't mind deceiving them, right?

804
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,590
All of the nations like that, in that

805
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,030
condition.

806
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,150
They were supposed to lead mankind into the

807
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,370
consistency of the right thing to do from

808
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:38,850
the Creator.

809
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,110
So, that's why the Psalm says they will

810
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,890
be killed like men, which is very humiliating,

811
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,050
because now they rule over men spiritually.

812
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,930
So, again, the character of the Nakash, I

813
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,170
mean, what character would you assign to someone

814
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,090
who's out to get you that is not

815
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,730
just a complete, you know, vagrant.

816
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,610
He actually has some notoriety within his society

817
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,950
and all that, and he's out to get

818
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,190
you.

819
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,870
Like an attorney is out to get you,

820
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,090
right?

821
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,030
They try to use everything they can, right?

822
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,000
So, I don't know, the character.

823
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,640
If you want to understand scripture, you've got

824
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,600
to understand what's going on around you, because

825
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,360
ultimately, if you don't understand what's going on

826
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,060
around you, you're going to have to put

827
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,640
up a separation wall and say, oh yeah,

828
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,740
this is our everyday life on planet Earth,

829
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,820
and now I'm going to study scripture.

830
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,520
You know, let's get behind, you know, this

831
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,680
is something totally different.

832
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,480
No, it's not.

833
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,020
It's a continuation of all these things.

834
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,600
And anything is.

835
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,820
You know, again, going back to the e

836
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,660
-mail, some questions about the Yanov and the

837
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,280
cloud, and, you know, that's like the presence

838
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,200
of the mothership, let's say.

839
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,500
Well, how many times do you read about,

840
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,120
in scripture, the gods presenting themselves on Earth

841
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,860
as they are?

842
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,200
Is that a good time?

843
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,620
Do they break out the Budweisers and the

844
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,000
Coronas and the Pinatas, and they have, what

845
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,780
do they call when the, what's the white

846
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,080
trash thing they do when they have the

847
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,700
football game, the tailgate party?

848
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,420
Is that what they do, the tailgate?

849
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,820
We have a tailgate because the gods are

850
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:08,920
here.

851
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,720
Or is everybody running from fear, you see?

852
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,240
So let's say the gods were around for

853
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,360
a couple of thousand years, almost a thousand

854
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,520
years for sure, hanging around.

855
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,260
Is that a good time to be on

856
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,540
Earth?

857
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,420
No.

858
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,780
It's pretty shitty.

859
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,460
That was a really, really tough time for

860
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,080
people on Earth.

861
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
Hey, by the way, even it's written in

862
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,200
Noah.

863
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,840
This guy's going to give us some relief.

864
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,720
Because finally, what's going to happen is going

865
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,340
to be so much interaction between mankind and

866
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,900
these lower entities, and of course man is

867
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,580
going to be enticed into learning more of

868
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,380
this technology and doing more with it, that

869
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,220
it's really difficult to live here on Earth.

870
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,420
And we heard that the Creator is going

871
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,900
to drop a flood to end this bullshit.

872
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,440
And when he drops the flood, he's going

873
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,060
to pull away.

874
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,300
So we're going to have two good things

875
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,720
happening.

876
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,660
First thing, he's going to make a flood

877
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,860
to get rid of all these scumbags, billions

878
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,380
of them.

879
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,960
And then they're also going to pull out.

880
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,460
That's a good thing at that time.

881
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,900
For the gods to pull out their presence,

882
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,720
their overt presence, because it's a hassle having

883
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,240
them around.

884
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,980
Because it's potentially extremely dangerous to be around.

885
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,060
Imagine driving down a road and having 300

886
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,040
kilovolt power lines all over the road.

887
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,660
You know what I mean?

888
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,120
Very dangerous.

889
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,380
So how many times have I said, basically

890
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,580
right now, people don't know this, but you're

891
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,800
in a veritable Garden of Eden right now,

892
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,180
regardless of what you hear publicized about environmental

893
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,480
problems and all that.

894
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,400
Well, first of all, it's almost like a

895
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,240
Garden of Eden, because the weather is relatively

896
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,760
stable.

897
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,920
You don't have disasters, you don't have earthquakes

898
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,540
that open the ground, and fire comes out

899
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,600
and burns black smoke for 40 years at

900
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,900
a time, swallows up half a million people.

901
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,860
You don't have any of that.

902
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,440
You don't have the gods coming through, you

903
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,560
know, tearing shit up for a long time.

904
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,040
So it's very, very, very peaceful.

905
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,820
Again, the adversaries, they want to fool you.

906
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh yeah, war and starvation.

907
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,660
It's all just another cover, because there's no

908
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,280
reason for it.

909
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,620
It's just your ignorance.

910
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,880
You know, I was having a conversation recently.

911
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,140
When you read in any society, in any

912
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,640
time in human history, well, especially the past

913
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,380
100 years, I should say, not any time

914
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,820
in human history, the past 100 years, the

915
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,020
modern system, the success of the economic system,

916
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,480
the success of the medical system, the success

917
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,720
of the education system, the only reason these

918
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,340
systems can tout a success is because you're

919
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,440
failing in understanding what they're doing.

920
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,780
In other words, the current medical system is

921
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,820
a complete farce.

922
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,360
And the only way it could be considered

923
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,980
a successful medical system is because you have

924
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,360
failed in understanding anything about medicine and how

925
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,620
the human body really works.

926
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,160
That's why they're successful, because you're a failure

927
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
in that subject.

928
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,680
The economic system, what?

929
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,340
It's all fiat.

930
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,900
There is no money.

931
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,820
And the only way it could be successful

932
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,420
is if you don't know that it's credit

933
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,840
and you don't know how it works, you

934
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,080
see.

935
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,000
The only way the education system is successful

936
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,260
is if you failed in understanding what it's

937
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,020
really about.

938
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,080
The only way a religion is successful is

939
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,000
if you fail to understand what it's supposed

940
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
to be based on.

941
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,460
So, whenever you hear of a success, it's

942
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,400
really based on the failure of the masses

943
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,140
in that topical nature of that matter, across

944
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,560
the board.

945
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah.

946
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,960
So, whenever you hear about these successes, they

947
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,140
actually represent the failure of the masses to

948
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,540
comprehend.

949
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,520
Basically, this is where I used to hammer

950
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,940
a lot.

951
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,420
Pranking.

952
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,520
You ever hear about the attorneys and the

953
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,000
doctors, the government and the bankers, they're all

954
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,640
pranking you.

955
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,800
They have nothing to do.

956
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,440
It's just a prank.

957
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,780
When they go to school, their job training

958
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,060
is how to prank you.

959
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,580
Kevlar underwear.

960
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,040
That's right.

961
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,699
You know, if a headhunter opens a bag

962
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,219
and shows you five heads and you say,

963
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,580
does it upset you that you have that?

964
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,480
He says, yeah, it does.

965
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,940
My brother's got ten.

966
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
So, they're immoral.

967
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,380
And the biggest problem, really, for those that

968
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,520
are running these sovereign states is they look

969
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,280
at everyone and they classify them as scumbags

970
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,739
or morons and they're like, oh, shit.

971
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,780
Guess what?

972
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,380
Well, they're having babies.

973
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,060
What does that mean?

974
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,960
More scumbags and morons when they grow up.

975
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,920
There's no change that's going to happen.

976
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,380
Because the people are scumbags and morons because

977
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,179
of the system they went through and they

978
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,000
have children and they tell the children to

979
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,360
have allegiance to that system.

980
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Where it's all voluntary, believe it or not,

981
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,560
to a certain degree.

982
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,760
So, that's why when you hear about human

983
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,580
depopulation, it has nothing to do with too

984
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,880
many people being upon the earth.

985
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,380
You could have a trillion people on the

986
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,900
earth, no problem.

987
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,060
Not the current system that you have now,

988
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,720
the way you manage water, food and all

989
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,000
that.

990
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,380
But when they talk about overpopulation, it's like

991
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,780
they're just getting tired of the same breeding

992
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,240
program.

993
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,020
But they're not going to change the breeding

994
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,040
program, I mean the education, the medical and

995
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,600
all that other stuff, the economic system and

996
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,740
all that, because why?

997
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,600
You're quite happy with it.

998
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
Peaceful culling, I believe they'd call it.

999
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
Just bear that in mind.

1000
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,720
So, it's basically the children.

1001
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,800
And they always use the children anyway.

1002
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,180
Do it for the children, right?

1003
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,040
It's just like if you have a fair

1004
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,560
assessment of this society, and you're like, oh,

1005
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,220
it's pretty shitty and the people are pretty

1006
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,580
shitty.

1007
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,700
And you're like, but you know what's even

1008
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:48,960
worse?

1009
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,940
They're having babies.

1010
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,920
Oh, shit.

1011
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,600
I mean, you get more of them.

1012
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,200
The same ones coming around again and again

1013
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,620
and again.

1014
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,960
How does it end?

1015
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,280
Well, it will end.

1016
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,760
You see?

1017
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
So, anyway.

1018
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,700
It's not that having babies is bad.

1019
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,520
You're told, the early man was told to

1020
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,980
do that.

1021
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,320
It's that they're so stupid to see what's

1022
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,980
going on.

1023
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,700
But anyway.

1024
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,460
And they have a new creature, a new

1025
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,940
being, and they put him exactly in the

1026
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
same spot that they were.

1027
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,620
And this is irrelevant of what Jack Fresco

1028
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,080
says, you're a product of your environment and

1029
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,380
all that.

1030
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,940
No, no, no.

1031
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,420
This goes beyond that.

1032
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,300
Because the environment, it's too rigid to change,

1033
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,800
to improve at this point.

1034
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,560
And it's not because of the leadership, it's

1035
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,840
because of the people themselves.

1036
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,020
Okay, so.

1037
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,660
If we go back, let's just do a

1038
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,100
recap.

1039
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,180
Everything in scripture is pretty much from 1500

1040
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,360
B.C. and on.

1041
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,980
Except for maybe the book of Job, and

1042
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,080
some other writings, perhaps, that are alluded to.

1043
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,080
So, you're looking at what they call Bronze

1044
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,920
Age, Post-Bronze Age writings.

1045
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,660
Even though something in the scripture might refer

1046
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,360
to a couple of thousand, or three or

1047
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,080
four thousand years prior to it, the setting

1048
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
of what you're reading is that time period.

1049
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,140
Now, what is the setting?

1050
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,740
Again, post-exilic slaves, people are pretty much

1051
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,120
on the run, and then eventually they're not

1052
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,300
on the run when they go to settle

1053
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,540
some land, when they evict a whole bunch

1054
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,380
of serious scumbags, and giants, and other hybrids,

1055
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,600
and things like that.

1056
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,340
So, the time period is quite important to

1057
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,280
consider the information in.

1058
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,400
So, you have to have a very heightened

1059
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,280
sense of alertness when you're reading the five

1060
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
books of Moses, and the alertness should always

1061
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,060
subject your mind to the setting.

1062
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,960
These are people that were, quote-unquote, exiled

1063
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,300
out of Egypt, or left Egypt, of a

1064
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,800
slave background, and here they're being set up

1065
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,920
by the Creator acting as one of the

1066
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,380
gods of all the other nations.

1067
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,380
Very simple.

1068
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,810
Everything else falls in place, unless you want

1069
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,250
to start looking at the ultra-subtle aspects

1070
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,870
of what it means when the gods overtly

1071
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,950
present themselves in their true form.

1072
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,050
Have you ever looked at, for example, sci

1073
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,190
-fi, when they talk about matter, anti-matter,

1074
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,690
when it comes together, bad things happen, right?

1075
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,950
Yeah, similar to that.

1076
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,210
So, consider it essential to have a peaceful

1077
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,710
environment as men are, and as gods are.

1078
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,510
You can't have both in the material world

1079
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,170
at the same time, overtly.

1080
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,370
The gods have to take a position where

1081
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,310
they are covert.

1082
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,870
In other words, they stay unseen.

1083
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,730
Then you can have peace.

1084
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,070
And that's very simple.

1085
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,610
That explains a lot of the settings and

1086
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,830
situations that you see.

1087
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,290
So, you piece it together, and see how

1088
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,230
it works for you in your travels.

1089
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:17,570
Because ultimately, everyone that's going to be studying

1090
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,230
this, or listening to what I'm saying, still

1091
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,170
has what they consider, what they grasp personally,

1092
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,810
on the subject matter.

1093
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,870
What I have said, and what I still

1094
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,350
say, there hasn't been a counsel of any

1095
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,730
kind, a viable one, a truthful one, or

1096
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,370
an accurate one, one that's based on precision,

1097
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,650
to grab the scriptures, and summarize them in

1098
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,410
whole, what they're about, and present that as

1099
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,270
a communication to people, so they don't have

1100
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,750
to wonder about all the details.

1101
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,670
No one's ever done that, by the way.

1102
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm the only one that's ever done the

1103
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,010
simplicity of it.

1104
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,670
There's Christian writers, there's Jewish writers.

1105
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,650
The Jewish writer says, I'm going to drop

1106
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,190
some Talmud on your ass, alright?

1107
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,290
Or the Christian writers, oh yeah, we're Christians

1108
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,770
now, yeah, sure we are.

1109
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,550
You've got all this crap.

1110
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,430
Or you'll have these narrow subject matter lines.

1111
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,410
I was speaking to someone recently, and I

1112
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,670
listened to a podcast, I think it was

1113
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,110
Heiser, or someone like that, and this asshole,

1114
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,730
I had sent him a correspondence a long

1115
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,610
time ago, he's supposedly an expert in the

1116
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,110
New York Times, yeah, that too, probably, Old

1117
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,430
Testament, and I said, well, you consider yourself

1118
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,630
to be a Christian, but there's no crucifixion,

1119
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:33,830
right?

1120
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,190
That's all a fraud, and he sent me

1121
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,230
a message back a while back, and said,

1122
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,350
oh, that's patently ridiculous.

1123
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,450
He won't look at it.

1124
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1125
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,370
And then you've got the other Christian people,

1126
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,450
oh yeah, the U.S. Constitution, what a

1127
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,770
great system, what an asshole.

1128
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,450
If you read the Constitution, it tells you

1129
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,750
that slavery has to be no involuntary slavery.

1130
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,690
That means it has to be voluntary.

1131
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,790
Well, I could trick you into volunteering, right?

1132
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,870
And the other thing it says, there's no

1133
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,650
slavery unless you're convicted.

1134
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,050
Well, it doesn't say rightfully convicted, so you

1135
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,670
could falsely convict someone, and now they're a

1136
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,250
slave, you see?

1137
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,290
The Constitution is a pretty shitty document.

1138
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,490
And it also establishes justice, which is really

1139
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,130
fucked up.

1140
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,610
Yeah, yeah.

1141
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,990
It says it in the first 17 words,

1142
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,470
to establish justice, right there.

1143
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,170
You know, I was at a Constitutional convention

1144
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,590
a while back, and I stood up and

1145
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,910
I was speaking, and I said, the Constitution,

1146
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,390
these are all Constitutionalists, right?

1147
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,570
Old farts, these old patriots, diseased, of course,

1148
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,870
because patriotism is a disease.

1149
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,650
And I said, well, the Constitution is pretty

1150
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,050
screwed up, and I would wipe my ass

1151
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,650
with it, and they all wanted to really

1152
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,370
get upset.

1153
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,390
You know, they were like, oh, what did

1154
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,950
he just say?

1155
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,770
And I said, no, no, no, no, no.

1156
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,050
And they were like, okay.

1157
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,790
And I said, no, no, what I meant

1158
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,450
was, you need to crumble it up first

1159
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,070
a few times, and then wipe your ass

1160
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,490
with it to make it softer, because that

1161
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,390
parchment is really hard.

1162
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,850
And then I ran out of there, you

1163
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,010
know?

1164
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,070
Oh, good one.

1165
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,530
Yeah, anyway, that's what they get.

1166
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,390
So they don't want the truth.

1167
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,070
So no one comes out, you know, real

1168
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,850
harsh stuff like that, because I don't know

1169
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,870
what they're trying to do, get people to

1170
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,290
like them.

1171
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,950
I don't want people to like me, basically,

1172
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,330
because I've seen what comes along with that,

1173
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,110
and it's not pleasant.

1174
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,790
In the state that they're in, in the

1175
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,050
state that humans are in right now.

1176
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,950
It doesn't mean I don't want to interact

1177
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,670
with people for gainful experiences.

1178
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,610
You know, if I need spark plugs and

1179
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,090
you've got spark plugs, let's make a fair

1180
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,590
exchange.

1181
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,830
If I would like some food and you

1182
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,150
have food, let's make a fair exchange.

1183
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,350
Other than that, I don't want to know

1184
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,430
anything about you.

1185
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,410
You know what I mean?

1186
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,170
Unless it's something worthwhile.

1187
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,610
Because you're a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant.

1188
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,590
Unless you're actually on a path of better

1189
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,170
things, and if you are, then keep to

1190
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:53,790
yourself again.

1191
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,650
So it's a very difficult situation.

1192
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,790
So that's why in places in scripture, it's

1193
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,610
like, yeah, if you're born here, you're basically

1194
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:02,970
screwed.

1195
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:04,310
Right?

1196
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,430
So what do you do in a screwed

1197
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,110
up situation?

1198
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,190
Now here's the other thing.

1199
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,350
There's a very subtle thing that's brought up

1200
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,970
always, and it's about gaining knowledge and truth.

1201
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,210
It is best...

1202
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,450
Well, okay, let me just put it this

1203
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:22,570
way.

1204
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,770
There's something subtle and also prominent about gaining

1205
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,650
knowledge and truth.

1206
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,570
Now, ultimately, if you gain knowledge and truth,

1207
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,610
you don't want to be here.

1208
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,450
I mean, it's best to make your life

1209
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,610
short, get it over with, and you know

1210
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,170
what's coming.

1211
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,690
That's where you should focus on.

1212
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,930
But on the other hand, if you don't

1213
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,590
have knowledge and truth, you're going to fall

1214
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,990
into all the worries and concerns around you,

1215
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,910
which are farces and fraudulent, and you're going

1216
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,410
to be pulled back and forth like a

1217
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,330
rowboat that's loosely tied, and you're going to

1218
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:54,970
be inefficient.

1219
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,670
I mean, how many times have you heard

1220
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,970
people getting ulcers because of financial worries?

1221
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,470
It's like, what?

1222
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,070
There is no money.

1223
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,030
What do you mean you got an ulcer

1224
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,950
because of financial worries?

1225
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,130
That's ridiculous.

1226
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,710
But is it better to have an ulcer

1227
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,050
because of financial worries, or is it better

1228
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,510
to really know that there is no money

1229
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,270
and people are killing each other for something

1230
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,970
that doesn't exist lawfully?

1231
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,130
Which one is worse?

1232
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,010
They're both pretty shitty.

1233
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,710
But for me, I would rather know.

1234
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,930
Because then it is crap.

1235
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,470
It's like the headhunters.

1236
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,150
If the headhunter is having a national holiday,

1237
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,730
like the Americans had one recently, I don't

1238
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,390
care how happy they are.

1239
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,670
They're headhunters.

1240
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,630
But at the same time, if I didn't

1241
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,190
know, I would say, man, this is such

1242
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,050
a fucked up society.

1243
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,210
How can we still have a holiday?

1244
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,150
I don't know.

1245
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,310
I guess I'll just do it.

1246
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,890
Some people would rather be that way.

1247
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,330
People have outwardly admitted, I don't want to

1248
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:48,750
know Greek.

1249
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,110
I'm not saying what you're saying is not

1250
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,230
true.

1251
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,910
I just don't want to know.

1252
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,130
I want to be happy in my little

1253
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,450
bubble.

1254
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,470
I remember you saying that.

1255
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,750
I've had more than a dozen people say

1256
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,750
that in the past few years.

1257
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,690
I said, that's fine.

1258
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,390
That's respectful.

1259
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,650
That's a certain level of honesty within that

1260
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,070
person's comfort that they like to maintain.

1261
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,990
Because if I said, Bruce, there's a button

1262
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:11,370
on the wall.

1263
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,550
Press this, you'll be uncomfortable.

1264
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,690
Press this, you'll be comfortable.

1265
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,550
Why?

1266
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,810
You'll be comfortable, of course.

1267
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:17,910
You have to tell me why.

1268
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,730
It's not that simple.

1269
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,790
Just to preface a lot of the information,

1270
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,210
before you even tried to have a conversation,

1271
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,570
is futile.

1272
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,610
They're unworkable at this.

1273
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,830
Humans have been unworkable for thousands of years.

1274
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,430
It's much better and easier to just gather

1275
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,450
them under a real simple premise and then

1276
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,230
control them.

1277
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,470
If it's time to have them just kill

1278
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,710
each other, push a button, get them instigated

1279
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,490
to start killing each other.

1280
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,530
If it's time for them to live in

1281
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,130
peace, have them live in peace.

1282
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,650
Because it just doesn't work any other way

1283
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,570
in the way that it's set up.

1284
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,450
Because everything is a farce.

1285
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,810
And essentially, the gods that had taken dominion

1286
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,190
over the regional areas, over each nation, they

1287
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,530
were out for malevolent stuff and deceit and

1288
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,690
farce from the beginning.

1289
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,770
So any form of cultural or tradition, no

1290
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,670
matter how old or how new, that people

1291
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,810
hold on to is based on that system

1292
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,150
of their patron or matriarch deity.

1293
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,570
So it's a pretty shitty system.

1294
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,850
So how do you maintain yourself?

1295
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,390
Your life is with good food, good clothing,

1296
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,990
good shelter, good conversation.

1297
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,770
Have at least one or two people around

1298
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,430
you that love you.

1299
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,650
You know, do the right thing.

1300
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,030
And you can trust.

1301
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,270
If you can achieve those things, you've got

1302
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,970
more than anyone has ever gotten here.

1303
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,710
And then you just pass through.

1304
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,730
And then later it will come to understanding.

1305
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,230
There's a level of ambassadorship that people would

1306
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:57,670
consider.

1307
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,050
Yeah, in scripture, tell people the truth about

1308
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,430
reality and all that.

1309
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,830
But how do you couch it?

1310
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,310
I mean, what level do you want to

1311
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,150
tell them about?

1312
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,730
If you're asked, you should.

1313
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,010
Yeah, answer the question.

1314
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,150
It should be done.

1315
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,910
So this is pretty much the mindset.

1316
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,210
If you have a pretty good understanding of

1317
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,250
the current society that you're in, when I

1318
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,650
say current, you have to look at it

1319
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,710
in hundred year chunks.

1320
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,390
You have to go back a hundred years

1321
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,330
also.

1322
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,890
Pretty good handle on medical system, economic system,

1323
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,710
agricultural system, governmental system, religious systems.

1324
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,430
All the various systems that you interact with

1325
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,470
or know about.

1326
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,630
If you have a pretty good handle about

1327
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,870
what's really going on, and if someone asks

1328
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,450
you what's going on, you still have to

1329
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,270
at some point give the option or throw

1330
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,250
in the detail, it's around this time.

1331
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,790
Because there was no blood pressure 200 years

1332
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:59,090
ago.

1333
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,590
Tests in medicine.

1334
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,150
But you think of some of the ways

1335
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,410
things repeat, how different societies repeat over time.

1336
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,650
You got the rise of the guns and

1337
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,250
stuff and all that, and I was just

1338
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,250
kind of noticing how much this society reflects

1339
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,570
the old Western days in a lot of

1340
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:19,710
ways.

1341
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,370
Not really.

1342
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,670
Because in the Western days, if you had

1343
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,370
a beef with someone, you'd go out and

1344
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,210
you can duke it out, duel it out

1345
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,390
to the death, and all the authorities wouldn't

1346
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,270
get involved.

1347
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,670
Because you were free.

1348
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,350
This is before the sovereign state.

1349
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,190
The sovereign state came in 1871, by early

1350
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,030
20th century it was in, everyone's enslaved now.

1351
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,230
You can't do what you want.

1352
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,690
Like if you get into a car accident,

1353
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,470
a bonafide car accident, not on purpose, and

1354
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,310
the people in the car are hurt, the

1355
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,910
state sues you for damaging state property.

1356
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,090
And you think it's the barrier you crashed

1357
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:57,490
into.

1358
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,150
It's not, it's the people in the car.

1359
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,610
And they're serious about that.

1360
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,730
You're pretty much finished.

1361
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,550
You're worse than the Egyptian slaves right now.

1362
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,310
Do nothing.

1363
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,930
Like last week I mentioned, an attempted civil

1364
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,450
war revolution by these patriotic idiots would be

1365
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,230
fun to watch.

1366
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:19,830
You should film it.

1367
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,470
It would be a Turkish shoot.

1368
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,230
I'm sure the oligarchs that own the United

1369
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,210
States of America would say, oh yeah, let

1370
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:28,670
them go.

1371
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,630
Get the FBI in there to help them

1372
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,410
get some guns.

1373
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,910
And they won't just go in and wipe

1374
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:33,290
them out.

1375
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,770
Make sure you get it on film.

1376
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,770
A human snuff film.

1377
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,110
There's going to be no civil war revolution

1378
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,950
or anything like that.

1379
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,270
So you're too stupid.

1380
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,950
You're better off with what you've got right

1381
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,870
now because at least right now you can

1382
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,470
maintain a certain amount of peace.

1383
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,730
But I've never met a quote unquote patriot

1384
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,330
or whatever that I would substitute even the

1385
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,230
lowest current government official with.

1386
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:03,070
The lowest current government official of the corporation

1387
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,910
is 100 times better than any of these

1388
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,570
patriot idiots you ever run into.

1389
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,150
Any of them.

1390
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,970
Even the guy who empties the waste baskets

1391
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,810
in any government office is better than any

1392
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,170
of these patriots by far.

1393
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,750
Because he knows it's a corporation.

1394
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:17,630
He knows it's bullshit.

1395
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,530
So anyway, he knows that everything's finished.

1396
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,750
To a certain degree because he's exposed to

1397
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,250
it every day.

1398
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,330
But that would be interesting to watch if

1399
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,010
these idiots, patriots, try to get something physical

1400
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:30,730
going on.

1401
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,070
It's just going to be a snuff film.

1402
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,630
Look at Waco and all these other things.

1403
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,450
Screwed up stuff.

1404
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,230
That was something totally different in a sense

1405
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,350
but I'm just giving an example.

1406
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,850
There's no way out.

1407
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,850
You'd be exterminated.

1408
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,410
There's nothing you can do at this point.

1409
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,170
In any country, believe it or not.

1410
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,030
Now it doesn't mean that let's say the

1411
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,810
US can go into Syria and say that

1412
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,030
Syria is having a civil war.

1413
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,730
That's bullshit.

1414
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,830
Up until two years ago, I had correspondence

1415
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,090
with people in Syria.

1416
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,290
They were in Aleppo and they said they

1417
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:09,810
have to leave.

1418
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,670
And I understand why.

1419
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,750
If you look at Aleppo, it's mostly blown

1420
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,010
up.

1421
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,410
They were like, these people are not Syrian.

1422
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,070
There's no revolution.

1423
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,070
These are Malaysians, Vietnamese, Australians, Turks.

1424
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,710
There's no one in there from Syria.

1425
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,250
Very few.

1426
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,790
That's different.

1427
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,710
If you go down the line of all

1428
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,850
these questions, what context are you looking at

1429
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,330
it in?

1430
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,990
Again, anything in scripture that you're going to

1431
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,150
look at, you're going to look at it

1432
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:39,630
in chunks.

1433
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,650
What was going on?

1434
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,890
What do you know about the time of

1435
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,970
Moses and after?

1436
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,430
For the setting.

1437
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,950
What do you know about the Creator taking

1438
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,250
the place as one of the patriotic or

1439
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,210
patron deities, let's say, patron deities of all

1440
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,250
the other nations, bringing himself to that level

1441
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:05,570
for Israel and acting that way?

1442
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,070
Let me put it this way.

1443
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,950
It's very plain.

1444
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,950
The Creator is not acting like the Creator

1445
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,110
when you read in scripture.

1446
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,430
When he asks for a certain people, because

1447
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,610
you don't have to be an Israelite to

1448
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:18,850
do it.

1449
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,310
Anyone who wants to do it can do

1450
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,170
it if they commit to it, is the

1451
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:22,450
law.

1452
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,030
By the way, living your life lawfully is

1453
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,050
like reading scripture is studying, let's say in

1454
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,430
university, and doing the law is the lab.

1455
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,470
When you take a course, you need some

1456
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,790
lab or hands-on.

1457
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,750
When you do the law, food, clothing, shelter,

1458
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,990
according to the law, and you act according

1459
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,370
to the law, keep time and all this

1460
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,450
stuff, that is your hands-on experience with

1461
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:49,870
scripture.

1462
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,090
That's very dangerous, by the way, to any

1463
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,870
organization, because there is no organization that knows

1464
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,810
what the law is.

1465
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,530
They mouth-flick, they do, but they won't

1466
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,030
do it.

1467
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,610
It's very dangerous to the establishment also.

1468
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,210
Very, very dangerous.

1469
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,110
And Dimitri talked about that, the ideology.

1470
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,750
They tell you, oh yeah, Christians don't have

1471
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,330
to do it, or no, the Jews, we

1472
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,530
do our tradition, but no one is touching

1473
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,770
the biblical law at all.

1474
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,670
They can't, because they know that this is

1475
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,930
the way things are going to be later,

1476
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:23,830
not the time now.

1477
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,510
It doesn't mean you can't have hands-on

1478
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,450
with it, because it's the right thing to

1479
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,390
do from a moral place.

1480
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,470
But again, if you consider the Creator has

1481
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,510
taken, brought Himself down to the position of

1482
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,630
the sons of God to rule over one

1483
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,830
nation, or one nation has allegiance to Him,

1484
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,850
and anyone else can as well, and is

1485
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:46,650
functioning that way, even with the temple complex,

1486
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,350
even with His law, whether it's divine geography,

1487
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,410
or human geography, earthly geography, or all that,

1488
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,690
He is acting, He has brought Himself down

1489
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:04,450
to the level of a patron deity.

1490
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,230
He's not acting, the Creator is not acting

1491
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,070
like the Creator in Scripture.

1492
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,210
It's very obvious.

1493
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,970
If He's the Creator of the universe, can't

1494
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,690
He just speak things into existence, immediately hop

1495
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:21,830
on?

1496
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,650
Who would fight the Israelites?

1497
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:24,730
No one would.

1498
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,090
If He presented Himself in full power.

1499
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:33,070
Even when Christ came to the earth, He

1500
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,530
presented Himself as, I have to do this

1501
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,770
thing you don't understand.

1502
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,010
You'll understand later, if you remember reading that.

1503
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,450
And He steps out.

1504
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,310
It's like guerrilla tactics.

1505
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,630
Got a job to do?

1506
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,410
Go and do it.

1507
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,490
I'm not going to advertise it.

1508
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,670
If a few people know about it, it's

1509
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,930
okay.

1510
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,310
By the time anything can be done, I'm

1511
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:53,750
out of here.

1512
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,170
Plausible deniability.

1513
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,030
And He knew there was going to be

1514
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,290
plausible deniability about what He did because He

1515
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:02,770
said so.

1516
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,610
He said, well, if they say, look, He's

1517
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,010
in the desert, don't go, it's not me.

1518
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,570
Look, they're going to say, it's me at

1519
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:07,950
the mountains.

1520
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,150
No, don't go, it's not me.

1521
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,650
That's the plausible deniability.

1522
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,570
Look, He's still here.

1523
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:14,710
He went to India.

1524
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:15,590
He's really a Buddhist.

1525
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,330
That's not me.

1526
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,450
So they knew about the plausible deniability.

1527
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,650
Once you understand that there is earthly functions

1528
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,550
with humans acting in a national way, sovereign

1529
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,830
or semi-sovereign, and they each have a

1530
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,470
patron or matron deity, that is the order

1531
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,430
of things now.

1532
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,150
And when you speak of the gods, the

1533
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,870
most you're going to get on in any

1534
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,470
overt sense is a patron deity.

1535
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,310
The Creator is not acting as the Creator.

1536
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,790
The only time He acted as the Creator

1537
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,750
was during the flood.

1538
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,110
And also when they wrapped things up, and

1539
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,830
it was written about the on-off, the

1540
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,430
dark cloud, and rolled out.

1541
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:55,770
Rolled out of town.

1542
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,710
Then you know it's that.

1543
00:55:59,230 --> 00:55:59,990
To that level.

1544
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,810
Now, after what's called the millennium period, what's

1545
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,730
coming, we're in it right now, it just

1546
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,690
hasn't manifested a strict beginning of a change

1547
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,190
yet.

1548
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,510
In other words, the gods have not returned

1549
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,070
overtly.

1550
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,470
Which is more than the gods returning.

1551
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,710
It's actually the war between, if you read

1552
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,390
ancient texts, especially 2nd or 3rd century, there

1553
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,990
were some writings, Qumranic writings, and other writings,

1554
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,990
and people who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls,

1555
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,350
and others, we're talking about their interest, in

1556
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,310
the end there's going to be a war

1557
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,750
between man and the gods.

1558
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,190
And obviously it's not going to work out

1559
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,870
well for man.

1560
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,490
But that is the scenario that's coming.

1561
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,070
Even when this scenario comes, there's going to

1562
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,430
be a reorganization, and the full power of

1563
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,450
the Creator on Earth will not be realized

1564
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,450
until still 900 years from now.

1565
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,850
Plus.

1566
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,140
But at least we'll have overt contact with

1567
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,780
the gods and resurrected beings.

1568
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,680
So if you want to know the overt

1569
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,380
power of the Creator, read like Zephaniah, or

1570
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,400
read like the ends of parts of Revelation.

1571
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,980
All that.

1572
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:20,200
So, the other aspect right now, that's why

1573
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,240
it's so difficult, this is the knowledge part

1574
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,520
again.

1575
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,560
If you know who the Creator is, and

1576
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,520
you know exactly what's going on, which is

1577
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,820
quite simple, it's not easy, but it's simple.

1578
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,940
You have a human society of various varieties,

1579
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,660
and types.

1580
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,200
And there's a patron deity over each type,

1581
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,780
nation, or territory, or region.

1582
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,840
And the Creator doesn't bust in as the

1583
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,180
Creator.

1584
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,860
He comes in and he sets himself up

1585
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,120
as one of these other patron deities over,

1586
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,140
let's say, Israel.

1587
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,920
If they want him.

1588
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,660
He says that, basically.

1589
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,060
If you want me, I'll do it.

1590
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,560
And he does this as a witness to

1591
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,060
everyone else if they want to know who

1592
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:04,460
he is.

1593
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,460
But he's acting on that dynamic.

1594
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,460
He's not acting as the Creator at this

1595
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:08,780
point.

1596
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,140
And again, if you ever read the scripture,

1597
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,200
what do the Christians say?

1598
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,620
The only begotten son of God?

1599
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,560
It doesn't say that.

1600
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,180
It doesn't say he's the only begotten son,

1601
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,400
because then who are the sons of God?

1602
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,120
What it says, he's the monogenous, the one

1603
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,460
of a kind, like a genus is a

1604
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,840
type.

1605
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,180
Right?

1606
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:37,160
He's a monogenous of Elohim, meaning he is

1607
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,040
a one of a kind.

1608
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,120
What's his one of a kind?

1609
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,360
His one of a kind is not to

1610
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,960
rule over a nation now.

1611
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,300
One of a kind is to show the

1612
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,240
people that are human that resurrection is possible

1613
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,580
and he's going to prove it.

1614
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,600
That is a prototype of sorts.

1615
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,860
That was his job.

1616
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,280
I shouldn't be saying this kind of stuff

1617
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,040
because I'm going into things I'm saying I

1618
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,420
shouldn't be talking about publicly.

1619
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,580
But these are things that are like, it's

1620
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,800
like imagine a neon sign 50 feet tall

1621
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,020
and everyone's walking around.

1622
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,500
I didn't see that neon sign.

1623
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,320
What are you talking about?

1624
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,700
It's 10,000 watts and 50 feet tall.

1625
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,560
How can you miss that?

1626
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,240
Cosmic censorship is a bitch.

1627
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,820
So basically I just laid out all knowledge

1628
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,940
in all scripture and all knowledge basically of

1629
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,120
humankind for the past 6,000 years and

1630
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,000
the past half hour.

1631
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,520
Not all the knowledge but basically how to

1632
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,200
perceive it.

1633
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,000
Right.

1634
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,280
What I call the world order.

1635
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,880
The world order is you have groupings of

1636
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,140
people.

1637
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,040
There are gods over each group of people.

1638
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,380
The creator takes his place as one of

1639
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,580
those grouping of gods.

1640
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,780
Not as the creator in full power obviously

1641
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,600
until a time later and this is what's

1642
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,240
going on.

1643
00:59:59,340 --> 00:59:59,900
Period.

1644
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,600
What else is there to know?

1645
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,440
It's pretty obvious if you look at the

1646
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,260
medical system it's a farce.

1647
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,940
Through these eyes that I'm mentioning.

1648
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,440
Basically they're not really scientific.

1649
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,640
What they are is they're pushing a religion.

1650
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,680
Blood pressure is like an easy Achilles heel

1651
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,460
to show what kind of a fraud the

1652
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,100
system is.

1653
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,900
If blood pressure is so important why aren't

1654
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:25,780
vets using it?

1655
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,630
If you ever see a horse or dog

1656
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,770
get a cuff a sphigometer on it and

1657
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,810
check the blood pressure and say oh he

1658
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,050
needs some blood pressure medication he's got hypertension

1659
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,570
what they don't get stressed out too?

1660
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,250
Of course they don't do anything.

1661
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,450
Horses get stressed out.

1662
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,850
They're very emotional animals.

1663
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,610
All animals are very emotional.

1664
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,530
Contrary to things that naturalists wrote 200 years

1665
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:52,850
ago.

1666
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,610
It's all farce.

1667
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:02,470
Viruses and whatever science you see.

1668
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,530
Years ago if your vision went bad they

1669
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,350
didn't prescribe glasses they gave you a list

1670
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,890
of dietary things to do.

1671
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,670
Are you familiar with that?

1672
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,310
No I was not.

1673
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,890
Old medical books had categories on poor vision.

1674
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,110
It was all dietary and exercise and breathing.

1675
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:21,610
Not glasses.

1676
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,770
Right now I see 8 year olds getting

1677
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,390
glasses.

1678
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,190
Glasses?

1679
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,010
Their diet sucks.

1680
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,650
They've never eaten real bread or real cheese

1681
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,790
or real fruit in their lives.

1682
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:37,050
There's no reason to get into that in

1683
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,990
any kind of remedial status because it's not

1684
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,710
going to be remedied.

1685
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:41,930
These people don't need better food.

1686
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,910
They need to be gone.

1687
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,170
Not because I say so.

1688
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,070
The gods say so.

1689
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,050
And the people that own them say so.

1690
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,210
Getting a little tired of your asses.

1691
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,050
So there's all the questions in the email.

1692
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,890
I think this indirect direct approach of what

1693
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,050
is really going on on this earth I

1694
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,110
think should help answer most people's questions for

1695
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,970
a long time.

1696
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,830
The aspect of several questions what else can

1697
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,590
we do about the body other than good

1698
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:15,930
water and eating seasonally?

1699
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,830
Well then it gets kind of like more

1700
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:23,090
specific and it also gets more into what

1701
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,430
do you want, a DIY manual on brain

1702
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,930
surgery?

1703
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,250
You don't see too many of those, right?

1704
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:30,110
Right.

1705
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,610
It gets specific.

1706
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,250
There are many things you can do for

1707
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,130
the body but the thing is there's something

1708
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,230
called diagnostic.

1709
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,670
You have to diagnose properly.

1710
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,470
Even a car.

1711
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,950
You ever go to a mechanic who can't

1712
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,590
diagnose a car?

1713
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,170
They start changing parts and the problem is

1714
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,870
still there, right?

1715
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,350
You always want to go to a mechanic

1716
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,710
who says you don't pay anything until it's

1717
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,110
fixed.

1718
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:51,990
Right.

1719
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,910
So a lot of dealers say it's $900

1720
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,810
and it didn't help.

1721
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,170
Well it's going to be another $1200 for

1722
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:58,290
that.

1723
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,210
People go for it.

1724
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,210
So that mindset is what I'm talking about.

1725
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,850
Basically if you understand how to diagnose the

1726
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:08,610
body one easy way to proceed with understanding

1727
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,230
it is why throw away everything that's been

1728
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,710
gathered in knowledge about the human body for

1729
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,410
thousands of years?

1730
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,430
Don't throw all that away.

1731
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:19,070
I would say the eastern arts are easier

1732
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,550
to look at than the western arts which

1733
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:23,390
have been completely subverted because of the Christianity.

1734
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:24,910
Right?

1735
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:25,730
The church.

1736
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,270
They didn't want any of that, right?

1737
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,570
But if you understand on how to diagnose

1738
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:34,230
the body I would suggest the easiest thing

1739
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,310
for the western mind or the mindset to

1740
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,790
comprehend is macrobiotic diagnosis.

1741
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,570
I don't like to suggest that because they

1742
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,490
call it macro-neurotics.

1743
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:46,390
They're too dogmatic.

1744
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,750
Learn about lymphology.

1745
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:55,710
How do you get a semi-stagnant fluid

1746
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,070
like the lymph fluid moving in order to

1747
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,750
invigorate the health of a body?

1748
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,010
Because if the fluid becomes too stagnant that's

1749
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,970
where you get most diseases or if it

1750
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,530
becomes a carrier for things to fester in

1751
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,170
the lymph system.

1752
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,610
So how do you get the lymph system

1753
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:09,950
moving?

1754
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,810
Jumping up and down on a trampoline.

1755
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:12,850
Stretching.

1756
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,270
Massages.

1757
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,190
Hot and cold alternating baths.

1758
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:17,490
Barometrically.

1759
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:19,930
You know how people say I'm going to

1760
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,850
go for a hike or a walk?

1761
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,690
Well don't walk horizontally, walk vertically.

1762
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,350
Climb something barometrically.

1763
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:30,230
If you walk up a steep hill let's

1764
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,190
say or a mountain which is a thousand

1765
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,090
feet tall it might take you half the

1766
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,070
day to go up and come down.

1767
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,950
You have a barometric change.

1768
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,710
That decrease in pressure as you go up

1769
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,590
expands the body and as you come down

1770
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,250
contracts it again and you get a wonderful

1771
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,270
lymphatic charge.

1772
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:50,010
The old Austrian doctors even today, not so

1773
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,870
much, you might have heard when people were

1774
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:53,850
sick they said just go up to the

1775
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:54,130
mountains.

1776
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,850
There's a cabin up there.

1777
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,650
There's a retreat.

1778
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:58,890
Go live there for a week.

1779
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,910
Have you heard that before?

1780
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,530
Go stay up in the mountains for a

1781
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:04,650
week.

1782
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:05,190
See how you feel.

1783
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:05,590
Come back.

1784
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,290
That's the barometric method.

1785
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,750
Baro means pressure.

1786
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,950
Again, there's a whole discussion.

1787
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,870
I personally, like I got an email recently

1788
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,610
and it says, Greek you sound like you've

1789
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:24,510
lost enthusiasm.

1790
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:25,890
You sound like you get mad and you

1791
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,750
even sound bitchy.

1792
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,870
I didn't answer it back but I'm thinking

1793
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,170
like who cares?

1794
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,470
I've been speaking publicly for over ten years

1795
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:35,390
on the internet for more than seven now

1796
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,070
and I do get people still contributing a

1797
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,490
little here and there to get coffee and

1798
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:39,810
cigarettes.

1799
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,010
I appreciate that a lot.

1800
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:41,930
Some more than others.

1801
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,290
I'm not going to market this.

1802
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,690
I'm not going to be like Ray Kroc

1803
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,310
of McDonald's and persist and persist and persist.

1804
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,770
I'm not going to stay up and write

1805
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,250
stuff.

1806
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,590
Why don't you get it together?

1807
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,490
You're talking about the same stuff all the

1808
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:01,630
time.

1809
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,930
Why?

1810
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,770
I'm talking to eternal second graders.

1811
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,630
If your people are going to be in

1812
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,150
the second grade for their whole lives why

1813
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,450
should I talk about what's in the third

1814
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:09,670
grade?

1815
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,310
It's ridiculous.

1816
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,130
There's no support for this type of thing

1817
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,810
to grow it as an organization.

1818
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,010
And I don't mean in a standard organization

1819
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,890
but where people can organize information and we

1820
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,570
can present, let's say instead of doing a

1821
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,710
sonic like this why not buy time on

1822
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,210
a server and have eight hours of audio

1823
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,310
files categorized on various conditions of the human

1824
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:36,750
body and how to remedy them or diagnose

1825
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:36,990
it.

1826
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,670
You know how long it takes to do

1827
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,890
that?

1828
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:40,710
I ain't doing it.

1829
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,610
I'd rather watch Netflix or sleep or ride

1830
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,130
my bike.

1831
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,890
Screw y'all.

1832
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,990
What am I, Mother Teresa?

1833
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:54,290
I'm not here to forget it.

1834
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,690
And of course, again, I do appreciate the

1835
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:00,090
contributions for the coffee and cigarettes.

1836
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:06,410
But there's no support for what's right and

1837
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:09,050
moral on this planet in a general sense

1838
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,270
where it can be mobilized.

1839
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,290
So, sorry.

1840
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,590
After the resurrection that'll be taken care of.

1841
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,130
It doesn't mean that everything I do is

1842
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:18,670
successful.

1843
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,210
It doesn't mean that I'll run into someone

1844
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,890
that has a health problem or whatever and

1845
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:22,530
it'll be solved.

1846
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:28,510
But this way of doing it is astronomically

1847
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,670
beyond what you're going to get anywhere else.

1848
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,690
Even recently, someone said to me, I went

1849
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,490
to this holistic doctor and he told me

1850
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:39,230
about a condition.

1851
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,670
I said, wait a second, before you tell

1852
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:43,730
me what he told you to do, did

1853
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,610
he take your blood pressure?

1854
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,250
He said, yes, he did.

1855
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,930
I said, all right.

1856
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,770
Well, even if you don't tell me what

1857
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,790
he did, it doesn't matter.

1858
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,610
Because he's a fraudster.

1859
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,280
So, yeah.

1860
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,600
Interesting how it happened.

1861
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,360
I ran into someone who's a German immigrant.

1862
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,140
He's quite wealthy.

1863
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,120
He imports wines and things.

1864
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,380
Recently I was at a sushi place.

1865
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,660
He was like, hey man, how's the water

1866
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,160
stuff going?

1867
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,460
I said, I'm not doing it anymore.

1868
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,180
We had the best water in the world.

1869
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,080
I stopped nobody.

1870
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,800
People were like, it was the best water

1871
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,380
we've ever had.

1872
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,180
But so what?

1873
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,680
He said, what do you do now about

1874
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,060
the water?

1875
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,500
I said, what do you do about the

1876
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:27,920
water now?

1877
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,060
I said, well, if somebody asks me to

1878
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,939
do something about water, I say, hey, what's

1879
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:33,300
wrong with drinking out of the toilet?

1880
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:36,640
What do you mean?

1881
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,260
You're asking me how to make water better.

1882
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,040
What's wrong with drinking out of the toilet?

1883
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,260
Go drink out of the toilet.

1884
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:41,880
Leave me alone.

1885
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,100
This is the reality, and believe it or

1886
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,140
not, this is what the gods think of

1887
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:50,660
you too.

1888
01:08:53,149 --> 01:08:53,550
Sorry.

1889
01:08:54,450 --> 01:09:01,370
So from that perspective, I think that even

1890
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,569
the most rudimentary basic Greek speak is a

1891
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,750
thousand times over anything else you've ever heard.

1892
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:07,310
Not five or ten or a hundred times.

1893
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:08,790
A thousand times beyond.

1894
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,710
So be happy with what you got.

1895
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,130
Sorry.

1896
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:17,370
That's all you're going to get.

1897
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,050
Why?

1898
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,529
Can more be done?

1899
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:20,609
Oh, a lot can be done.

1900
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:21,790
But is it going to happen now?

1901
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,370
Because I'm not going to volunteer to do

1902
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:23,609
it.

1903
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:25,910
Period.

1904
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,229
There's no support.

1905
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,170
There's no backing.

1906
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:29,970
Nobody wants it.

1907
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,290
Remember, it's super wealthy people.

1908
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:33,430
Oh, they pat you on the back.

1909
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:35,090
Oh, you're doing great stuff, man.

1910
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:35,310
Great.

1911
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:38,450
I could use maybe $10-15 million to

1912
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:40,350
get a building and have some dorms, get

1913
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,550
people from all over the world come and

1914
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,290
share their experiences.

1915
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,970
Yeah, I'm not really interested in that.

1916
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:45,729
You just go ahead.

1917
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,149
So the people that have the wherewithal, I'm

1918
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:53,570
not talking about the people listening to contribute.

1919
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,130
Yeah, you send some money in an envelope,

1920
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,810
whatever, that's fine.

1921
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:56,970
Great, I'll get cigarettes with it.

1922
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,430
But I'm not talking about that.

1923
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,950
I'm talking about the people that have the

1924
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:04,790
wherewithal, you know, six, seven, eight figures to

1925
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:08,090
put together a real system of disclosing good

1926
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,090
communication, good information.

1927
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,910
Don't want it.

1928
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:12,430
Don't want it.

1929
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:16,290
It has nothing to do with what one

1930
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:17,710
individual wants to do.

1931
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,070
It has to do with where you are

1932
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,350
in the setting on this earth.

1933
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:22,510
It's shit.

1934
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,970
So, if you want better water, what's wrong

1935
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:27,110
with drinking out of the toilet?

1936
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,630
Scoop some out of the toilet, put it

1937
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:29,530
in the fridge and chill it.

1938
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,170
You already know that chilling makes it better.

1939
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:33,970
Period.

1940
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,050
I mean, can stuff be done?

1941
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:37,790
Oh, yeah.

1942
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,590
Tremendous amount of stuff can be done.

1943
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,190
Actually, recently I said, oh, I want to

1944
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:44,710
do a sonic event again on water because

1945
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,130
it's really easy to up the quality.

1946
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:46,870
I'll tell you right now.

1947
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,890
You ever see these home good places they

1948
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:54,450
have for wine connoisseurs?

1949
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,110
When you open a bottle of wine and

1950
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,870
don't finish it, it's a cork system or

1951
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,410
a plug system that you draw a vacuum

1952
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,370
on the bottle of wine.

1953
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,230
They've been around for like 50 years, but

1954
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,250
now they're really cheap.

1955
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,930
A company like Rabbit or VIN, V-I

1956
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,590
-N, make them.

1957
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,670
In other words, you open a bottle of

1958
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,790
wine, something non-carbonated, they give you a

1959
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,730
rubber stopper and it has an orifice that

1960
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:16,110
seals like a sphincter, a one-way valve,

1961
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:17,410
and you put a pump over it and

1962
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,910
you draw a pump on the wine bottle.

1963
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,630
You familiar with that?

1964
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,570
No, I'm listening intently, though.

1965
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:24,470
OK.

1966
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,350
What you do then is if you decant

1967
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,230
your water into something like a wine bottle,

1968
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,810
which is roughly a 28-millimeter opening, you

1969
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,230
get one of these vacuum systems.

1970
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,790
It has like three or four stoppers and

1971
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,530
a pump for $10.

1972
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,590
You have an air gap over the water

1973
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,350
level in the bottle, blue bottle, dark-colored

1974
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,410
bottle, amber bottle, where you put it in

1975
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:44,750
the fridge.

1976
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,390
Pull a slight vacuum on that water and

1977
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,230
then chill it.

1978
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,650
Actually, when you pull a vacuum on the

1979
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,990
water at room temp, you'll notice there'll be

1980
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,790
a half-degree temperature drop right away.

1981
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,750
What does that tell you when water starts

1982
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,130
dropping temperature on its own?

1983
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,950
It's going towards a healthy condition.

1984
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,030
In other words, if you start treating water

1985
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,910
in room temperature and you notice that as

1986
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,730
you're treating the water, the water is actually

1987
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,750
dropping its own temperature, you're like, wow, it's

1988
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,870
invigorating itself.

1989
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,990
Now that you bring that up, when I

1990
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,790
take mine out of the fridge and I

1991
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:18,150
slowly open it, you can hear that vacuum.

1992
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,370
Right.

1993
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,970
If you induce that vacuum from the beginning,

1994
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,190
also there's an ethereal thing.

1995
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,870
When you create a monotone or a monoform,

1996
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:31,790
the way you eliminate the life ether is

1997
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:32,450
with a vacuum.

1998
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:36,430
For example, really good medical-grade fridges that

1999
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,850
they use in high-end restaurants, you know

2000
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,130
how you open and close the fridge door,

2001
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:39,370
right?

2002
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,530
Well, these are different.

2003
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,650
When you close the fridge, you hear a

2004
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,170
little pump and it draws a vacuum on

2005
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:45,890
the entire fridge and the gasket kind of

2006
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:48,410
seals real tight, prevents bacteria from growing.

2007
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,270
And you just don't go up to this

2008
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,350
fridge and try to open it.

2009
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,290
If you remember the freezers, you fired up

2010
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,850
a freezer in the Midwest where you can't

2011
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:55,530
open it, right?

2012
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:56,150
Right.

2013
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,450
Because the air holds it tight.

2014
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:00,530
So these restaurant fridges, you push a button

2015
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,610
and you hear a pressure release and then

2016
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,530
you open the fridge.

2017
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:07,130
We're talking about $30,000 fridges now, small

2018
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:07,510
fridges.

2019
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,390
They're medical-grade or whatever.

2020
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:12,670
So these real high-end fridges, they always

2021
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,710
pull a vacuum because the bacteria and the

2022
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,710
fungus will not grow.

2023
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:18,350
Right.

2024
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,470
But that's not why you're doing it with

2025
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:23,070
water because when water flows underground, there's no

2026
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:23,910
atmosphere there.

2027
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,170
And through capillary action on the real narrow

2028
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,690
crevices is a negative pressure.

2029
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,490
You know what I mean by capillary action?

2030
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,430
You ever put a straw in a glass,

2031
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,910
you notice the water level in the straw

2032
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,230
is higher than the rest of the glass.

2033
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,290
That's because there's less pressure.

2034
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,590
So the water discussion part two would be

2035
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,750
learn how to pull a vacuum.

2036
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,150
Now, if you could pull a vacuum on

2037
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,110
the water and then inject some CO2 gas

2038
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,350
and still maintain the vacuum, like if you

2039
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,210
can pull four or five inches of vacuum,

2040
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,210
let's say, in a system.

2041
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,210
I think I posted a photo of a

2042
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,170
mini-fridge with an eight-gallon blue vessel

2043
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:54,810
in it.

2044
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:59,230
We pulled five inches of vacuum and then

2045
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,670
we injected CO2 slowly until the five inches

2046
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,650
of vacuum dropped to two inches of vacuum,

2047
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,750
meaning there's still a vacuum, but there's CO2

2048
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,430
in the vacuum.

2049
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,750
CO2 will not go into the water.

2050
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,150
That helps the water digest.

2051
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:13,030
And when you do that and start vortexing

2052
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,530
the water with a silver impeller, you'll see

2053
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,330
the temperature drops a degree and a half

2054
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,530
by itself, just with that condition.

2055
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:22,930
Chalberger talked about that.

2056
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,250
When you get the water moving properly, it

2057
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,610
will start to drop temperature on its own.

2058
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,990
It's kind of like a sick horse in

2059
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:31,330
the barn.

2060
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:35,110
Look, he's standing up on his own.

2061
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,390
It means he's getting better.

2062
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,890
So there's more we can discuss on water.

2063
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,170
I just give out that little part.

2064
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,410
So you get some water out of the

2065
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:45,170
toilet, put it in a wine bottle, get

2066
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:49,250
one of those wine vacuum systems, draw a

2067
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,190
slight vacuum on it.

2068
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:50,910
You go on YouTube.

2069
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,130
VIN, I think it's V-I-N, Rabbit

2070
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,530
is another.

2071
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:54,970
There's a couple of other ones depending on

2072
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:55,850
where in the world you live.

2073
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,150
You can get them anywhere at a home

2074
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,930
goods section of a store, department store or

2075
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,650
home store that has wine stuff.

2076
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,290
Between $10 and $20 for an elaborate one.

2077
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,230
They have electric ones.

2078
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,530
You put a battery in that is not

2079
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:08,090
necessary.

2080
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,950
It's like a hand pump.

2081
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,730
It works with a check valve in reverse.

2082
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,650
You get the idea.

2083
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:15,430
You put in a rubber stopper and the

2084
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,050
valve, the fitting of the top of the

2085
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,450
stopper fits on the pump.

2086
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,550
As you draw on the pump, it pulls

2087
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,510
the vacuum in the bottle.

2088
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:24,430
You remove the pump, it stays sealed.

2089
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,430
You get the idea.

2090
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:27,750
Very simple.

2091
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,510
Anywhere you go in the house, you got

2092
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,150
the systems that put a vacuum on a

2093
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:33,770
wine bottle?

2094
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,330
Yeah, yeah, come right here.

2095
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,730
Get the cheapest one.

2096
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:37,330
They work better.

2097
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,590
Start pulling vacuums.

2098
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,750
You're going to see, talk about invigorating water.

2099
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,590
It'll mature faster.

2100
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,020
Also, for those people that are not sure

2101
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,740
about the water quality, especially if you're getting

2102
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:55,400
it out of the toilet, if you draw

2103
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,420
enough of a vacuum, it destroys the pathogens.

2104
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,890
Because the pathogens explode.

2105
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:02,610
Right.

2106
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:11,060
That's part 2.1 of water.

2107
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,420
There's many other things we can do.

2108
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,480
But that's a very simple one that I

2109
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,620
have not included in water talks previously.

2110
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,000
Because still, why bother?

2111
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,080
That's pretty much it.

2112
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,780
You're living in a condition right now, in

2113
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,080
a divine condition, where things are very simply

2114
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,940
the way they are, because it's based on

2115
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,960
secular geography, secular racism, meaning you have the

2116
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,480
different races and nationalities, and also cultures and

2117
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:48,920
traditions.

2118
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,400
And there is a God over each one.

2119
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:55,280
And the chief deity, the Most High, has

2120
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,800
taken his position in interacting with humankind as

2121
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,240
one of these patron deities, not as the

2122
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,160
creator himself, which he will in the future

2123
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,280
reveal himself to be.

2124
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:11,670
I don't think I've ever repeated myself and

2125
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,930
gotten into that kind of detail on a

2126
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,170
sonic.

2127
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,630
I have mentioned that before.

2128
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,770
And I haven't addressed everything in bullet point

2129
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,190
form.

2130
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:24,450
But essentially, any question in scripture can be

2131
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,710
answered if you understand, and I said this

2132
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:30,890
in a call recently, this is what all

2133
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,310
of the theologians, all of the scholars, all

2134
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:36,030
of the religious leaders of every religion, academics,

2135
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:39,810
your parents, all your religious institutions, friends, family,

2136
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,870
don't want you to know.

2137
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,670
In other words, when this knowledge starts to

2138
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,310
form, they pin it down.

2139
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,910
It's like, no, no, no, it's your opinion,

2140
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,670
don't do that.

2141
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,490
It's called heresy.

2142
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,590
If you know what the soul and the

2143
01:17:55,590 --> 01:18:01,970
spirit is, and the human bodies also, if

2144
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,030
you know how to keep time, if you

2145
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:08,730
know that there are gods over nations, you

2146
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,350
will understand everything in scripture.

2147
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,470
I mean, comprehend it.

2148
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,890
And if it seems like you don't understand

2149
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,330
it there, well, that's because it needs to

2150
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,190
be harmonized.

2151
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:22,350
In other words, you'll be reading a verse

2152
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,490
that makes sense, and you'll see a verse

2153
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,090
that doesn't make sense out of nowhere, and

2154
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:25,590
then it goes back.

2155
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:28,570
That's called interjection in literary mechanism, they interject

2156
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,230
the thought.

2157
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,470
Well, that's because it needs to be continued

2158
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,650
somewhere else, so you need to create harmony

2159
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,010
there.

2160
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,910
A good bit of research is to, when

2161
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,310
you look at nations, do a research on

2162
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:43,490
the word nations, being divided, being organized, being

2163
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,010
good, being destroyed, being formed.

2164
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,130
And you'll see when nations is being used,

2165
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:52,870
goyim is one way in Hebrew, or laos

2166
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,470
in Greek.

2167
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,030
So when you look at all being formed,

2168
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,150
you'll see all the dynamics.

2169
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:02,730
So if you understand the basic premise of

2170
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:06,850
things mentioned, basically defining the basic terms in

2171
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:10,190
scripture, like one of the most paramount enemies

2172
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:12,570
in scripture is this thing called death, which

2173
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:14,930
the gods and angels are subject to also.

2174
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,030
So what do you know about death?

2175
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,270
What's the remedy of death?

2176
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,450
What is the key of death?

2177
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,090
Someone yesterday said, what are the keys to

2178
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:22,410
death?

2179
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,490
Well, that's the resurrection, but the resurrection is

2180
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:27,070
not that simple.

2181
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,670
You can look at the examples, basically keep

2182
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,590
your mouth shut, because you don't want to

2183
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,110
argue with the adversary, right?

2184
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:35,130
Screw up and be thrown on the lake

2185
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:35,510
of fire.

2186
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,670
You'll still be thrown on the lake of

2187
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,890
fire, you'll still be resurrected, but it's a

2188
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:40,510
different outcome.

2189
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,910
Then you have the various levels of honor.

2190
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:44,250
The highest honor is to be part of

2191
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,130
the first resurrection.

2192
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,210
That's why when Christ says, I want you

2193
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,430
to be like me, it's not this Christian

2194
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,510
demonic shit that people talk about.

2195
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,970
It's because I want you to be part

2196
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:55,870
of the first resurrection, because I'm the first

2197
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,410
to be resurrected from the dead.

2198
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,830
And just because I'm the first, it doesn't

2199
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,110
mean that there still isn't a first resurrection.

2200
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:07,630
So anyway, this gets into the more advanced

2201
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:08,150
matters.

2202
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:10,670
If you're asking questions like the ones that

2203
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,030
I've been seeing for the past few years,

2204
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,250
I'm not going to get into the advanced

2205
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:13,590
stuff.

2206
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,830
And I'm not going to berate people for

2207
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,030
not being ready for it.

2208
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,410
And how can I judge and do that?

2209
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,050
But yeah, I can do it.

2210
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:22,110
It's my right to do so.

2211
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,970
I don't see anyone ready for more competent

2212
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:26,950
discussions, period.

2213
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:32,090
So, sorry, would you rather me lie and

2214
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:33,230
say, well, maybe we'll do it in the

2215
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:33,510
future?

2216
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,230
Maybe?

2217
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:34,610
No.

2218
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,850
Right now, as it stands, no, there's no

2219
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:39,910
competent discussion, beyond what we've discussed or heard

2220
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,650
in Greek speak, necessary.

2221
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:45,470
Because you've got to keep things in context.

2222
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,970
What it's like, someone I know has been

2223
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,850
listening to Greek speak for half a decade,

2224
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,710
and he's so excited to get in touch

2225
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:54,810
with me, to tell him what this holistic

2226
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,750
doctor told him.

2227
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,130
And then I asked him, did he take

2228
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:57,730
your blood pressure?

2229
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:58,170
He said, yes.

2230
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,750
You mean, didn't you, like, why don't you

2231
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,650
at least tell me, he invalidated himself by

2232
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,010
doing that, but by the way, this is

2233
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:06,070
what this idiot said.

2234
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,750
You know, so what do you do?

2235
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,310
What do you do?

2236
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,930
I mean, you just kind of sit back

2237
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:13,250
here, like, yeah, I mean, when I go

2238
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,610
get smokes, I'm like, hey, you guys got

2239
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,990
any other cigarettes that are pretty good quality?

2240
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,110
Or when I, you know, take my time

2241
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:22,310
making coffee, make sure you have clean clothes

2242
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,370
and good food, and the rest is just

2243
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,150
like, eh, why bother?

2244
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,290
You know, what's interesting, if you look at

2245
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:35,090
Scripture, you know, someone said, Greek and all

2246
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,670
that stuff you just said about the gods

2247
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:38,430
and the Creator taking his position, like, this

2248
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,810
is how it is, ah, that's European.

2249
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:40,690
You know what?

2250
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:44,530
Okay, look at some supporting stuff, for example.

2251
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,090
When you read in Scripture about general prayer,

2252
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,230
what is the general prayer?

2253
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,090
Praying for what?

2254
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,250
Peace.

2255
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:55,070
Does it say pray for a democratic republic,

2256
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:55,610
or whatever?

2257
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,350
Or a good king?

2258
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,590
Or a monarch?

2259
01:21:58,830 --> 01:21:59,790
Or here, this, or whatever?

2260
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,510
No, you pray for your peace.

2261
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,210
It doesn't matter if it's the National Socialist

2262
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:07,450
Party, or the Nazis, or Stalin, or Hitler,

2263
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:11,410
or Roosevelt, or Trump, or Obama, or King

2264
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:13,350
Louis, or King Henry, it doesn't matter.

2265
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,170
That's just secondary, tertiary crap.

2266
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:19,690
Just pray that there's peace around you, right?

2267
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,770
You know what I mean by peace?

2268
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,210
It's not like tremendous bloodshed, where you can't,

2269
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,030
like, enjoy a meal, or a cigarette, or

2270
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,570
a coffee.

2271
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,450
You know, how can you make a good

2272
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,590
coffee if you hear blood-curdling screams of

2273
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:31,230
people hanging from the street posts?

2274
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,650
You're not going to make a good coffee

2275
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:34,590
when you hear that.

2276
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:35,510
No, you're not.

2277
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,570
It doesn't matter who's in office, or what

2278
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:40,230
type of, because it's screwed up.

2279
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,110
So, in essence, you're buying time.

2280
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,230
You know, you're basically a number.

2281
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:48,430
I've said this sonically before.

2282
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,050
You're just a number.

2283
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,150
There's a certain amount of...

2284
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,310
I mean, I've looked at...

2285
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,890
It's so funny when I think about it.

2286
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,510
I mean, I can't describe the character of

2287
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:54,690
people.

2288
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:55,210
There's no sense.

2289
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,710
It's just shit.

2290
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,470
When you look at the people around you,

2291
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,310
it doesn't matter if they're relatives, friends, acquaintances,

2292
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:00,190
people at the bus stop.

2293
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:00,890
It's just crap.

2294
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,110
And if you don't think so, you're not

2295
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:02,670
paying attention.

2296
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,590
Why are they here?

2297
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:05,910
What the hell are they doing?

2298
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:10,090
There's a certain amount of bodies, spirits, souls

2299
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:15,030
have to come through this incarnation.

2300
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:15,770
A number.

2301
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:18,530
And if you study scripture, they're into numbers

2302
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:21,490
big time before we go to the next

2303
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:21,810
level.

2304
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,510
Like someone recently said, Oh, this guy had

2305
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:24,450
a child he should come and see.

2306
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:24,850
I said, Why?

2307
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:26,750
That little baby's going to grow up to

2308
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,130
be a scumbag just like his parents.

2309
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,070
I don't need to see him.

2310
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,070
Actually, it's going to be very upsetting to

2311
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:31,370
see him.

2312
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,730
I'd like to snatch the baby and take

2313
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:36,070
him somewhere where the people are lawful and

2314
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:39,490
knowledgeable and clean and godly, let's say.

2315
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:46,190
So anyway, that's the real reality, not the

2316
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:48,150
reality that people like to indulge in, which

2317
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:48,990
is a farce.

2318
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,830
Can a farce be a reality?

2319
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:52,650
Of course.

2320
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:54,430
You're in it.

2321
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,060
All right, anything else going on?

2322
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,080
Just a fellow who put something in.

2323
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,280
Could you please talk a little bit about

2324
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,960
depression and contemplating suicide?

2325
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,740
What are you waiting for?

2326
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,740
I know you have in the past, but

2327
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:22,280
maybe just pretend it's someone you care about,

2328
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,300
not just another number.

2329
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,100
Oh, that's a good question in a way,

2330
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,920
but here's the simplest thing about that.

2331
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,840
Depression is, you know how you've heard me

2332
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,400
say, could boredom, people say I'm bored, that's

2333
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,200
another popular, boredom and depression are undefined.

2334
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,400
In other words, it's like taboo to address

2335
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,120
them directly.

2336
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:39,820
Let's take boredom.

2337
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,160
If you address boredom directly, could boredom be

2338
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,180
a form of anger?

2339
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,120
I'm not talking about general anger that you

2340
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,520
associate.

2341
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,840
It's like you don't like the situation, but

2342
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,020
you don't want to express it in a

2343
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,120
way so you say it's bored, right?

2344
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,620
Do you know how they say, is itch,

2345
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,720
you know when someone has an itch they

2346
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,920
can't scratch medically, that goes into the category

2347
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,340
of pain, right?

2348
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,240
If you go to the medical technician and

2349
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,880
say I'm itchy and I'm uncomfortable, he treats

2350
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,520
that no different than he would treat a

2351
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:05,700
pain.

2352
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,180
He's going to give you a pain killer

2353
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,900
kind of thing, opiate or something to suppress

2354
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,260
that.

2355
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:11,320
Steroid.

2356
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,600
So can boredom, now can depression be a

2357
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,240
cocktail of truth and fiction or farce and

2358
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,600
truthfulness?

2359
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,700
In other words, could depression be a product

2360
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,980
of, you know certain things are true, like

2361
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,120
if you don't show up at a certain

2362
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,980
time tomorrow your boss will fire you, that's

2363
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,040
true, and then there are other things that

2364
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,700
you think are true, but you know they're

2365
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,920
really not and they're a farce, right?

2366
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,220
And you're mixing the two as being sustainable

2367
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,100
in your life.

2368
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,100
Got to say yea or nay.

2369
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,960
if you have a comprehension and understanding that

2370
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,880
the culture that you grew up with is

2371
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,260
moral, forget about anything else, is even just

2372
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,400
moral, you're going to be depressed.

2373
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,360
Yeah.

2374
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,960
If you think that there's a moral right

2375
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,600
in anything that you see around you or

2376
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,880
anything is objectively moral, you're an idiot and

2377
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,800
you're going to be depressed.

2378
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,040
There's not much in the ancient writs about

2379
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:14,480
suicide.

2380
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,480
It's actually an honorable way to go when

2381
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,640
certain conditions prevent anything else.

2382
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:20,560
Right?

2383
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,520
Like, you know, or at least to initiate,

2384
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,960
you know it's time for us, we'd rather

2385
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,960
take ourselves out than let these guys take

2386
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:28,340
us out.

2387
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,620
But you're not in that condition.

2388
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,180
Nope.

2389
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,720
You know, I don't think any, even people,

2390
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,620
you've heard people hanging themselves in prison.

2391
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,120
You know, that seems justifiable to a certain

2392
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,600
degree.

2393
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,780
Why don't you take your clothes off, run

2394
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,420
naked down the street before if you're considering

2395
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,200
suicide.

2396
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,400
So many other things you do.

2397
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,320
Put on Netflix.

2398
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,540
Go get yourself a cocktail.

2399
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,300
You know.

2400
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,180
Take up, find a hobby.

2401
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,380
Study a little.

2402
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,480
Distract yourself.

2403
01:26:59,520 --> 01:26:59,960
You know what I mean?

2404
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:00,940
Mm-hmm.

2405
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,900
Depression is no such thing.

2406
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:05,740
That's one of the things.

2407
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:06,540
Oh, you sound depressed.

2408
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,080
No, no, no, no.

2409
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,520
Depression is a mix of fact and fiction.

2410
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,600
I'm not mixing fact and fiction.

2411
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,580
I know the reality.

2412
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,760
Greek-speak and the stuff I do is

2413
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,780
a complete anomaly.

2414
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:16,960
Forget it even happened.

2415
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,860
It shouldn't even exist.

2416
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,040
I'm not saying that it's wrong to do

2417
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,260
it.

2418
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,600
But it's definitely not right for this society.

2419
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:24,700
Period.

2420
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,920
So it's an anomaly.

2421
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,620
You know, it's kind of like a Fortean

2422
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:29,960
thing.

2423
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,940
You know, like a woman walking her dog

2424
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,160
in the morning and the sidewalk opens up

2425
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,380
and a guy comes out of it.

2426
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,260
You know, it's like, holy shit, what the

2427
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,260
hell just happened here?

2428
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,600
I know what I saw.

2429
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,240
But everyone will laugh at you if you

2430
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,160
tell them that, right?

2431
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:42,620
Right.

2432
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,020
Or I saw, you know, a guy walk

2433
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:45,780
right through the wall.

2434
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,860
I know what I saw.

2435
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:49,780
Yeah.

2436
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,200
It's an anomaly.

2437
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,880
These are anomalies that I'm talking about.

2438
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,300
Yeah.

2439
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,220
So anyway, next thing, if there's nothing else,

2440
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,860
let's call it for now and make yourself

2441
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,860
useful, people.

2442
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,080
That was the last one there, Greek.

2443
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:05,900
Yeah.

2444
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,480
And to address all the points on the

2445
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:13,820
email, basically, another three minutes here maybe, basically

2446
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,440
the cloud at Exodus, the Tower of Babel

2447
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,600
was not just a tower.

2448
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,620
Go read that again, that section.

2449
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,520
The people gathered.

2450
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,880
They knew about the sons of gods.

2451
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,680
They knew about the divisions that were about

2452
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,180
to happen.

2453
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,320
They didn't build a tower first.

2454
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,540
They built a city first.

2455
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,260
It's a city of Babel that was put

2456
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:34,640
together.

2457
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,700
And then the Tower of Babel is simply

2458
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:39,640
like a temple area or a temple complex.

2459
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,420
When I say complex, it's because it's a

2460
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,720
school, court system, and library system, and offering

2461
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,300
system.

2462
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:47,740
Right?

2463
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:48,600
Right.

2464
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,280
So what do the, have you ever heard

2465
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,860
of, for example, okay, at this time, you

2466
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,960
had a group of gods that were interacting

2467
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,580
with people.

2468
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,140
If you go look at, for example, this

2469
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,160
is Tower of Babel stuff again.

2470
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,900
If you go look, for example, even popularized

2471
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,680
in Hollywood and show traditions.

2472
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,300
Have you ever heard of like, oh, you

2473
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,440
say this thing, abracadabra, whatever, and you summon

2474
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,400
this genie.

2475
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,100
Right?

2476
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:15,820
Or you recite this ancient thing and you

2477
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:16,980
summon this demon.

2478
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,880
Have you heard that before?

2479
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:18,600
Oh, yes.

2480
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,760
It's in Hollywood and all this.

2481
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,060
And it's in reality also.

2482
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,860
In demonology, whatever.

2483
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:23,300
Right?

2484
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,980
The Catholics have their own thing or whatever.

2485
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,240
So, okay.

2486
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:29,900
Well, apparently, I mean, we're not that smart,

2487
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,720
but we're not so stupid to not realize

2488
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:38,000
that this type of accurate summoning is irresistible

2489
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,600
to certain spiritual beings.

2490
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,260
Did you ever get that kind of hint?

2491
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:42,980
Yeah.

2492
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,180
It seems to be irresistible.

2493
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,000
Have you ever seen even some Hollywood, they're

2494
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,980
like, when they summon the being, he shows

2495
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:49,960
up and he's like, why did you call

2496
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,140
me?

2497
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:51,760
Right?

2498
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:52,920
I'm here.

2499
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,560
You know, basically that's what I do.

2500
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,980
When I hear this, I come.

2501
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,140
Right?

2502
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,880
He doesn't say, you might say, why did

2503
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,360
you bother me?

2504
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:00,680
Right?

2505
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,400
Alright, I'm here.

2506
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,220
You did it again.

2507
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:04,140
Right?

2508
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:04,560
I'm here.

2509
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,320
What do we do now?

2510
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:07,520
Okay, so in other words, there's a certain

2511
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,220
type of summoning or quote-unquote offering.

2512
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,240
There's a system of sigils, which are, you

2513
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,480
know, geographical things that can be written and

2514
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:15,880
formed.

2515
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:16,880
Right?

2516
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,200
Corporations use them.

2517
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:18,940
Yeah.

2518
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:23,100
That are irresistible to certain spiritual beings.

2519
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,440
And that certain spiritual beings could be billions

2520
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:25,880
of them.

2521
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,640
What kind of crap do you think they

2522
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,880
were fixing on doing?

2523
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:34,260
Because in Babel at the time, when they

2524
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,560
were building this white brick structure, it's not

2525
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,720
this stuff that you see popularized in the

2526
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:38,960
art.

2527
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,100
By the way, do you know the temple

2528
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,160
in Jerusalem was referred to as the Tower

2529
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:44,680
also?

2530
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:48,680
Right.

2531
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:52,460
Anyway, if you go and study, not necessarily

2532
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:55,340
in Scripture, but typically when we're in Jerusalem

2533
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,680
and you see the Tower, it's incredible.

2534
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:56,940
Right?

2535
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,620
The big white limestone.

2536
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,160
So anyway, if you want to know similarly

2537
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,980
what the Tower of Babel looked like, go

2538
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:10,480
look at models of what the Temple in

2539
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,140
Jerusalem, Yahweh, looked like.

2540
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,940
It's not a mystery, what I'm saying.

2541
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,400
Well, it is a secret, I should say.

2542
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,860
But if you can put a couple of

2543
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,940
things together, if you've got at least two

2544
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,960
or three sharpened pencils together, you'll see how

2545
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,480
everything works out very neatly that way.

2546
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,200
But it wasn't to summon the Creator, it

2547
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,540
was to summon a veritable plethora of gods

2548
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,160
within the spiritual society.

2549
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,800
Because it does say that now they're going

2550
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,300
to be doing things that we can't stop

2551
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:39,500
them, they're going to be like us.

2552
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:40,520
Right.

2553
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:40,980
Right?

2554
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,620
It's very simple.

2555
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,340
So simple.

2556
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,340
Just knowledge of it has been lost.

2557
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,060
Okay.

2558
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,940
So, you see, because people have not adjusted

2559
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:02,480
their mindset to this being real, yet.

2560
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
Fixed appointments to this current moon cycle.

2561
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,200
Well, Leviticus, it's very simple, when you look

2562
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:13,280
at the things that are appointed to be

2563
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:18,380
the holidays or days of Yahweh, those cycles,

2564
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,580
the days of the month, are based on

2565
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:21,320
the lunar cycle.

2566
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:21,680
Yes.

2567
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,160
It doesn't have to say that specifically.

2568
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,320
Well, it doesn't say moon.

2569
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,720
Well, it kind of does.

2570
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,640
It's called the Kodash.

2571
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,160
There's various ways of saying it.

2572
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,060
You could go look at parallel cultures at

2573
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:31,560
the time.

2574
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,460
You know, for example, there hasn't been one

2575
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,980
culture on the earth yet where archaeologically they

2576
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:45,680
have not found precision polished observatory quality telescope

2577
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,700
type lenses.

2578
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,380
Every society on the planet, they have found,

2579
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:57,620
archaeologically speaking, ancient relics that depict astronomical viewing

2580
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,760
optic pieces.

2581
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,380
Are you familiar with this?

2582
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:01,880
No.

2583
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,500
They recently just found one, like the Vikings

2584
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,440
had a high-powered, accurate telescope.

2585
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,380
Yes, the Vikings.

2586
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:12,020
Okay.

2587
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,680
Explanation of what the moon, stars, and planets

2588
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,360
actually are.

2589
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,380
That's a whole other discussion.

2590
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:20,900
I don't care to form anything too elaborate

2591
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:25,440
voluntarily on that, other than the stars are

2592
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,320
an interesting thing.

2593
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:29,260
They're a point source counter-spatial light emission,

2594
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,920
meaning that if you don't have resistance, they

2595
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,580
don't appear.

2596
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:34,800
Right?

2597
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,760
Just like a battery, you need resistance in

2598
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,320
a circuit for it to work.

2599
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,000
If you don't have resistance in the circuit,

2600
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,400
either nothing happens or you short the battery.

2601
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:43,720
Right?

2602
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:44,540
Right.

2603
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,820
You ever drop a wrench across the two

2604
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,740
terminals on a car battery and the wrench

2605
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,400
vaporizes, doesn't it?

2606
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,400
Not a good thing to do.

2607
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,840
So you need a certain level and the

2608
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,280
resistance that allows, you know, if there's no

2609
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,300
resistance in a light bulb, it doesn't light

2610
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:58,700
up.

2611
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,100
Right?

2612
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:01,720
That's how it works.

2613
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,960
So you need a resistive element to view

2614
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:04,620
the stars.

2615
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:06,260
Right?

2616
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,860
And the planets are basically globes or spheres,

2617
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,660
and someone wanted to have, about two years

2618
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,200
ago, I put together a list of stuff

2619
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,820
to talk to flat earth people about.

2620
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,480
Then I said to myself, why?

2621
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,040
It's like trying to talk to Christians about

2622
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,480
the Bible.

2623
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:24,240
These people don't need an argument or a

2624
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,780
debate on flat earth or Christianity or anything

2625
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,000
else.

2626
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,160
They need some psychiatric drugs and they need

2627
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,840
a straight jacket and a lollipop.

2628
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:33,940
So I stopped.

2629
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,520
But there's so many things that can be

2630
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,960
discussed on what the planets are.

2631
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,120
They're very, planets are very simple.

2632
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,040
You know, how many times do you hear

2633
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:47,720
inferences of the gods putting things together with

2634
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,020
a high level of efficiency?

2635
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:51,460
We're not going to form a big rock

2636
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:52,760
floating through space.

2637
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,240
It would be like the most intricate clay

2638
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,380
pot you can imagine.

2639
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,520
It's layers.

2640
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,000
Very lightweight.

2641
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,820
You know, even a whale is extremely lightweight

2642
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,700
for its structure.

2643
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,600
If you look at a skeleton of a

2644
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:05,940
whale,
