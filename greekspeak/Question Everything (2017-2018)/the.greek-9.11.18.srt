1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,029
Let's get you in there.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:01,830
Okay.

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,110
Evening folks.

4
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,510
We're live with the Greek greetings and Another

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,870
week.

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,590
Yeah, okay.

7
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,370
It's it's the third week of the seventh

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,490
month for those that don't know actually I

9
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,450
think it's not for those that don't know

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,470
because if you don't know that you Probably

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,690
won't know I mean, yeah, we're talking about

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,150
For those that do know I should say

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,010
it's an affirmation Correct.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,470
Yeah, and it's funny how many people say

15
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,430
they I View it as just part of

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,730
the situation humanity is so many people have

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,330
run into through the years That want to

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,630
do quote-unquote, you know, the father's law

19
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,310
what they call, you know The proper thing

20
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,930
or God's law and they can't get time

21
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,210
to me that shows the the mix-up

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,110
In society, you know, they're censored and it's

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,910
not because I say so and I'll tell

24
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,790
you why If if the world is so

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,930
screwed up that we're not supposed to know

26
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,290
All right, what the right thing to do

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,770
is it wouldn't be available at all Right,

28
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:08,490
right.

29
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,330
So what happens is it's available in such

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,570
a fucked-up way use a medical term,

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,770
correct that Those that really want it.

32
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,630
I mean those that don't Care or censored

33
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,350
are going to see it say.

34
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,530
Oh, yeah, that's not for me But those

35
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,670
that really want it will say oh This

36
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,570
just affirms how screwed up it is and

37
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,150
it affirms that the ones doing the screw

38
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,470
-up know how important it is You know

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,470
also, so it's a game right in a

40
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,930
way a game within the censorship so It's

41
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,530
it's pretty interesting, you know typically People everyone

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,630
will give lip service just like yeah, I

43
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,270
want knowledge I I like but really they

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,290
don't they hate it They hate people with

45
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,010
that pursue those things and again, I always

46
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,230
say how do we know that?

47
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,790
Well, look at your media.

48
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,110
How do they portray people that seek knowledge?

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,750
Oh, they're nerds, right?

50
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,570
You know, they even did movies about that.

51
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,250
Yeah, they would they Stereotypical, right, right Where

52
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,370
where they're trying to create a culture here.

53
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,330
Here's the thing.

54
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,990
I was discussing prejudicial aspects of human culture

55
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,290
recently it's not the Race or the co

56
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,830
or the person being let's say black Puerto

57
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,770
Rican Italian Greek Chinese That's that makes stereotypical

58
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,570
Prejudicing accurate because it is accurate.

59
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,070
Mm-hmm It's the culture they come from

60
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,670
so if you had someone that is of

61
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,450
let's say Italian bloodline for 30 generations and

62
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,030
they're brought up in you know farm-fresh,

63
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,230
Iowa Right from they were born there and

64
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,190
raised there You couldn't tell the difference that

65
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,930
they were Milanese or Bolognese or Sicilian.

66
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,850
Let's say right They wouldn't desire any of

67
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,570
the things they would desire what people from

68
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,050
farm-fresh, Iowa do pork chops really bad

69
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,970
starches Campbell's mushroom, whatever, you know, you know

70
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,750
what I'm talking about?

71
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,970
Yes, they would have you go to their

72
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,870
house They have two big freezers in the

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,830
garage just in case You know They were

74
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,750
you know, they were they talk a certain

75
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,210
way, right?

76
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,590
Okay, so So very now how how it

77
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,410
how easy is it take that farm-fresh,

78
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,830
Iowa?

79
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,350
Italian Italian you would say and make him

80
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,790
act like his project, you know people who

81
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,470
came before him Very difficult impossible.

82
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,930
Yeah, so when you meet someone who is

83
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,150
let's say American black or American or Puerto

84
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,570
Rican or Chinese from those and they hold

85
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,650
on to those Cultural they're raised in a

86
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,890
family that speaks the language and eats the

87
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,710
food and uses those traditions their prejudices that

88
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,770
you have against them and Stereotypes that make

89
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,030
the the prejudice and stereotypes worthwhile and accurate

90
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,870
is not the individual.

91
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,410
It's himself It's the collective that he comes

92
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,870
from An example again would be like if

93
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,530
you ever watched Star Trek the Borg it

94
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,610
didn't matter which Borg it was It was

95
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,090
that you had Borg Because there were a

96
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,730
collective right, right So now the cosmic censorship

97
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,610
transcends that by the way Cosmic censorship doesn't

98
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,149
care about what culture or what stereotype you've

99
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,570
been enlisted in Or you've enlisted yourself and

100
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,890
were born in You see the difference because

101
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,350
it's more divine or cosmic Right.

102
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:29,850
It's straight.

103
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,090
I just want to throw that Yeah stuff

104
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,310
to people and speaking of cosmic.

105
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,110
There is a major cosmic Superimposition on the

106
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,170
planet right now is sort of like on

107
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,270
the western part of the Atlantic Ocean Manifesting

108
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,910
it's or expressing itself as a massive hurricane

109
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,490
about to go into the East Coast.

110
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,210
Let's say that again Sure, there is a

111
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,890
large cosmic imposition Meaning it's an ethereal disturbance

112
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,550
out in space and I mean way out

113
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,410
there about three-quarters of the way to

114
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,490
the moon and it's so happened to have

115
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,810
landed on the Western Atlantic and it's manifesting

116
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,110
itself.

117
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,270
I think hurricane Francisco.

118
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,990
It's expressing itself You know, it's interesting is

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,910
I so there's a lots of people know

120
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,770
I can take that It's something I sound

121
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,490
cocky close your ears If you're not used

122
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,470
to hearing the Greek speak at this point

123
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,670
because it's going to get a little crazy

124
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,650
There are plenty of people that know what

125
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,290
that I can take out that hurricane I'll

126
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,130
have to do is that I have a

127
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,590
hurricane abatement device.

128
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,410
It's about 20 feet long and The reason

129
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,210
you you make it that long is so

130
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,810
you don't have to guess am I really

131
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,630
hitting it, right?

132
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,070
And yes longer bigger is better in some

133
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,650
cases because there is Resonate, you know there

134
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,430
are factors to be considered where size is

135
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,010
important just like in the Newman machine, right?

136
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,930
Like I have lots of windings and stuff

137
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,970
and expresses what?

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,070
The Joseph Newman machine does but it doesn't

139
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,170
do what?

140
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,450
7,000 pounds or 40,000 pounds of

141
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,290
copper does it just doesn't so right and

142
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,790
I've had long Discussions with Trevor on this

143
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,290
and no matter how much we touted what

144
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,270
we were able to do We said well

145
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,290
ultimately, you know when we told stories about

146
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,310
big weather guns, we were all like yeah,

147
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,130
that's there's no replacement for that No, there

148
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,330
isn't so anyway How many people are getting

149
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,450
in touch for me to get rid of

150
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,870
it none none I think steering it around

151
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,990
will be kind of fun in the meantime

152
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,530
It should it should hit the coast with

153
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,550
the cumulative power of about a megaton You

154
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,210
know, it would it could do what a

155
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,730
megaton, you know, a Few hundred Hiroshima's would

156
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,970
do right in terms of damage.

157
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,450
Yeah, it could at a category for So

158
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,770
I think steering it around, you know, it

159
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,510
might be fun, but I'm here's the thing

160
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,390
It's I'll make one for free, but it's

161
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,290
a mil 1.5 million to take it

162
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,470
out.

163
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,030
How's that?

164
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,490
Anyway a fair asking price.

165
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,550
Yeah.

166
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,330
Yeah, if you want hurricanes, I'll make them

167
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,490
all day, but to take them out.

168
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,570
No, it's 1.5 30 grand if you

169
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,750
want to talk about it So and this

170
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,890
if you're like you're doing this for money,

171
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,110
but no, I'll just give it away It

172
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,870
doesn't matter but you got to give something.

173
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,970
No, I can't just sit there, but no

174
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,590
one's even calling So it's interesting That's another

175
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,630
part of the censorship because you know, what

176
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,370
are you gonna do say it's Americans No,

177
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,830
there are plenty of people over the world

178
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,170
You know, it's look prejudices and stereotypes are

179
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,190
super accurate Right.

180
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,930
I mean if you ever listen to American

181
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,730
black people talk about each other You'll be

182
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,150
like this doesn't sound right because it's god

183
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,110
-awful talk Right.

184
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,390
Mm-hmm, right, but you know heaven forbid

185
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,630
you're not black talk about them like that

186
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,870
now you're gonna be you see Yep, so

187
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,670
you're in trouble because you're not entitled.

188
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,370
It's with any group, right?

189
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,050
But once they let you and you can't

190
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,390
actually I can I've Back in the day

191
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,970
had acquaintances that were very black ghetto American

192
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,390
black and I could talk I could say

193
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,930
anything because they know me Or I was

194
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,330
invited in the group the same with other

195
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,110
cultures, but here's the interesting thing cosmic censorship

196
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,750
doesn't work that way No, you never get

197
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,070
a bunch of people getting together say how

198
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,650
come we don't see this even though it's

199
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:11,970
obvious.

200
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,910
What are we gonna do?

201
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,990
They never do it's kind of hidden under

202
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,990
the rung which is why it's cosmic censorship

203
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,810
You know, which goes back to why it's

204
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,430
the third week.

205
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,650
Yeah, the seventh being that that it's that

206
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,550
day a reckoning I guess the folks have

207
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,789
Memorialized oh, yeah, we have all September 11th.

208
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,669
That was last week.

209
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,730
Yes.

210
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,809
It was Awfully I Just couldn't help but

211
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,850
notice when I when I was just scanning

212
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,010
different news articles in the place where they

213
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,190
had everybody Placed the the rubble the people

214
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,210
the dust was in a place called fresh

215
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:59,770
kills Yeah Nobody had in any way shape

216
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,530
or form expressed any outrage at naming that

217
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,210
that Well, it was fresh kills.

218
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,930
It's been fresh kills for a long time,

219
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,590
right?

220
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,690
But I mean if you're gonna Yeah, it's

221
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,770
been fresh kills for 50 years before you

222
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,710
know, I know but they're not gonna Just

223
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,310
wrong They're they're not the people the average

224
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,610
human is you could put him on a

225
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,650
giant anvil with a giant cartoon hammer And

226
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,070
he'll just say well, what are you doing?

227
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,070
Yeah, you know You know, they're so stupid

228
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,410
There's a very small exception in humanity that

229
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,630
will ever see anything at any time in

230
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,970
human history If you don't believe that statement

231
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,830
go read the book of Numbers for example,

232
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,930
actually don't bother but you know what?

233
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,050
I mean, right talk about grumbling and complaining.

234
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,790
I mean that was like the epitome of

235
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,170
it, right?

236
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,470
Oh god Yeah, you know, there's a there's

237
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,990
grumbling in every book.

238
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,790
Well, you know Exodus or whatever but book

239
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,210
of Numbers tops it so you know, I

240
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,890
mean Forget it.

241
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,450
They're finished.

242
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,090
Here's the thing This is this has don't

243
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,790
take it personally.

244
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,730
This is amongst the gods You know, you're

245
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,850
you're basically aligned and oppressed by a national

246
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,490
God, you know I think someone in the

247
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,710
chat earlier put about what do you do

248
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,470
about praying for dinner and silent and I

249
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,990
wrote Well, that's the sinner dinner that he

250
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,750
can't fix that You only get away from

251
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,270
those people, you know 20 years ago.

252
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,370
You might say well You might want to

253
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,170
put an expressive body of knowledge together to

254
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,030
give to Christians.

255
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,150
What's that idiot?

256
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,430
Oh, what's his name?

257
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,230
Martin the guy who wrote 101 questions that

258
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,690
earnest Yeah, yeah that Christians don't know I

259
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,770
mean that kind of stuff you could have

260
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,170
gotten away with and in half of that's

261
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,770
accurate the other half's not by the way

262
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,650
But now is just got to get away

263
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,130
or insulate yourself from them.

264
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,450
You know, there's a guy That I know

265
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,610
here in town and he bought this one

266
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,730
of these McMansions, right, right, but he got

267
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,190
it like half of what it could have

268
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,770
been if it was in a better location

269
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,850
It was at the end of the subdivision

270
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,410
and there's this huge 250 kV power line

271
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,910
going by and I mean like right you

272
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,690
see it's right there.

273
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,930
You could hear it and everything Like what

274
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,330
do you do?

275
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,730
I said, well, you're gonna have to put

276
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,370
up some where you sleep put up some

277
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,970
mirrors on the inside Walls, you know in

278
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,130
the mirror.

279
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,290
You can't tell it's a mirror.

280
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,790
It's facing the parallel You just put it

281
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,490
up against the wall.

282
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,750
You see the back of the mirrors paint

283
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,790
over it Whatever and we had some dowsing

284
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,350
rods and they were spinning around like you

285
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,850
remember those old model airplane propellers He wound

286
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,310
with the rubber band right and you let

287
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,750
it go.

288
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,330
Sure.

289
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,850
You know, it was a pretty fast Propeller,

290
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,010
that's how fast the dowsing rods were spinning.

291
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,150
Holy sweet when I went under it.

292
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,910
Yeah I mean it was like those airplane

293
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,630
propelled there was there was spinning at about

294
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,450
60 about a 60 to 100 rpm I

295
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,270
couldn't stop him.

296
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,790
That's a lot, you know, and he was

297
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,510
like, how do you do that?

298
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,230
Yeah, I see where the field was going

299
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,570
I said this feels drilling down into the

300
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,250
ground about 30 feet and going up about

301
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,350
500 feet and you're within it everyone else

302
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,030
here is within it and If you ever

303
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,470
knew anything, let me know and I'm like,

304
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,190
oh, whatever I'm not gonna mention anybody has

305
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,230
this family has the biggest funeral home business

306
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,190
here in town I'm like, well, you know,

307
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,070
yeah, if I do DD if I do

308
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,050
DD services, I won't be the one calling,

309
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,770
you know anyway So, oh my god, but

310
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,430
the censorship is yeah, that's an interesting thing

311
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,390
So back to the sinner dinner praying at

312
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,530
that any public prayer is absurd Scripturally doesn't

313
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,610
what there's a difference between prayer and calling

314
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,370
out But when you say like the America,

315
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,390
this is the but also Okay, I'm presuming

316
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,490
the person who wrote that is American So

317
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,790
that is mostly an American thing.

318
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,450
See like when When you Okay, how do

319
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,130
we catch this?

320
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,330
For example, I used to do a lot

321
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,510
of these roundtables right back in the day

322
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,890
70 years ago more and when I'd say

323
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,170
something So you denying Jesus?

324
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,230
I'm like, well, where were you born?

325
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,090
I was born in America.

326
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,370
Okay, what you go?

327
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,670
You ever go anywhere else?

328
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,590
You know, how'd you learn?

329
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,030
I learned it here Okay, so you're talking

330
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,170
about the American God and the American Jesus

331
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,450
You know, whatever comment they give you right?

332
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,870
They don't know that There's these people are

333
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,810
you know, they're so far removed and they're

334
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,430
censored so if you're having a conversation in

335
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,270
Greece and Someone you know says what are

336
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,970
you talking about?

337
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,550
That's you know Jesus where as well, where

338
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,790
were you?

339
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,130
But okay, you're talking about the Greek God

340
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,770
So what's there is no when you look

341
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,390
at Christianity?

342
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,430
There is no universal Christian God No matter

343
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,290
how much they say it because you'll notice

344
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,350
it changes from country to country If we

345
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,370
read scripture, we know that gods have been

346
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,730
aligned and issued over certain countries So when

347
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,650
you say God in France, that's the French

348
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,290
God not the American God.

349
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,970
I know this is hard for people to

350
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,530
understand It doesn't matter.

351
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,010
They're not gonna stand much ever anyway, but

352
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,590
it doesn't mean we can't bring it up

353
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,830
as a fact right now Why is it

354
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,250
a fact?

355
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,570
Well, you know because it's stated as such

356
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,130
And I'm just reporting on it as being

357
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,890
a fact, right?

358
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,070
So right There there are many levels to

359
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,290
All this so back to the guy with

360
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,990
this I call it the sinner dinner, you

361
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,330
know, right, right You know because everybody's a

362
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,430
sinner if you're Christian, right?

363
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,230
So, yeah If you have no desires, how

364
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,890
can you sin?

365
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,470
I?

366
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,170
Don't know they ask that a Christian you'll

367
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,810
freak out because he doesn't know what sin

368
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,210
is Because the American God in the American

369
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,950
Jesus doesn't permit that kind of thinking It's

370
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,270
a lot in short Yeah, it's the fool

371
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,710
Analogy Recently, I want to see what Ken

372
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,110
Wheeler was doing that to the fat tattooed

373
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,710
bald guy I think he did a video

374
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,190
what makes a fool and you people aren't

375
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,770
gonna like it what I'm gonna say I'm

376
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,850
like, oh man, it's you gotta listen some

377
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,690
Greek speak if you think you're harsh but

378
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,750
he basically calls everyone a fool pretty much

379
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,270
except for like if you want to know

380
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,850
what how quote-unquote Intelligently activated someone is

381
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,150
socially ask him what books they've read And

382
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,510
most people have never read a book But

383
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,530
you know, but still, you know that lets

384
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,550
you know a lot about you know Good

385
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,050
because the book is not like a movie

386
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,350
you have to sit there I mean it

387
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,690
could be so you could read a book

388
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,450
in two hours But it's a more of

389
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,270
a commitment and usually if you're gonna make

390
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,190
that commitment You're actually moving you're putting more

391
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,690
energy into it than most other things.

392
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,030
So, mm-hmm Yeah Unfortunately, or fortunately, there

393
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,290
aren't too many people go out there calling

394
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,930
everyone morons and idiots or whatever fools It

395
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,450
doesn't matter as long as it's done, you

396
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,770
know, so, you know later on people can

397
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,190
see we were so foolish Yeah, I told

398
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,850
you so as well.

399
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,050
How come nobody said anything?

400
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,870
We were all so stupid Back to the

401
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,770
sinner dinner though.

402
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,450
Yes It's which is easy.

403
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,350
It's not an easy thing because it's the

404
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,150
sinner dinner You know, the sinner dinner is

405
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,330
a typical Christian thing.

406
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,370
There's a movie called founder.

407
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,070
It's about the guy who started McDonald's I

408
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,210
really like that film who's the guy who

409
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,810
was in deedle Michael Keaton?

410
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,730
I think Beetlejuice and all that great, right?

411
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,890
He plays a pretty good Ray Kroc.

412
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,270
They try to stay historically, correct And the

413
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,210
whole thing about McDonald's being the name because

414
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,130
everyone else had a name like burger this

415
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,670
burger that right, right?

416
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,750
Sounds very American authoritative and he wanted to

417
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,470
follow the line He saw a painting of

418
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,810
a family in church doing the Pledge of

419
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,070
Allegiance to the flag in church, which is

420
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,490
perfect I mean they that's their God, right?

421
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,250
They have the Right the Patriot the father

422
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,090
God the Patriot Patricia patristic Aspect to it.

423
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,630
Mm-hmm.

424
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,890
They have the the circus the church They

425
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,790
have the American God there and the American

426
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,730
Savior and the Constitution and you know echoes

427
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,170
all of the deification of being an American

428
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,190
Right, you know, that's their cult their tribe

429
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,670
so When you sit down to do dinner

430
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,770
To stop that the prayer there would have

431
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,030
to lead Understanding why and when you understand

432
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,670
why then that all that other American stuff

433
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,350
falls apart.

434
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,850
I mean It's not even like a house

435
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,290
of cards.

436
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,210
It's like smoke.

437
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,370
You just open the window a little and

438
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,010
it all goes away, right?

439
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,190
And this is a very very dangerous ideology

440
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,089
To those, you know the powers that be

441
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,030
the powers that control the what you call

442
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,569
United States of America or France or Canada

443
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,109
or Mexico?

444
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,910
Now on the other hand if you go

445
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,650
to a country like the most Catholic country,

446
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,510
I would suggest this is an opinion But

447
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,349
actually it's vetted by many If you do

448
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,349
research into Christianity, yes, I actually did research

449
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,030
in Christianity a long time ago And everybody

450
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,550
vetted guess what which country in the world

451
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,210
is the most Christian country in the world?

452
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,130
And I'm and don't it's not Italy or

453
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,630
the Vatican.

454
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,570
That's where you'd think Which is the most

455
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,710
Mexico Yes, that's right.

456
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,910
And they're dangerous.

457
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,610
So they even get a little sauce They

458
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,630
had the War of the Crosses for years.

459
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,210
Yes, you know if Protestant they'll kill you

460
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,910
You know, they'll burn your house or they're

461
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,170
you're not allowed and if you go and

462
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,210
study Mexican Christianity It's all based on like

463
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,510
the de los muertos.

464
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,450
They have these very macabre Or you know

465
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,690
angel of death stuff going on.

466
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,610
Oh, yeah Smattered with yeah, it's really all

467
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,270
that, you know, so that's their version.

468
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,970
So if you said that's the most Catholic

469
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,390
in the world Objectively, no, but they say

470
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,870
it is we branded as such that you

471
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,210
could say that Mexican Catholicism is Very radical.

472
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,050
Yes, because you'll have a French Catholic in

473
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,510
Spain Catholicism is very strong also Italy places

474
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,310
like that, but that is Mexican, you know

475
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,990
for Mexican Catholicism versus you know Or Christianity

476
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,250
versus Italian versus French and the dumbest thing

477
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,610
I've ever heard is Christian say well, that's

478
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,770
Catholic That's not Christian.

479
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,570
Oh, that's not real Christianity Right.

480
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,110
Oh boy, you know this stuff that they

481
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,450
make up with You know hit your cross

482
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,610
Yeah, and there is no cross I've spoken

483
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,470
academics that tend to have lucid moments about

484
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,170
studying scripture and message of and I tell

485
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,470
him there's no crucifixion I give him one

486
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,310
like oh, that's absurd.

487
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,790
Well, I know it's absurd to Sleep on

488
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,010
a park bench and eat out of a

489
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,810
garbage can of course, but you know Find

490
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,750
another way to make a living, you know,

491
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,010
yeah You're not going to make a living

492
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,510
doing what you're doing telling the people That

493
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,870
everything they you know, basically the core beliefs

494
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,910
about the gods and the Christ all that

495
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,270
is false You know, they just skirt around

496
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,010
There was an issue.

497
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,910
It was a very lascivious comment What is

498
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,490
when you skirt around instead of going for

499
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,790
full insertion?

500
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,810
But anyway, they can't do they don't yeah,

501
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,270
they don't know how to yeah, so anyway,

502
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,670
uh Yeah Anything else by the way pulling

503
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:36,950
up?

504
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,490
I don't know we could go different ways

505
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,650
or make it really short We can we

506
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,270
can go however you would wish to make

507
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,070
Greek Hmm.

508
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,430
Let's see.

509
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,410
I was just taking a I have no

510
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,910
desires anymore I have no desires as an

511
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,070
old song was it the public enemy, right?

512
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,370
You got no desires your father was tired

513
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,410
But you know, whatever look enemy number one,

514
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,150
uh, I I I don't know Yeah, go.

515
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,090
I don't want to talk about September 11th.

516
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,670
That's another planet.

517
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,430
I would be interesting And it I would

518
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,830
just just go to Dimitri Kalas of his

519
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:11,990
Exactly.

520
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,890
I'm just I'm surprised that nobody is celebrating

521
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,830
that man on this day, you know Oh,

522
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,050
no Planet of scum scumbags and now it

523
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,910
is You're not gonna to be in it.

524
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,750
That's the rule now there I didn't say

525
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,350
that it's not possible to not be a

526
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,090
scumbag or an asshole on this planet or

527
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,430
an idiot or more Well, it is possible,

528
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,730
but it's very rare To to achieve that

529
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,530
condition or meet anyone who has you know,

530
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,510
right?

531
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,910
Yeah, yeah, it's it's quite interesting Do the

532
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,650
perspective?

533
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,850
Do the meanings of the Greek alphabet letters?

534
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,710
Or letters alpha have the same meanings is

535
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,530
Hebrew No Yes, and no.

536
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,910
Yeah, they all Gematria, yeah, it clicks in

537
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,830
usually after the fourth or fifth letter it

538
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,730
falls apart, right?

539
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,130
alphabet Right.

540
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,150
Mm-hmm.

541
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,570
I'll affect gamma Dalit right a alpha beta

542
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,330
gamma Delta right ABCD and then after that

543
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,050
they kind of start right Changing Yeah, but

544
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,730
what's more important?

545
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,810
What's never being addressed is as a universal

546
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,010
language that all countries had Around what's called

547
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,870
the Bronze Age?

548
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,630
You'll find it if you look up Minoan

549
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,530
rain Language or they they tell you they

550
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,530
can't Translate that you know as several there's

551
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,030
different types of Greek ancient Greek Wow, and

552
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,370
they'll find similar script everywhere in the world

553
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,250
and I mean everywhere Australia Antarctica China Around

554
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,370
that time period and the reason why they

555
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,030
tell you they can't translate it is because

556
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,910
it's forbidden because that will prove without a

557
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,530
doubt that the whole world was under a

558
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,350
single measurement and Literary system around the time

559
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,570
of let's say after the flood.

560
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,330
Oh And before the Tower of Babel Oh

561
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,490
Do that interesting Mm-hmm something else to

562
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:27,790
peek into Mm-hmm It's

563
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,750
alright, I think Greek speak is like something

564
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,390
people like to get off on You said

565
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,670
you wanted to correct a few things about

566
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,670
my parchment that I sent you No, that's

567
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,970
fine, no, no, not really.

568
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,490
Oh, okay.

569
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,710
Okay All right.

570
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,090
Look good.

571
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,230
Everything was fine.

572
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,150
Okay, we were just talking about signing the

573
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,610
signing.

574
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,030
Yes.

575
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,710
Yes That's not your signature.

576
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,450
The reason you you know, if someone says

577
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,330
would you like to eat some human feces

578
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,310
you say yes or no?

579
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,130
That's up to you But the typical answer

580
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,770
is no, right?

581
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,550
Why didn't you say?

582
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,730
Yes, because I'm not approving of that, right,

583
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,770
right So if someone produces a Legal document

584
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,290
that's totally self and you know, it's just

585
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,570
an unconscionable thing.

586
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,990
Why would you sign it?

587
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,310
What race would you write white on it?

588
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,490
Yeah, but you don't but you remember these

589
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,650
people The people that you're dealing with are

590
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,750
like robots Right, right.

591
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,350
It's the God see them as that, you

592
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,530
know In other words, how much compassion would

593
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,950
you have for taking a robot and crushing

594
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,850
him into his bare?

595
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,110
Basic material and throwing him into a pile

596
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,490
Nothing, right very little Compassion for that most

597
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:42,730
foot.

598
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,070
Yes.

599
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,110
That's how people are.

600
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,770
That's how they're being viewed cosmically So that's

601
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,970
what's being sent to you when you start

602
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,010
getting up more into the satanic realm, which

603
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,690
is the attorneys and the administrators They're more

604
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,190
on the the Satanist aspect, you know, which

605
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,630
is like we know what's right, but it

606
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,290
has nothing to do with you So shut

607
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,130
up, right?

608
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,410
But I would admit it Yeah, still you

609
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,170
still it's still void what they're doing is

610
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,750
still void.

611
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,870
Yeah And if you go up to those

612
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,950
that control the entire system that don't make

613
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,690
themselves known They will always always also lie

614
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,910
and hide what they're doing because it's unconscionable

615
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,730
and you void it with them all the

616
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,190
way through You know, do you want to

617
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,250
you see so everything is pretty much should

618
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,750
be voided on its face Now for it

619
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,010
now, she shouldn't be like if you're gonna

620
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,970
deal with a Living being that is honorable

621
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,310
because there is nothing honorable in any of

622
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,290
the controlling situations whether it's medical legal Governmental

623
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,930
religious none of them are honorable.

624
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,130
None of them for sure It might seem

625
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,610
so because that's part of the idea, you

626
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,530
know And they never have been and never

627
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,630
will be that's that's the beauty of the

628
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,870
reality of Seeing the simplicity of things, you

629
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,130
know How simple it is, you know that

630
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,090
and that those are the rules the exceptions

631
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,850
are few And exceptions are show so few

632
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,610
that not being well-versed in the exception

633
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,210
is no fault, you know, you won't Like

634
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,570
in other words if you're looking for a

635
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,270
decent honorable human or man or woman And

636
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,410
you don't know what decent and honorable is

637
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,830
don't worry about it Because even if you

638
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,510
did know you the chances of meeting them

639
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,530
is very rare you see right, so the

640
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,950
The aspect if you're dealing with a decent

641
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,690
horrible human you can get into an agreement

642
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,130
that's written as well, but you do it

643
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,650
Honorably, right, right, but these people are not

644
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:40,990
herbal.

645
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,190
They never have been it doesn't matter whether

646
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,110
it's communist Russia American capitalism or democracy or

647
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,270
Republic whichever one they wake up in the

648
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,510
morning tell you it is today or some

649
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,090
African tribe You know, they're not honorable either,

650
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,110
you know, you know if you go down

651
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,310
there if they see you're a foreigner They

652
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,250
send someone out, you know, like you have

653
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,970
to give us money before you come here,

654
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,690
you know, right?

655
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,550
To take pictures or whatever, you know And

656
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,350
it's not even it's not even that it's

657
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,410
like they know you're you're scumbag So we're

658
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,910
dealing with scumbags and they tell you they're

659
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,050
at least they're honest in the way.

660
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,930
They'll say this is how we deal with

661
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,490
you Because you've always been known to be

662
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,070
like this it doesn't mean they'll chew they

663
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,050
won't change their ways later It's like once

664
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,870
they get to know you.

665
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,270
Mm-hmm, but it's a rotten system.

666
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,290
It's always been rotten This is nothing new

667
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,310
That's why a lot of these patriotic morons

668
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,490
in any country like oh we have to

669
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,950
go back go back to what you have

670
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,290
no knowledge of history There's nothing to go

671
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,430
back to there's no you can't show me

672
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,510
an exemplary model of human society at all

673
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,430
It's because it's a continuation process, you know

674
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,890
how people say the creation, okay Did it

675
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,190
happen?

676
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,530
Yes.

677
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,250
Is it happening?

678
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,570
Yes.

679
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,510
Is it going to keep happening?

680
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,790
Yes, it's it's an ongoing process.

681
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,230
What do you mean?

682
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,310
Creationist or evolutionist that either way you go

683
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,510
there.

684
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,130
It's a continual process.

685
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,770
You know what I mean?

686
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,110
Mm-hmm Yeah, so So until this process

687
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,610
continues further a lot of the things that

688
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,970
I bring up we're not going to come

689
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,010
to fruition It has to be far down

690
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,830
the line more You know in terms of

691
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,110
human nature whether you're dealing commercially or legally

692
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,610
or lawfully And by the way lawfulness is

693
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,790
off the table That that is a people

694
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,830
think that legal is law and it's not

695
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,190
right.

696
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,070
That's the law of the subject It's and

697
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,730
legal is based on policy If you research

698
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,810
what's called a sovereign state the definite the

699
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,630
academic definition is three things One is it

700
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,870
has absolute complete control over whatever territory it

701
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,550
states that it's a sovereign state over The

702
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,510
second thing is to maintain order and the

703
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,610
third thing is to provide services Nowhere in

704
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,510
there doesn't say you can vote or elect

705
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,630
or what type it doesn't matter if it's

706
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,390
communist socialist Now some people say well, I

707
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,250
like America because it's capitalist that came from

708
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,030
a communist country.

709
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,590
No, it's the same exact system It's just

710
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,910
that it's both legal systems.

711
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,810
You just didn't like the policies over there

712
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,590
But America is not any more lawful or

713
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,210
less lawful than where you came from.

714
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,810
It's the same.

715
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,890
It's not lawfully based It's just that the

716
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,550
people that happen to be running it that

717
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,710
everyone agrees with is not what you like

718
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,730
the way you want to live You see

719
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,530
presented different Right, it's the same thing.

720
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:40,830
Mm-hmm And it's the same with all

721
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,390
the religions they have to be in accord

722
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,490
with with you know How you how you're

723
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,970
going to maintain order and provide services for

724
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:49,430
the people?

725
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,570
These are not things to be debated These

726
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,490
are things not even things to be looked

727
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,630
at with great depth either because the deeper

728
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,430
you look You know the human instinct as

729
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,990
you want to Commune about it or console

730
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,410
about it.

731
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,470
There's no one to talk to about these

732
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,070
things, right?

733
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,050
You could talk at people about it.

734
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,210
They'll stand there.

735
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:15,470
Yeah.

736
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,750
Yeah, whatever it's you know, they'll try to

737
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,190
discount it or ignore it or want to

738
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,570
change the subject but and Discussing and delving

739
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,510
into the matters of the state of humanity

740
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,990
is not fruitful in many ways because there's

741
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,070
nothing you can do to change It the

742
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,890
best you could do is insulate yourself.

743
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,270
Just like the guy who lived by the

744
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,650
power lines Right, he is planning on moving

745
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,610
but I said, what do you play?

746
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,910
Well, I don't I don't see it So,

747
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,410
you know in 10, you know 10 years,

748
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,430
he still might be there Let's say maybe

749
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,870
right if things are within the order that's

750
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,830
acceptable for people still live in houses by

751
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,990
then.

752
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,050
But but I would suggest that Any any

753
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,770
condition you insulate yourself from it doesn't mean

754
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,330
removing yourself or like a diver goes into

755
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,030
the water He insulates, you know, the neoprene

756
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,290
right the suit insulates you from the water

757
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,090
and all that, right, right so There's nowhere

758
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,890
to go now anyway, there hasn't been for

759
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,250
a long time, you know moving around different

760
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,390
locations, right?

761
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,450
Other than just maybe being in a constant

762
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,970
state of movement is another possible Bring, you

763
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,470
know, he's always traveling in RVs and things,

764
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,110
you know, maybe maybe I don't see that

765
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,050
as being viable but Because the problems are

766
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,450
spiritual and cosmic Just like this Hurricane that's

767
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,930
coming to the Atlantic right now.

768
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,410
That is not a hurricane people looking at

769
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,450
the wind and all this others that's a

770
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,110
imposition of a of a vortex in space

771
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,690
on the earth It goes up very very

772
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,090
high and it it changes geometric form.

773
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,670
It kind of looks like tulips You know

774
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,730
like so if you go beyond if you

775
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,510
look at the hurricane right now It looks

776
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,410
like a tulip and put in profile right

777
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,670
gets wide in the middle narrow at the

778
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,290
top narrow at the bottom Right, then we

779
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:00,990
go up to the atmosphere.

780
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,790
There's nothing there but beyond the atmosphere again

781
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,130
It appears this massive field and you could

782
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,850
you know years ago NASA had infrared imagery

783
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,770
of the sky and all that and you

784
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,970
could see it when it was a hurricane

785
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,130
They try to shoot down those visible light

786
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,890
But when they use infrared or ultraviolet you

787
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,930
see this big storm over the storm out

788
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,650
in space Wow Yeah, and this is not

789
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,570
that you know, it's like none of your

790
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,710
business because I can't explain it Oh, it's

791
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,510
probably something along with the lens, right?

792
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:35,370
right so So congratulations you guys on the

793
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,950
East Coast Tomorrow maybe you'll steer it around

794
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,110
depending how I feel I Don't they see

795
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,290
when they say it's going to go north

796
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,650
you just bring it south, right?

797
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,050
Right, and then when they say it's going

798
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,310
south and you bring it another way speed

799
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,830
it up slow it down make it stop

800
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,310
Yeah, make them a little crazy.

801
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,590
But unfortunately, this is downwind of me.

802
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,990
In other words, it's east So it's on

803
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,670
on the it's upwind of the flow downwind

804
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,030
of the flow and it's difficult to control

805
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,370
without It's quite an elaborate operation.

806
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,610
I have to aim West To start manipulating

807
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,170
the jet streams that are behind me But

808
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,650
I have to manipulate them and block them

809
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,930
in the way that I don't diminish them

810
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,710
too much So then they flare up later

811
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,310
and then they interfere with the hurricane.

812
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,550
So it's very it's kind of cocky We

813
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,610
could get into it very basically the flows

814
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,110
of northern Hemisphere go from west to east

815
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,050
so this hurricane has ramped off just like

816
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,430
that almost looks like a The equator being

817
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,450
a highway and you have an exit ramp

818
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,950
that goes off the highway That's what this

819
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,530
hurricane looks like it did because this hurricane,

820
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,150
you know The equator goes from east to

821
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,270
west and it takes this exit ramp off,

822
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,650
right?

823
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,310
Right, and it's but still moving east to

824
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,390
west against the flow So simply aiming and

825
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,050
doing certain basic one-on-one protocols is

826
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,310
not going to do much of an effect

827
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,510
On it.

828
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,950
Actually the easiest thing to do is to

829
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,170
beef it up That's really easy.

830
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,430
You could to bring that up to a

831
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,050
category 5 by the way Pop a link

832
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,130
into the channel.

833
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,870
I have a rather interesting website reader that

834
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,630
I like using.

835
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,990
Oh good so They're saying it'll make landfall

836
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,650
the next few days right now The jet

837
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,510
streams that are haven't even come to the

838
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,270
west coast of America are making their ways

839
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,330
across And they're going to either contribute or

840
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,930
diminish Right.

841
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,150
So those need to be addressed You know

842
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,690
before they get there and then the hurricane

843
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,470
itself needs to be addressed from below Which

844
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,110
if we were to start messing with it,

845
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,490
there'd probably be earthquakes in places like, Georgia

846
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,930
and Oklahoma Because we have to go through

847
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,530
the earth That will excite the ether the

848
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,330
earth, you know I think we've described there

849
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,510
vaguely indirectly that you can make the ground

850
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,310
shake with the same Equipment you use to

851
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,570
affect the weather the So we can make

852
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,250
the ground shake and Divert this thing around

853
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,070
or make it go away or whatever for

854
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,310
what?

855
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,889
You know when you've done this over a

856
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:10,330
hundred times and you know, what's going you

857
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,469
know, and you know The F it has

858
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,830
an efficacy rate of 90% Success, you

859
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,790
don't do it anymore.

860
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,409
You know, it's just like you're a retired

861
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,409
NFL you retired NBA now, you know You

862
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,889
don't play, you know, you don't need to

863
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,810
do it anymore, right?

864
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,489
You can move on to the stick Yeah,

865
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,150
I put that on Rams lighter Satellite in

866
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,190
there, which is a rather nice satellite.

867
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,389
I gotta say Yeah Okay, good.

868
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,750
Yeah, they've changed it around unisys has been

869
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,409
changed.

870
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,310
Mm-hmm Expressed and all this those have

871
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,690
been changed Less information harder to harder to

872
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,409
manipulate in terms of you know vantage points

873
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,730
and cycles, you know I mean, I was

874
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,870
gonna dig around in there.

875
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,710
That's for sure And they've changed the way

876
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,310
the maps look also the proportions.

877
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,090
Yes country had looked different now.

878
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,440
Mm-hmm But I see what you mean

879
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,580
about your your steering oh I haven't done

880
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,660
anything and I'm probably not There's no reason

881
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,640
to study it they're actually if it's not

882
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,660
tamp with If it's not tamper with it's

883
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,440
gonna do what the forecasters say.

884
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,160
They're pretty accurate, right?

885
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,100
Based on their materialistic sense.

886
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,820
Mm-hmm, you know, it's based on you

887
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,160
know statistics what it's things have done before

888
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
they you know Ensemble models, but if I

889
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,140
start messing with it, they're gonna say we

890
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,020
don't know what way hurricanes do this, you

891
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,460
know But you know and when it gets

892
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,740
real extremely just ignore it, you know, yeah

893
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm tempted to play around with it You

894
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,260
know But here's the thing Years ago working

895
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,660
with someone they introduced some people to us

896
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,960
as could we explain weather work this and

897
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,040
you know If we explain it to them,

898
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,160
they're too anxious Right, and all they're gonna

899
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,160
do is create weather disasters Mm-hmm not

900
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
to mention his name by you know, Harry,

901
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,680
but anyway, right so All they do now

902
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,720
is create disasters ever since these guys came

903
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,080
online.

904
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
All you hear about is India Monsoons and

905
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Japan this and this is just really bad

906
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,560
disasters when I was just doing it was

907
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,580
just a few people There was no bad

908
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,320
weather for like five years or like where'd

909
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,520
all the hurricanes go or when they'd appear?

910
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,360
It's like they disappear.

911
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,380
Like how did that happen?

912
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:29,480
Mm-hmm No Mm-hmm You guys are

913
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,760
you're on your own now But here's the

914
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,060
other the reason I brought up the guys

915
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,460
messing up the weather now as also many

916
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,880
other groups are You know with even more

917
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,520
power behind them would which are not that

918
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,480
smart But you know the easiest thing to

919
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,680
do let's say I started tinkering around with

920
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,320
it right right now The first thing you

921
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,740
notice if it's a cat for it's gonna

922
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,620
go to a cat five.

923
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,840
It'll just get inflamed It's kind of like,

924
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,880
you know, you've got a sore on your

925
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,000
knee and someone starts examining it You know

926
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,660
after you've settled in on the pain, they're

927
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,640
like, ah, that really hurts.

928
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,500
You just get worse.

929
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,180
Yeah Yeah, so you have a little excitement

930
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,220
Yeah, anything anyone does well, actually most of

931
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,500
the people that think they know what they're

932
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,100
doing don't know fortunately or unfortunately Either way

933
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,780
actually if they knew what they were doing

934
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,560
They'd stop and want to learn a little

935
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,040
bit more before they did what they were

936
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,960
doing But my point here is that If

937
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,140
yeah, it's very here's the point an amateur

938
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,700
weather person actually the one who understands how

939
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,760
the ether works is going to be very

940
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,680
disappointed if initially without guidance because let's say

941
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,560
they have the intent of Diminishing that hurricane

942
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,100
they won't it's going to just flare it

943
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,360
up.

944
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,580
It doesn't mean all is lost Even if

945
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,140
I start playing with it now, it'll probably

946
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,920
flare up to a higher category for a

947
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,460
short time Mm-hmm.

948
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,940
That's just what the it's just what it

949
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,180
does.

950
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,000
Anything does that, you know go poke around

951
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,440
on a living thing What does it do?

952
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,960
It moves more, right?

953
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,060
So Yeah, but the way to take this

954
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,700
out is very simple start manipulating all the

955
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,200
fields and the way of a Jet streams

956
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,820
that are not even across the u.s

957
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,520
But get them out of the way, so

958
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,500
you don't have any interference You got to

959
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,420
go deep underground below the hurricane which is

960
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,240
going to shake anything in line That where

961
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
you're shooting and also you have to go

962
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,380
at the hurricane and above it In line

963
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,340
below in line above it, but when you

964
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,520
go when you aim at the hurricane do

965
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,540
not aim at the center That's not what

966
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,500
defines a hurricane The definition of a hurricane

967
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,880
are basically the rotating arms Right, so what

968
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,660
you want to do is diminish one of

969
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
the rotating arms and it goes off balance

970
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,120
and it just becomes a storm So the

971
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,740
eye will still be there, but it won't

972
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,400
act this one Actually a long years ago.

973
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,920
I knew someone in New Orleans and they

974
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,660
were starting to evacuate Cheverstown or someplace, you

975
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,100
know, it's like outside of New Orleans.

976
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,560
Mm-hmm, and there was a in the

977
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,920
National Guard came in ready to tell 25

978
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,280
,000 people to evacuate and Person got in

979
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,400
touch.

980
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,860
We could do something about that and I

981
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,500
said sure well, we totally cleared it out

982
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,840
and The eye was still visible.

983
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,600
It was sunny weather not no wind no

984
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,120
clouds But the eye was still visible in

985
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,160
infrared because that's like the the counter space

986
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,840
part, right?

987
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,140
But there was no storm.

988
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,460
There was no wind So most the amateurs

989
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,780
would go for the eye They go, but

990
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,080
if you take out one of the arms

991
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,600
of the hurricane, it could no longer be

992
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,500
defined as a hurricane, right?

993
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,640
So that's what you do you aim for

994
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,580
that and then once you take out one

995
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,620
of the arms Actually, you just take out

996
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,560
about half or 30% of it It

997
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,680
starts to fall apart very quickly loses symmetry

998
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,280
Kind of like if you took out a

999
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,740
big chunk of your car wheel, right?

1000
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,100
It'll lose symmetry very quickly the whole tire

1001
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,700
peels off right and actually that's what happens

1002
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,000
when you take off one of the arms

1003
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,280
You'll see a radical spreading out of the

1004
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,800
other arm.

1005
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,840
It loses its concentrated geometric form It spreads

1006
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,820
out really over a large area and then

1007
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,260
you just go after that as a regular

1008
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,020
storm You just take pieces out of it

1009
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,080
You know and then you put a block

1010
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,720
over the area that you want to protect

1011
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,680
and then the people, you know Are told

1012
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,960
evacuating they go out the next day.

1013
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,400
There's not a cloud in the sky, you

1014
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,200
know, you know what happened?

1015
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,000
And then the weather engineer the weather Meteorologist

1016
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,600
say well, we need a better computer model,

1017
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:35,120
you know Yeah, so I I Mean, you

1018
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,300
know, there's this technicalities like to do a

1019
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,120
weather op like that Which is more than

1020
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,620
4,000 miles away or 5,000 kilometers

1021
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,200
away would take at least a few hours

1022
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,860
of planning half a day of assembling Various

1023
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,600
sets of tubes and grounding devices and then

1024
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,360
you have to man it for about 30

1025
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,860
hours.

1026
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,940
I mean constantly Constantly adjusting.

1027
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,920
Yeah.

1028
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,160
Yeah So yeah It's exciting.

1029
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,460
I mean you could hear I'm talking about

1030
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:03,960
it like it.

1031
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,700
I just want to do it, right?

1032
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

1033
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,800
No for what?

1034
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,680
No, you know They're ridiculous they could have

1035
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,260
their sinner dinners instead But nonetheless I'm gonna

1036
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,240
make this turn off the AC and Make

1037
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,000
a cup of coffee and go into the

1038
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,820
office or if there's anything else Haven't had

1039
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,080
much on the emails.

1040
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,960
I have to check that again just This

1041
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,200
week.

1042
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,400
I've had a four-hour conversation with a

1043
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,160
surgeon 30 years surgery And we was all

1044
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,540
technical stuff regarding.

1045
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,600
Well, not all technical mostly regarding Procedures and

1046
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,200
cases and mm-hmm things like that in

1047
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,440
the in the surgeon was admitting that yes

1048
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,860
now I see When I consider the vacuum

1049
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,360
Like for example if part of the head

1050
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,680
is removed You know the skull to get

1051
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,060
into the brain Mm-hmm And if you

1052
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,360
don't put the material back the skull back

1053
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,380
because you're due to possible infection simply at

1054
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,140
times that they don't do it You'll see

1055
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,480
a tremendous amount of suction Forming and that's

1056
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,780
how you know, it's healing right, you know

1057
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,100
various devices now that are talking about creating

1058
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,560
suction also the ineptitude of the administration Person

1059
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,180
also admitted very heavily On what we've discussed

1060
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,320
maybe loosely on the new order of barbarians

1061
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,620
1968 the medical system you changed like what

1062
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,200
they call Obamacare a lot of doctors don't

1063
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,040
want to practice anymore that that was already

1064
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Just a new order of barbarians where he

1065
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,720
talks about how doctors will behave.

1066
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,340
That was a plan back then Right, basically

1067
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,760
picking them technicians and you know decreasing services

1068
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,820
because they want you dead basically, you know

1069
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,180
This is another thing I haven't really gone

1070
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,300
I've been looking at it but the a

1071
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,980
1 number 1 a 1 priority of any

1072
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,240
government a Sovereign state in the world right

1073
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,960
now military is how to get a condition

1074
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,200
where the military it kills its own people

1075
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,360
You know, you want to put that whatever

1076
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,740
phrase you want you heard?

1077
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,800
So in other words the American government's number

1078
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,140
1 a 1 priority is how are they

1079
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,840
going to create an environment where the?

1080
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,980
American military can start killing Americans the same

1081
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,660
for Canada the same for French the same

1082
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,860
for Iraq the same for Russia all of

1083
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,740
them Because the the owners of the countries

1084
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,840
that's what they want They want to start

1085
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,880
eliminating the populations of the earth It doesn't

1086
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,040
matter if it's with food water military, you

1087
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,920
know military is the best and easiest because

1088
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,660
you can control it Now the interesting thing

1089
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,040
is it has to be simultaneous if American

1090
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,780
military was convinced and they agreed start killing

1091
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,000
Americans Well, the people in Canada might say

1092
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,100
oh Why aren't we doing anything about it?

1093
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
Let's go help them.

1094
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,660
Right, right So, you know or right so

1095
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,620
and they could they could try to keep

1096
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,460
it secret or whatever But it'll get out

1097
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,480
and it might cause friction.

1098
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,600
So you have to have all the countries

1099
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,580
doing it at the same time Right.

1100
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,280
So, you know like the Iraqi military started

1101
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,260
eliminating all the Iraqis You know, so what's

1102
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,940
going on here, you know, they they pulled

1103
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,960
off something very similar to that in Libya

1104
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,020
But they couldn't really keep it going, you

1105
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,640
know, don't believe anything in Libya Libya was

1106
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,020
complete farce what's been put out there?

1107
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,920
That was that country was on the up

1108
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,580
and up and it was destroyed by NATO

1109
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,200
the national was it the North Atlantic terrorist

1110
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,740
organization?

1111
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,100
So I'm not speaking out against any sovereign

1112
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,980
state United States Canada Iraq or this is

1113
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,580
just they have no They have no say

1114
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,140
in what I'm telling you, this is what

1115
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,320
the their owners are Doing it's kind of

1116
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,920
like something.

1117
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:45,800
Yes.

1118
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm saying this Cadillac, you know ended up

1119
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,620
in the lake It's not because the Cadillac

1120
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,220
wanted it.

1121
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,200
It's the guy who was driving it drove

1122
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,780
it into the lake, right?

1123
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,480
Right, you look far doesn't you know, the

1124
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,680
the government and the the apparatus administration is

1125
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,560
the app is just that it has no

1126
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,960
say You know, it's the owners of the

1127
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,860
of the apparatus that have to say and

1128
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,280
there's number one Priority is to do what

1129
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,880
I just mentioned by the way, and but

1130
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,800
they that they understand they're not stupid They

1131
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,140
understand it has to be done on a

1132
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,360
simultaneous fashion at least within a region Like

1133
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,300
they could probably successfully get the Canadian military

1134
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,120
to kill Canadians American military to kill Americans

1135
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,160
Mexican Military to kill Mexicans all the way

1136
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,740
down the south this whole hemisphere.

1137
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,260
They could probably get away with that Right

1138
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,380
because where are they gonna run to right

1139
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,820
and also they contain it, you know Europe

1140
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,480
they could probably get away with it.

1141
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,920
Also, maybe Yeah, but because remember Europe is

1142
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,880
really Western Asia when you think about it.

1143
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,520
What it's Northwestern Asia Mm-hmm.

1144
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,300
So Asia's, you know the center of the

1145
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,680
world, you know, you got East West North

1146
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,780
South Asia right in Africa, right?

1147
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,260
You could probably get away with it on

1148
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,860
the what's called the African continent.

1149
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,140
So this is what I'm say probably So,

1150
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,660
you know look out for these things.

1151
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,760
This is the the agenda, you know, that's

1152
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,480
the number one a one priority on the

1153
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,060
list So when you start looking at, you

1154
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,480
know, there is no money they talk about

1155
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,440
economy They don't know anything about health to

1156
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,860
talk about diseases So, you know, I mean

1157
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,700
this is that's that's all stuff to keep

1158
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,020
you busy and by time.

1159
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,160
Well, you know I'm sorry about you know,

1160
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,140
what's scary about day is Everything that they've

1161
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,460
mentioned way back then has been put into

1162
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,640
place and it's been going smoothly Very well,

1163
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,680
I think I'm a little behind.

1164
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,000
I think if you listen to the Areas,

1165
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,900
yes about 20 years behind slow.

1166
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,820
Mm-hmm Yeah, intentionally, I would think yeah,

1167
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,320
but here's the ultimately the gods Yes, well

1168
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
most 95% of the earth's population be

1169
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,400
wiped out very violently.

1170
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,700
Absolutely without a doubt positively Yes, take that

1171
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,820
to the bank if you don't know that

1172
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,600
You're stupid But who is it if you're

1173
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,560
okay, so that's done Don't even think about

1174
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,100
it because that's that's gonna come like the

1175
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,720
Sun's gonna rise tomorrow The thing to think

1176
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,960
about is this really is that mankind the

1177
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,440
people that are behind the scenes that really

1178
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,880
want this are Not going to get the

1179
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,740
satisfaction The gods are gonna do it That's

1180
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,620
all that's all that taught that that topic

1181
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,040
is closed, you know, I mean, mm-hmm

1182
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:35,540
Yeah, mm-hmm And

1183
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,940
if the gods are gonna do it and

1184
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,220
you have no control I don't think it's

1185
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,120
a morbid or negative topic You know Right.

1186
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,460
I mean remember these are these are the

1187
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,160
guys that made the whales and the birds

1188
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,800
and the cheetahs and the roaches and the

1189
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,660
planet it's your Sentiment feeling emotion desires are

1190
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,800
out of the are irrelevant So It's it's

1191
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,480
not to be viewed as a bad thing

1192
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,200
because there's at that point it's transcended good

1193
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,300
and bad And if you really want to

1194
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,260
get into the touchy-feely aspects of why

1195
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,860
it's gonna happen Is it you know, like

1196
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,620
it's not deserved possibly hell.

1197
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,920
No, it's fully deserved.

1198
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,400
It's completely deserved and that's obvious so And

1199
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,800
if you don't think it's deserved, you're not

1200
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,980
paying any attention All right, so dy I

1201
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,960
got a bunch of emails here Starting early.

1202
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,380
Okay.

1203
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,160
Let's see.

1204
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,820
I Just comments.

Yeah, okay much out just the basic stuff

1206
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,900
that you learn about when you're on the

1207
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,320
internet, but Yeah, I'm not gonna read some

1208
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,120
of this pretty I thought I was lascivious

1209
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,380
this pretty little serious but okay I wouldn't

1210
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,760
say there's much there other than the stuff

1211
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,380
I brought up.

1212
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,480
Mm-hmm.

1213
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,740
I See, okay Anything else?

I just answered to custodian Hey, I put

1216
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,660
up a biggie mix that I did a

1217
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,240
while back.

1218
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:09,920
Oh, yeah.

1219

Yeah, great.

1220
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
I call it So it's a beat thing.

1221
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,040
I think it's better than the music that

1222
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,580
they use Yeah, and I brought up, you

1223
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,020
know the Christians, you know, they have this

1224
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,120
fake morality You ever you ever been around

1225
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,960
them and say hell?

1226
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, you just said oh, that's a bad

1227
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,680
word Yeah, I mean while you know, they're

1228
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,440
involved in the most abominable stuff, you know

1229
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,060
Spiritually you can imagine.

1230
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:32,900
Mm-hmm.

1231
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,260
Now.

1232
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,940
Here's the thing that people don't realize They

1233
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,420
haven't studied but I'll break it to you

1234
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,200
Okay, when you read about headhunting societies or

1235
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,680
you know The Canaanites or the Giants or

1236
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,660
you know, anyway, they did these horrendous things,

1237
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,980
you know Like sex with animals and then,

1238
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,920
you know while they were killing the animal

1239
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,960
or eating killing children You know with Moloch

1240
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,580
or Murdoch or all these things, you know

1241
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,200
when they were doing all these things Marduk,

1242
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,300
you know In Babylonian societies you read about

1243
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,320
all the you know, like don't do this

1244
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,700
like they did, you know Like they eat

1245
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,820
their children don't offer them in the fire,

1246
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,960
you know all this stuff Do you think

1247
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,140
that this was viewed as a horror film?

1248
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,460
It was viewed as the most pleasant thing.

1249
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,980
It was a wonderful thing You can do

1250
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,000
You know, it's the same thing like you

1251
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,760
go down the street and And you see

1252
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,060
people Oh Christmas, isn't it beautiful when they

1253
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,260
were offering children and doing cannibalism?

1254
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,440
Isn't that beautiful?

1255
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,760
You see great.

1256
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,420
It was not a nightmarish scenario Now obviously

1257
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,340
just like we were started off discussing certain

1258
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,900
prejudicial Stereotypes that are accurate because of the

1259
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,880
culture It did look if because you're let's

1260
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,660
say coming from this century or this culture

1261
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,180
what you are used to If you were

1262
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,300
to see it, it would be probably nightmarish

1263
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,420
to you Right, right, it would be very

1264
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,180
unpleasant to most people today Right, but you

1265
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,740
know, you know, but to the people there

1266
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,540
it was very pleasant.

1267
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:03,820
Now.

1268
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,040
Here's the other aspect of it What what

1269
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,560
makes it worse now is that it's all

1270
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,800
been changed to be modified so it is

1271
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,260
pleasant You're still doing it the intent of

1272
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,180
those things the cannibalism the child sacrifice So

1273
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,280
but it's it's you know, the birthday party

1274
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,500
the Christmas the church all these things are

1275
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,620
Modified to your cultural liking your cultural acceptance

1276
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,140
It's the same stuff and it's done in

1277
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,840
parody You may not go to church and

1278
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,720
see that it has to do with an

1279
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,960
offering to ball or whatever Because you don't

1280
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,080
you're not aware of the fine points of

1281
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,680
the birthday celebration or the dolls Or you

1282
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,500
know Lord, you know all this other stuff.

1283
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,480
They they yeah, so it's a parody Which

1284
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,440
in many cases is much worse Because if

1285
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,400
you ask the people that were doing the

1286
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,600
real thing, oh openly, what are you doing?

1287
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,160
They can give you a pretty succinct Accurate

1288
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,380
clear description and explanation, but now if you

1289
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,760
ask someone why do you do a birthday

1290
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,060
party?

1291
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,060
Why do you go to church?

1292
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,780
They don't know everything that comes out of

1293
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,600
the mouse is false.

1294
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,540
It's just you know, the opposite of what

1295
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,740
they think So that's why it's much easier

1296
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,220
to continue it now because right now the

1297
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,560
way the situation goes with what humans celebrate

1298
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,860
You won't find a contrasting Culture to let's

1299
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,840
say counter it or battle it or show

1300
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,720
a contrast Because no matter what culture you

1301
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,900
have on the earth and say, oh, look

1302
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,040
how happy and pleasant it is Look, the

1303
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
child is being taken care of.

1304
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,980
Look how wonderful these things are Aesthetically see

1305
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,060
even back then Even though within the Canaanite

1306
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,320
culture certain cultures when they did human sacrifice

1307
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,060
openly and it was pleasant to them You

1308
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,400
see it was possible to have a contrasting

1309
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,620
culture come in and say this is horrible

1310
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,960
And they're not going to change this either

1311
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,360
you change or you got to go and

1312
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,580
they obviously chose the latter, right?

1313
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,100
So but now because of the homogenous there

1314
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,760
is very little Contrast to it, you know

1315
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,760
Which is actually yeah.

1316
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:21,130
Yeah global It's alright screw Mm-hmm Ain't

1317
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,070
much a much here man.

1318
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,210
You were chosen if you're born here.

1319
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,950
Let's say you're alive on the earth right

1320
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,430
now Just make the best of it every

1321
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,810
day every minute or whatever, but don't get

1322
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:35,210
involved in anything That's too altruistic because it's

1323
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,770
just gonna fall flat on your face Altruism

1324
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,650
means, you know make the world a better

1325
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,430
place how to make things better and a

1326
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,570
general sense, you know.

1327
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:49,050
Mm-hmm Ain't gonna happen Now Of course

1328
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,450
You're going to be given the visage of

1329
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,290
it happening, you know the image or the

1330
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,870
idea Which is part of the new order

1331
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,310
in the Middle East, you know when that

1332
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,870
starts coming together Oh, yeah, you'll be promised

1333
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,510
all this stuff and it'll come to a

1334
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,110
certain degree.

1335
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,910
Yeah, you'll all you'll all buy it So

1336
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,890
but that that doesn't mean that it's that

1337
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,850
it's more than skin-deep other than When

1338
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,930
it comes down to the application of law

1339
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,230
Obviously if you study you will see that

1340
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:24,230
There is a I would say a revival

1341
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,530
but an application of biblical law throughout the

1342
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,870
entire planet at that time So and it's

1343
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,070
going to be used in a very harsh

1344
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:31,430
way.

1345
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,470
Yeah, that's just how the things are done

1346
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,240
So it on the part of the side

1347
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,040
of the world that matters, which is the

1348
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,720
Northern Hemisphere The it's fall going into winter

1349
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,300
so this is a breaking down time So

1350
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,140
we finished a growing season see what's being

1351
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,780
harvested One of the things that an email

1352
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,420
I was going down a list last week

1353
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,480
and sort of a tirade Before we got

1354
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,360
cut off on the internet, right?

1355
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,840
What's going on where it's quiet.

1356
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,500
I think I remember what was one of

1357
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,340
the questions Well, that's where the real stuff

1358
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:07,560
is.

1359
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,320
You've heard me say where it's really quiet

1360
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,760
So, you know you can actually divide one's

1361
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,400
perception So one's perception would be everything you

1362
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,100
could see here in terms of this kind

1363
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,460
of information Immediately you divide your perception.

1364
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,280
Where is it noisy?

1365
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,600
Okay, what's noisy?

1366
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,640
Right.

1367
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,000
Well here let's say Syria Iraq, you know,

1368
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,840
Russia America.

1369
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,940
That's okay But you put all the noisy

1370
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,300
stuff aside now You see all the things

1371
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,420
that you can perceive where there's no talk

1372
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,320
about and that's where the real stuff is

1373
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,400
happening you see So now there's more to

1374
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,680
investigate right because usually the stuff that's noisy

1375
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,360
is poignant and small and limited but the

1376
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,380
stuff that is Quiet is much more vast

1377
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:52,840
and open.

1378
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,660
Okay, so then the efficiency aspect comes in.

1379
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,740
What do you know about what's quiet?

1380
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,500
And that's how you begin to study All

1381
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,360
right, so let's say there's let's say take

1382
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,500
grab something there's no discussion about pandemics and

1383
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
the medical industry right now All right.

1384
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,580
No one's really crying Obamacare.

1385
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,100
No one's crying pandemic.

1386
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,500
Really?

1387
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,920
No one's correct Okay So now's a good

1388
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,940
time to start assessing what is the medical

1389
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,980
community up to?

1390
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,940
Because they're do they're up to some bad

1391
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,680
shit right now if there's nothing in the

1392
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,720
news Right there what they're doing now, you'll

1393
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,240
see later, you know the project Right.

1394
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,180
Okay So, let's say you see the petrochemical

1395
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,340
industry what's going and then is no no,

1396
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
okay, that means that they're working on shit

1397
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,080
They're up to some bad shit and you're

1398
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,820
gonna see it later.

1399
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,160
You see how it works.

1400
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,740
Mm-hmm So, where is it really quiet,

1401
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:51,380
you know Hmm It doesn't have to be

1402
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:51,740
industry.

1403
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,020
It could be cultural also, right?

1404
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,700
Alright, you know like for example in America,

1405
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,660
there's like the race thing that's been going

1406
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,020
on for a past decade or less So

1407
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,080
right now American blacks are you know, not

1408
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,840
in the news, right?

1409
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,580
Well, guess what?

1410
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,640
They're getting ready to do something By springtime,

1411
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,120
you'll see the American black issue again, right

1412
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,000
or something Right.

1413
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,120
Yeah, all these things in basically you divide

1414
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,620
your perception It's very simple humans are not

1415
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:30,240
that complicated they're quite stupid And they're and

1416
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,720
whatever they involved in their institutions their culture

1417
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,860
their society Their authoritative figures their their scientists

1418
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,540
their leaders.

1419
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,020
I mean, they're they're not from other planets

1420
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,400
They come from themselves.

1421
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,420
And then of course you have the background

1422
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,660
leadership, right?

1423
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,380
Right the owners the people have been pulling

1424
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,560
the oligarchs Let's say people have been pulling

1425
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,420
the course of events through the gods, by

1426
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,220
the way for thousands of years, those are

1427
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,420
the ones that are you know working the

1428
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,320
the The human aspect of the power base,

1429
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,120
but essentially the the main power base is

1430
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,100
the residing presiding gods over each nation That's

1431
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,500
the main power base and then you have

1432
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,540
of course Interactions and things going on on

1433
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,060
their side and those that they influence See

1434
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,960
in order to get a military to do

1435
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,380
something You don't have to go to each

1436
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,960
soldier.

1437
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,280
All you need to do is go to

1438
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,000
the general and have him give the command

1439
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,240
Yeah, so the oligarchs ruling that are the

1440
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,880
owners of what you call the states and

1441
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,140
all that of various governments and various countries

1442
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,440
The gods influence them Then they influence their

1443
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,820
puppets which are the president's Kings ministers and

1444
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,280
all that.

1445
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,100
Yeah, right And then they gets to you.

1446
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,130
It's very simple and Of course, there was

1447
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,330
a change thousands of years ago if not

1448
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,890
less You could see anyone who studies history

1449
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:05,530
Will see the Nepal Napoleonic Wars were profound

1450
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,430
change in world The way things are done

1451
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,230
in the world in terms of you know,

1452
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:15,470
bureaucracy administrative government all that Napoleonic Wars changed

1453
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:19,130
everything where no more If we want to

1454
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,250
rule shit, we're not coming forward anymore.

1455
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,950
We're gonna stay in the back Right now

1456
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,870
we know who they're their financial people are

1457
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,830
the Rothschild's the Morgans the Rockefellers the Zeeves

1458
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,870
The Sipes, you know, we know the Habsburgs

1459
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,670
we know those there we know who their

1460
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:38,450
financial people are We don't know who their

1461
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,250
spiritual people are You know one can say

1462
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:44,050
this comes like before like Freemasons or Illuminati.

1463
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,870
Yeah, I don't know if you know any

1464
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,690
Freemasons They're not very smart You know, there

1465
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,470
might be some smart people in Freemasonry.

1466
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,770
But what do you see Freemasonry?

1467
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,750
They're just as dumb as everyone else at

1468
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,270
this point.

1469
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,990
That's just what's put out for public consumption

1470
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,210
Illuminati and Freemasons Yes, that is a gateway

1471
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,590
Into that realm, but we don't know who

1472
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,610
the priesthood is We know who again with

1473
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:08,290
our economic brokers are the Rothschild's Rockefellers and

1474
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,270
all that Morgans on and on and on

1475
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,630
we know they're brought we we don't know

1476
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,850
who their priesthood is We don't really know

1477
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:18,030
their techno who their technology, you know implementers

1478
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,810
are which should be you know, the technology

1479
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,870
people We don't know them either and they're

1480
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,790
we can kind of verse Yeah, you can

1481
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,870
kind of guess military industrial complex, you know

1482
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,750
DARPA No big military contractors, but yeah on

1483
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,730
the surface again for public consumption You know,

1484
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,910
it's easy to see the food people the

1485
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,370
food who they put in front of measure

1486
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,170
that the DuPont Monsanto, right?

1487
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,410
Sure, Daniel Midlands is another one, right?

1488
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,670
So those are names that people know in

1489
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:53,690
the Midwest really well So Yeah, it's just

1490
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,510
a conglomerate of each industry has its own

1491
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:01,050
setting of Power base, but remember if it's

1492
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:04,750
if it's visible, it's for public consumption You

1493
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,950
know, it's not it's usually not true Just

1494
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,070
like they call September 11th How many people

1495
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,570
are like well, you know, here's the thing

1496
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,050
at least it's on a Tuesday this year

1497
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,810
It took about 17 years to make it

1498
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,550
back to a Tuesday.

1499
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,750
Yeah, what happened on a Tuesday before what

1500
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,010
a bunch of morons Someone I saw a

1501

comment one saying.

1502
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,190
Oh, yeah All those comments about 9-11

1503
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,270
is crass to the 3,000 people that

1504
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:25,490
died.

1505
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,630
I'm like what a moron It's kind of

1506
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,790

01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:41,790
head out your ass Anyway It kind of

1511
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,290
reminds me of the comments that I've seen.

1512
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,770
Oh this Greek guy He makes comments about

1513
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,870
older people wait till he gets older and

1514
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,870
someone right he is older.

01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,250
He's in his 50s, right?

1516
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,150
Oh, you know and I was like, oh,

people you just demonstrated it All you do

1519
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,590
is cry and bitch and nothing to say

1520
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,230
It's crazy.

1521
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,890
Yeah, in other words, you're gonna see the

1522
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,450
demonstration of stupidity You know someone needs to

1523
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,720
get together that these sites do exist a

1524
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:16,950
an atomic nuclear atomic nuclear whatever Website facts,

1525
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,730
you know where you start out with Madame

1526
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,630
Curie Madame Curie and you move all the

1527
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,830
way down the line show Manhattan downtown Manhattan

1528
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:27,990
show, you know the bombing in Beirut show,

1529
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,690
you know as being nuclear, you know show

1530
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,270
Bali bombing show You know all the bombings

1531
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,850
all over the world that many notes show

1532
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,310
the different sizes, you know You could sort

1533
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,490
of the czar bomb which is what three

1534
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,130
megaton in Russia and show all the nuclear

1535
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,090
tests underground You know, here's a good example

1536
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,770
for September 11 You know people look at

1537
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,630
the spikes or squiffs or whatever.

1538
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:49,670
They call them shooting out of the building

1539
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:53,810
windows Okay, if you go to any underground

1540
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,930
go to YouTube and put in underground atomic

1541
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,030
bomb or underground nuclear explosion and they'll show

1542
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,250
them to you and Once you get to

1543
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,830
zero time at ground zero You see the

1544
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,690
earth sink down and you see lots of

1545
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,830
little puffs of clouds everywhere on the surface

1546
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,530
Now if you weren't showing anyone that that

1547
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,630
if you weren't telling anyone you just showed

1548
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,830
someone a shot of that What do you

1549
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,650
see I say, oh I see lots of

1550
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,970
explosives going off on the surface wrong That's

1551
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,130
one Explosion going on underground and it's showing

1552
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,870
up as many little plumes and clouds on

1553
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,710
the street You see you get the picture

1554
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,130
looks like a head of Brock spread out

1555
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:34,870
Great, right?

1556
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,630
Yeah, it doesn't look like one mushroom got

1557
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,050
so people don't it's all those scripts and

1558
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,330
things that you see There's a couple of

1559
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,470
good 9-11 videos on the sidewalk when

1560
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,210
the buildings are coming down There's a manhole

1561
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,750
cover that blasts up and a jet stream

1562
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,250
goes up about 10-15 stories of like

1563
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:54,230
just as incredibly super hot Super gaseous, you

1564
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,690
know cesium gas whatever radioactive for molten stone

1565
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,310
shoot up out of the ground in places

1566
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,590
around You know the Federal Reserve building and

1567
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,870
other buildings that are about a half a

1568
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:10,230
mile south Let's see north or southeast the

1569
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,250
World Trade Center their foundations cracked The stones

1570
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,710
that they used in those buildings all prior

1571
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:19,750
Prior to the buildings coming down there used

1572
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,930
to be some articles on the internet about

1573
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,490
that and how they had to repair the

1574
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,650
downtown Wall Street area foundations that were cracked

1575
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:31,350
and they all cracked before The buildings fell

1576
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,070
down from the actual expansion of the granite

1577
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,910
You know, which is deep underground, right?

1578
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,210
And that's all been covered You know I

1579
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,250
remember five six years ago before 2011 seeing

1580
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,630
that the concern I forgot the name of

1581
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,570
the construction company did the restoration on the

1582
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:47,130
building They had to do what's called epoxy

1583
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,670
consolidation You know where you actually, you know

1584
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,310
put an epoxy in the crack but it

1585
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,610
has to be you know able to expand

1586
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:57,050
strong enough to hold the stone together like

1587
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,750
stone would but also Expanding contract without separating.

1588
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,930
So that was the article and it was

1589
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,570
led me to oh Yeah on September 11

1590
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,810
and it turns out that everything those buildings

1591
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:10,730
that did have damaged it happened prior to

1592
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,690
the buildings collapsing So, you know if you

1593
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:15,030
only had a window of 10 seconds, but

1594
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:20,060
right on the rice So anyway, who are

1595
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,600
you gonna go to?

1596
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,560
I mean, this is like basic stuff.

1597
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,160
You know, this is nothing regarding theory or

1598
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,680
opinion or Whatever.

1599
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,520
Mm-hmm snap this planet Earth man.

1600
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,520
I was out in public yesterday and some

1601
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,000
guy was complaining I said chill man.

1602
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,620
It's planet Earth.

1603
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,420
He started laughing.

1604
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,000
He says yeah, he kind of got it

1605
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,080
But he went back to shit right away,

1606
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:47,860
you know All right, I don't know if

1607
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,980
there's anything else I don't see nothing here

1608
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,120
Greek no Anything else we need to bring

1609
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,480
up or I mean usually Sonic unless or

1610
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,460
something, you know, right I but Personally at

1611
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,060
this moment don't Yeah, that's fine.

1612
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,120
Keep our personal stuff personal right either way.

1613
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,020
Sure Yeah, I think these Sonics are just

1614
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,860
I think it's good to do them every

1615
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,420
week if possible You know repetition and wrote

1616
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,660
There's lots of stuff to talk about I

1617
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,360
mean there's stuff to get into and then

1618
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,480
you know It has to do with perspective

1619
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,200
mindset and you know, are you using your

1620
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:27,880
faculties?

1621
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,700
You know, are you blind is your mind

1622
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,360
blinded or is it just your eyes that

1623
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,040
are blinded?

1624
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,120
Right, right?

1625
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,860
so The getting over the mental paralysis, you

1626
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:47,110
know the emotional paralysis You know So yeah,

1627
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,470
that's simple.

1628
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,250
You know that it's basically The Greek speak

1629
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,890
stuff is like a form of therapy You

1630
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,510
know to get you moving like someone who's

1631
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,470
a paraplegic who hasn't moved their limbs.

1632
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,010
They get sores, right?

1633
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,730
So if you just you just got to

1634
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,070
move even though you can't move them on

1635
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,350
your own at least they're being moved, you

1636
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:11,130
know mm-hmm, so It'll work out oh

1637
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,890
Yeah, it's gonna be great later on post

1638
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,070
-resurrection Unfortunately, most people you know, you're gonna

1639
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,790
have to be killed first before you realize

1640
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:18,070
it.

1641
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,690
Mm-hmm You know, even those that are

1642
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,630
for example considered the elect and are chosen

1643
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,330
And nowhere does it say that their behavior

1644
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,110
deems them to be so they're chosen to

1645
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,650
be that Right, so it's not meritorious Right

1646
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,730
in some cases it is meritorious.

1647
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,950
There is something that still needs to be

1648
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:36,390
looked at.

1649
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:39,550
You know the 144,000 But it doesn't

1650
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,250
seem itself.

1651
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:44,190
It doesn't deem strictly meritorium They're chosen and

1652
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,290
it says that they haven't defiled themselves with

1653
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,190
women as their virgins that I don't think

1654
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,070
that's an accurate translation I think when you're

1655
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:55,010
chosen To be part of the elect it

1656
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,190
doesn't seem to be meritorious because we remember

1657
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,670
Nebuchadnezzar was chosen, you know, he's here's a

1658
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,370
guy that you know, a piece, you know,

1659
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:04,010
I'm presuming, you know Because this is what

1660
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:09,590
their thing was so It's gonna be interesting.

1661
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,790
But even if you're part of the elect

1662
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,330
you still have to be killed first you'll

1663
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,729
be experiencing the resurrection instantly, you know be

1664
01:08:15,729 --> 01:08:17,670
standing around picking your nose or whatever and

1665
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:21,430
You'll be killed and resurrected instantly and you

1666
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,170
know, so you still in other words, there's

1667
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,970
no passage to Truth righteousness knowledge or what

1668
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,649
they call the Christians call holiness or all

1669
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,510
that in this life You have to be

1670
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,310
snuffed out and brought back to achieve that

1671
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,830
so It's quite interesting concept there.

1672
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,050
So anyone who tries to achieve that on

1673
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:45,890
that celestial or cosmic level?

1674
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,609
I assure you you won't you know, the

1675
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,750
New Agers or you know, they talk about

1676
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,090
their ascended masters and all that crap You'll

1677
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,350
as a demons, you know All right, the

1678
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,490
Gnostics also, you know, it's a various old

1679
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:03,630
demonology So, you know again, we brought up

1680
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:07,050
the Freemasons if you look into demonology whether

1681
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:10,630
it's you know, the public consumption stuff that's

1682
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:13,250
put out by the Crowley's or the The

1683
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,990
the more cloaked stuff that the Gnostics put

1684
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,770
out or whatever, you know on and on

1685
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,970
a lot of the Eastern demonology You know

1686
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:22,170
that on the surface it could be branded

1687
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:23,710
as such people say, oh, that's bad, right?

1688
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,109
Oh, it is, you know, like a harsh,

1689
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:27,529
but when you actually investigate it, it's try

1690
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:30,130
it fills one's minds with pleasantries, right?

1691
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,550
It goes on and on and on about

1692
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,890
you know Those that partake are endowed with

1693
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:37,510
special, you know purpose and power and it

1694
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,770
goes on, you know So even the most

1695
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:44,450
manipulative malevolent spirit will present works To its

1696
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,470
victims or its its subjects that are pleasant

1697
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,609
to the victims or the subjects, you know,

1698
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:50,029
right?

1699
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,330
I'm not talking It's beyond the calling card

1700
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:58,230
the content Delivers, let's say the sentiment and

1701
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,650
emotion and feeling to those involved that they're

1702
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:04,510
doing the right thing Right, you know, for

1703
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,870
example, you'll never find a religious cult Christianity

1704
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:10,610
Judaism on and on and on Buddhism that

1705
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,350
their followers don't think they're not doing the

1706
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,090
right thing go run into like with these

1707
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,490
you ever see The real furry Jews in

1708
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:17,070
New York or in Jerusalem.

1709
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,630
I'm furry Jews, you know, the Hasidim, right?

1710
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,370
How ridiculous is that?

1711
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,690
You know, I mean, but nonetheless if you

1712
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,350
go deal with them on a personal level

1713
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,730
I mean the personal meaning on it on

1714
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,330
their faith base.

1715
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,330
They really think they're doing the right thing,

1716
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:30,970
right?

1717
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:35,550
Right Freemasons in the Memphis rites of Mitzrayim,

1718
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,270
which is probably one of the darkest deepest

1719
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,810
They probably engage in more human sacrifice than

1720
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:40,630
the other Freemasons.

1721
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:43,230
They think they're doing the right thing, you

1722
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,790
know Mm-hmm.

1723
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,430
You see what I mean, right?

1724
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,430
So if everyone thinks they're doing the right

1725
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,090
thing and they're all contrasting who's doing the

1726
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,090
right thing Oh, they all can't be doing

1727
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:52,810
the right thing.

1728
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:55,610
Yeah, you know all say so contrasting you

1729
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:00,330
see so It so anyway, yeah, this is

1730
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:03,310
this is part of the human again, I

1731
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,770
have a Someone that I've known have moved

1732
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,730
up to the Mount Shasta.

1733
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,030
He's Runs a I don't want get into

1734
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:11,510
what he does He's business quite successfully in

1735
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:13,810
the New Age stuff and him and someone

1736
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,150
else a few weeks ago similar New Agey

1737
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:17,690
They all say the same thing.

1738
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,130
Oh, well you do love will fix that

1739
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:21,370
love is like oh shit You don't even

1740
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,250
know what love is.

1741
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:25,190
Oh boy that now we're talking snake oil

1742
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:28,650
stuff, you know So don't buy into that

1743
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,030
by the way They again you ever see

1744
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,590
the Jack fresco love is bullshit the way

1745
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,930
most people find love I think I've been

1746
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,810
talking about it before I discovered fresco, but

1747
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:41,530
What people call love is something that accommodates

1748
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,230
them or something that fulfills their requirements or

1749
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:47,170
needs Once that stops doing that they no

1750
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,950
longer love it right like ask a wedding

1751
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:49,830
couple on their night.

1752
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,350
Are you in love?

1753
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,170
Yes, ask them the same thing on their

1754
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:56,330
divorce No, because they're no longer meeting each

1755
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,090
other's needs that's not what love is at

1756
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,710
all Love is doing the right thing even

1757
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,870
if it inconveniences you See, they don't know

1758
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,310
and they never will it's too late by

1759
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,870
the way on a social cultural level for

1760
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:16,270
people to acquire wholesome righteous things It doesn't

1761
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,990
mean that they won't be made aware of

1762
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:21,390
them in the near future So they admit

1763
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,810
that this is right, but doesn't mean they're

1764
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:23,690
gonna do it, right?

1765
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:27,050
All right Because otherwise you can't take them

1766
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,090
out lawfully, right?

1767
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,050
Correct.

1768
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:29,730
Correct.

1769
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,070
Yeah, the gods will cannot take out a

1770
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:35,030
society without them being aware why they're taking

1771
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,470
it Whether they agree with or not, they

1772
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,230
have to acknowledge This is why they're being

1773
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,030
you know, just like what they read the

1774
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,910
rights to someone you're being arrested for this

1775
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:44,870
or even on a firing Squad, they'll read

1776
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,590
you again while they're shooting you, you know

1777
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,450
all over again Mm-hmm.

1778
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:58,100
So there you go and Again I want

1779
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,360
to I don't want to stress this but

1780
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,740
let me just bring this up in closing.

1781
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,980
It's the seventh month folks right, I Don't

1782
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:05,580
know should I say it again?

1783
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,620
It's the seventh month.

1784
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,240
Right?

1785
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,960
Does that mean that what it means to

1786
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,300
you?

1787
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,020
Because that's irrelevant.

1788
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,100
What does it really mean?

1789
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,400
Can you objectify?

1790
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,420
what harvest in gathering the end of The

1791
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,620
year by the way, this past year is

1792
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,580
marked now not when it started right?

1793
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,700
It's marked the end.

1794
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:25,960
Mm-hmm, right?

1795
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,960
Just like when you're pumping gas You know

1796
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,600
how much you don't know how much gas

1797
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,880
you put it in until you put you

1798
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,520
the pump shuts off and you retract the

1799
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,660
Nozzle, right, right?

1800
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,640
Otherwise, you'll just be flapping your lips at

1801
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,200
five gallon six gallon seven gap Well, why

1802
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,720
don't you just when you pull the nozzle

1803
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,480
out, you know, there's no more pumping of

1804
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,480
gas Now you could look at the meter

1805
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,620
and say well I put in 16.2

1806
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,420
gallons done So what the seventh month comes

1807
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,000
you're done with the year, right?

1808
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:59,460
So So, what does that mean not what

1809
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,940
you think it means or whether you care

1810
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:04,160
find out what Harvest time means what in

1811
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,600
gathering means or the end of the year?

1812
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,840
What does that really mean the pagans got

1813
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,700
their own rituals, but it still ties in

1814
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,200
they make resolutions, don't they?

1815
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:18,640
Mm-hmm, you know stuff So, yes, they

1816
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,060
do breaking down time And if nothing much

1817
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,100
is breaking down, it just means that it's

1818
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:31,660
it's not noisy So, we'll see Mm-hmm

1819
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,500
still got and remember these periods are ongoing

1820
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,760
So for example when the harvest comes the

1821
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,520
seventh month in the breaking down the in

1822
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,340
gathering seasonally It doesn't mean that it happens

1823
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,160
within that season it that breaking down period

1824
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,980
starts and it keeps going through winter, which

1825
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:53,240
is like Typically a time period that's set

1826
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,720
for doing things that you can't do during

1827
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,240
the other seasons or what shouldn't do Right,

1828
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,380
and it might even go into the springtime

1829
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,660
and carry over so they constantly overlap like

1830
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,780
fish scales You know or they you see

1831
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,300
so even though this is a breaking down

1832
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,660
period It still culminates with the building up

1833
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,540
period that passed this spring Which culminates also,

1834
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,660
you know at with the the previous years

1835
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,980
breaking down period so these periods It's like

1836
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,800
a sinusoidal, you know, it's still have that

1837
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,160
zero the the line that goes through the

1838
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,940
how do you determine frequency?

1839
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,240
It doesn't matter how far down line you

1840
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:30,600
go.

1841
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,100
You still see how it's operating.

1842
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:41,890
So right Yeah, there's a resonance Right and

1843
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:43,670
it moves backwards too, right?

1844
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,080
All right.

1845
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,760
Yes, I don't see much else Got quite

1846
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,420
about six or seven emails just basic questions.

1847
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,560
I think I've brought up most of this

1848
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:08,800
stuff before they're basically just comments So That'll

1849
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,000
be it for now, okay, and Yeah so

1850
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,860
until and if they make if they by

1851
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,540
the way, if you look at the Mockumentaries

1852
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,880
or whatever they're doing because it is September.

1853
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,180
I'll just remember doctors killed 3,000 people

1854
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,740
yesterday They killed 3,000 today and they're

1855
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,200
gonna kill 3,000 tomorrow So that kind

1856
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,380
of makes what they're they always by the

1857
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:35,080
way memorialize it canonized their victims So you

1858
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,140
want to fall for whatever?

1859
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:40,820
National holiday you do what you find fit

1860
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:44,460
What you've seen pleasing also, but to me

1861
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,080
it's not pleasing at all.

1862
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,660
No, the hypocrisy is yeah Okay, I mean

1863
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,020
Okay, great.

1864
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:53,320
Yeah.

1865
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,620
Well, thank you very much.

1866
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,560
Thanks.

1867

Okay.
