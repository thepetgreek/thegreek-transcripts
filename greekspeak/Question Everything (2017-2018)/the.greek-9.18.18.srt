1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,560
And greetings everyone, this is Live with the

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Greek, and I think you've got a phone

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,740
call.

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,760
Yeah, it sounds like it, right?

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,140
Yeah, that's the old-fashioned sound there, I

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,600
like that.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah, yeah, well it's a small flip phone,

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm still not using anything like a miniature

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,940
television, you know, anything that looks like a

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,820
mini TV or anything.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,000
And in the beginning I felt like I

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,700
was resisting it, now I'm glad I don't

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,120
have it.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,900
Personally, I like that everyone else around me

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,140
has it, you know, like if I'm out

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,180
doing commerce, people are very gracious usually.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,620
Let's say I'm out in the field and

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,940
I need, let's say I want to scan

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,040
a barcode and see what, you know, or

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,420
something.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,040
I say, can you scan that for me?

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,540
And Tommy goes, oh sure, I'll do it

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,400
for you, you know.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,380
Yeah, I'll do it, sure.

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,760
Yeah, they're accommodating.

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,360
Yeah, they are, yeah, they're good.

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
They're bipedal cattle, they're fine.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,700
So I noticed the world's been in mediocrity

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,120
lately.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,580
Not too many false flags or stuff to

31
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,580
keep things exciting.

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,680
I noticed that there's not much going on,

33
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,080
seemingly.

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,800
Yeah, the flooding down south, and we just

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,980
got dealt with a good batch of some

36
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,080
rain, which brought the whole city into a

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,780
rather frenzy of some sort in their media.

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,160
It was quite interesting.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,320
I was wondering about the subtle changes and

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,400
that kind of stuff, when you mentioned that

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,580
before, especially with that video, that was something.

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Oh, that heifer?

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
Oh, my, my, my.

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
It sounds respectful.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,100
Actually, it's about as respectful as you could

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,700
get for humans.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,480
They're just fools.

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,360
And what happens is, you know, you could

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,600
look at the animal or the creature, the

51
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,960
being, from creation on, the design and all

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
that, and you see how it's being used,

53
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,640
or how it performs, and it's just pathetic.

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,780
I mean, it's the deplorable humankind.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,940
And here's the irony of it, you know.

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,720
It's kind of like this old man who

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,560
rescued a cat, but he yelled at the

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,220
guy, and he's like, you know, I hate

59
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,740
people, not animals, you know.

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,600
Right.

61
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,440
Just because you tell it like it is

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,880
doesn't mean that you don't like the thing

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,980
that you're telling about.

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,440
But you can have hate for the way

65
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,000
that it is.

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,820
Years ago, I had a pretty fancy exotic

67
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,160
car.

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm not going to say what it is

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,740
or whatever, but it's the kind of car

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,180
that people mention when they're bragging.

71
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,500
And I hated it because it didn't function

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,440
correctly, and I noticed it was a prank,

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,520
you know.

74
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,020
To make a long story short, kind of

75
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,760
like certain high-end, finicky, esoteric equipment, regardless

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,160
if it's audio equipment, cars, tools, you know,

77
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,020
things like that, things that get on the

78
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,360
fringe.

79
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,460
You know, that's why, you know, for example,

80
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,340
is a Maserati a good value?

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,980
No.

82
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,840
It's not a good value.

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Right.

84
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,000
I just said I wasn't going to mention

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,200
names.

86
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,240
But here on the other hand, is a

87
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,580
Bugatti Veyron that's two million bucks a good

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,920
value?

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,820
Yes, it is.

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,220
It is a good value at two million.

91
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,080
Why?

92
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,080
Because it goes from zero to 60 miles

93
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,220
per hour back to zero in less than

94
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,960
five seconds.

95
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,020
Ouch.

96
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,340
I was telling this to someone.

97
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
And they're like, that's not a big deal.

98
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,200
I said, you're not listening to me.

99
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,020
It goes from zero to 60 back to

100
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,200
zero in five seconds.

101
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,360
Not zero to 60.

102
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,780
Zero to 60.

103
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,680
See, everyone thinks how fast something goes makes

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,120
it good.

105
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:52,940
No.

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
In reality, the real engineering mind is more

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
curious in how it stops.

108
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,360
Right.

109
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,300
You know, back in the days in the

110
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,720
70s, we were souping up like the Z

111
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,460
Camaros and the even Ford Falcons with the

112
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,240
straight six.

113
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,860
Yeah.

114
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,800
We put in a truck engine, right?

115
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
We didn't have to cast iron head.

116
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,220
You couldn't close the hood, you know.

117
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,579
And they were really fast.

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,839
And they had that, you know, leaf spring

119
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,600
suspension all around with the first, you know,

120
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,520
struts in the front.

121
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,640
It had, you know, the shocks in the

122
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:23,800
front.

123
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,120
Right.

124
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,520
The coils and the truck suspension.

125
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,400
Garbage.

126
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,840
And the thing is, I noticed after playing

127
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,120
around with cars, I was, you know, my

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,580
early teens, that I got a little tired

129
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,300
of the go.

130
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,280
I was more curious in the stop because

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
we had a lot of run-ins where

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,500
we couldn't really safely, you know, just barely

133
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,060
by the skin of our teeth made it

134
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,160
because we couldn't stop.

135
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,920
Barely stop.

136
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,520
Holy smokes.

137
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,900
So the thing is, how fast can you

138
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,140
stop and how safely and comfortably can you

139
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,760
stop is more important than the go.

140
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,080
The go doesn't mean nothing if you can't

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,580
stop her.

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,580
Or control it, yeah.

143
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,540
Right, right.

144
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,920
Right.

145
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,380
So with that said, it's exactly what the

146
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,680
topic of any conversation can be.

147
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,760
To what end?

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,660
How do you get to the end that

149
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,040
it's going to come to?

150
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,820
And the subtle stuff, it's all subtle.

151
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,760
Here's the thing.

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,300
You know, we just had a little conversation

153
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,360
about Christians before.

154
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,020
Right.

155
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,060
The thing that people don't realize, regardless if

156
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,380
it's, I think most people listening might have

157
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,520
heard of Dmitriy Kozov.

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,700
He recently did some videos on state religions,

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,220
basically saying the same thing.

160
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,320
If you've ever heard any Greek speak from

161
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,680
10 years ago, I'm saying like, well, if

162
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
you read the Koran, it tells you to

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,260
do the laws of Moses, right?

164
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,080
Right.

165
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,920
It's very clear.

166
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,360
There's 10 places, 10 references, maybe 15 to

167
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,660
Moses.

168
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,840
And all this says, it's not a, you

169
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,760
know, what people think.

170
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,820
It's a post, I don't know what you'd

171
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,700
call it, post-Christian era document.

172
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,120
But to make a point with all this

173
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,600
stuff is that anyone studying anything truthfully or

174
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,560
objectively, no matter who you are, where you

175
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,740
are, when you are, you always come to

176
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,680
the same conclusions.

177
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,260
Right.

178
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,560
And what people will not be able to

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,180
conclude is because anything, is because they don't

180
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,580
study.

181
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,700
They're stuck in trends.

182
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,840
What they do is they eliminate the ability

183
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,000
that their faculties grant them.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,160
You know, like your faculties would be your

185
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,020
perception, your touch, smell, sight, hearing, sound.

186
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,880
But they don't know what to do with

187
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,420
the impulses, right?

188
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,240
Or they don't know how to control it.

189
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,900
One example would be, I, in the past,

190
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,440
and even currently speak to people that are

191
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,240
into Greek speak.

192
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,440
And when someone asks them to explain what

193
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm talking about, they have no authentic dialogue.

194
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,260
They just repeat what I say.

195
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,040
Right.

196
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,700
It's no different than, you know, the people

197
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,320
in public.

198
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,020
You know, what's going on?

199
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,280
Well, they just repeat what they heard on

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,900
Fox News.

201
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,320
There's no authentic dialogue.

202
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,520
It's lacking.

203
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,900
So, to what end is very simple.

204
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,040
Like, all of the religions, again, are state

205
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,500
religions.

206
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,420
In other words, they're promoted by the state,

207
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,900
meaning they're permitted to exist by the state

208
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,240
because it makes people docile and compliant to

209
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,140
the state, which is a complex apparatus.

210
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,100
But it's simplified as, you know, commercial apparatus,

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,460
right?

212
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
Well, it's almost a tool, huh?

213
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,080
Yes, yes.

214
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,300
So, we understand why there are different countries,

215
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,220
if you understand.

216
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,340
Well, like I've been saying for many years,

217
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,060
a decade and a half almost, there's a

218
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,220
patron or matron deity or a god behind

219
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,860
each nation.

220
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,860
And that's, you could study that, you know,

221
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,480
on your own.

222
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,760
And these gods are hostile to man, but

223
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,500
they want to be, in order to be

224
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,720
successfully hostile, you have to appear as a

225
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,440
friend, right?

226
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,080
Right.

227
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,560
Or have to appear as, yeah.

228
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,200
Okay, so that's why when you hear all

229
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,320
this stuff about adversarialism in politics, whatever, they're

230
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,600
not really adversaries because they're not pulling punches

231
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,280
like they were.

232
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,740
Or, I mean, they are pulling punches like

233
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,540
they're friends, not throwing punches like they're adversaries.

234
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,580
But essentially, going back to what is going

235
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,520
on and where people get their input from,

236
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,960
is designed on the notion that people will

237
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,160
always put their faith before their knowledge.

238
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,320
Like most people say, oh, I like the

239
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,600
way that sounds, I believe in that.

240
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,780
You know, years ago, I was on a

241
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,460
Skype, this person, believe it or not, had

242
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,000
an alternative media radio, they were a host.

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,040
And they were listening to me on a

244
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
Skype call, and they were like, you know,

245
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
Greek, I think I'm going to follow you.

246
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
Do I like what you're saying?

247
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm going to follow you.

248
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,400
I was like, no, please don't.

249
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,480
You're an idiot.

250
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,679
What you need to do is get an

251
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,240
orange vest and a plastic broom and wear

252
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,300
yourself out, is what you need to do.

253
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,160
So, yeah, so in other words, what has

254
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,080
been, humans, you know, are stupid, and they're

255
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,980
reliably so.

256
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,320
But here's the thing.

257
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,320
Now, inherently, they're not stupid, but they seem

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,020
like they are because it just keeps, you

259
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,060
know, being so prevalent.

260
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,420
But what they're, the powers that be, spiritual

261
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,960
and physical, rely on humans believing and grasping

262
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,400
onto something before they know anything about it.

263
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,180
Even a little bit about it.

264
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,300
But in other words, the absolute minimum is

265
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,960
shown as all there is to know.

266
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,100
Like, for example, if you go on the

267
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,860
internet, you'll see the browsers or the ads.

268
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,580
What you need, everything you need to know

269
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,900
about this going to Bermuda.

270
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,580
Everything you need to know about this hurricane.

271
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,140
Everything you need to know about this.

272
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,040
No, that's bullshit.

273
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
There's nothing there.

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,860
They're not telling you anything.

275
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,800
Okay.

276
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,800
So most people work on the, you know,

277
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,780
I feel good, why?

278
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
Because you're touching yourself kind of thing?

279
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,100
You know?

280
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,420
What do you mean, feel good?

281
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,160
Right?

282
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,640
Yeah.

283
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,420
It's that self-absorbed crap.

284
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,240
So people, everything that people inherently lean to

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,940
as part of their faith, what they believe

286
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,520
to, what they desire, is based on the

287
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,260
impulse that, you know, is put out in

288
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,560
the world.

289
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,140
In other words, find something to believe in

290
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,440
and believe in it.

291
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,100
Instant gratification.

292
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,220
Right.

293
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,400
Never any discussion.

294
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,500
Study it well.

295
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,140
And all this other stuff.

296
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,400
It's like they ask children, what do you

297
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,460
want to be when you grow up?

298
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,500
It's like, what do you want to be

299
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,680
when you grow up, I would ask.

300
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Right?

301
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,560
Because you're an idiot.

302
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,200
Grandpa or whatever.

303
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,180
You know?

304
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,460
So the point is, when you put the

305
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,500
belief system and you grasp onto some bullshit,

306
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,860
which is either all religion, science, political, sports,

307
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,640
whatever, without any knowledge, this is how you,

308
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,520
this explains really the way society functions, all

309
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,740
of it.

310
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,160
Now, what happens if most of us have

311
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,040
fallen for that?

312
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,180
Right?

313
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,560
Most.

314
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,740
Now, what happens when you start to say,

315
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,880
wait a second, I need to gain some

316
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,620
knowledge, and you already establish the faith, the

317
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,720
knowledge will push against the faith like the

318
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,740
horse against the cart.

319
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
So you're doing the believing in something or

320
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
liking something before you study is putting the

321
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,100
horse in front of the cart.

322
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,680
The horse is designed and made to pull,

323
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,640
not push.

324
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,420
You could make it to push, you know,

325
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
but the horse doesn't have shoulders like an

326
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,500
ox, you know?

327
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,560
It doesn't like it.

328
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,900
So it's going to be hard to get

329
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,420
it to push.

330
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,400
So what will happen is that the knowledge

331
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,500
and the faith will be contrary to each

332
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:15,780
other.

333
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,140
And you have two options.

334
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,200
One is the individual will be looking at

335
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,020
other individuals and how happy they are in

336
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,060
believing in basically nothing, and say, do I

337
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,540
want to be happy or do I want

338
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,440
to have two struggles?

339
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,180
One with these people around me that are

340
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,320
happy, the other one internally because I have

341
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,080
to now admit to myself and others I

342
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,700
no longer believe in that because of X,

343
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,500
Y, Z, but they don't care about X,

344
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,220
Y, Z, you see?

345
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,720
Right, the old Persian water story.

346
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,100
Sure.

347
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,560
Yeah, that's a way where the natural environment

348
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,140
is controlled.

349
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,520
So, yeah, there are many stories that could

350
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,180
be told about this concept.

351
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,680
You know, hurry up and believe something.

352
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Like if you ask most people why they

353
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
believe in, let's say, in the religious sense

354
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
what they do, it's because my parents did

355
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,260
or it's the country.

356
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,960
If you speak to someone in Greece about

357
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
this stuff, they say, oh, no, the two

358
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,020
most important things to a Greek is his

359
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,120
religion and his family.

360
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,000
I said, that's why you're going to lose

361
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,580
those two things.

362
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,020
That's why you're so screwed up, right?

363
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,700
And the same thing if you talk to

364
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,000
people of any quote-unquote national faith or

365
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,860
mainstream, they don't know why or, you know,

366
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,940
especially in America, they have to quickly decide.

367
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,420
Just like, for example, you may not be

368
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,560
a football fan, but when the stupid ball

369
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,900
comes around, you immediately latch onto a team

370
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,160
because it's, you know, you're really left out

371
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,920
if you don't, right?

372
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,580
Or the World Series and baseball come around,

373
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,360
you're not a baseball fan, but it's the

374
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,980
World Series, so let's just pick a team,

375
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,140
you know, we're not into this, you know.

376
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,500
So what most people do in America is

377
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,900
because, again, just the same thing they do

378
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,280
in other countries, it's whatever ideology they have.

379
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,740
And what you're being told from a young

380
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,380
child is to hurry up and believe in

381
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,700
something.

382
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,240
Hurry up and make a snap decision because

383
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
that's the way society is run.

384
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,540
No one's really thinking.

385
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,460
We have people thinking for us, right?

386
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,820
Doctors, lawyers, priests, right?

387
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,540
So what that means immediately is that the

388
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,400
population is too primitive and too irresponsible to

389
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,880
deal with anything.

390
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,500
You know, last week I mentioned the number

391
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,340
one priority.

392
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,620
By the way, the number one priority of

393
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,860
any government in the world right now is

394
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,460
how to get their military to go after

395
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,860
their civilian population.

396
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,980
Every country in the world wants that.

397
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,640
Not the actual government itself, the state, but

398
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,760
the people who control that government, you know?

399
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,200
That is the number one priority, and I've

400
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,260
gotten this from several sources already in the

401
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,840
past year.

402
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm just finally listening.

403
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,900
Of every government in the world.

404
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm not speaking out against them.

405
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm just reporting on what they're up to.

406
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,220
Now, if you go, for example, in the

407
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,060
American military, if you're hanging around in halls

408
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,360
of Congress and Pentagon or DOD, what the

409
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,220
older guys are telling the younger people is

410
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,240
that the gods of old are coming back.

411
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,840
And these are not religious people.

412
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,920
These are not even people that know what

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,380
that means.

414
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,660
That's been said now for the past year

415
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,120
also.

416
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,000
The gods of old are returning.

417
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,320
Yeah, in the military they're saying that.

418
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,620
Not the snotty recruits.

419
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,060
Yeah, yeah, so there's a movement.

420
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,940
But here's the interesting part, which is not

421
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,300
interesting.

422
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,620
Remember, the number one priority of any state

423
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,400
right now is how to get their military

424
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,520
force, which is not even their military force.

425
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
It belongs to the private owners, just like

426
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,560
police.

427
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,960
To go after their population without any, what

428
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,380
do you call it, without any mercy or

429
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
whatever, if they have to.

430
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,560
I was having a short discussion with an

431
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
American moron.

432
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,860
And he's saying, oh, that won't work because

433
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,800
posse comitatus.

434
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,620
I say, well, let's just reduce posse comitatus

435
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,420
because there was no police back then.

436
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,580
Posse comitatus says the American military can't shoot

437
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,720
American citizens or civilians, but the police have

438
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,820
no problem legally to do it.

439
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,520
So why is that?

440
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,640
What's different with the police?

441
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Well, guess what?

442
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,420
There is no police in a republic.

443
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,970
There are no police.

444
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,870
The only time police show up is when

445
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,330
the banks form districts.

446
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,350
For example, like the United States, talk about

447
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,370
state rights, federal rights.

448
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,070
That's all bullshit.

449
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,190
The country has been sold out and divided

450
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,930
into districts.

451
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,030
You ever, right, there's a post office like

452
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,090
Kentucky's KY.

453
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,870
You know, that's where they spread that on

454
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,610
their toast there.

455
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,790
Right.

456
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:36,490
Right.

457
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,050
It's right.

458
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,570
They have, you know, Iowa's IO or Hawaii

459
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,350
is whatever age.

460
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,370
Those are not natural grammatical abbreviations.

461
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,850
That's to show you that you're using all

462
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,410
these, you know, there are 12 Federal Reserve

463
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:49,850
districts.

464
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,370
That's all.

465
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,010
There's no state.

466
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,550
All the rest is for public consumption.

467
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,230
Yeah, there's state rights, this and that.

468
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,170
Oh, this guy's in trouble.

469
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,070
He won his case over the state.

470
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,150
Yeah, that's just a show.

471
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,630
No one cares about.

472
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,190
No, you know, this is they still have

473
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,690
to upkeep.

474
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,750
So again, the main priority is how do

475
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,030
you get your implemented forces of destruction to

476
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,610
go against the civilian population?

477
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,950
I didn't finish the thought last week or

478
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,330
even now.

479
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,890
It's a long conversation on this.

480
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,250
It's not just all the Greek says this.

481
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,990
I don't believe it.

482
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,550
Screw you.

483
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,090
This is the main thing.

484
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,090
How do you do that?

485
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,610
Once a country facilitates that type of aggression

486
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,410
against its own, quote unquote, slaves or citizens

487
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,650
or residents, that's not the problem.

488
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,690
That's easy to do.

489
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,910
But the thing is, how do you maintain

490
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,790
that the remnant, the survivors, the ones that

491
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,830
are left are in harmony with it?

492
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,030
They'll go back to work the next day.

493
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,490
Like right now, if they got, let's say,

494
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,850
in Kansas, the military to go in there

495
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,450
and wipe out like 90% of the

496
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,450
population, right?

497
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,330
I don't think the people are going to

498
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,150
go to work tomorrow.

499
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,850
Probably not.

500
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,990
There'll be outrage, right?

501
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,310
So the problem is not getting rid of

502
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,130
the 90% of the population using the

503
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,329
military.

504
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,050
That's simple.

505
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,589
That's a chemical, physical thing to do.

506
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,710
I mean, there's high-speed chemistry, explosives, nukes,

507
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,030
bullets, poisoning, whatever.

508
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:14,690
That's easy to do.

509
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,430
Many things in their toolbox.

510
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,790
Yeah, many things in their toolbox.

511
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,130
The hard part is how do you do

512
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,710
that without not having severe consequences in the

513
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,130
aftermath?

514
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,530
In other words, they want to figure out

515
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,050
a way to do it, and then everyone

516
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,190
the next day says, oh, that's fine.

517
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,650
It's just natural.

518
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,390
Let's go back to work.

519
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,610
Nothing to see here.

520
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,350
Right.

521
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,750
You see, that's the part that's the kicker.

522
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,490
That's the part, if you figure that out

523
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,510
now, you know exactly what's coming, you see.

524
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,790
Right.

525
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,850
A little spiritually and physically.

526
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,710
Just for example, a lot of people discuss

527
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,930
in the ancient writs, regardless of what prophecy,

528
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,370
some will say, well, how do you always

529
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,410
get stuck on the Bible?

530
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,510
I'm like, no, give me any work, any

531
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,230
literary work or anything that's been memorialized even

532
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,670
that makes sense and adds up, I'm into

533
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:01,930
it.

534
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,230
This doesn't have to be scripture.

535
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,250
Right?

536
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,350
Although it's prioritized also, you know.

537
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,470
I'm into anything that's good, not crap, you

538
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,690
know.

539
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,930
Diversification.

540
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,890
Sure, but even the more you diversify, the

541
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,350
more you come to the center anyway.

542
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,250
Right, right.

543
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,810
It's the same spot, which is the truth

544
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,050
and how things really work.

545
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,530
So, again, the subtlety, like everyone knows, go

546
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,410
into a public space.

547
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,310
Whoever knows about the Antichrist, raise your hand.

548
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,870
They all raise their hands.

549
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,090
Well, if everyone's so smart about it, aren't

550
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,610
they going to cry foul when he shows

551
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:35,850
up?

552
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,270
Of course.

553
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,570
Yeah, so guess what?

554
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,270
No one's going to figure it out.

555
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,770
Well, I mean, you have to know how

556
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,730
the mechanism works.

557
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,730
So when you look at all these things,

558
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,510
they're going to be so subtle.

559
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,570
And, again, it's very easy for any state

560
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,250
to destroy its own population.

561
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,110
The thing is the aftermath, the blowback, the

562
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,410
reaction, you know, you want everything to be

563
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:58,770
normal.

564
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,010
You still want people to go to open

565
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,270
Starbucks and McDonald's and Walmart and work at

566
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,110
the water utility and work at the power

567
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,930
station and pick up the garbage.

568
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,890
But you just don't want it.

569
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,670
You just only want one out of ten

570
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,170
people.

571
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,810
You don't need the rest, you know.

572
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,290
Right.

573
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,950
Because, actually, from an objective point of view,

574
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,250
a causal point of view, they're pretty useless

575
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,670
anyway.

576
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,410
They're just filler.

577
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,710
But how do you get to that point

578
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,230
where you've eliminated the majority of the population

579
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,270
and the remainder still acts normally and also

580
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,190
is susceptible to the changes you want to

581
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,530
implement?

582
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,810
That is the, in other words, that's what

583
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,850
you're looking for, right?

584
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,570
Right.

585
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,470
That's what you're looking for, the reasoning behind

586
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,110
that, right?

587
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,390
Yeah.

588
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,450
The how-to.

589
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,370
See, the thing is, there's a very simple

590
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,170
way to look at it.

591
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,270
It has to be done by consent and

592
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,950
by permissions.

593
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,230
Everything is by permission and consent, from both

594
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,470
ways.

595
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,990
See, they give you the illusion that you

596
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,830
have to consent, but no, they're actually just

597
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,630
giving you permission.

598
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Like, for example, with the homosexuals and the

599
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,750
gay rights, there is no such thing as

600
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,110
gay rights.

601
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,510
All they're saying is the state now is

602
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,430
permitting this.

603
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,070
Right.

604
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,450
That's all.

605
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,770
That's all they're saying.

606
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,850
We are permitting this.

607
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,770
So, in other words, the minds behind the

608
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,830
state, they're not talking about politicians, like, for

609
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,950
example, the Congress and President and all that.

610
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,390
That's irrelevant.

611
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,350
Congress doesn't even, people, if you know how

612
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,630
to read, they won't let you in Congress.

613
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,710
You have to be illiterate.

614
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,910
I mean, no comprehension.

615
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:24,750
Right.

616
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,110
Right?

617
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,350
They never wrote a law.

618
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,310
They never read a law.

619
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:27,730
Nothing.

620
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,510
They're just there, you know, because the Constitution

621
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,970
says Congress assembled as Congress, not showing up

622
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,050
and attending, you see.

623
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,950
The President, okay, since Nixon and starting with

624
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,990
Kennedy and maybe before that, they were always

625
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,610
giving the President a hard time in the

626
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,210
people's minds.

627
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,610
The people say, oh, it's important they have

628
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,710
a President no matter who it is.

629
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,670
We have to be behind them.

630
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,930
That's being patriotic.

631
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,110
Well, they've been working for a long time

632
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,210
to diminish that office to irrelevancy.

633
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,450
Why?

634
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,570
Because you don't need one.

635
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,770
Because there are no states.

636
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,510
There is no government.

637
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,610
You're just 12 districts.

638
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,630
You're a commercial entity, and you're privately owned.

639
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,990
As a matter of fact, all of North

640
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,350
America, believe it or not, except for Paraguay,

641
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,570
is the same owner.

642
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,130
Paraguay is connected differently because you have to

643
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,830
study how the post office works.

644
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,090
I know.

645
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:14,830
I'm sorry.

646
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,650
Did I say Paraguay?

647
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,290
Yeah.

648
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,210
I didn't mean Paraguay.

649
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,090
Uruguay.

650
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,290
Oh, okay.

651
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:19,990
Oh, okay.

652
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,510
Yeah.

653
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,190
So it's very interesting, you know, how these

654
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,610
things work.

655
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,210
But this is not for public consumption.

656
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,090
Right.

657
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,810
In other words, the bullshit that you see

658
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,590
that's going on politically with presidents, Congress, laws,

659
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,950
and all, is the same bullshit that you

660
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,250
see when Christmas comes around, or Halloween, or

661
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,890
Fourth of July.

662
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,090
None of that exists, but people are enthralled

663
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,770
by it.

664
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,390
So at this point, it seems like getting

665
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,310
rid of what they call the structure of

666
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,970
the American government is going to be just

667
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,850
as resistive as getting rid of Christmas.

668
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,790
I think they're both going to go together,

669
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,950
you see.

670
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,970
You know how they put a lot of

671
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,310
resistance against Christmas in America about a decade

672
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,910
ago, and people kind of pushed back a

673
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,130
little, and they stopped.

674
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,010
Well, they're pushing back against officers in the

675
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,630
American government.

676
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,490
Like, for example, here, I don't want to

677
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,990
mention the position of local government.

678
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,810
Someone that I know, and they've been in

679
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,190
there for 35 years, even though they're supposed

680
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,970
to be reelected every four, right?

681
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,590
Right.

682
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,930
Everybody here knows it's a corporation.

683
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,310
None of that stuff is true that they

684
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,010
tell the public.

685
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,890
And this is someone official in the government.

686
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,990
I'm not going to say who it is.

687
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,630
Okay.

688
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,930
Right?

689
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,870
Yeah.

690
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,910
And I'm not talking about you call them

691
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,130
up, they're going to deny that, but once

692
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,590
you get to know them, you'll see, right?

693
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,050
Sure.

694
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,210
The same with the military.

695
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,870
There's a movie, Jarhead, by the way.

696
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,370
I don't know if you've seen it, about

697
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,390
the Marines and all that.

698
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,250
Sounds familiar.

699
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,130
The best part is when they're watching videotapes

700
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,990
and the guy's girlfriend says, Hi, baby, I

701
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,950
just want to show you, I'm tired of

702
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,270
your ass, and she's having sex with the

703
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,730
neighbor on a videotape.

704
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,910
Just to show you, this is how these

705
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,850
pagans are, you know?

706
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,890
They don't even know why they're together.

707
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,410
That's why very often I hear about people

708
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,070
getting divorced.

709
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,610
I'm like, why were you together?

710
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,770
You didn't even know why you were together,

711
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,790
so you just have to make up something

712
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,530
to break up because you never knew why

713
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,190
you were together anyway.

714
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,690
That's how pagans operate.

715
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,750
So, again, back to the way the structures

716
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,270
work.

717
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,810
The irrelevancy, okay, what's subtle is this.

718
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,330
This is what people are not watching.

719
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,570
How things are being made irrelevant or attempted

720
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,950
to be made irrelevant, not because that's when

721
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,910
the change will happen, but just to be

722
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,990
in alignment with reality.

723
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,650
So going back to, let's say, the concept

724
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,850
of the state, the reality of the state,

725
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,910
like Dimitri says, is a privately owned corporation.

726
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,590
You can look at it.

727
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,610
That was in 1871 for America.

728
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,730
They changed it, put it on the credit

729
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,670
system in 1933.

730
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,870
It's irrelevant.

731
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,650
Anything they tell you about constitution, patriotism, president,

732
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,530
Congress, it's all irrelevant.

733
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,590
It's just as relevant as saying, if I

734
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,450
say Starbucks is privately owned, yes, yes.

735
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,330
Okay, Walmart's privately owned, yes, yes.

736
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,170
Okay, well, Walmart sells all this stuff and

737
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,750
Starbucks sells all this other stuff.

738
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,250
Okay, yes, they're very different, aren't they, right?

739
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,230
But they're still privately owned, you see.

740
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:08,750
Right.

741
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,850
Just like it doesn't matter, well, this state,

742
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,390
they do this.

743
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,030
So what?

744
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,050
That's because they don't know how to change

745
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,190
your mind to give up this stupid thing

746
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,610
about patriotism, right?

747
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,410
Right.

748
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,330
So they're trying to discredit the presidency.

749
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,110
They've already got rid of Congress, by the

750
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,070
way, in most people's minds.

751
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,450
Yeah.

752
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,030
Because Congress has less than a 20%

753
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,610
approval rating.

754
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,070
That's great.

755
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,510
I mean, fine.

756
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,510
You see, they can't be honest.

757
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,130
They're shameless.

758
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,950
Those that are controlling those can't come out

759
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,030
and say, look, we own you.

760
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,190
You're our property.

761
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,510
Sorry.

762
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,270
You have a problem with us and you

763
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,530
shouldn't.

764
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,330
You should have a problem with your great

765
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,970
-great-grandparents.

766
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,730
They voted for it, basically, by not doing

767
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,190
anything.

768
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:45,870
Right.

769
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,390
You know, if you have a problem, go

770
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,950
shit on their graves, piss on their graves,

771
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,310
whatever.

772
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,250
It's not us.

773
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,930
Sorry.

774
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:53,670
Right.

775
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,270
And you've got no say, but we have

776
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,830
to let you, because you need, it's like

777
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,070
this.

778
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,430
Listen, people of the world, you're just our

779
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,250
private chattel, our property, you, your children, everything.

780
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,490
You don't own anything.

781
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,110
You have credit to get what you want.

782
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,490
Yeah, the attorneys screw with you, telling you

783
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,950
there's such a thing as a debt, this

784
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,310
and the other, which there isn't, but that's

785
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,570
okay.

786
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,970
Get used to it.

787
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,510
You're being screwed with.

788
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,850
Get used to it.

789
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,630
You'll be fine.

790
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,430
But they can't tell that to the people.

791
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,170
Okay, so Congress has been made irrelevant pretty

792
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:20,590
much.

793
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,150
Now they're going after the presidency, not to

794
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,570
go after the presidency.

795
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,670
The presidency is finished a long time ago.

796
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,290
Right.

797
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,950
A long time ago.

798
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,390
That's over.

799
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,070
What they're doing is going after it so

800
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,270
you get it out of your mind that

801
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,910
it matters, because it doesn't matter.

802
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,970
It's a show, and when they show any

803
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,630
presidentiary leader doing something significant, it's a show.

804
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,130
Just like the courts railroad everybody.

805
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,030
They ignore everything.

806
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,050
And then occasionally they'll be fair with someone,

807
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,030
and that one makes the news.

808
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,290
Oh, yeah, this guy is fair.

809
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,390
Oh, see, it's a fair system.

810
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,770
It's total bullshit.

811
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,970
See, what the people, again, Christianity is the

812
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,530
same thing.

813
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,810
They will not look at the Bibles, even

814
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,170
the piss-poor thing called whatever version they

815
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,530
give you in English, without an interlinear even

816
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:05,930
or whatever.

817
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,910
If you really read it with comprehension, you're

818
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,630
going to say, wait a second, they're pranking

819
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,850
me here, first of all.

820
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,130
Second of all, it's nothing like their religion.

821
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,810
Even if you read the King James, by

822
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,110
the way, as it is, you're going to

823
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,150
see it's a very anti-Christian document.

824
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,130
New Oral Testament, it doesn't matter.

825
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,950
As it is.

826
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,270
Either way.

827
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,070
Just like the Koran is very anti-Muslim,

828
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,270
as it is.

829
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,530
And what they call the Old Testament is

830
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,410
very anti-Jewish, for example.

831
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,050
Even the very furry Jews with the hats

832
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,550
that you see.

833
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,790
The ones with the beards, they call them

834
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,470
the furry ones.

835
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,670
They have varieties.

836
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,510
Then you've got the secular, whatever.

837
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,190
So there's no honesty.

838
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,050
It's all just shamelessly, ridiculously a lie.

839
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,630
In your face, no problem.

840
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,110
But the people are holding on to beliefs

841
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,910
of certain things, via their religion, via patriotism,

842
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,530
via whatever other ideology they have.

843
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,170
The media has really stepped up on that,

844
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,530
as far as subtle.

845
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,490
People turn to that automatically.

846
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,670
Whatever news site is out there, here's where

847
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,370
you get the real stuff, or whatever the

848
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,170
case may be.

849
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,450
That's another way to lure you in.

850
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,130
Exactly.

851
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,350
Look at all the things that are being

852
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,950
discredited.

853
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,270
For example, good food and water is discredited.

854
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,950
There was a little bit of a boost

855
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,970
in the 80s and 90s, where they had

856
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,830
all these health companies.

857
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,270
Smith & Wesson, the gun company, bought Hain,

858
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,350
which was a natural food producer.

859
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,470
H-A-I-N.

860
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,170
What does that tell you?

861
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,890
They're not going to invest in something that

862
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,650
has no growth.

863
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,630
The thing is, where you're going to see

864
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,250
the subtle changes is not in what's going

865
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,930
to change, but change people's mindset towards it.

866
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,870
How come there are people floating around the

867
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,530
Pentagon, old senior people, telling people they're witnessing

868
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,130
the return of the old gods?

869
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,390
What does that mean?

870
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,530
Exactly that.

871
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,070
Why is the A-1 priority of all

872
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,030
the owners of all the states or governments

873
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,190
to get rid of 90% of the

874
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,450
population using whatever?

875
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,070
Water, food, military.

876
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,250
Why is it there?

877
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,810
Because it's long overdue in their minds.

878
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,930
This is the same thing as cattle.

879
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,510
If you know anything about cattle ranching, I

880
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,990
did a study on ranching cattle a while

881
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,390
back.

882
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,790
That's why very often when I hear about

883
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,030
anthrax, I have to laugh.

884
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,150
Threatening people with powder and anthrax and all

885
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,510
that stuff.

886
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,730
That is a very common thing that happens

887
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,310
all over America, especially the southwest in places

888
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,910
like California where they had ranching where it

889
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,550
was very dry.

890
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,490
Horses and cattle got that.

891
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,590
The way you remedy that, by the way,

892
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,330
is to actually take notes on this.

893
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,690
What they did, this guy Joe Blankenship, actually

894
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,010
he's passed away now.

895
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,690
Whenever there was an anthrax outbreak, he would

896
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,730
just show up with a double axle truck.

897
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,030
Let's see, 10 wheels, right?

898
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,910
Double axle.

899
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,730
Sure.

900
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,550
With about 10 or 15 55-gallon drums

901
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,590
and a single piston diesel pump.

902
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,990
They would put iodine, just regular iodine, that

903
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,870
red shit, in the water and spray it

904
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,670
over all the animals.

905
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,570
Iodine, diluted iodine, not full strength, but diluted

906
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,590
iodine over the area gets rid of it.

907
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:31,910
Wow.

908
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,530
So does colloidal silver, but the iodine is

909
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,750
a readily available thing.

910
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,150
There's many commercial sources for it.

911
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,410
It doesn't even have to be food grade.

912
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,850
People are like, oh, there's nothing.

913
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,250
Just iodine gets rid of it.

914
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,430
Even the iodized salt, there's enough iodine in

915
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,270
there to get rid of it.

916
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,150
Anyway, there's no intelligent life on this planet.

917
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,570
Again, with the ranching, some of the ranches

918
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,210
were developed with a carrying capacity of so

919
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,530
many.

920
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,850
When stuff grows naturally, you know from experience

921
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,730
and statistics what grows on the land can

922
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,050
carry a certain capacity of cattle.

923
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,150
Now, if you double or triple the amount

924
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,610
of cattle, they run out of food and

925
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,450
that has to be open and the ranch

926
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,390
becomes very tenuous.

927
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,270
You could have disease.

928
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,030
Right?

929
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,090
Now, with the people, the humans, it's different.

930
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,650
There's plenty of food.

931
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,330
The reason they're messing with the food is

932
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,190
to prevent starvation.

933
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,830
Now, this is an interesting study I did

934
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,430
a while back.

935
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,070
There is enough land on just the highway

936
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,550
medians in America, where the highway median is

937
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,250
a narrow strip.

938
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,150
If you just shut down all the farms

939
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,250
and grew food only on the land in

940
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,850
the highway medians, that would be enough to

941
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,650
feed the whole country.

942
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,630
I know it sounds crazy, right?

943
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,270
Yeah.

944
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,210
Yeah, you're going to get some tailpipe pollution

945
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:54,790
and all that.

946
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,530
Sure.

947
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,390
Okay, so there's no starvation.

948
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,050
During Jeremy Carter years, they were paying farmers

949
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,910
to burn the wheat.

950
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,570
Yeah, that's right.

951
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,050
They would rather them burn the wheat than

952
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,490
get a negative price on it.

953
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,750
Because it actually would go to zero and

954
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,390
then go negative.

955
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,170
Right?

956
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:12,890
Right.

957
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,530
It would go to zero.

958
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,370
So, you're talking about a sick bunch of

959
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:16,650
people.

960
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,930
The people that own, there are people and

961
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,010
there are certain demonic beings behind them that

962
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,350
own all of the countries now.

963
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,370
They want to get rid of the people

964
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,710
because they're just tired of your stupid asses.

965
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,610
There's plenty of water.

966
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,550
Water, like oil, is made underground, just like

967
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,110
the vegans.

968
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,830
Vegan means no animal.

969
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,390
Okay, but it's wrapped in plastic.

970
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,010
And isn't plastic dinosaur animal product?

971
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,150
They always freeze up when I say that.

972
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,230
Because none of these vegan idiots ever came

973
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,690
to me and said, Well, it's really not

974
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,850
dinosaur fossil fuel.

975
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,590
It's abiotic.

976
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,590
It's created by the earth.

977
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,170
No one.

978
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,330
That's how stupid they are as a general

979
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,850
group.

980
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,130
Right.

981
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,050
But it's easy to pull that.

982
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,830
And you don't want to mess with stupid

983
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,250
people.

984
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,390
It's like you don't pick on retarded kids.

985
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,110
Anyway.

986
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:05,690
Right.

987
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,790
So, the powers that be are just tired

988
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,190
of your stupid asses, right?

989
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,890
And your children and your parents and all

990
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,050
that.

991
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,030
The whole group is just like, you know,

992
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,850
we've had enough of them.

993
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,530
We've been running these people for 150 years,

994
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,170
most of the world for 100.

995
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,930
And absolutely the whole world now for at

996
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,510
least 30.

997
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,750
Except for one or two countries, maybe recently.

998
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,630
And it's no fun.

999
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,690
It's kind of played out.

1000
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,590
You know, like if someone likes fishing, and

1001
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,970
they don't catch a lot of fish, but

1002
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,910
they're really into fishing.

1003
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,750
If you provide them with a few barrels

1004
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,250
of fish to go fishing in, they get

1005
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,850
real excited.

1006
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,770
Finally, I'm catching fish, right?

1007
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,450
Right.

1008
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,290
But I assure you, no matter how much

1009
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,310
they like fishing, after like a year of

1010
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,150
that, or two years, or five years, or

1011
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,010
ten years of that, they're like, oh, screw

1012
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:53,890
the fish.

1013
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,310
This sucks.

1014
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:55,910
Right?

1015
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,750
Belly up to the bore.

1016
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,210
So, this is the subtle thing.

1017
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,370
Anything they're telling you, not enough water, bad

1018
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,910
weather, starvation, population the earth can't support, is

1019
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,050
total bullshit.

1020
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,090
The subtlety is coming from the point that

1021
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,010
what you believe in, what you hold on

1022
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,370
to as being your faith, needs to be

1023
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,090
changed in order to accept the reality they

1024
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,610
want to put.

1025
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,370
So, all of you idiots out there, that

1026
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,670
think anything in any of your governments, doesn't

1027
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,710
matter if it's Erdogan, Trump, Putin, doesn't matter,

1028
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,970
even a monarch, Netanyahu in Israel, those people

1029
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,630
there have nothing there but functionaries and position.

1030
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,350
There are leaders behind there.

1031
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,090
So, when the scripture is talking about leader

1032
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,130
of a people, it's talking about the leader

1033
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,850
of the people.

1034
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,850
Now, for example, if you had a leader

1035
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,990
of a country, let's say like Dimitri gives

1036
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,290
Iran as an example with Ayatollah Khomeini, he

1037
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,650
was really the leader of a people.

1038
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,570
He cleared out, he got rid of the

1039
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,290
influence, the background influence, for a short while,

1040
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:01,610
right?

1041
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,490
You see?

1042
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,230
Right.

1043
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,850
Okay, so he would be a leader.

1044
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,489
So, for example, Trump is not a leader.

1045
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,370
He is the agent for the leader.

1046
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,190
But even, not even like an agent for

1047
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,130
a leader, he is more like an agent

1048
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,730
to tell you what you are used to

1049
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,270
hearing, and to tell you things that you...

1050
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,070
Same with Putin.

1051
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,590
He is part of the show.

1052
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,730
He is putting on a show, and also

1053
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,530
they are changing what they are saying.

1054
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,570
So, same with Netanyahu, same with all of

1055
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:30,830
them.

1056
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,909
Even the cannibalistic African leaders, the ones that

1057
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,230
they celebrate by eating human liver, right?

1058
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,889
Right.

1059
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,650
Those guys are still puppets.

1060
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,290
At this point right now, because they have

1061
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,830
a credit-based economy, right?

1062
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,570
So, this is the insanity of it.

1063
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,969
Like the Pope is another one.

1064
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,570
The Pope is just a...

1065
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,570
Rhymes with P-U-P-P-E-T.

1066
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,370
Right.

1067
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,710
There is a leader in the Vatican, I

1068
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,570
assure you that.

1069
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,350
It's not the Pope, and it's not the

1070
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,030
Jesuits either.

1071
00:34:59,550 --> 00:34:59,650
No.

1072
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,650
None of those guys.

1073
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,410
There is a leader of the United States

1074
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,190
of America, but I'm sure it's not the

1075
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,270
jokers you see on TV.

1076
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,530
That's for sure.

1077
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,150
For 150% sure, not just 100%.

1078
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,230
Yeah, that's a good one.

1079
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,530
You see?

1080
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,570
So, when the Scripture is talking about leaders,

1081
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,090
and you factor it into a certain time,

1082
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,750
you have to understand, is he really the

1083
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,430
leader or not?

1084
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,790
So, when you look at the leader of

1085
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,130
a people, let's say, 2500 years ago in

1086
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,110
the area of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, yes, he was

1087
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,090
the leader of the people.

1088
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,970
They didn't have a sovereign corporate state, as

1089
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,490
you do now.

1090
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,090
You see?

1091
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,070
David was a leader.

1092
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,330
Hezekiah was a leader.

1093
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,430
Right.

1094
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,890
Because the Scriptures, in any ancient text, is

1095
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,270
blatantly honest.

1096
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,450
For example, if during the kingdom of Judah

1097
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,910
and Israel, there was a sovereign corporation or

1098
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,010
whatever, it would state that.

1099
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,370
It would tell you it's a corporation, and

1100
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,590
they have this puppet called David, or a

1101
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,590
puppet called Hezekiah, or whatever.

1102
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,990
Scripture is blatantly clear.

1103
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,330
It doesn't hide stuff like that.

1104
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,510
Right.

1105
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,270
You see?

1106
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,070
So, who is the leader of what they

1107
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,710
call Russia?

1108
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,830
We don't know.

1109
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,490
But we know it has a leader, you

1110
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:17,670
see?

1111
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,270
Right.

1112
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,190
You see how the subtleties are working?

1113
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,950
And what these leaders are saying, it doesn't

1114
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,690
matter, even industry, when you look at this

1115
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,650
Elon Musk idiot, or Bill Gates, or Steve

1116
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,770
Jobs who passed away, those guys, they're puppets.

1117
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,530
They have no...

1118
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,490
They're very...

1119
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,370
If you've ever seen...

1120
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,970
I learned this a long time ago, back

1121
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,210
east.

1122
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,470
There was a couple of industrialists I saw

1123
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,330
giving a speech.

1124
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,250
And I was working in lighting and sound

1125
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,010
and all that stuff.

1126
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:45,650
Right.

1127
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,890
And you get to see them off stage.

1128
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,670
Right.

1129
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,610
And this one guy was being crowded by

1130
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,410
three people, and they were in his face.

1131
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,730
You know when someone is speaking to a

1132
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,810
child and they're angry at them?

1133
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,990
Their mouth is just two inches from their

1134
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,830
face, and the person's looking down at the

1135
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,210
floor and they're nodding the whole time?

1136
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,430
Right.

1137
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,010
Imagine the body language.

1138
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,970
Imagine Bill Gates standing there.

1139
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,650
I'll just say it.

1140
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,190
Bill Gates is standing there, and he's staring

1141
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,590
at his shoes, and he's nodding like he's

1142
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,270
one of those bobbing head dolls.

1143
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,830
Up and down, up and down, up and

1144
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,490
down, up and down.

1145
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,230
And there's two guys an inch away from

1146
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,890
his face, looking like they're almost ready to

1147
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,270
yell at him.

1148
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,310
And this is going on for five minutes,

1149
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,210
or three minutes, or one minute could be

1150
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:27,830
like five minutes.

1151
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,330
And he's just nodding his head up and

1152
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,250
down like a little boy.

1153
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,450
Wow.

1154
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,970
And that's the head of your Microsoft?

1155
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,450
Come on.

1156
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,590
Give me a break.

1157
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,770
You know?

1158
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,090
So when you, again, the leaders of the

1159
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,230
people, this keeps coming up, the kings of

1160
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,530
the north, the king of the south, the

1161
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,030
king from here.

1162
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:44,990
Yeah.

1163
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,250
You have to learn to discern the nature

1164
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,050
of the state.

1165
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,230
Right?

1166
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,270
Hmm.

1167
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,810
Okay, the other thing is, regarding food and

1168
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,130
water.

1169
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,350
Okay, oil and water are made in the

1170
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:58,910
earth, period.

1171
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,090
Period.

1172
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,610
That's just like you make pee and poo.

1173
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,730
You'll be doing it until the day you

1174
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,730
die, most likely.

1175
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,450
The earth is going to be making water

1176
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,050
and oil.

1177
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,830
Somebody was telling me, oh, the flood, this,

1178
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,310
flood, that.

1179
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,910
Like, flood was not the oceans.

1180
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,190
The flood, the primary water from the underground

1181
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,850
and the rain.

1182
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,090
It wasn't the oceans, you know?

1183
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,470
Right.

1184
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,210
Because they talk about in Genesis how the

1185
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,750
water will not exceed its boundaries.

1186
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,450
So it couldn't have been a worldwide flood.

1187
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,770
I said, well, but the cause of the

1188
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,450
flood was not specifically the oceans.

1189
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,310
It was specifically the fountains of the deep

1190
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:31,910
and the sky.

1191
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,030
So it doesn't break the Genesis rule of

1192
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,330
the waters will not exceed their boundaries to

1193
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:37,730
the land.

1194
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,990
See, so it's like no one has no

1195
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,470
comprehension.

1196
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:44,910
Anyway, so your food, basically food, water, air

1197
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,190
are unlimited because the earth perpetually produces it,

1198
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,810
recycles it, renews it.

1199
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,450
So anything you hear about water shortage, food

1200
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,010
shortage, it's total bullshit.

1201
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,730
It's just like saying you owe a debt.

1202
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,570
Yeah, if you agree to it.

1203
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,630
Now look, if they tell you that global

1204
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,790
warming and the bad weather and the starvation

1205
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,110
go away and you agree to it, well

1206
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,690
then that's the reality that you want to

1207
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,090
pursue.

1208
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,710
Remember, even scripture is voluntary.

1209
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,770
The law is voluntary.

1210
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,210
You can't force someone to do it.

1211
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:14,530
Right?

1212
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,350
So these are the subtle things.

1213
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,670
You have to establish what's called the common

1214
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,790
denominators, right?

1215
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,550
Right.

1216
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,130
To discuss the subtleties, like for example, if

1217
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,750
you, like people are not good at math,

1218
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,050
if you show them like the movie Good

1219
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,790
Will Hunting, which is like a chalkboard full

1220
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:36,350
of mathematical equations, it's blatant in their face

1221
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,470
they can't figure it out.

1222
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,190
And to get the result or solve the

1223
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,230
equation is very subtle.

1224
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,490
Right?

1225
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,950
When you see a huge, let's say derivative

1226
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,430
or calculus or like 15 quadratic equations, the

1227
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,770
way you figure it out is subtle.

1228
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,570
The opposite would be if you showed your

1229
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,670
common person a big letter 2 and then

1230
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,830
the plus sign, I mean number 2, and

1231
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,170
again an equal sign, that's not so subtle.

1232
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,970
That's in your face.

1233
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,370
That's easy.

1234
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,130
We could hit that.

1235
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:04,330
Boom.

1236
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:04,810
That's 4.

1237
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,750
2 plus 2 is 4.

1238
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,290
I think most people know that.

1239
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:08,650
Okay.

1240
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,850
So from that point of view, that's not

1241
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,150
subtle.

1242
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:14,650
You see?

1243
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,390
The subtle parts are understanding the underlying structure

1244
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,690
and does the information that you're getting or

1245
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,510
trying to solve fit the underlying structure or

1246
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,990
the substrate.

1247
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:24,850
Right.

1248
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,550
For example, in the beginning we started discussing

1249
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,310
how people accept faith before knowledge.

1250
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,210
And then they don't want, they can't look

1251
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:32,630
at knowledge.

1252
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,430
Now it's too late.

1253
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,770
And if they do, it's contrary socially.

1254
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:36,550
Okay.

1255
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,510
That's part of the cosmic censorship.

1256
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,810
The way you censor, I'll start to, you

1257
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,550
know, Sam asked me about some cosmic censorship.

1258
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,570
I've written some stuff about it a while

1259
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,270
back, but it's technical.

1260
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,030
Not that no one can comprehend it, but

1261
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,030
yeah, no one can comprehend it.

1262
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,310
Yes.

1263
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,270
You know what I mean?

1264
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,330
It's not like no one can comprehend it,

1265
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,830
but at this point, I don't think there's,

1266
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,430
it can be comprehended without looking at it

1267
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,310
from a, you know, what it really is.

1268
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,010
And not that I fully understand cosmic censorship,

1269
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,230
but we can, we have made a line,

1270
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,990
a list of line items on what, why

1271
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,470
society is so fucked up.

1272
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,010
And if you look at it, whether it's

1273
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,070
on the individual or social level, it shows,

1274
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,990
well, this is cosmic censorship.

1275
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,370
You see?

1276
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,810
And part of the cosmic censorship is to

1277
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,990
put on people the desire to believe in

1278
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,350
something, even though they know nothing about it.

1279
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,150
Now you're stuck.

1280
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,010
Because you don't know what it means.

1281
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,550
That's groupthink then.

1282
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,970
Groupthink, yeah, is cosmic censorship.

1283
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:38,690
Yeah.

1284
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:39,750
Yeah.

1285
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,990
The other part of cosmic is seeking pleasure

1286
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,350
at any cost or without any discernment.

1287
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,390
You know, the typical thing, if you, like

1288
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,230
with Christians especially, because this is a Christian

1289
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,710
society, if you ask them about why you're

1290
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,930
doing Christmas or New Year's or Halloween, oh,

1291
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,510
come on, you just don't know how to

1292
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,470
have a good time.

1293
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,350
That's their answer.

1294
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,510
Mm-hmm.

1295
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,810
Yeah.

1296
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,190
So if you're living in a society of

1297
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,870
cannibals, why are you eating that baby?

1298
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,910
Oh, you don't know how to have a

1299
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,450
good time.

1300
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,330
Right.

1301
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,430
You see?

1302
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,590
What do you do with people?

1303
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,510
How sorry would you be if their leaders

1304
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,310
wanted to reduce them down to only one

1305
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,790
out of ten?

1306
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,830
You wouldn't feel so sorry for a society.

1307
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,590
Oh, do you feel bad that they got

1308
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,150
rid of 90% of the headhunters?

1309
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,890
Do you feel bad?

1310
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,330
No, you don't.

1311
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,350
Oh, there are people, too.

1312
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,370
Okay, well, why did you call them headhunters

1313
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,010
if there were people?

1314
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,870
Just call them people.

1315
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:36,630
Right.

1316
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,390
You see?

1317
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,790
All right, so the subtleties are very subtle,

1318
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,030
but they're not once you understand does the

1319
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,970
information match?

1320
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,810
if you go into a crowd of people

1321
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,950
anywhere in the world and you ask them,

1322
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,770
anyone who's ever heard of the Antichrist, raise

1323
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,570
your hand, if almost everybody raises their hand,

1324
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,730
how is it going to happen?

1325
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,090
Very subtly.

1326
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,070
You know, these people don't, so the subtleties

1327
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,730
that are happening is the truth behind the

1328
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,050
matter.

1329
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,310
Because everything that everyone is discussing is bullshit.

1330
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,470
Very simple.

1331
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,630
How do you know it's bullshit?

1332
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,510
Because most things that people discuss and get

1333
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,450
involved with is open to one's acceptance or

1334
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:22,410
one's interest based on their, you know, selective

1335
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,630
nature.

1336
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,570
Some type of pleasure, yeah.

1337
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,710
Yeah, like, oh, I don't want to talk

1338
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,490
about that.

1339
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,330
I don't like talking about that.

1340
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,970
That means it's a bullshit subject.

1341
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,730
Or, if you're coming to them with it's

1342
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,870
not bullshit, it doesn't resonate with them because

1343
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,650
it's not bullshit.

1344
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,850
See, if you give me some bullshit, I'll

1345
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,190
take it when I feel like it because

1346
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,910
that's what I'm used to getting, you know?

1347
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,030
Talk about how the Republicans are screwing stuff

1348
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,510
up, right?

1349
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,270
When there is no Republic, there's no such

1350
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,250
thing that the whole thing is a bad,

1351
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,030
bad show.

1352
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:57,230
It's like our happy days, Fonzie and who

1353
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,510
was it?

1354
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,930
Richie.

1355
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,230
I need some joy.

1356
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,310
Yeah, yeah, right.

1357
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,810
Yeah.

1358
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,730
Yeah, and it ain't going anywhere and you're

1359
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,890
not going anywhere unless you understand the substrate

1360
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,070
behind what is and what's coming.

1361
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,450
You can't overlap it just, you know, on

1362
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,190
face value.

1363
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,170
You can take, if you comprehend prophecy and

1364
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,250
you have a good handle on what's being

1365
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,870
said, you can overlay that on what's going

1366
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,790
on but what, not what you think is

1367
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,770
going on but what's really going on.

1368
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,050
Right.

1369
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,890
You see, there's a big difference there.

1370
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,250
You know, how many times you look on

1371
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,150
the internet rectangle, there's a prophecy being fulfilled

1372
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,510
and they give you some bullshit political thing

1373
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,090
going on.

1374
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,410
It's like, oh no.

1375
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:41,690
Yeah.

1376
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,410
You see, so it's very, very subtle.

1377
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,430
The Antichrist analogy is the best one that

1378
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,010
I can give.

1379
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,210
Most people have heard about it and if

1380
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,930
they're so smart and they know about it

1381
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,170
then how is it going to take place?

1382
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,830
Doesn't work that way, sorry.

1383
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,970
So, you know, all of this stuff, it's

1384
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,330
just, it's, how many times have you heard

1385
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,970
me say that the being's in control of

1386
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:09,970
an IQ of 2 million?

1387
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,230
You're not going to outsmart them.

1388
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,230
You're not even going to perceive that they're

1389
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:13,910
doing anything.

1390
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,130
That's how smart they are.

1391
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,550
Like, the best thieves are the best, are

1392
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,150
the, are masters of disguise.

1393
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,390
Yeah.

1394
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:32,750
So, anyway, I would suggest that you have

1395
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,210
to study both sides.

1396
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,970
You know, I mean, nowhere, like when you

1397
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,290
study scripture, nowhere in scripture does it fully

1398
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,630
disqualify secular knowledge.

1399
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,350
It kind of pokes fun at the scribes

1400
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,950
changing things and philosophy as being the be

1401
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,970
-all end-all, let's say, man's philosophy or

1402
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,250
man's law, but it doesn't say you shouldn't

1403
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,270
know about it.

1404
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:56,910
Right?

1405
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:57,710
Right.

1406
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,210
So, keep yourself aware.

1407
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,570
And the workings of it, it's mature, you

1408
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,270
know, it's a, most people, again, they have,

1409
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,790
they've stopped developing, you know, what's interesting, I'm

1410
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,670
starting to see on the rectangle, more Greek

1411
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,570
-speak topics come up out of the blue,

1412
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,230
so to speak.

1413
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,870
Like, for example, there was a commentary about,

1414
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,130
like most people, this guy hasn't matured beyond

1415
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,850
eight years old.

1416
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,410
Well, where have you heard that before, you

1417
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:29,530
know?

1418
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,970
Right.

1419
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,410
Most people, it's not possible to mature beyond

1420
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:33,710
that.

1421
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,950
When you look at the parents, like Jack

1422
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,670
Fresco says, you give the child a book,

1423
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,490
the cow goes moo, and the lamb goes

1424
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:39,850
baa.

1425
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:40,730
Yeah.

1426
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,490
Well, guess what?

1427
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,950
When you go to get a PhD in

1428
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,390
physics, it's the same thing, you know?

1429
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,990
It's just a slightly different wording.

1430
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,190
It's the same mentality, same mindset.

1431
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:51,930
You know?

1432
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,770
You know, do you ever see a dog

1433
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,310
or a cat or a deer or an

1434
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,790
elephant raise its young, like, or show it

1435
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,570
something that's contrary to what it's going to

1436
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,290
need as an adult?

1437
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,190
No.

1438
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:03,770
Not at all.

1439
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,090
They're preparing you.

1440
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,470
So, look at how the society educates their

1441
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,850
children.

1442
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,050
That means, that's the follow through.

1443
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,950
Go look at a high school textbook, college

1444
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:13,410
textbook.

1445
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,730
When I open it, even if it's physics

1446
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,130
or whatever, all I see is the cow

1447
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,910
goes moo and the lamb goes, you know,

1448
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,410
baa, and the dog goes bark and the

1449
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,130
cat goes meow.

1450
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,050
Yeah.

1451
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,030
That's the same mindset.

1452
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,890
Obviously, you know, the topics are different.

1453
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,570
Sure.

1454
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,730
And they're wording it differently, but they still

1455
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,810
got you in that mindset.

1456
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,470
So, whoever heard of the Antichrist raised your

1457
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:35,810
hand.

1458
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:36,710
Really?

1459
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:37,490
Mm-hmm.

1460
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,370
You're hearing things now.

1461
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,850
They don't get it.

1462
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,630
Right?

1463
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,670
So, and the other subtle thing is this.

1464
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,530
Be very careful because right now, actually, it's

1465
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,490
been, when I say right now, I mean

1466
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,510
in this past century and especially now that

1467
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,310
times have ended, because remember, time ended 20

1468
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,190
plus years ago.

1469
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:02,790
Right.

1470
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,970
So, whatever is good is considered evil and

1471
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,470
whatever is evil is considered good or permissible.

1472
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,890
Like, whatever is haram is not tawd.

1473
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:13,790
Right?

1474
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,470
And like haram in Arabic is not permissible

1475
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,970
and halal is permissible.

1476
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:18,570
Right?

1477
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:19,490
Mm-hmm.

1478
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,550
So, what is now, what is becoming permissible,

1479
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,430
again, going back to the sodomites or the

1480
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,090
lesbians or whatever, they're not giving them any

1481
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:29,590
rights.

1482
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,530
Who wants rights anyway?

1483
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,810
You know, that's, that means that you're in

1484
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,210
trouble and you're given a right.

1485
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:35,870
Great.

1486
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,050
You're presumed to be a criminal.

1487
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,450
Yeah, there's no law, discussion of law.

1488
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,170
All they're doing is making it permissible and

1489
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,210
then if you don't like that, now you're

1490
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,830
interfering with them, you see.

1491
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,250
Mm-hmm.

1492
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:52,110
It's not, yeah, you see, it's interference and

1493
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,650
permission is what the entire society is based

1494
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,030
on and they don't know this, by the

1495
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,270
way.

1496
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,330
And very subtly done.

1497
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,530
Yeah, if you look at some older, not

1498
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,510
now, like past 30 years or so, legal

1499
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,350
documents for a bank robbery or not bank

1500
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,030
robbery, a store robbery, let's say a convenience

1501
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,090
store or a store.

1502
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,790
Sure.

1503
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,450
It wasn't really robbery, it was interfering with

1504
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,710
the state's ability to collect taxes was the

1505
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,170
charge.

1506
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:19,590
Interesting.

1507
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,990
Because how's the state going to collect taxes

1508
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,150
if the guy's interfering with a gun and

1509
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,630
a mask?

1510
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,750
Right, But you see, that's beyond, even the

1511
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,550
attorneys getting out of Harvard, they don't, they're

1512
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,890
like, who, who, who?

1513
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,350
You know, they don't understand that.

1514
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,590
You see, so, yeah, yeah, it's really, it's,

1515
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,350
yeah.

1516
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,130
So on the bright side, you know, have

1517
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,490
you had a good meal lately?

1518
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,490
And if you haven't, or you, let's say

1519
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,710
you have on the bright side, do you

1520
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,350
know how to, did you prepare it and

1521
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,170
can you have another good meal?

1522
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,250
Right, you see?

1523
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,570
Are your shoes comfortable?

1524
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,030
Are your clothes comfortable?

1525
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,490
Do you have someone around or are you

1526
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,750
or imagine that there's someone around that you

1527
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,970
can speak to, even, right?

1528
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,390
Right, right.

1529
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,690
Okay, is the air reasonably clean where you

1530
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:11,990
are?

1531
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,190
Is your bed reasonably comfortable and is where

1532
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,890
you dwell reasonably comfortable?

1533
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,890
Anything outside of that is superficial.

1534
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,650
Those are the main things.

1535
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:22,650
Yeah.

1536
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:22,930
I'm serious.

1537
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,450
Good food, good clothes, good people.

1538
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,730
Some conversation, yeah.

1539
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:29,150
yeah.

1540
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,190
Good water.

1541
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:30,550
Yeah.

1542
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:31,470
Yeah.

1543
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,590
Because once you know both the gods and

1544
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,390
man are fixing on getting rid of 90

1545
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,950
% of the earth's population, you know that

1546
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:39,270
now.

1547
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,910
It's not whether you're afraid of it or

1548
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,170
want it or it's good or bad, it's

1549
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,750
going to happen, period, you're done.

1550
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,090
Get over it.

1551
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,410
Move that to the side.

1552
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,590
So that means that you're living on a

1553
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,150
momentary basis, daily basis, weekly basis.

1554
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,890
There's a prayer in scripture, does it say

1555
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,490
give us our yearly bread or our monthly

1556
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,330
bread or my 401k?

1557
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,750
Or does it say daily, right?

1558
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,390
Yeah.

1559
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,010
Because it's that bad.

1560
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,590
Like all these states, they all are under

1561
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,230
what's called state of emergency.

1562
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,190
Every year, every month, every day, every government's

1563
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,330
under state of emergency.

1564
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,510
That's been going on for quite some time.

1565
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,450
Oh yeah.

1566
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,290
Oh yeah.

1567
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,170
They know.

1568
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,090
Yeah.

1569
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,110
But you don't because you don't, you know,

1570
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:19,970
it's too subtle maybe.

1571
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,580
So the fall, the breaking down period is

1572
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,940
now and it's quiet.

1573
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah.

1574
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,480
Yeah.

1575
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,720
It's quiet but for the, in other words,

1576
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,340
the noisemakers aren't spinning.

1577
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,040
It doesn't mean that there isn't a party.

1578
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,440
You see?

1579
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,720
Just because there's no noise doesn't mean that

1580
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,380
the group, you know, there isn't anything going

1581
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:42,800
on.

1582
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,540
The punch bowl is still full.

1583
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,340
You know?

1584
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,320
And don't drink from it because someone pissed

1585
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:49,800
in it, right?

1586
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,780
So anyway, hmm, the host pissed in it.

1587
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,360
Right.

1588
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,180
And he gets off on watching you guys

1589
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,380
drink out of it with pleasure.

1590
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,240
So anyway, there's a lot going on and

1591
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,000
where do you start?

1592
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,140
Well, if you have, you have to understand

1593
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,920
the substrates.

1594
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,260
What's happening is there's a posture being set

1595
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,960
when it's quiet.

1596
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,180
Okay.

1597
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,400
There's some people that might appreciate this.

1598
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,140
When it's quiet, you know, imagine all the

1599
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,320
topics that you've seen in the media, good

1600
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,900
or bad.

1601
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,580
I mean, there's not much good but, right?

1602
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,320
I mean, what can people do that's generally,

1603
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,060
you know, objectified as good?

1604
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,580
Very little.

1605
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,700
They just do.

1606
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,620
And hopefully, they don't do too much damage.

1607
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,260
That's good.

1608
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:32,800
Right?

1609
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,260
Now, to give an example, have you heard

1610
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,600
of any plagues, any pestilence, any kind of

1611
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,140
scare of epidemics in the past?

1612
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:43,600
Whatever.

1613
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,540
it's funny you should bring that up.

1614
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,660
You know, I go to a, that map

1615
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,680
that shows all the different things that's supposed

1616
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,500
to be in real time.

1617
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:56,340
It's free and yes, there is biological hazards,

1618
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,100
epidemic hazards that always seems to pop up

1619
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,140
at least daily.

1620
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,880
Daily, but on what scale?

1621
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,320
You know, pretty much always localized.

1622
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1623
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,720
All the different countries except, well, Australia wasn't

1624
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,080
in there.

1625
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,940
Well, I don't know how that would be

1626
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,880
quantified.

1627
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,440
Like, for example, if some, if there's a

1628
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,300
neighborhood that has a hamburger shop and all

1629
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,680
the patrons get sick from the cold.

1630
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,840
Right, something like that.

1631
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,500
Yeah, like local.

1632
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,380
Sure.

1633
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,240
Okay, so let's say what you've used to

1634
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,040
your whole life seeing, you know, you have

1635
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,400
the, let's say the epidemics.

1636
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,220
Bring that up right now.

1637
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,080
Yeah, there isn't anything like that.

1638
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,760
Guess what?

1639
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,720
They're working on it.

1640
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,160
Okay?

1641
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,560
Right.

1642
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,580
So when that comes up, when it comes

1643
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,760
up, you'll see how it's been structured because

1644
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,540
it was worked on while it was quiet.

1645
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,100
The next thing is a geopolitical thing.

1646
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,480
It's kind of being resolved in the Middle

1647
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,180
East a little bit, but guess what they're

1648
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,720
working on?

1649
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,480
You know a country called Jordan?

1650
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:02,680
Yeah.

1651
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,460
Oh, yeah, that little short guy.

1652
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1653
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,160
Well, you're going to see some serious stuff

1654
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,100
going on there like you ain't seen before

1655
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,860
when that shit hits the fan.

1656
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,100
Okay, so watch that, right?

1657
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,340
If you've been watching, Iraq hasn't been in

1658
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,860
the news, but if you really are watching

1659
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,880
what's going on in Iraq, it's, what is

1660
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,560
the main, if you deduce the main thing

1661
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,320
that's going on in Iraq right now, especially

1662
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,520
for the past six months, is decentralization.

1663
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,040
In other words, there's a growing majority of

1664
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,560
people in what they call the country of

1665
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,680
Iraq don't want the country to be like

1666
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,020
a country of Iraq.

1667
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,820
They want it in different sections.

1668
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,040
This has been going on a bit.

1669
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,300
I've discussed becoming a new Assyria.

1670
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,220
Okay, you know, what else is going on?

1671
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,880
You know, bad weather.

1672
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,240
Well, we're working on that.

1673
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,480
Next subject.

1674
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,220
The thing, you'll get that for sure.

1675
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:58,820
You'll see.

1676
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,420
The other thing is economics.

1677
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,740
You know, it was 2008.

1678
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,140
That was not a crash at all.

1679
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,120
That was just a reset.

1680
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,820
It was a wonderful thing to happen.

1681
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,560
It proved many things.

1682
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,920
It proved how stupid people are, you know,

1683
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,800
and it proved that the credit system can

1684
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,280
recover.

1685
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,400
It was an orchestrated deal.

1686
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:20,800
Of course.

1687
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,860
It's kind of like when you test a

1688
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,900
car tire, they have a course for testing

1689
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,700
car tires.

1690
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,540
You know, and part of the course is

1691
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,620
when the tire does fail, how quickly can

1692
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,860
you recover with a spare?

1693
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It was all a success.

1694
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,340
You see, people say, the tire failed, but

1695
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,660
look, the car still drove off.

1696
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,580
that was a big success.

1697
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,320
So, when you look at these things, you

1698
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,900
know, and by the way, the way the

1699
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,040
economic system was reset allegedly on the crash

1700
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,480
of 2008 is going to make it more

1701
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,920
difficult to rearrange it the next time.

1702
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,180
That's another explanation why.

1703
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,200
Right?

1704
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:56,780
Yeah.

1705
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,500
Because no matter what they do to recover

1706
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,800
the next credit economy folly is going to

1707
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,540
be very obvious that what the credit system

1708
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,200
really is.

1709
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,580
People still don't know what it is.

1710
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:11,800
Right?

1711
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,500
So, it's kind of like the story of

1712
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,580
the old caveman, you know, who wants to

1713
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,120
live in the cave.

1714
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,840
He sends one of his children and he

1715
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,060
doesn't come out, so he has to send

1716
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,420
another child who doesn't come out.

1717
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,040
Then he sees a lion come out, the

1718
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,420
lion goes back and he still doesn't know

1719
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,660
what's going on so he sends another child

1720
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,780
and the child doesn't come out.

1721
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,280
I mean, this is how oblivious the people

1722
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,240
are when it comes to the economy or

1723
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,940
anything, or even the health field or anything.

1724
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:43,220
So, you start imagining what could be in

1725
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,320
the news or what could be noisy and

1726
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,740
is not and that's what's being worked on

1727
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,600
because it's all a show right now.

1728
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,340
Right.

1729
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,140
The main thing, again, is how do you

1730
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,580
reduce the population down to 10% of

1731
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,100
what it is?

1732
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,960
This is a secular and divine thing.

1733
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,660
It's a big thing.

1734
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,300
I'm not stressing it as the be-all

1735
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,740
end-all, but this is something that people

1736
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,300
scream about, you know, population reduction, this, that,

1737
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,560
and the other, but they don't know that

1738
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,840
it's going to happen for sure.

1739
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,380
They don't know that.

1740
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,260
Right.

1741
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,660
And they don't know how it's going to

1742
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,020
happen.

1743
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,780
A lot of it is based on that

1744
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,140
and I think we've had a discussion about

1745
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,760
that audio or about The New Barbarians, right?

1746
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh yeah, Dr. D.

1747
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,640
Yeah.

1748
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,960
For example, they talked about how all the

1749
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,860
cars will look alike.

1750
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,280
That's true.

1751
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,520
I mean, if you go out, I can't

1752
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,220
tell right now if a minivan or a

1753
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,980
compact car is a BMW, a Kia, or

1754
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,280
a Toyota.

1755
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:37,940
I can't tell.

1756
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,780
So those many things, you know, they already

1757
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,600
gave the gays and the lesbians or the

1758
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,980
homos rights, you know, that was a lot

1759
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,060
of things, but a lot of things that

1760
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,700
were mentioned there were not put in order

1761
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:47,880
yet.

1762
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,860
That's a really good secular guideline.

1763
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,840
You know, a lot of things have not

1764
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,480
been done yet.

1765
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,120
Right.

1766
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,780
You know, like, where's the demise pill?

1767
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:57,160
Right.

1768
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,440
You know, when someone gets tired and they

1769
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,520
go to an office and they check out,

1770
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,140
they say, I'm done with here, okay, fine,

1771
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,960
lay down, we'll give you an injection, take

1772
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,800
the pill, you're done.

1773
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,300
That hasn't come around yet.

1774
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,620
That's being worked on, I'm sure.

1775
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,940
I mean, the thing is, how do you

1776
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,220
get people to accept it?

1777
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,600
Well, Gavorkian started up a little bit there,

1778
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,100
but that faded out real quick.

1779
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,580
They slapped him down too quickly, I think.

1780
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
I think they could have kept it around

1781
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,420
and people would have gotten used to it.

1782
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:23,920
Right?

1783
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,380
Yeah, if it was in the face more

1784
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,620
positively spun.

1785
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:29,860
Right.

1786
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,980
Here's another, when it comes to, you know,

1787
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,320
the subject of war, because the three things

1788
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,740
that are going on with human society is

1789
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,620
very, very simple.

1790
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,660
The first thing is entertainment, in this order,

1791
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,960
believe it or not, and I'll explain why.

1792
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,640
The second thing is food, which is food,

1793
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,900
clothing, shelter, and the third thing is how

1794
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,480
you kill, war, you know, how do you

1795
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,040
kill each other?

1796
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,020
Those are the three things about human society.

1797
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,700
Why is it the first thing, entertainment?

1798
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,620
Well, it should be obvious, but we can

1799
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,560
discuss it briefly.

1800
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,800
Entertainment includes marketing, what you're, when you engage

1801
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,140
in television, radio, film, written, you know, pulp

1802
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,360
or electronic media, that's how you find out

1803
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,820
what you're going to eat and if it's

1804
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,520
okay to kill people too, right?

1805
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,460
You know, if you look at the Syrian

1806
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,800
war, they say, oh yeah, Assad is, we

1807
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,160
need to go kill, you know, so if

1808
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,580
Assad's so bad, just take him out, why

1809
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,960
do you have to kill a million Syrians,

1810
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,300
right?

1811
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,000
So the entertainment justifies, you know, let's say

1812
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,860
9-11, entertainment justifies, because the news is

1813
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,520
entertainment, don't think it's the news, right?

1814
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,900
I mean, whatever news is new.

1815
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,840
It's like what movie is new is the

1816
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,340
news, right?

1817
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,360
So the entertainment is first for humans, believe

1818
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:41,860
it or not.

1819
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,200
What do you think the churches are?

1820
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,720
And your synagogues and your mosques and all

1821
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:46,980
that?

1822
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,920
What do you think that is?

1823
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,500
Entertainment first for humans, period.

1824
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,000
Second is food, clothing, shelter.

1825
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,180
We're talking about this society now.

1826
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,280
Food.

1827
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,080
How do you know what's good to eat

1828
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,300
or not?

1829
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,280
How many times do you hear people saying

1830
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,480
they don't want to eat this and where

1831
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,340
did you get that information?

1832
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,640
Oh, from the doc, what doc, on TV,

1833
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,160
right?

1834
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,040
Okay.

1835
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,920
Have you heard of like Atkins diet or

1836
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,880
paleo diet?

1837
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,860
Oh, God, yes.

1838
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,180
Where do people get these ideas?

1839
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:14,960
That's entertainment.

1840
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,500
How about clothing?

1841
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,300
How are you going to know what to

1842
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,640
wear?

1843
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,860
Entertainment is where you learn what to wear,

1844
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,340
what's trending, what's fashionable.

1845
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,480
And shelter, that's also entertainment.

1846
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,720
You know, oh, yeah, I want to get

1847
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,340
a tiny house.

1848
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:31,560
Why?

1849
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,360
I saw it on the internet.

1850
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:32,820
I like it.

1851
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,300
Oh, really?

1852
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,700
Entertainment, right?

1853
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,220
Entertainment dictates what you're going to eat, what

1854
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,520
you're going to wear, and how you're going

1855
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:40,940
to live.

1856
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,160
And the third part is how to kill

1857
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
humans.

1858
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,320
Entertainment dictates that.

1859
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,140
Oh, yeah, they blew down the towers.

1860
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,320
We have to go get those countries.

1861
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,200
Perfect, yeah.

1862
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,540
Wasn't it you that, yeah, I think you

1863
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,840
mentioned something one time about how they tried

1864
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,720
to get more enlistments at one time and

1865
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,300
all they did was made a movie with

1866
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,080
some soldiers.

1867
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,680
Japanese.

1868
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:03,580
right.

1869
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,840
Yeah, and Frank Capra, that asshole who did

1870
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,880
that other Christmas movie.

1871
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,220
Right, right.

1872
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,420
Did it, yeah.

1873
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,840
He said, oh, we'll just make a movie

1874
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,160
with people dressed up like Japanese soldiers raping

1875
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,280
white women, white Christian women, and the enlistment

1876
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:17,580
went up.

1877
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,720
They tried to do stuff like that for

1878
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,460
Vietnam also and other things like that, yeah.

1879
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,840
Yeah, they had the anti-war thing going

1880
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,660
on at that time.

1881
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:25,640
Oh, yeah.

1882
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,040
You know, if that anti-war stuff didn't

1883
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,200
go on, I bet you that would have

1884
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,360
worked a heck of a lot better.

1885
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,500
I bet it would have.

1886
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:33,680
Oh, yeah.

1887
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,140
There was more anti-war.

1888
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,160
The most anti-war there ever was was

1889
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,840
for World War II, but you don't hear

1890
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,640
anything about it.

1891
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,480
No, no.

1892
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,140
Right, just like the history books tell you

1893
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,500
still it's Arabs and airplanes.

1894
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,860
There were no Arabs and there were no

1895
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,300
airplanes.

1896
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
I mean, there were airplanes, but they were

1897
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,220
landed at an Air Force base, you know.

1898
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,080
Right, right.

1899
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,700
Right, so, yeah.

1900
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,300
Yeah, so again, entertainment will tell you who

1901
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,820
it's okay to kill and it, yeah, you

1902
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,760
see, right?

1903
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,900
All shaking hands with each other, yeah.

1904
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,580
Entertainment will dictate your food, clothing, shelter, and

1905
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,780
it'll dictate when it's okay to go kill

1906
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,520
a whole bunch of people.

1907
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,360
Yep, yeah.

1908
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,920
Very simple.

1909
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,040
And if you know, if you understand things

1910
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,020
that are true, or the truth, or the

1911
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,160
truth of the matter, because, you know, each

1912
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,200
matter has its own structure, substrates, and history,

1913
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,660
and condition, you know, what state it's in,

1914
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:31,880
right?

1915
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,000
Like, if we talked about the hat industry,

1916
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,420
it's very different discussing it before the 1960s

1917
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,420
than now.

1918
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,020
Right now, it's just baseball caps, basically, and

1919
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,900
ski hats, right?

1920
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,500
Yeah.

1921
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,600
It wasn't so, you know, if you go

1922
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,740
back turn of the century, it was more,

1923
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,280
you know, the richer you were, the shinier

1924
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,940
and taller your top hat was, right?

1925
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:51,900
Mm-hmm.

1926
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,920
So, but hats are a passé, and, you

1927
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,980
know, how does that come, entertainment again?

1928
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,980
You know, so, You had to tell them.

1929
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,480
Yeah, again, religion, same thing, entertainment, and the

1930
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,780
people take entertainment very, very seriously.

1931
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,580
Oh, yeah.

1932
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,300
I know, I wasn't going to talk about

1933
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,620
this, but, I got kicked out of my

1934
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,960
first Christian channel.

1935
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,020
Yeah.

1936
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,220
Well, the Christian channel, not yours.

1937
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,800
yeah, yeah.

1938
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,140
Oh, yeah.

1939
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,500
And, Well, let's, but here's the thing, you

1940
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,620
know, if they come out, those people are

1941
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,320
deprived.

1942
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,840
They're in depravity.

1943
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,740
Yeah, yeah.

1944
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,220
It's not that they're Christian, or Muslim, or

1945
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,640
Jewish, or Hindu, or Buddhist, or whatever.

1946
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,460
They know nothing about nothing to go for

1947
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:38,760
that.

1948
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,060
You see?

1949
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,180
Well, you know, and knowing what I know

1950
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,460
now, and I was, and I did more

1951
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,680
listening than I did any kind of engagement,

1952
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,460
and it was all Mithra, Asclepius, brother me,

1953
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,860
brother that, and sister, and, And it was,

1954
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,740
let me ask you this, though, let's get

1955
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,020
more down to the root of it.

1956
01:03:59,020 --> 01:03:59,200
Okay.

1957
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,300
In case one of these idiots are listening.

1958
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,120
Right.

1959
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,920
It's important for them to get this.

1960
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,420
Are they mostly American, would you say?

1961
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah.

1962
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:08,520
Oh, yeah.

1963
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,020
Yeah.

1964
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,160
I think there was a couple of, there

1965
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,900
was a couple of Spanish ones in there,

1966
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,240
yes.

1967
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,840
Okay, but they were most likely that not

1968
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,920
going directly for Mithra, let's just say, but

1969
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,660
yes, a derivative of, of derivative, yes.

1970
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,580
Well, I could tell you directly what they

1971
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,280
were going for.

1972
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,900
Directly, they're going for the American Jesus and

1973
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,760
the American God.

1974
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,020
Exactly.

1975
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,240
Based on the American Bible.

1976
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,000
Yep.

1977
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,160
Yep.

1978
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,360
As what, and the American Church.

1979
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,760
Now, if this was a group in England,

1980
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,620
it would be the England, English Jesus.

1981
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,960
If it were, if it was a group

1982
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,160
out of Yes.

1983
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,420
Italy, it would be the Italian Jesus.

1984
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,240
Yeah.

1985
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,120
Yeah.

1986
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:49,540
You see.

1987
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,260
Entertainment.

1988
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,240
The same with Buddhism, and the same with

1989
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:53,600
Islam.

1990
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,220
Right.

1991
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,140
It would be, yeah, it would be, because

1992
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,120
each country has its own, what, how difficult

1993
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,240
would it be for the God that's behind

1994
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,040
America to be okay to have people organized

1995
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,780
under the J-E-S-U-S label,

1996
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:11,480
or G-O-D?

1997
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,600
Totally fine.

1998
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:14,500
Oh, yeah.

1999
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,620
How would the God in Italy, for example,

2000
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:22,240
or Spain, be okay with the people being

2001
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,080
organized, as long as it was a lie,

2002
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,260
under their form, of J-E-S-U

2003
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,220
-S or G-O-D?

2004
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,760
Totally fine.

2005
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:29,560
Mm-hmm.

2006
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,440
As long as you follow the party line,

2007
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:31,740
you know?

2008
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,440
Right.

2009
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,780
Because it's political.

2010
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,340
They don't know this.

2011
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:37,800
You know?

2012
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:38,660
Mm-hmm.

2013
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,080
Who was it?

2014
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,060
It was something that the greatest Americans that

2015
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,300
ever lived was John Wayne, Barry Manilow, and

2016
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,440
Jesus Christ himself.

2017
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,740
Those were the greatest Americans that ever lived.

2018
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,160
No, literally.

2019
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,280
This is what people think.

2020
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,120
Mm-hmm.

2021
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,620
Or how about this one?

2022
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,740
The King James Bible is the true word

2023
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,160
of God.

2024
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,140
It was good enough for the Apostle Paul.

2025
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,820
It was good enough for me.

2026
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,120
It's like saying, you know, the iPhone is

2027
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,740
the best GPS.

2028
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,960
It was good enough for Christopher Columbus.

2029
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,200
It was good enough for me.

2030
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:10,420
Right?

2031
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:10,940
That's right.

2032
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,760
There's no...

2033
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,620
You can't...

2034
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,380
You ever hear take a number?

2035
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:16,680
No.

2036
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah.

2037
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,360
Yeah, that's what these people are, take a

2038
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:19,520
number.

2039
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,260
The waiting room.

2040
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,020
take a number.

2041
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:21,960
Yep.

2042
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,500
Your number 6,953,000 in the minus

2043
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,260
mark, whatever.

2044
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,320
Just stand here.

2045
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,420
We got 70 years.

2046
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:33,260
You can graze and eat and poop, breathe

2047
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,440
the air, and then you're out.

2048
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:34,720
Boom.

2049
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,900
That number is satisfied.

2050
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,360
Next.

2051
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:37,680
Yeah.

2052
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,200
Right.

2053
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,620
This is serious cosmic talk.

2054
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,320
You don't get that.

2055
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,140
Oh, yeah.

2056
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:44,840
Yeah.

2057
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,200
No one could touch this at all, this

2058
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,620
kind of talk, because they don't think.

2059
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,680
And I'll tell you what, if I know

2060
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,740
for sure, 100% sure, that people that

2061
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,480
do know this and have meditated and know

2062
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,860
that it's true aren't speaking.

2063
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:58,600
So...

2064
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,540
Yeah, it's...

2065
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,100
But, you know, the Muslims are a funny

2066
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,900
bunch and the Buddhists are a real funny

2067
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,200
bunch.

2068
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,440
I mean, they're all just as ignorant.

2069
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,640
You know, the Jews are a real funny

2070
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,360
bunch too, but you could have more fun

2071
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,020
with the Jews because at least you could

2072
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,480
make scriptural references and they have heard of

2073
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:13,620
it.

2074
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,440
They don't understand it or don't know much

2075
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,680
or they'll bring up a point of view

2076
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,420
and they'll find out that it's really not

2077
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,320
what they think it is, you know.

2078
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,200
So you could have a lot of fun

2079
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,740
with the Jews on that.

2080
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,120
I like to spell it J-O-O

2081
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,620
-Z so it doesn't get picked up.

2082
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,660
I like to change that because it sounds

2083
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,020
the same and it actually emphasizes the phonetic

2084
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,880
aspect of it.

2085
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,760
And it's...

2086
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,160
Yeah, it works.

2087
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,960
Yeah, it does work.

2088
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:41,900
Yeah, it does.

2089
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,240
Because no one...

2090
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,220
Yeah, who cares?

2091
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,700
Yeah, so with the Jews you will get

2092
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,120
a little more...

2093
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,140
you'll have a little more fun if you

2094
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,020
study scripture because at least you'll feel that

2095
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,740
they're not trying to push something completely foreign

2096
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,220
on you.

2097
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:59,200
They will usually admit occurrences in the Old

2098
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,600
Testament as being significant where no one else

2099
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:02,940
does.

2100
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,920
You know, none of the...

2101
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,640
Buddhist, Christians, Hindus or Satanists or whatever are

2102
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,100
all the same.

2103
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,340
You know, they're not going to...

2104
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,420
You know, you can have more fun with

2105
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,040
the Jews in a more relaxing way.

2106
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,399
It's like I'd rather have a drink with

2107
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:17,740
a Jew than a Christian any day.

2108
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,460
You know, if we're going to talk about

2109
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,540
scripture you know, the Christians are just finished,

2110
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:21,899
you know.

2111
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,540
Right.

2112
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,600
And there's a thing going on now.

2113
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,720
I've noticed on the rectangle...

2114
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,520
it's been going on for a couple of

2115
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:28,700
years.

2116
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,080
Christian academics.

2117
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,700
If you listen to them very carefully though

2118
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,340
they are usurping your attention.

2119
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,100
Meaning, what they're doing is they're coming in

2120
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,000
from the priest...

2121
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,520
they're trying to be your priest by the

2122
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:42,740
way.

2123
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:44,720
Because...

2124
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,620
what does that mean?

2125
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,560
Very often people would ask me some pretty

2126
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,439
deep questions to resolve things for them scripturally.

2127
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,580
I'm like, you have to remember I'm not

2128
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,020
your priest.

2129
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,779
I can't tell you what to do because

2130
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:54,540
I'm not a priest.

2131
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:55,740
Right.

2132
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:56,979
Because the priest had the knowledge and the

2133
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,420
priest had the dictum to do that, you

2134
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,620
know.

2135
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,399
So what I would say is these academics...

2136
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:05,060
like recently I heard something about an academic

2137
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,620
and talking about another one and someone said

2138
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,620
well, that guy sounds stupid and the other

2139
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,399
academic says yeah, but don't call him stupid.

2140
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:13,380
Right?

2141
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,439
Because it's a priesthood.

2142
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:15,100
Right.

2143
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,620
So don't fall for these idiots.

2144
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:18,880
Because they're all idiots by the way.

2145
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:21,680
Now it doesn't mean that an idiot can't,

2146
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,040
you know, hit his hand with a hammer

2147
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,220
and say something truthful.

2148
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,279
Like, oh shit.

2149
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,920
A lot of these academics could go through

2150
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,600
the poop and pull out the corn and

2151
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,240
wash it off.

2152
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,520
But remember, do you want to eat the

2153
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,819
corn that's been cleaned off of somebody's poo?

2154
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:39,840
You know?

2155
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,399
But you still can approach what they've done

2156
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,880
if it's a lot of work to save

2157
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,560
you work.

2158
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,939
If, you know.

2159
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,120
If it's worthy.

2160
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,000
Or just to show another parallel thing.

2161
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,760
Here, I'll...

2162
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,740
not toot my own horn, but toot toot.

2163
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,080
I've been looking at stuff and hearing people

2164
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,820
lately and I noticed more Greek-speak type

2165
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,340
subjects are popping up here and there.

2166
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,020
That's why I put the YouTube with that

2167
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,380
heifer.

2168
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:08,480
Right.

2169
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,620
The Asian heifer on there.

2170
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,680
She actually said well see, September means the

2171
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,880
seventh month but whatever.

2172
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,460
Let's go back to our being our little

2173
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,640
LSD trip here.

2174
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,160
American Christian stuff, you know.

2175
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,500
American Jesus is great.

2176
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:21,940
The gospel, right?

2177
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,040
Those of you who know what that means.

2178
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:23,740
Oh yeah.

2179
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,360
I mean, there's a whole plethora of idiocy.

2180
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,340
I mean, you can take...

2181
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,580
You know like ice cream how they have

2182
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,240
different flavors mixed with...

2183
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,060
You know, they mix flavors of like chocolate

2184
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,000
and other things to make a new flavor,

2185
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:37,340
right?

2186
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:37,980
Right, right.

2187
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,920
And they just mix things.

2188
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,900
You can mix pretty much any flavor that's

2189
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,120
out there to make a new flavor, right?

2190
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,000
But I'll tell you what's not going to

2191
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,440
change.

2192
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:52,240
That whenever you see a flavor, whatever stupidity

2193
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,300
because that's all you're going to get from

2194
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,100
humans anyway, coming out of somewhere, make sure

2195
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,300
that you get a geographical marker on it.

2196
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,160
Why?

2197
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,040
Because they're being influenced by that geography.

2198
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,480
Right?

2199
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,360
Okay.

2200
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,600
So let's say you land on a video

2201
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,380
about Christianity and the origin, let's say the

2202
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,280
speaker, the audience and all that is from,

2203
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,220
let's say, I don't know, pick a country,

2204
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,140
Armenia.

2205
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,120
That's going to be the Armenian J-E

2206
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,800
-S-U-S and God he's talking about.

2207
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,640
No matter how many references he makes to

2208
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,840
the biblical text, unless they qualify it by

2209
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,560
first saying even though the text has never

2210
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,560
been translated and what we have given in

2211
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,460
the New Testament is pretty much erroneous, is

2212
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,820
not worth looking at really until it's organized

2213
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,540
a little better.

2214
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,360
The irony of it is the most important

2215
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,780
thing to look at, by the way, is

2216
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,340
the New Testament.

2217
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,260
That's why it's in the most disheveled condition.

2218
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,560
The other thing is unless they start giving

2219
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,080
you the caveats, you know, we want to

2220
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,240
talk about Scripture but it's going to be

2221
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,620
difficult because you guys don't know what's in

2222
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:55,760
it.

2223
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,300
Nobody knows what's in it unless you do

2224
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:57,800
the study.

2225
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,100
None of them talk like that.

2226
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,820
So they're going to give you the crap

2227
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,760
that they're getting from that God that's in

2228
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,800
their nationality.

2229
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:06,480
I'm serious about this.

2230
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,980
The entertainment over there, yes.

2231
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,340
Yes, right.

2232
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,160
The entertainment that they're giving there, yes.

2233
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,400
The same with medicine, the same with science,

2234
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,820
the same with all this other stuff.

2235
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:17,520
Right.

2236
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:18,640
Yes.

2237
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,440
The return of the old gods.

2238
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,340
Ah, that's...

2239
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,480
That is interesting.

2240
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,520
Yes.

2241
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,260
Yes, but you know, it's the return of

2242
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,400
the old gods being more overt on the

2243
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:28,600
scene.

2244
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,920
In other words, the bizarreness.

2245
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,120
Right, right.

2246
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,160
You see, if you hung out with some

2247
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,760
mobsters, right, other than what you see on

2248
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,660
TV, some of the Goodfellas is pretty accurate,

2249
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,800
and the Sopranos might have been pretty accurate.

2250
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,020
If you hang out with some mobsters, let's

2251
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,960
say for a couple of days, and you

2252
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,240
really live with them for a few days,

2253
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,180
let's say from where they normally live to

2254
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,780
their vacation house, how they do business, you

2255
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,320
will find it to be in great opposition

2256
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,060
and very contrary, almost bizarre to what's considered

2257
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,640
normal, but yet they do have a visage

2258
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,240
of being normal and likable, even.

2259
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,760
Just like anyone would have a characteristic that's

2260
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,120
likable.

2261
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,180
But they're very, very strange.

2262
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,960
Because they're operating with a certain character and

2263
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,520
a certain power level that they control their

2264
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,020
environment.

2265
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:15,160
Right.

2266
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,300
If you ever hang around powerful people that

2267
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,880
control their environment, they don't act like your

2268
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,420
average Joe Schmoe, by the way.

2269
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,100
They're very quirky, they have, you know, I've

2270
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,780
seen, I've been around some very wealthy people,

2271
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,580
and no matter how much you like them

2272
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,200
or like them, you always see the really

2273
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,320
strange sublime weird stuff and the real mean

2274
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,760
streaks come out more than you've seen in

2275
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,800
your common people.

2276
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:41,360
Right?

2277
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,380
Because they can get away with it.

2278
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:44,820
Right.

2279
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,080
You know, like for example, if Joe Schmoe

2280
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,520
puts out a mean streak on another Joe

2281
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,880
Schmoe, the other Joe Schmoes will kick your

2282
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,240
ass.

2283
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,100
You say that again.

2284
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,600
But if you have, I'm not going to

2285
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,280
mention names here, someone who's a billionaire put

2286
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,640
a mean streak on someone, a maintenance person,

2287
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,520
he's going to put his head down and

2288
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,700
say, I'm sorry, yes, I'll do it right

2289
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:02,980
away.

2290
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:03,660
Right.

2291
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:04,500
Right?

2292
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:05,900
Big difference.

2293
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,640
And they get, because they're always being accommodated,

2294
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:10,540
that mean streak is cultivated, I call it

2295
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,680
a mean streak, it's kind of a childish

2296
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,780
thing to say, but you know, from a

2297
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,360
position of power, they're not apologetic.

2298
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,480
In other words, they don't have to tell

2299
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,960
you why they want it, when they want

2300
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,380
it, you just better do it.

2301
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,400
And not even or else.

2302
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,220
Yeah, not even or else.

2303
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,300
The or else is unspoken.

2304
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,440
Yeah.

2305
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,380
You just do it.

2306
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,800
You see, the commoners don't have that in

2307
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,380
their thing.

2308
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,480
Okay, so why did I bring this up?

2309
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,680
Because the gods that are behind the nations

2310
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,380
are like that.

2311
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,940
When they make things happen, it's bizarre, it's

2312
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,020
going to happen no matter what, even though

2313
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,040
it shouldn't be happening.

2314
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:48,520
Right.

2315
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,380
based on common logic.

2316
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,900
Watch out for that.

2317
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:53,540
Okay.

2318
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,620
Use scripture.

2319
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,620
I found some very good sources other than

2320
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,020
scripture, and that would be understanding the real

2321
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,160
natural sciences, how things really work.

2322
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,020
You know, so when you hear of a

2323
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,940
storm and the power goes out, do you

2324
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,480
know why?

2325
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,860
Not because the force of the wind or

2326
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,320
whatever knocked the power line down.

2327
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,700
No, it has nothing to do with that

2328
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,080
at all, but they don't accurately report that

2329
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:15,600
to people.

2330
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,660
Structurally, everything could be fine and all of

2331
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,360
a sudden the transformer explodes, right?

2332
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:20,980
Right.

2333
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:21,520
They don't know why.

2334
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,620
It's electrons.

2335
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,220
Yeah, right.

2336
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,400
So you have to, okay, water.

2337
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,960
So how does, you know, how does weather

2338
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,700
really work?

2339
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,960
You see, so when you comprehend that, yeah.

2340
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,060
How does food really work?

2341
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,000
What, you know, carrying, carrying, you know, the

2342
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,800
carry and consumption ratios, you know, in other

2343
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,680
words, if you, you know, how does that

2344
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:39,920
work?

2345
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,120
You know, if you're going to maintain the

2346
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,620
population of adults, you need one pound minimum

2347
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,120
per person per food a day.

2348
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,700
You need one pound of food and two

2349
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,700
pounds of water, 32 ounces of water, I

2350
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,860
mean, yeah, two pounds of, of liquid and

2351
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,200
one pound of food per person per day.

2352
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,400
So if you, let's say you were to

2353
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,540
open a prison and you needed to maintain

2354
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,880
the population of adults, it would be, you

2355
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,320
would have to be able to supply a

2356
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,440
minimum of one pound of food and two

2357
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,480
pounds of liquid to each prisoner per day.

2358
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,640
That's the minimum.

2359
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:17,540
Right.

2360
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,540
To, to stay alive and maintain, you know,

2361
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,700
if you're fatty and you like overeating, no,

2362
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,080
you're not going to, that's, because if you

2363
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,480
did three meals, that's a third of a

2364
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,700
pound, you know, it's not much.

2365
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,380
Right.

2366
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,200
But you need a pound per, if you're

2367
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,920
doing a survival thing, by the way, it's

2368
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,040
a pound of food per adult per day

2369
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,460
and two pounds of liquid per day.

2370
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,580
Minimum a pound, 16 ounces, right, of water

2371
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:39,480
per day, minimum.

2372
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,080
But depending on the environment.

2373
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,100
Mm-hmm.

2374
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,780
You see, that's, that's your ratio.

2375
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:48,780
So a year's supply would be 365 pounds

2376
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,440
of food and 700 pounds of water.

2377
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,280
Yeah.

2378
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,060
I'm saying, you know, there's eight, eight pounds

2379
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,060
per gallon, right?

2380
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,040
Mm-hmm.

2381
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,280
It's eight and a half depending on the

2382
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,400
dissolved solids.

2383
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,440
It could be up to nine and a

2384
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,160
half if you have very heavy mineral water.

2385
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:02,800
Right.

2386
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,020
Those are the real, so once you understand

2387
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,580
these capacities, you see, you start to get

2388
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,280
more comprehension on what's going on.

2389
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,420
Mm-hmm.

2390
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,960
Yeah, you know, it's amazing, I was talking

2391
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,000
to someone, an old guy, he's about 80

2392
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,980
something now and he's into food storage since

2393
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,760
the Y2K.

2394
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,300
He still goes on and off about it.

2395
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,980
He didn't know the one pound per person

2396
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,320
per day and two pounds of liquid.

2397
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,300
He's been into it for 20 years and

2398
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,300
he doesn't, he didn't even know that ratio.

2399
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,220
Oh, Simple, yeah.

2400
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,480
Talk about not, it's like go to a

2401
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,460
local pastor or minister, ask them anything in

2402
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,800
the Bible.

2403
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,320
Oh, it doesn't matter what that says, it

2404
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,380
doesn't matter what, just have faith, my son.

2405
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,400
Yeah.

2406
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:42,920
Yeah.

2407
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,300
And just relax because we're going to give

2408
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,220
you some lubricant.

2409
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,300
Yeah.

2410
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,640
Just relax.

2411
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,380
Yeah.

2412
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,540
Whatever.

2413
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:52,260
Yeah.

2414
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,680
Why do you have both your hands on

2415
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,160
my shoulder?

2416
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,460
Yeah.

2417
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,620
Sick people, man.

2418
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:58,420
Oh, yeah.

2419
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,940
Not some of them, all of them because

2420
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,920
the ones that you think are good are

2421
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,060
part of a system that is inherently evil

2422
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,980
so you go figure out how you're going

2423
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,600
to sort your, so the people that think

2424
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,580
that there are good pastors and ministers and

2425
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:14,520
priests or whatever or rabbis or gurus or

2426
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,540
whatever, just don't forget that they're part of

2427
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,380
a group that condones abuse and evil.

2428
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,040
Right?

2429
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,140
Tie that into your patriotism.

2430
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,880
I have a friend who is a Nazi,

2431
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:24,420
you know.

2432
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,620
He's a nice guy, right?

2433
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,500
Yeah, but he's part of a group that

2434
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,640
sounds really bad that everyone's been taught to

2435
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,560
hate because of it, right?

2436
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,460
Whether it's true or not, that's the idea.

2437
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,840
So when I hear that he's a pastor

2438
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,380
or minister, I'm like, oh, his friend's a

2439
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:36,600
Nazi.

2440
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:37,660
What's the difference?

2441
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,440
Cosmically, they represent the enemy.

2442
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,600
And even though your priest, pastor, minister, priest

2443
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,000
or whatever is not directly related to representing

2444
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,020
Satan in his mind, he is directly representing

2445
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,640
the god of your nation, for sure.

2446
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,260
That, you know, the J-E-S-U

2447
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,620
-S, the American J-E-S-U-S

2448
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,080
or the Russian or the Mexican or the

2449
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,840
Canadian J-E-S-U-S, whichever, whatever

2450
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,940
they say, it doesn't matter.

2451
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,460
They can change it on a dime.

2452
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,060
And sometimes they do.

2453
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,760
And they do, yeah.

2454
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:11,540
They're pretty evil.

2455
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,200
Years ago, I was on a roundtable and

2456
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,380
I said, pretty much one-third of the

2457
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,160
population is just fixed on evil.

2458
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,420
Can't be changed.

2459
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,980
They'd rather die before they...

2460
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,180
Then if you put a gun to their

2461
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,840
head and said, stop being evil, I'll pull

2462
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,180
the trigger, they wouldn't know what you're talking

2463
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:25,920
about, most of them.

2464
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,300
But cosmically and objectively, they are.

2465
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,480
The other third is, another third is they're

2466
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,180
victims and the other thirds are just along

2467
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:32,720
for the ride.

2468
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,760
They can go either way.

2469
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,800
They're just cannon fodder.

2470
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:35,700
Useless.

2471
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,320
So what do you do?

2472
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,540
How do you sort that out?

2473
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,180
This is your world population.

2474
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,620
Right now.

2475
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:43,600
Yeah.

2476
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,760
Yeah, it's not very good.

2477
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,500
No.

2478
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,380
This is cosmic talk.

2479
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,860
Most people can't handle it, man.

2480
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:51,440
At all.

2481
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,920
That's okay.

2482
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,920
And you know that people say, it's not

2483
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,360
my problem.

2484
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,160
Oh, it will be.

2485
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:56,820
Remember Yoda?

2486
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,800
Maybe Skywalker?

2487
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,340
I'm not afraid.

2488
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,160
Oh, you will be.

2489
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,260
It will be your problem, all right.

2490
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,520
But you know what the best part of

2491
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,660
it being their problem is?

2492
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,020
They're not going to realize that it is.

2493
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,280
Yeah.

2494
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:13,240
They're going to go with it all the

2495
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:13,460
way.

2496
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,300
Even at the resurrection, they're still going to

2497
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,820
be talking shit.

2498
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,060
Yeah.

2499
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:22,680
Yeah.

2500
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,720
I'm telling you, man.

2501
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:24,700
Okay.

2502
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,080
I don't know if there's any questions or

2503
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,500
anything else.

2504
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,900
We did have one guy.

2505
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:30,720
Hi, Greek.

2506
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:33,200
Appreciate it when you talk about improving water

2507
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,720
quality.

2508
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,140
Do you have any recommendations on how to

2509
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,720
improve air quality?

2510
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,220
Same.

2511
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,900
Best way to do it is to...

2512
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,700
Are you ready for this?

2513
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,900
Create an artificial sun, which does...

2514
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,240
The sun is not a light bulb, by

2515
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:47,560
the way.

2516
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,460
It could be invisible.

2517
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,600
That allows the air to move where you

2518
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,900
have a rarefied rising cold and a descending

2519
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,420
heat, just like it is on the earth

2520
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,980
within a living space.

2521
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:59,300
That's the best.

2522
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,340
The second best is to have good convection

2523
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,700
that is not air forced through ducts.

2524
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,100
You know what I mean about convection?

2525
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,780
You open the top window, open the bottom

2526
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,800
window, the bottom of the window, the hot

2527
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,180
air, right?

2528
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,860
Better rise, yeah.

2529
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,480
The other thing about air quality that people

2530
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,440
should know, especially those that are structurally minded,

2531
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,800
is depending on the interior space, depending on

2532
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,300
what it's made of, is going to be

2533
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,620
dependent on how much dust you have.

2534
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,900
If you have a dirt floor, you're probably

2535
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,360
going to have more dust around than if

2536
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,360
you have a marble floor.

2537
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:30,800
Right?

2538
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:31,560
Yeah.

2539
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,060
So keep it clean.

2540
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,980
Carpets are notorious dust collectors.

2541
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,380
Here in the southwest where I am, the

2542
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,580
population since I've been here has more than

2543
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:41,980
doubled.

2544
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,820
And the car engines have more than, amount

2545
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,640
of combustion engines have more than doubled, but

2546
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,360
the pollution has gone down almost 70 or

2547
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,180
80%.

2548
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,440
And it's not because of the EPA.

2549
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,320
It's because I've been running, you know, devices

2550
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,640
that clear the air and prevent pollution from

2551
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,020
forming.

2552
01:21:59,560 --> 01:21:59,820
Right?

2553
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,640
So if you understand how the ether works,

2554
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,300
you can make a small rotating device.

2555
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,320
Some of them are the size of a

2556
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:05,860
coffee mug.

2557
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,760
I have a guy in Australia that's been

2558
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,480
experimenting with coffee mug size ambient ethereal translators

2559
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,380
for a couple of years now with great

2560
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:14,960
success.

2561
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,860
You can go into any place, any pollution,

2562
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,260
place that has bad air quality, increased air

2563
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,460
quality within three weeks and maintain it forever

2564
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:27,900
that way with a small coffee, you know,

2565
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,540
coffee mug size device that rotates.

2566
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,420
That's the other thing.

2567
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,160
That's what I'm employing and I enjoy it.

2568
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,040
I remember when I first moved here to

2569
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,740
the southwest, there was always an inversion layer

2570
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,400
and they had air warnings on the news.

2571
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,220
Don't breathe the air tomorrow.

2572
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,300
Oh, how are you going to avoid that?

2573
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:43,980
Right.

2574
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,760
You'd approach the city from a distance, let's

2575
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,400
say 30 kilometers out or 15 miles out,

2576
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,800
and you'd see the city and you'd see

2577
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,740
the sky and about, just hovering above the

2578
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,500
city was a thin band of brown.

2579
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,020
Right?

2580
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,240
And you'd see blue below and above it.

2581
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,560
Right?

2582
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:00,960
Right.

2583
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,760
Ever since I've been employing the rotating translators,

2584
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,320
that has not occurred ever here.

2585
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,560
That's impressive.

2586
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,700
Yeah, that's the truth.

2587
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:12,060
Yeah.

2588
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:12,660
And it's simple to do.

2589
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,580
The other thing is we can also change

2590
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,520
weather air quality at a distance.

2591
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,260
I've done several, I don't know, let's just

2592
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,860
not get into specifics, but, you know, international

2593
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:29,460
ones at a distance.

2594
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:33,100
I believe you mentioned about China one time,

2595
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:33,480
yes.

2596
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,460
Yes, yes.

2597
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,200
Somebody says, oh, did you get permission from

2598
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:36,620
them to do it?

2599
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,860
I said, no, I said, well, you could

2600
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,060
create an international incident.

2601
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,180
I said, that would be like the best

2602
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,180
thing I would go, if I knew I

2603
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,900
created an international incident between the Americans and

2604
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,940
the Chinese over that, man, oh, what an

2605
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,060
accomplishment if I had children and grandchildren.

2606
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,240
I'd say, my granddad did that, you know,

2607
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,380
started World War III, you know, or whatever.

2608
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,740
By cleaning the air.

2609
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,640
Like, who's that, the bullshit story that they

2610
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,560
gave you who started World War I was

2611
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,160
killing the ambassador Ferdinand, King Ferdinand, the assassination.

2612
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:06,960
Yeah.

2613
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,020
Which he wasn't really assassinated, his own people

2614
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:09,500
assassinated.

2615
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,340
They shot at him, the guy ran, he

2616
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,120
missed, and then his own people shot him

2617
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,000
twice or something.

2618
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Anyway.

2619
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:20,550
Yeah, that's pretty, I'd say the medical term

2620
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,210
cover your ears, fucked up if you ask

2621
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:22,470
me.

2622
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:23,630
You got that right.

2623
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:27,170
So, or snafu, or whatever, what's it, or

2624
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,010
in the military, FUBAR, yeah, FUBAR.

2625
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,550
FUBAR.

2626
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,670
FUBAR, and they've got in the army, those

2627
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,830
idiots, they got us saying soup sandwich when

2628
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,670
something's really messed up.

2629
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:38,170
Yeah.

2630
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,630
That's a soup sandwich, you know, you pour,

2631
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:40,830
yeah, so.

2632
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:44,490
So, that's our army rangers that do high

2633
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,530
lows and hey ho's, and I don't know

2634
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,750
what else they do, but, you know, paratrooping.

2635
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:51,430
So, yeah, yeah.

2636
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,390
All right, if there's nothing else, we'll call

2637
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:53,490
it.

2638
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,050
It's been a long night, just thought we'd

2639
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:56,330
come on, say hello and goodbye.

2640
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:57,330
Yeah, yeah.

2641
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,910
Subtleties are, are there.

2642
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:03,370
Again, just to wrap it up again, repeat

2643
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,950
a few salient points.

2644
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:05,750
Sure.

2645
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:08,650
Get over the, get over your daily grind,

2646
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,090
your weekly, monthly, yearly grind.

2647
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,010
Get over that you live to 60, 70,

2648
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:12,870
80, 90, or whatever.

2649
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:13,650
Get over that.

2650
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,650
Some of these things that the gods are

2651
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:16,890
engaging in are multi-generational.

2652
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,270
Like Dougreek, I know that, I've heard that.

2653
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:21,190
No, yeah, you might have heard, but have

2654
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,290
you internalized it?

2655
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:23,610
Right?

2656
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,170
Do you really know what that means?

2657
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,930
Mm-hmm.

2658
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:29,590
You know, are you able to fathom a

2659
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:32,990
plan that, whether you want to call them

2660
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:35,810
the global elite or the gods, they take

2661
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:37,050
hundreds of years to implement.

2662
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,530
Can you fathom that?

2663
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:40,770
And if you say yes, you're lying, because

2664
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,950
you can't fathom it.

2665
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:42,570
How?

2666
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,710
Yeah.

2667
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:45,430
How can you see what it takes?

2668
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,370
No one can really see it unless you've

2669
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:48,770
lived that long or been around that long.

2670
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:50,870
The best you can do is start to

2671
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:53,010
rationalize what it takes to do that.

2672
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,610
Begin to rationalize.

2673
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,010
Well, yeah, okay, so if it took 75

2674
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:01,810
years to implement this, that means grandma was

2675
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:05,230
born when they started, and now that she's

2676
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,710
old, you see, so you can start rationalizing

2677
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:09,770
it that way and saying, well, look at

2678
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:10,810
the rationale here.

2679
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:13,490
Look, this, you know how many things change

2680
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:15,750
over 75 years on a trend level?

2681
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,490
Many, many things.

2682
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:17,610
Right.

2683
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,250
How the entertainment has changed in those generations

2684
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:24,870
and what's been passed down and entertaining and...

2685
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:26,670
And what most people are affected by is

2686
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:26,970
trends.

2687
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,410
It's like, have you ever heard of Atkins

2688
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,690
diet or paleo diet?

2689
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,730
It's like the dumbest shit in the world

2690
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,870
until the next dumb shit comes out.

2691
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,770
You know, that's why very often I go

2692
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:36,470
on a Skype call.

2693
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,950
They're like, oh, the Greek, he's not going

2694
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:38,890
to like it.

2695
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:40,530
He's not going to like it before they

2696
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,690
even tell me what it is, you know.

2697
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,290
But why does it matter if I like

2698
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:45,490
it or not?

2699
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,970
Is it true?

2700
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:46,530
Is it bullshit?

2701
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,650
Well, you know, Greek, we need something to

2702
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,270
talk about.

2703
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,110
See ya.

2704
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:51,350
Yeah.

2705
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:53,350
Don't forget to get those orange vests and

2706
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:54,650
plastic brooms, guys.

2707
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,910
