1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,250
There's a light over the ocean.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,380
And greetings folks, we're live with the Greek.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,340
And how are you doing tonight, Greek?

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:16,860
Greetings.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,260
Doing okay.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, we'll just do another Sonic this week.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,960
See if we can catch up on stuff

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,480
casually.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,380
I hope people realize that I do not

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,540
go out of my way to do any

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:27,920
of this.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,880
If any of this public emanations or anything

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,880
puts inconvenience on me, I don't do it.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,580
So it's basically a very casual setup.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm not into making projects or writing books

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,800
or anything like a lot of morons are

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,460
thinking they're going to educate anyone or share

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,340
the truth.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,960
Actually, they don't even know what that is.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,840
That's why very often when you show someone

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
Greek speak, they can't handle that triple T

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,420
rating.

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,660
Right.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Anyway, they want rated S.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,860
Rated stupid.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,860
It's not just rated T, it's triple T.

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,220
So what's interesting is you have to always

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,300
look at why are you doing something?

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,680
I call it self-assessment.

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,440
What are you embarking on?

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll bring up a point.

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been looking a bit on the Internet

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,760
lately because I'm trying to put together a

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,380
couple of reference things for a project.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,940
It's interesting, there's a lot of stuff towards

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,760
Christians now regarding Biblical stuff.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,660
Like Christianity doesn't touch this or the church

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:40,880
doesn't.

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,340
What these morons don't know, meaning the Christians

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,100
or any religion, you could actually do the

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,500
same thing.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,020
There's a lot of it going on with

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,620
the Koran also, with Muslims.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,740
Not so much with Buddhists and Hindus because

45
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,520
they're already too far gone in terms of

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,820
a cognitive understanding or studying anything.

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,880
But what's interesting about the Christians is that

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,800
if they keep doing this studying, they're going

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,580
to find out that the truth and scripture

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,820
and history is 100% against Christianity.

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,060
In other words, there'll be nothing left.

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,120
You know how I keep saying that Christianity

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
is 0% Biblical?

54
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,580
It's true.

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,540
There's nothing of it as Biblical.

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
There's a difference between having the appearance of

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,340
it.

58
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,840
It's just like when you go to the

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,600
bank to get a loan.

60
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,340
They are not lending you anything.

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Zero.

62
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,920
There is no loan there.

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,400
It's really hard for people to comprehend that

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,240
because, well, it's been going on for so

65
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,540
long, everybody does it, nobody really knows what

66
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,040
you're saying.

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,940
That's not the point.

68
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,320
The point is, Christianity is 0% Biblical.

69
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,260
If it was 1% or 5%

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,180
and you were rational, you would have to

71
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,080
grant them that.

72
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,060
You'd have to say, well, it's Biblical here.

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,100
You can also say that it's a product.

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,260
You do know the reality of Christianity is

75
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,420
geographical.

76
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,500
It changes geographically.

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,640
There's a God under each geography or each

78
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,860
nation that rules it.

79
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,580
Even then, they can't see that.

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
The whole thing because there's a couple of

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,040
people out there trying to do lectures and

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,380
things.

83
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,400
I want to make a comment because sometimes

84
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll pull up a YouTube on metallurgy and

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,880
it'll say recommended for you because I'll look

86
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
up stuff of the period.

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
There'll be some guy doing a lecture on

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,440
how the Christianity tradition is contrary to Biblical

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,780
stuff.

90
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,120
I want to put a comment.

91
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,820
I'm like, if you actually knew the truth

92
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,220
and you told people the truth, no one

93
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,400
would listen to you, number one.

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,640
Number two, there is no single thread.

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,260
Actually, there are a couple of threads, but

96
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,400
there is no single thread that you can

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,720
pull that would unravel that entire cheap sweater.

98
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,080
You know how a cheap sweater, you keep

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
pulling it?

100
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,520
There's not just one thing you can pull

101
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,720
on.

102
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,300
I tend to find that the best thing

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,680
to pull on for the Christians is there

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,700
is no crucifixion.

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,620
I noticed I just now went up to

106
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,519
chat a little bit.

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,540
Was it you?

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,460
I was surprised.

109
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
I saw that a while ago.

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,160
Actually, that was from the 90s, wasn't it?

111
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,340
I didn't even read that.

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,100
I just saw the title.

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,100
I think that was recent.

114
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,840
That's what kind of caught my eye.

115
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,460
The overall setting, the context is true.

116
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
There is no crucifixion.

117
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,960
It was a stoning, but the rest of

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,840
it is a dummy load.

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,660
We can discuss why it's a dummy load

120
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,700
and how it's set up to be a

121
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,060
dummy load, spiritually also.

122
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,120
I remember that from the 90s.

123
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,880
Not in the 90s, but I remember that

124
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,460
early on when I was researching.

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,180
When I saw it, I said, no, this

126
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,520
is not the correct approach.

127
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,460
What's wrong about the approach is very simple.

128
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,160
It's trying to cite some kind of synoptic

129
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,060
apocryphal work or something.

130
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,200
You don't have to do that.

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
He did throw a lot of that in

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:12,780
there.

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,020
You don't need any of that.

134
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,440
No.

135
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,940
You just get it out of scripture itself.

136
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,340
It stands on its own.

137
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
That's the dummy load.

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,460
Right there, meaning it's not time yet.

139
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,700
You could plant the idea there was no

140
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,540
crucifixion and it was a stoning, but people

141
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,740
will say, that's not in the Bible.

142
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,100
That's from this thing here, but of course

143
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,920
it's in the scripture.

144
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,420
No one will see it because no one

145
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,000
studies it.

146
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
That's why I started off saying, if I'm

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,840
taking a nap and someone says, come talk

148
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,020
to give them some Greek speak, I'm like,

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,880
hell no.

150
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,540
When I wake up, maybe if I feel

151
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,000
like it.

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,660
Because there's no reason.

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,700
You have to know where you are.

154
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,020
There's no purpose for it other than just

155
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,260
for myself to say it.

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,460
Like I said, there's no one that can

157
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,780
articulate this that I've ever run into all

158
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,280
these years.

159
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Maybe one or two people.

160
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,440
Actually, someone that I'm no longer in touch

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,260
with maybe did.

162
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,600
I could say very clearly no one can

163
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,060
articulate Greek speak or these topics at all.

164
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,540
I've got to give a little bit of

165
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,180
credit A for effort, or E for effort,

166
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,700
to 6187 or whatever.

167
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,660
He says he tries to do it and

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,020
all that.

169
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,500
That's fine.

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,860
Yeah, I guess he does.

171
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,580
E for effort.

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
As it stands, I could clearly say how

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,800
simple any topic is.

174
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,740
It's not one thing or another.

175
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,240
It's can you look at anything objectively, reduce

176
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,300
it very quickly, simple terms.

177
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,040
That's why when we discuss scripture you'll notice...

178
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,600
And get to the point.

179
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,240
If you want to know the verses, go

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,040
look it up because you have computers now.

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,320
Even before that there were topical references you

182
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,700
could use before computers.

183
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm not going to give verses and whatever.

184
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,620
You go figure it out on your own.

185
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,560
That's the two old beef patties thing.

186
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,040
I'll give you the overall picture, which is

187
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,580
what you're lacking on anything.

188
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,520
That overall picture is lacking until there's clarity.

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,940
You've got to come up for some real

190
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,100
tacky music for the triple T rated Sonics,

191
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,340
right?

192
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,380
You know how they have triple X rated

193
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,760
music?

194
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,300
This is definitely triple T stuff.

195
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,560
The humans are in really bad shape.

196
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm having some coffee.

197
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,900
I'm going to mute out in a second.

198
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,760
Go ahead and entertain everyone for about 30

199
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,020
seconds.

200
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll be right back.

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,580
I'm going to make some noise.

202
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,380
I'm just going to mute.

203
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,700
All right.

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
Make some noise.

205
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,780
That I can do.

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,540
Let's go with that.

207
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,920
Okay.

208
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,280
That was quick.

209
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,300
And easy.

210
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,680
I had everything ready except for the grounds.

211
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
That happens.

212
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah.

213
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,240
And being crafty to put the cone right

214
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,520
over the glass instead of the carafe.

215
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,680
Hopefully people have already figured out that coffee

216
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,120
machines are for shitty coffee, right?

217
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
Because they ruin the coffee.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,160
Unless you have one of those special ones,

219
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,980
if you could put up with the synthesized

220
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,780
results, even though they're good coffees, those Koreg

221
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,060
machines, the little pods you put in there,

222
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,440
push a button and a needle with hot

223
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,940
water penetrate.

224
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,420
Okay.

225
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Those are very specific for that.

226
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,920
And they still use that same concept where

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,380
the water goes through it at pressure.

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,700
So I hope people have realized that the

229
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,260
way you make tea and coffee is not

230
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,600
the way that it's portrayed in the conventional

231
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,640
convenience modes with machines and things like that.

232
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,120
And you have very good sonic events based

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,980
on that alone.

234
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
So help yourself, folks.

235
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,920
Also, go back on the chat.

236
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,400
I think there's not much going on.

237
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,600
That's an interesting book.

238
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,680
If you know Greek speak, you'll get more

239
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,180
out of it.

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
Because it talks a lot about the ether

241
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
and how things are.

242
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,700
And if you know scripture, you'll know that

243
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,680
you'll get more out of it.

244
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,380
Because there's so much unknowable.

245
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,140
You know they say you only use 10

246
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,980
% of your brain.

247
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,340
It's actually like 1%.

248
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,000
The brain is fully functional.

249
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,140
It's just that they're telling you that the

250
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,020
only stuff you know is what's put out

251
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,360
by the state and the attorneys.

252
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,600
That was the other subject that I wanted

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,240
to bounce into if possible.

254
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Celebrityism.

255
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,320
The art of celebrity.

256
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,800
How it's affected culture.

257
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,220
How it's manipulated.

258
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,180
The tools of the mystery people.

259
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Those are the showmen.

260
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,460
That goes back to the circus.

261
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,200
The church.

262
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,900
The stars.

263
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,060
You'll notice that.

264
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,480
That's the circus.

265
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,540
Circus was a sacred place in ancient culture.

266
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,100
It was always a deity behind it.

267
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,340
That's why when you read...

268
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,460
How many times do stars come up in,

269
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,000
let's say, old sacred works?

270
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,040
Always.

271
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,980
So that's why they call themselves stars.

272
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,340
They're tying you into...

273
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,280
It's just a dummy load.

274
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,500
But at the same time, when you read

275
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,480
about ancient practices, that was done around entertainment,

276
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,620
as well as being sacred.

277
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,400
And how it controls the mobs, and what

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,160
it gives the mobs to think about.

279
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,460
The Gustav Le Bon stuff all kicks in.

280
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,520
It's like the perfect connection to the hive.

281
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,720
And also Alexander the Great, if you want

282
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,140
to call him that, did use entertainment.

283
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,360
He didn't do what the Romans and other

284
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,220
conquerors did.

285
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,640
He came in, and he just convinced a

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,400
group of people.

287
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,760
Literally convinced them.

288
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,680
Or persuaded them, I should say.

289
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,480
Whether it was through intimidation or finance or

290
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,140
whatever means.

291
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,700
And the initial projects that were put in

292
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,020
place by the Greeks Macedonians, when they went

293
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,440
through the world, was entertainment complexes.

294
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,720
Every area that he had conquered, supposedly, had

295
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
an amphitheater of some sort.

296
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,750
There's a place out in Afghanistan, middle of

297
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,270
nowhere, and they've dug up this Greek small

298
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,330
amphitheater.

299
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,490
He did it through entertainment.

300
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,090
That's why it's gotten to the point since

301
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,550
Walt Disney that now universities look at what

302
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,430
they are doing in entertainment and put that

303
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,170
in their textbooks.

304
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,390
Like the Kennedy assassination.

305
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,570
That was a television for the public.

306
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,530
Made for TV.

307
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,710
9-11 was literally a made for TV

308
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,510
event.

309
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,710
All these false flags.

310
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,970
By the way, speaking of false flags, you've

311
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,490
got to tip your hat to Iran.

312
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,570
I was watching the news, they had a

313
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,870
military parade shot up.

314
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,230
And obviously, I don't know if you've been

315
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,910
around ever or seen a real film what

316
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,750
it's like when people are getting shot at.

317
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,610
Or what they look like when they're shot.

318
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,890
Well, I have.

319
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,650
I'm not going to get into those details.

320
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,070
And if you saw the typical grainy footage

321
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,830
and the certain characters, the way they acted

322
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,390
with Iran, because typically these false flags are

323
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,490
used as a pretext for something else.

324
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,550
So the Persians are like, hey, they could

325
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,750
do it and it works for them to

326
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,510
justify things.

327
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,930
Why don't we do it and use it

328
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,090
to justify what we're doing?

329
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,470
It's very obvious in your face they did

330
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,850
it with the Plasco building.

331
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,410
Two years ago they imploded using a...

332
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,310
The interesting thing about the demolition charge, the

333
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,390
nuclear demolition charge that they use, well, first

334
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,550
of all, it wasn't really nuclear as it's

335
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,450
discussed now.

336
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,310
It was more of an atomic, which doesn't

337
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,410
go high yield.

338
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,010
Like the Murrow building in Oklahoma, that was

339
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,690
an atomic charge, not a thermonuclear.

340
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,430
In other words, if anyone understands how these

341
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,370
devices work, the atomic is a straight up

342
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,930
implosion of fissionable material.

343
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,130
The thermonuclear is an initial charge of fissionable

344
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,330
material setting off a mass of specially treated

345
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,870
water.

346
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,850
That's why they call it a hydrogen bomb,

347
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,670
not because it has anything to do with

348
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,030
hydrogen.

349
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,790
It's because it deals with a form of

350
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,810
water that starts with a T.

351
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,790
Actually, it's water that makes it.

352
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,990
So they did it with the Plasco building.

353
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,350
It's interesting, I researched the Plasco building pretty

354
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,910
closely and I didn't save it, but at

355
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,790
one point the NNSA got interested in the

356
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,630
Plasco building.

357
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,650
The NNSA is the National Nuclear Security Administration.

358
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,990
Why would they be interested in a small

359
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,690
office tower fire in Tehran?

360
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,410
And all the firemen were told, get away

361
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,010
from the building, it's going to be destroyed.

362
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,550
Not all the firemen, but the key people.

363
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,490
And also, after it fell, they were clearing

364
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,530
the debris and they're pulling out hunks or

365
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,090
masses of molten metal.

366
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,690
And it's 2700 degrees to maintain that.

367
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,050
So they were showing the world that we

368
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,910
could do it too.

369
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,610
The Americans did it and no one figured

370
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,590
it out, obviously.

371
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,370
Not no one, but the majority.

372
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,950
And we can justify whatever we want also.

373
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,670
So the Persians go back, if you remember

374
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,730
citing scripture in the Book of Daniel, that

375
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,430
was one of the toughest principalities of the

376
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,290
time to deal with.

377
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,290
So I just want to bring up that

378
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,370
aspect of Persia with the military.

379
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,230
Because right away, see, they're justifying the shooting

380
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,790
at the military parade to go after US

381
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,590
and Israeli interests.

382
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,890
Just blame it on them.

383
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,110
And the response was interesting.

384
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,910
The Americans said, look in the mirror, which

385
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,730
is the perfect answer.

386
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,330
Because look, yeah, we do it, you do

387
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:34,450
it.

388
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,270
Basically, you see yourself in the mirror.

389
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,750
There's no one else doing it.

390
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,390
It's very interesting when you can see how

391
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,750
much is being disclosed.

392
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,570
Oh, by the way, I'm reckoning around the

393
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,150
second day of the 8th moon, maybe the

394
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,770
third at noon.

395
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,950
I think it was the second, yeah, already

396
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,330
at noon.

397
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,730
It was the 8th moon, which was a

398
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,510
very bright moon.

399
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,390
We'll see how we get into a 13th

400
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:02,570
moon.

401
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,990
If not, we'll look at the possibility of

402
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,810
an intercalative year later.

403
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,349
So just beware of the dummy load and

404
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,589
other things like a dummy load.

405
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,650
Because if you're going to hide a dummy

406
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,390
load, you can't put a label on it.

407
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,130
Dummy load.

408
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,780
But humans are in really bad shape and

409
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,660
have been in bad shape.

410
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,200
People think it's contemporary, and it's not.

411
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,480
So I would say that it's chronic.

412
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,420
Chronic means you don't know the cause, basically.

413
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,820
When you say something is chronic, it's another

414
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,480
way of saying we only know about the

415
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,600
symptom, we don't know the cause.

416
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,240
Otherwise it wouldn't be chronic.

417
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,840
They would treat the cause and it would

418
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,380
go away.

419
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,080
Right, because they don't know the cause.

420
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,460
Instead of touting their ignorance, they just say

421
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,340
it's recurring.

422
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,340
Of course it's going to be recurring.

423
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,980
Also, someone put in about any Mexican or

424
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,280
Latin recipes.

425
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,060
I think that's interesting.

426
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,100
They probably have a propensity towards that flavor.

427
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,160
That's the wrong thing to ask me.

428
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,880
I don't.

429
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,560
I find them to be very primitive culturally,

430
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,220
Latins.

431
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,200
I should say that because I'm not talking

432
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,700
about European, I'm talking about the Americas, the

433
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,320
Caribbean, North and South.

434
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,100
I don't like very low base type unless

435
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,640
they have an influence from French or Italian

436
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,620
or other influences.

437
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,560
Because you've got to think about it.

438
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,880
The Caribbean and the American Latins, they did

439
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,940
not exist prior to the Jesuit-Catholic invasion.

440
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,880
The Jesuits and Catholics invaded the indigenous peoples

441
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,400
and then interbred with them.

442
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,820
They turned the countries into penal colonies.

443
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,080
Brazil, places like that were penal colonies.

444
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,440
So the worst of the worst of Europe

445
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,640
came over and interbred with the surviving Indian

446
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,200
stock.

447
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,940
That's your culture.

448
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,220
I personally don't like Mexican food.

449
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
I don't like Latin food.

450
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,960
I find it to be refreshing if you

451
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
come from a culture, let's say an area

452
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,720
geographically where it's a convenience food.

453
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,300
For example, if you live in New York

454
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,660
in the 70s, 80s and 90s, a convenience

455
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,500
food was not a fast food or McDonald's

456
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,900
or whatever.

457
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,740
It was going to a Dominican or Puerto

458
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,640
Rican restaurant because you got a big plate

459
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,180
of rice and beans for three bucks.

460
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
It was more than a pound or two

461
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,140
pounds of food.

462
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,260
You know what I mean?

463
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,800
The Mexican food back in the day, you

464
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,340
got a burrito which weighed more than a

465
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,860
pound for a few bucks.

466
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,200
You still can find them.

467
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,060
You have to look though.

468
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,140
You have to look.

469
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,140
They'll pack you full.

470
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,180
In other words, you need a pound of

471
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,260
food per day, but if you go buy

472
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,580
a burrito and it's a pound and a

473
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,280
half, you bring it home or if you

474
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,560
have the whole thing for lunch, your boss

475
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,660
is not going to be happy.

476
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
You'll want to nap after that.

477
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,460
To me, it's kind of like whatever.

478
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,900
My suggestion was study the food of Mexico

479
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,440
City.

480
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,740
Here in town, there's a lot of Mexican

481
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,640
in southwest Arizona, but it's the northern part

482
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,320
of Mexico, which is the poorest part of

483
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,680
Mexico.

484
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,440
It's crappy food because the quality, they don't

485
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,620
know, but they're just poor people.

486
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,040
They're just glad to eat, put something in

487
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,420
their belly.

488
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,220
There is a Mexican restaurant here that it's

489
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,880
not open anymore.

490
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,840
It was the cuisine of Mexico City and

491
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,460
the white people that went there didn't know

492
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,840
what to make of it because they didn't

493
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,880
have burritos and things like that.

494
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,500
They didn't have the mushy rice.

495
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,180
It was actually very well prepared, French influence.

496
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,740
You had butter sauces with white wine and

497
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,100
garlic.

498
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,360
You see what I mean?

499
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,600
It's very different.

500
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,360
If you have a propensity or you do

501
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,700
like Latin food, when you say that, I

502
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,280
don't think of it for myself, but I

503
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
know when people ask that question, tacos, beans

504
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,820
and rice, burritos, that type of stuff.

505
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,920
If you go to the east coast of

506
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,200
all of America, it's Dominican, Puerto Rican, Cuban.

507
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,820
It's just filler food.

508
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,580
I've been around people that are from that

509
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:05,920
culture.

510
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,400
They're pretty ignorant as a group generally.

511
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
They go for cheap flavoring.

512
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
Their food is loaded with salt and MSG.

513
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,520
It's always overcooked to death.

514
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,120
I don't like Latin food from that respect.

515
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,860
If you find a hybrid, let's say influence

516
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,640
of Mexico City is a quick one.

517
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,880
Argentina is very different also.

518
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,600
I would research and study that.

519
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,860
Personally, what I like to do is Eurasian

520
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,200
mix.

521
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,820
I like Asian recipes, all of Asia, and

522
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,880
European and Middle Eastern.

523
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:54,960
Basically, Eurasian, Mediterranean,

524
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,920
Eastern cuisine, Mediterranean, I call it.

525
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,620
I personally don't.

526
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,320
If there was a street that had Italian

527
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,700
food, Middle Eastern food, Israeli food, Mexican food,

528
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,720
Puerto Rican food, Cuban food, I wouldn't look

529
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,020
at the Mexican food or the Puerto Rican

530
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,340
food or the Dominican food.

531
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,580
I wouldn't even look at it.

532
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,280
I wouldn't even consider it if the other

533
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,860
ones were there.

534
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,260
That's me though.

535
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,680
The reasons I'm giving you, I think, are

536
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,620
founded in a qualitative nature, not a taste

537
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,080
factor.

538
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,620
I would clearly suggest if you want to

539
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,580
understand the height of what could be the

540
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,820
height of Latin food on this side of

541
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,120
the world, it would be the food and

542
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,220
culture of Mexico City, which is French.

543
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,360
It's always an interesting subject to tell people.

544
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,260
I don't cook Latin food.

545
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,880
I mean, other than beans and rice, I

546
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
do enjoy that.

547
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,340
It's better than hamburgers.

548
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,820
Beans and rice gets kind of tired after

549
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,220
a while.

550
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,220
Let's say you were living...

551
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,860
If you were going to live on it,

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
you'd be like, okay, well, it's always good

553
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,000
to have it around.

554
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,940
But other than beans and rice, you're going

555
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
to have to look for some Mediterranean influence

556
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,680
or something like that.

557
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,820
Again, if you've ever been to anyone's house

558
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,060
that's Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican or whatever, the

559
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,040
Mexican, everything's just overcooked.

560
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,280
This is typical, not always, but for sure,

561
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,380
if you expect the food to be overcooked,

562
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,680
overflavored like with synthetic flavorings, you will not

563
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,460
be disappointed.

564
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,500
They don't know how to cook meat.

565
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,780
They don't know how to cook rice.

566
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,320
I mean, it's just as a general group.

567
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,900
There might be an exception.

568
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,720
I've never met one, and I've always been

569
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,680
seeking out culinary adventures.

570
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,400
That's what I say about that.

571
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,160
Is it because I personally don't like them?

572
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,060
No.

573
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
I just don't like the quality that they

574
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,360
put out.

575
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,560
I like to say, well, I like American

576
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,900
food.

577
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,560
What should I do?

578
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,220
I say, steer away from the whole thing.

579
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't even bother.

580
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,580
Yes, is it possible?

581
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,820
There are now in New York City some

582
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,880
gourmet comfort food diners.

583
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,140
They have a mac and cheese.

584
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,760
They have American meatloaf.

585
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,840
It's like $35 for a meatloaf plate, but

586
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:44,200
it's like Angus and Kobe beef with organic

587
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,880
sourdough.

588
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,780
You know what I mean?

589
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,960
It's like really high-end ingredients, but still

590
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,900
that's a very rare exception.

591
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,280
My suggestion is if you like the umami,

592
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,760
food that tastes good without using synthetic flavors,

593
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,900
I would suggest gearing towards obviously being cross

594
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,280
-latitude, but a Eurasian, Mediterranean diet.

595
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,120
Figuring out what people in European countries eat

596
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,480
and figuring out what people in Asian countries

597
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,860
eat.

598
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,540
Making a mix of that.

599
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,700
That works by the way, north and south.

600
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
When you flip over the...

601
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,340
Let's say you're in Australia and it's cold.

602
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
Don't bother looking cross-latitude on Australia.

603
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,900
You're going to find a lot of ocean

604
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,700
and a bunch of people that are eating

605
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,840
extremely local indigenous fruits and vegetables and crickets,

606
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,760
basically.

607
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,940
You're not going to do well on the

608
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,500
southern hemisphere cross-latitude.

609
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,280
You're best flipping up to the northern hemisphere

610
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,420
and just like I think someone I see

611
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,480
is learning about Korean food.

612
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,460
Yes, the best thing about Korean food is

613
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,900
and strictly the best thing about Korean food

614
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,740
is resetting one's positive intestinal flora and fauna,

615
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,500
which would be they use a lot of

616
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:12,900
pickles.

617
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,840
A lot of fermented vegetables and fish.

618
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,920
There's a pretty good Korean barbecue place here.

619
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,260
It's run by a bunch of old ladies,

620
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,700
literally.

621
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,280
The youngest cook is 75 and there's one

622
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,900
that manages about 90.

623
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,880
Looks like four of these old women.

624
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,660
Yeah, they're really slow though, so you got

625
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,800
to go on an off day.

626
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,900
I walked in there recently and there was

627
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,200
half the tables were full and half of

628
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,140
those half people had menus open, which means

629
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,700
they haven't ordered yet and we were sitting

630
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,840
there for 20 minutes still and no orders

631
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,160
taken.

632
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
In other words, going to a place that's

633
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,520
operated by the youngest person is 75.

634
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,500
It sounds good, but it practically isn't.

635
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,040
The service is not going to be good,

636
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,300
right?

637
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,340
But anyway, we ordered just a simple rice

638
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,940
dish and she comes with a platter with

639
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,840
five smaller dishes of various pickles.

640
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,140
Pickled root vegetable, pickled cabbage, a steamed spinach,

641
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,940
a pickled fish cake.

642
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,280
So, you know, the pickle and fermented foods

643
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,060
are biologically active, right?

644
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,660
That's what yogurt is known for.

645
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,120
Preserved foods are biologically active.

646
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,620
And they tend to reset the ecology and

647
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,600
environment in one's gut, let's just say.

648
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,500
And the gut I define from the back

649
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,440
of the throat all the way down to

650
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,780
just before about a couple of feet before

651
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,840
it makes its way out.

652
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,000
I think the large intestine, the very end

653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,480
of the colon, I wouldn't think is part

654
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,840
of your gut and your mouth isn't, but

655
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
the back of your throat is I would

656
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,920
suggest.

657
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:53,920
It's your gut.

658
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,880
Because you have a pain in your stomach,

659
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,120
you kind of feel it all the way

660
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,900
up there, you know.

661
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,120
And it will naturally close and contract so

662
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,480
you don't eat, you know, if you're not

663
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,800
hungry.

664
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,160
So I would say that's your gut.

665
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,380
So that whole entire area is where you

666
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,880
have that, I call it positive intestinal flora

667
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,300
and fauna, fungus and bacteria.

668
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,340
Undefined as people would like to define it

669
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,560
using their orthodox sciences, meaning they're there, there

670
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,020
is an active layer on the body that

671
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,040
assists symbiotically your body to maintain proper digestion

672
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,400
and transmutation and induction of food.

673
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,520
So pretty much that's the spiel on that.

674
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,580
And if anybody else got any other spiel,

675
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,260
which is German for speak, I guess, right?

676
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,240
Or Yiddish, actually.

677
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,380
Sprach.

678
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,160
Sprach is Deutsch for speak.

679
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,250
Yeah, so again, back to the food, there

680
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,430
is a seasonal change.

681
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,470
I would suggest Mediterranean, Eurasian.

682
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,590
Right, exactly.

683
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,250
And the food is not getting better.

684
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,370
I'm seeing things in the open markets, you

685
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,950
know, that the livestock shop at that I

686
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,230
never imagined would be pre-cooked and vacuum

687
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,750
sealed on a shelf, unrefrigerated kind of thing.

688
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,290
Like, you know, I've seen that.

689
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,870
I've seen things vacuum packed and pre-prepared

690
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,370
things that I never imagined would be such.

691
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,930
Like pre-cooked rice vacuum packed on a

692
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,870
shelf for sale.

693
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,850
I mean, that's like MRE stuff.

694
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,470
You know what I mean?

695
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,190
Like meal ready military food.

696
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,130
And people are buying, they don't know.

697
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,230
Right now it's down to just livestock management,

698
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,750
whether you're whether it's the sniffles, the cold,

699
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,110
food, government, education, religion, all that stuff that's

700
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,090
out there that people are dealing with or

701
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,290
involved in is simply livestock management.

702
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,490
They're like nothing more than livestock at this

703
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:35,790
point.

704
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,290
Human livestock.

705
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,900
Odds and ends.

706
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,300
I have greetings.

707
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,980
Just tuned in and wanted to try to

708
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,140
pop a question in.

709
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,840
Recently listened to an old talk show and

710
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,000
the Greek briefly mentions his involvement with manufacturing

711
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,340
copper tools for working with soil because the

712
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,100
way of iron tools discharge the networks in

713
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,540
the soil.

714
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,700
Just wondering if there's anyone out there who

715
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,120
has put together a good report on the

716
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,400
subject.

717
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
Can't find anything on the rectangle.

718
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,340
Thank you.

719
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, I've done that before.

720
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,400
I actually have them here.

721
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,340
I could post some photographs, but not necessary.

722
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:15,680
I think Shawberger basically came up with the

723
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,120
idea through observation on how ancients used farm

724
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,800
implements or what they were made of also

725
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,140
and how they used them.

726
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,920
Yeah, there's a PK Institute in Sweden I

727
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,600
think makes them still.

728
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,100
Basically non-ferrous.

729
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,120
Plastic would be just as good pretty much.

730
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,180
Just non-ferrous because you're cutting.

731
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,460
I've done some pretty good remedial work with

732
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,580
it, but I haven't taken photographs.

733
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,180
I might have photographs actually with a pecan

734
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,980
farm and other things like that in question

735
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,780
I should say, but we have done experimentation

736
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,160
and the direct comparison in some cases is

737
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,880
outstanding and sometimes it's very minimal, but it's

738
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,660
always better with the copper implement.

739
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,300
If you want to get into a more

740
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,260
materialistic observation of what happens just like here

741
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,100
because of the way iron tools discharge the

742
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,000
networks in the soil, one way to consider

743
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,200
those networks also is to consider them like

744
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,060
a small capillary void in the soil.

745
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,980
If soil is not hard packed that means

746
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,620
that there's air space in it, right?

747
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,340
And those air spaces after the soil settles,

748
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,360
let's say even if it's loamy soil natural

749
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,440
sediment in the forest develops these vertical chambers

750
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,620
that go to the surface like a pore

751
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,780
all the way down and those chambers that

752
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,740
have air in it tend to leach.

753
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,320
You ever see how crystals leach to the

754
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,780
surface?

755
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,020
If you put a wet cloth on a

756
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,720
piece of metal like iron or copper you

757
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
come back a couple of days later you

758
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,460
notice that the oxides have leached to the

759
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,440
surface through the cloth.

760
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,639
So what will happen is you will have

761
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,380
these copper and magnesium and other non-ferrous

762
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,040
metals from dragging these tools in the soil

763
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,480
coat these capillaries in the soil and that

764
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,920
coating, that non-ferrous coating in the soil,

765
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,880
the air space of the soil is the

766
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,239
beneficial because it's also, it prevents certain fungus

767
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,360
from multiplying, it attracts water it's cooling, a

768
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,560
very simple methodology to consider for commercial farms

769
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,400
and I've given advice several times years ago

770
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,800
and it's worked every time with commercial farms,

771
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,960
let's say with citrus, if there is a

772
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,280
heat wave right, a heat wave coming, I

773
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,600
suggest they replace all of the irrigation nozzles

774
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,420
or if they have a water truck with

775
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,700
a good brass, magnesium tin alloy brass or

776
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,880
a pure copper nozzle and the water that

777
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
goes over that nozzle at pressure will tend

778
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,420
to have a greater cooling effect than water

779
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,160
that goes over an iron or plastic nozzle,

780
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,100
so it will reduce the harm of a

781
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,440
heat wave on citrus plants.

782
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,460
The opposite, when there is a frost, you

783
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,680
often hear of a frost threatening let's say

784
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,580
Florida citrus crop right, what you do there

785
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,280
is you irrigate with an iron nozzle, not

786
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,700
a steel, now iron when you say iron

787
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,480
it sounds common, it's very difficult to find

788
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,700
pure iron almost all, like an iron, a

789
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,180
very soft iron still has carbon in it,

790
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,300
pure iron is very difficult to find but

791
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,460
a soft iron nozzle the water that goes

792
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,520
through the nozzle will tend to hold heat

793
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,900
and radiate heat itself because of the iron

794
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,480
it will have a warming effect and prevent

795
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,340
the frost from damaging the citrus, so there

796
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,420
is one aspect of it.

797
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,620
At this point if you do have iron

798
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,180
implements, you can coat them with various types

799
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,280
of industrial paints, there are some really good

800
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,840
epoxy paints by the way, like garage floor

801
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,160
epoxies, have you heard of those?

802
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,600
There is the re-tub for the bathtubs,

803
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,360
the two part any paint or coating that

804
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,380
is two part part A, part B, the

805
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,980
catalytic that's an epoxy, that's far more durable

806
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,140
than a regular paint.

807
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,860
I've had some success with coating iron things

808
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,840
with epoxies it will have to be done,

809
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,500
re-coated obviously, because the edge will not

810
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,920
maintain.

811
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,440
What you could do is take, if you

812
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
have let's say iron shovels or whatever, or

813
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,560
iron implements on a farm is epoxy coat

814
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,420
them, or epoxy coat them, right?

815
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,700
Also there is pool epoxies, you know, they're

816
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,200
all over in the 70's it was $500

817
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,660
a gallon, now you can get an epoxy

818
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,840
for less than $50 a gallon, or $80

819
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,440
a gallon, so it's really come down in

820
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,100
price and avoid the polyester resin ones, they're

821
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,000
not that strong but if that's all you

822
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
have you could use it, you know, it's

823
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,860
the stuff that you make fiberglass resin out

824
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,520
of but what you can do is, I've

825
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,360
done this in the past also on larger

826
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,540
pieces is we go and source out a

827
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,800
brass strip literally just a strip of brass

828
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,700
or copper and form that, drill holes in

829
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,760
it, and use brass screws on the edge

830
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,640
of the implement, the cutting edge because that's

831
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
the part that's going to continue to wear

832
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,020
after the body of the implement which is

833
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,400
iron is epoxy coated.

834
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,840
Now you could, I would suggest using stainless

835
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,940
steel screws because if you use the brass

836
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,780
through the iron you'll get galvanic corrosion and

837
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,540
it'll corrode off but I haven't really witnessed

838
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,420
that because the brass pieces tend to wear

839
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,840
off and have to be redone before the

840
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,520
corrosion sets in, so stainless steel screws with

841
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,640
a brass edge or copper on the implement

842
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,220
another thing you can do if you really

843
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,740
want to harken back to primitive days you

844
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,360
build the body and the tool itself out

845
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,780
of wood, completely out of wood and just

846
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,900
the very edge has a copper or brass

847
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,700
strip attached to the cutting edge because that's

848
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,420
the part that will wear so now you

849
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,460
have a wooden rake, a wooden shovel, a

850
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,480
wooden hoe with just a metallic edge because

851
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
the body of the tool is there to

852
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,780
support the load, not do the cutting, and

853
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,360
also hold the shape of the tool.

854
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,570
So, well just like what were the first

855
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,390
cars made of?

856
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,850
Wagons, right?

857
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,110
What are wagons made of?

858
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,350
Wood.

859
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,430
Everything was pretty much made out of wood

860
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,310
it was simple, and if you needed an

861
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,510
edge on it, well you put on the

862
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,870
appropriate edge that's another way to, now the

863
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,770
differences could be small they could be great,

864
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,510
it depends on the soil, again with the

865
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,710
tools if you're in a desert environment like

866
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,870
I am, what you do above ground there's

867
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,870
some kind of demonic force in the desert

868
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,970
that no matter how much you try to

869
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,270
mitigate the soil, amend the soil, you know

870
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,830
it's this hard calcified soil, as hard as

871
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,210
a rock with high clay, you dig it

872
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,310
up and you add manure vermiculite, things to

873
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,850
make it light and loamy, and two weeks

874
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,490
later it's hard as a rock again, it's

875
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,370
like as if the earth just ate all

876
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,490
the nutrients out of it.

877
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,230
Yeah, it's amazing how the desert is that

878
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,490
way, and you think well, from a materialistic

879
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,330
physics and scientific point of view that shouldn't

880
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:03,950
be happening.

881
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,610
If you amend two feet of soil, it

882
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,990
should stay amended unless there's erosion, runoff but

883
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,990
it just seems to be something major, so

884
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,450
the thing to do out here in the

885
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,450
desert is I just do above ground boxes,

886
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,650
I get like building rafters, 12 inch timber

887
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,170
and I build a box and then import

888
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,870
soil, and I do gardening that way so

889
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,610
in that case there may not be that

890
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,650
much of a difference with the copper tools,

891
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,110
because I don't need tools, because it's already

892
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:42,010
a big planting box and I don't think

893
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,510
that would make any difference because I have

894
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,870
tried and broken quite a few tools trying

895
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,650
to amend the desert environment.

896
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,790
There are certain things that do well in

897
00:40:50,790 --> 00:41:02,160
the desert certain plants yeah, he's

898
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,320
just up to shit, what he did, he

899
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,460
decided to pour sulfuric acid on the soil

900
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,380
to amend it, and it foamed and burned

901
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,180
the soil, not burned with flame, and he

902
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,700
noticed this white powder forming on everything, and

903
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,880
it's not monatomic by the way, there's no

904
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,420
such thing as monatomic, but it's a name,

905
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,580
it's popular, people when you say that they

906
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,260
know what you mean, it's a form of

907
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,260
transmutation so it's like a proto material, proto

908
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,000
meaning first like a protozoa, meaning one cell

909
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,380
yeah, he was doing cotton and feedstock and

910
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,480
other things like that but he got, he

911
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,340
comes from a long family of farmers up

912
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,500
in the Phoenix area but he got absorbed

913
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,100
by the new agers so he got, they

914
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,580
finished his ass off pretty quick David Hudson

915
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,240
yeah, actually he anyway, I don't need to

916
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,020
get into the whole monatomic story, I have

917
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,820
some of his stuff those powders, I have

918
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,180
the real deal, the old, I have some

919
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,700
rhodium actually I could put it on a

920
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,980
camera, only you would see it, or I

921
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,900
should take a photograph of it I have

922
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,640
the stuff that was made in his lab

923
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,380
it's this ultra light fluffy powder lighter than

924
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,100
anything maybe I'll put it on camera, maybe

925
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,900
you could see it Bruce let's see if

926
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,100
I can get it, it might be kind

927
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:46,380
of dark in here but let's see got

928
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:46,860
it?

929
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,380
I'll tumble it so you can see how

930
00:42:51,380 --> 00:43:01,320
light it is it's

931
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:09,580
really light yeah alright, this is from Hudson's

932
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,940
laboratory this is about 20 some odd years

933
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,840
old it has to be polycarbonate, if you

934
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,040
put it in glass it will start going

935
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,940
away to who knows where, it just disappears

936
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,420
and if you put it in polyethylene it

937
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,360
will dissolve the polyethylene or make it really

938
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,520
hard and brittle so it has to be

939
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:39,420
polycarbonate ok, so yeah, I

940
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:47,420
guess so I would suggest there's a lot

941
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,980
I could suggest regarding copper tools the concept

942
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,360
regarding the copper tools was based on a

943
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,820
form of futurism when you say futurism what

944
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,220
does it mean?

945
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,700
Well, we need to stop using as much

946
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,580
iron and use copper and non-ferrous materials

947
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,740
for better farming in the future, for the

948
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,200
future generations you don't have a future, sorry

949
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,520
I'm not breaking the news to anyone, I

950
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,440
think everyone inherently knows that by now but

951
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:31,020
yeah well, you mean the copper

952
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,940
monetizing or the iron monetizing?

953
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,760
yeah, well the thing is, the problems that

954
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,840
humanity has is much bigger than anything they

955
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,640
could realize, I should say in other words,

956
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,620
it's beyond their control but it will be

957
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,680
more clear later, at this point you don't

958
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,600
want to eat plastic food or toxic food

959
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,340
and if you are gardening and you want

960
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,560
a higher yield and all that, that's another

961
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,180
thing for yourself, but from a futurist or

962
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,320
a social point of view, they're screwed, that's

963
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,220
for sure so again, just to make a

964
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,960
suggestion if you are gardening and you want

965
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,300
to use non-ferrous implements put a coating

966
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,760
over it, put a non-metallic edge or

967
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,400
a non-ferrous metallic edge on it, brass

968
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,240
strips are pretty cheap and easy to get,

969
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,620
the best place to go is a metal

970
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,820
recycling place yep, you buy it by the

971
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,940
pound versus by the fitting, by the piece

972
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,440
that's pretty much it, aluminium should be okay

973
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,320
to a certain degree but I would suggest

974
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,000
stay away from aluminium because once it does

975
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,580
once the body recognizes it internally it shuts

976
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,400
down your electric brain, literally it shuts down

977
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,000
your brain piece by piece and it causes

978
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,780
a lot of disturbances in the body which

979
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,920
could lead to what's called overactivity, which is

980
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,220
another term commonly known as cancer which is

981
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,060
an overactivity of cells that's the simplest thing

982
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,320
when you discuss cancer, it's overactivity well how

983
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,900
do you know it's overactive, well because you've

984
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,820
got something growing where it shouldn't be and

985
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:29,320
it's growing fast and harmful so can't

986
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,360
hear Bruce by the way, I can hear

987
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,620
you do you want to reload the call

988
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,920
or maybe somebody, actually I've heard emails about

989
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,980
people not having problems with audio while we're

990
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,760
streaming so I think it's on their end

991
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,440
if I can hear you, yeah if I

992
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,420
can hear it's going on the stream do

993
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,820
you want to mute out and check the

994
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,560
stream real quick or say something and mute

995
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:02,700
out you should mute out, oh you're now

996
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,040
coming through yeah you might want to check

997
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,080
it out otherwise I don't see anything else

998
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,290
yep they won't hear you saying that but

999
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,550
let's just call it a short one this

1000
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,690
time and I think we've covered enough for

1001
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,230
this week thanks Bruce and Bruce says goodnight

1002
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,070
everyone and see you next time, thanks Bruce,

1003
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,750
bye bye
