1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,280
And greetings folks, we're live with the Greek

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,680
and how are you doing today, Greek?

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,340
Oh, doing.

4
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,980
I see we're okay.

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm just going on to the chat.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm going to drop a couple food photos,

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
maybe one of a four minute pizza, literally

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,020
just a very simple pizza, yeasted dough.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,680
And you build it, if you have a

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,620
gas stove, you just build a tent right

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,680
above the broiler area, remove the broiler baffle

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,740
tray and your thermostat no longer works.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,580
And if you have a pyrometer, it'll reach

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,940
six or 700 degrees within three minutes, which

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,480
is really good for doing a pizza.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,580
Yeah, you'll burn down, you don't want to

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,800
run it for more than 10 or 15

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,440
minutes because you could damage the steel and

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,280
the fixtures on the door handles and all

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,380
that, depending on whatever.

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,820
So I think we're going to have someone

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,740
join us as well.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
I'll bring him in right now.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's see if he picks up.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,000
He says whenever he's ready.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,380
People have heard.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,540
It's Sam.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,460
So what are you doing?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
I think he's on.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,740
Sam, welcome.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,600
We're off with Bruce.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,480
Greetings, Sam.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,880
Greetings.

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,820
Can you hear me?

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,180
Yes.

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,460
A little bit of microphone rumble of some

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,060
kind, but otherwise it's okay.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,440
Yeah, I was just moving it.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,900
I don't think it's rumbling anymore.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,700
Okay.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,220
Yeah, so I just opened up doing some

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,180
work today and stuff and how to modify

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,100
an oven to make a four minute pizza.

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,200
Came out pretty good.

45
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,700
That's pretty clever.

46
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,140
I just dropped it in a Greek chitango.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,060
Oh, there you go.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,420
You see it?

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,060
Yeah.

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,480
And that's a pesto.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,680
I have basil out in the garden, chopped

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,340
it up with some garlic.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,160
That makes me look hungry.

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,980
That's a pretty professional looking pizza.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
And it's actually, the crust is really thick,

56
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,080
but the actual pie itself is extremely thin,

57
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,820
cracker thin.

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,640
Right.

59
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,140
And I used a Fleischmann's yeast, honey, olive

60
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,460
oil, salt, two hours for rise, knocked it

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,660
down, spread it out using a wine bottle,

62
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,960
and there you go.

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,900
It's about 14, 15 inch pizza.

64
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,300
So I had most of it yesterday, some

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,100
of it for breakfast.

66
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,860
Very well done.

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,060
Very well done.

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,980
The cheeses are like cheddar, brie, and a

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,500
little bit of fresh mozzarella and parmesan.

70
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,800
So there you go.

71
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I just wanted to, I don't think I've

72
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,140
ever posted pizzas that I make that you

73
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,080
don't have to, I mean it looks pretty,

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,820
you could put it on a cooking magazine,

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,020
right?

76
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,700
Oh, yes, yes.

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,900
You don't have to use yeast.

78
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,220
It'll work well, just as well with a

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,800
flatbread.

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,460
If you do use an egg with the

81
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,120
dough, you'll get a little bit of rise

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,600
because egg offers leavening.

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,260
Right.

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:33,980
Right.

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,060
So there you go.

86
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
There's a pizza.

87
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,640
Looks nice.

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Yeah, it's four minutes to cook.

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,100
Two minutes and then I rotate it.

91
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,780
What I should really do to offer more

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,540
of a semblance of how to do it

93
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,640
at home is to open the oven and

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,300
photograph what it looks like in there.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,480
Yeah.

96
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,680
How I rearranged everything.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,220
Yeah.

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,200
Now if you look at the pizza to

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
the top right, you see the rectangle, look,

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,840
gray metal.

101
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,560
It looks a rectangle bar kind of thing,

102
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,260
like an ingot.

103
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,780
That's a four pound or two and a

104
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,900
half kilo or two kilo diver's weight, and

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,080
you can see the slots in it.

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,420
That's where you run the belt through, so

107
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,600
you put those around your waist when you

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,779
go diving to hold you down.

109
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,120
I have four of those that I use

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
in cooking, you know, and right behind it

111
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,620
you'll see there's a white porcelain thing with

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,680
a groove cut in the bottom.

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,900
That's a coffee mug, and I use the

114
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,540
diamond blade to cut that groove, so when

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
you have a strap handle lid, it straddles

116
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:32,940
the lid.

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,660
So that's my ghetto pressure cooker.

118
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
What I should do is take a photo

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
of the kitchen area there, show you how

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,620
it's been modified, what I've used, just so

121
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,180
you can...

122
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,140
You are a man of many talents.

123
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,020
But basically, the easiest way to modify any

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,120
oven or range is you allot whatever area

125
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,440
of volume your food tray or whatever, let's

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
say it's a pizza, you don't need a

127
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,980
lot of height, right, because the pizza, you

128
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,940
know, give yourself two inches is plenty.

129
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,020
If you're going to tent at three, it's

130
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,000
more than enough, because the pizza is not

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,940
going to be that high.

132
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,140
So basically, on the bottom tray, you just

133
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,160
measure up about three inches or so the

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
first rung, and just coat that with aluminum

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,060
foil, completely closed off.

136
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,860
So when the fire comes up from underneath,

137
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,560
it will form a tent area.

138
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,660
Now, your thermometer, I mean, your thermostat no

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,920
longer works, obviously.

140
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,320
You know, if I set the thermostat to

141
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,140
300, it's still running.

142
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,620
But if I put a pyrometer underneath my

143
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,760
tented area, it's at 700.

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
You get it?

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,100
So this is just something to do a

146
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,420
fast high...

147
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,820
Yeah, I figured I'd post it because it

148
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,240
came out...

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,540
And all the pizzas I do look like

150
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,720
that.

151
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't mean to brag.

152
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,480
They all look like that whenever I've done

153
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,540
pizzas, even the ones that have no leavening,

154
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
but you don't have the crust, you know.

155
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,420
The ones that don't have leavening are done

156
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,300
under two minutes.

157
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,940
And by the way, that's still bubbling, the

158
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,540
photo there.

159
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,080
You could see the cheese is still bubbling.

160
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,980
So, okay, well, I just wanted to throw

161
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,540
that in there.

162
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,700
I like to be practical other than doing

163
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,320
lower ball joints on minivans and stuff like

164
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,600
today.

165
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,740
So anyway...

166
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah, thank you for the pizza insight.

167
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,440
It also works on what's called a mini

168
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,300
electric oven.

169
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,940
It works the same way.

170
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,340
You just tent off the area, you know.

171
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,920
So an electric stove or oven, they have

172
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,660
elements, I think, above and below, right?

173
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,120
And you need both in an electric.

174
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,320
So you're going to have to figure out

175
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,120
which one you're going to use, because if

176
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,600
you have an electric, I'd say use the

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,920
top element or the bottom element, depending on

178
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
which tray you're using.

179
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,080
See, this is a double layer metal sheet,

180
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,420
not the thin...

181
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,520
You know, a lot of cookie sheets are

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,300
real thin single, but the better, more professional

183
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,980
ones, let's say, have a double layer so

184
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,680
the thin metal doesn't burn.

185
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
You're familiar with those, right?

186
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,240
So with an electric, what you want to

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,480
do is...

188
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,440
Two things you could do.

189
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,140
It's difficult to tent, because you need both

190
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,520
elements.

191
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,740
You...

192
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,640
Instead of doing it on a tray, you

193
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,740
do it in a large pan.

194
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,820
So you put the pizza in the pan

195
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,640
and put it on the stovetop and start

196
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,860
heating it on the stovetop and get under

197
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,480
it with a fork until it gets golden

198
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,860
brown.

199
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,080
And then you just stick it in the

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,180
toaster oven or the electric range as high

201
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,240
as possible, top element, just to brown it

202
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,760
on the top.

203
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,140
So it's a two-stage cooking.

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,380
Wow.

205
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,080
Hmm.

206
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,040
Right?

207
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,180
So here's one thing about...

208
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,720
The cookie sheet acts more as a diffuser,

209
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,360
then, too.

210
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,920
Yes, it's a diffuser.

211
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,800
You've ever cooked with metal, thin metal, it

212
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,500
always burns?

213
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,580
Yes, yes.

214
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,100
So the more utilitarian cookie sheets are double

215
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,520
layered.

216
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,180
If you...

217
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,820
Most of the...

218
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,220
You don't want to...

219
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,100
When you buy cookie sheets, they're real inexpensive

220
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,780
and flimsy, but if you go to a

221
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,880
restaurant supply or a good baking supply, you'll

222
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,260
notice they're not as flimsy, even though they

223
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,560
are thin, because if you look at it

224
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,700
closely, it's two layers.

225
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,640
And they usually have a mineral fiber in

226
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,000
between.

227
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,660
Right.

228
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,440
So you don't get that burn.

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,240
So each thin layer tends to overheat and

230
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,340
it diffuses exactly.

231
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,780
Yeah.

232
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,700
So instead of spending $1.50 on a

233
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,620
pizza pan, I think the double layer one

234
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,960
costs about $10, because it's...

235
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,900
More worth it, yeah.

236
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, because it's a restaurant or

237
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:38,919
whatever.

238
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,980
Now, you could use a stone also, which

239
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,820
is superior, but you're not going to get

240
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,420
a four-minute cook with a stone, because

241
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,700
the stone has to be hot.

242
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,800
You don't want to put the pizza on

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,500
a cold stone.

244
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Right.

245
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,340
So you're going to have to give it

246
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,040
an hour to heat.

247
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
So anyway, I just wanted to throw this

248
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,480
in, because I think I've discussed uneven heat

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,580
application in food is what renders those complex

250
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,320
flavors that you get when you have a

251
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,860
good meal.

252
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,720
You know what I mean?

253
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,300
Well, you got me curious again, and I

254
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,660
think that'll be on the list soon.

255
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah.

256
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,740
Try it.

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,640
And tent off a variable volume stove.

258
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,460
Okay, yeah.

259
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,980
And it saves on energy.

260
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,880
Imagine your standard oven, to get it up

261
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
to a 350, preheat, takes 15 minutes at

262
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,000
least.

263
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,660
Even tell you on the white people food

264
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,200
packages, 15 minutes, right?

265
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,520
Right.

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,920
Preheat.

267
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Well, when you partition the volume and decrease

268
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,220
it, it goes to 350 in about 40

269
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,720
seconds.

270
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,300
So what that shows on the utility bill,

271
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:55,780
right?

272
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,480
The difference.

273
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,320
Also makes sense if you're off the grid,

274
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,360
obviously, right?

275
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Oh, definitely.

276
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,640
Some people have to have propane tanks full,

277
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,180
you know, when you go out of the

278
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,040
city, if you have gas or whatever.

279
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,020
Anyway, okay.

280
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,230
So what's going on?

281
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,070
Sam, since you're here, you want to bring

282
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,310
anything forward or I haven't looked in the

283
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,490
chat for questions, but knowing why the chat's

284
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,890
been for the past year or two, I

285
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,970
don't think there's anything profound in there.

286
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,530
There was some questions last week about Genesis

287
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,270
and such.

288
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,950
All right.

289
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,110
There's always questions about Genesis in there.

290
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,490
Oh, yeah.

291
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,690
I mean, I don't know if you had

292
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,730
any outline for what you're going to talk

293
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,270
about tonight.

294
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,110
I mean, on the biblical end, mainly I'm

295
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,990
looking into a lot of the Israel captivity

296
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,710
stuff to see, you know, where different tribes

297
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,630
disperse to and what can be in there.

298
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,470
Of course, there's a whole community built up

299
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,930
around that.

300
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,750
So you have to be careful because a

301
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,510
lot of zealots post inaccurate stuff.

302
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,570
But that's mainly what I've been going through.

303
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,110
Are you sure?

304
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,070
Yeah, I'm just joking.

305
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,690
Yeah, of course.

306
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,670
Well, here's the interesting aspect about it.

307
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,110
You know, I speak on how screwed up

308
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,650
things are and everything's moronic.

309
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,850
And, you know, and then you parallel that

310
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,910
with the spiritual side, which is also in

311
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,310
turmoil in some capacity.

312
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,790
You know, when I say some capacity, because

313
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,190
we only know what we've been told in

314
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,430
scripture and in other levels, right?

315
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,370
What's interesting is when the Israelites go into

316
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,790
captivity or they're in a diaspora situation, you

317
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,750
have to ask yourself, what I've always asked

318
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,930
myself is once I determined that Yahweh was

319
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,710
their patron deity, is was he still their

320
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,890
patron deity when they were dispersed and taken

321
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,410
to captivity?

322
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,430
Or does he abandon them?

323
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,350
In other words, retract his protection and retract

324
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,090
his power over them as a nation?

325
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,990
And the answer to that I found every

326
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,290
time is the latter, he does.

327
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,070
Because there's no other way that they can

328
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,310
be affected spiritually if he's protecting them.

329
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,270
So that's like an obvious example of how

330
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,850
the Most High pulls his protection, even though

331
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,730
he's diminished himself to be like the sons

332
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,270
of gods, you know, over one nation over

333
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,770
instead of over the world, which it's not

334
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,530
time yet, right?

335
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,030
So he does pull his protection, you know.

336
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,970
But if he did pull his protection completely,

337
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,870
then they would have been annihilated, which we

338
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,350
know that they aren't because they will be

339
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,990
reassembled.

340
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,490
So not completely, though.

341
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,810
Right, he keeps them around as seeds, just

342
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,410
that he gives them just enough protection.

343
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,130
So the seed is not damaged, you know,

344
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,510
in other words, some seed is maintained.

345
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,870
In other words, there's no more field of

346
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,170
crops, just a store, small storehouse or a

347
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,970
box of seeds around.

348
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,270
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

349
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,010
Yeah.

350
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,050
I mean, looking at it that way, when

351
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,350
you then get into these alternative historians that

352
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,650
have their own expositions on what happens with

353
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,550
the 12 tribes, and they want to claim

354
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,790
that certain Western nations are various tribes, if

355
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,850
we then assume that Yahweh has in fact

356
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,630
abandoned them, then they aren't really the tribes,

357
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,770
though, if they've been abandoned.

358
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,910
Well, as in, abandoned on a national level,

359
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,390
like where the Creator comes and he takes

360
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,270
a position as one of the sons of

361
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,470
gods over the nations, instead of the Creator.

362
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,690
And he just happens to be the Creator,

363
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,130
you see.

364
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,370
Yeah, there we go.

365
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,850
Because when he comes down and he gives

366
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,550
them protection, meaning, you know, what they call

367
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,170
the Shekhinah, you know, his presence, and the

368
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,590
temple is built and their offerings and all

369
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,290
that directly through, you know, the proxies that

370
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,730
he sets up, you know, the angels, he's

371
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,570
still not in his complete form.

372
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,610
He's in a form as one of the

373
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,890
other, as the other gods are supposed to

374
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,190
do over their nations, you see.

375
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,870
And what's interesting is about, you know, people

376
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,690
say kingdom come and all that, that's when

377
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,670
the Creator is on earth to rule over

378
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,110
the old, the entire earth overtly.

379
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,670
So, there's going to be a big difference

380
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,390
then as well.

381
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,790
That's what, the reason I'm bringing that up

382
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,590
is because there's a mix-up you hear.

383
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,890
People aren't able to put this in its

384
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,950
proper perspective.

385
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,450
And the perspective is simply that the involvement

386
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,310
of, let's say, what we see in scripture

387
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,170
and Yahweh with Israel as their patron deity

388
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,070
is not, it's on the level of as

389
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,430
the other gods of the other nations are

390
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,170
to them.

391
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,990
And the difference that people, most people don't

392
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,370
realize, some do, very few actually haven't run

393
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,070
into many that have, I'm just saying it

394
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,430
to give some leeway, is that when the,

395
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,010
in quotes and air quotes, the return of

396
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,810
the Christ and the kingdom come, is the

397
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,170
Creator will rule over the earth and everyone

398
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,010
will have to fall in line, meaning the

399
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,750
other gods as well, the ones that are

400
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,390
not killed and whatever.

401
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,150
And there's going to be an overt presence,

402
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,130
you know, and then there's a whole handful

403
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,110
of things, the resurrection and all this, so

404
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,070
that is the main difference, that if you

405
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,990
put that in perspective, just like many other

406
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,570
things, like for example, when you bring up

407
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,010
anything biblical, people automatically say, well, I don't

408
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,290
know the Bible, I'm not religious.

409
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,730
And when I say, what do you mean

410
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,310
about religion?

411
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,190
They say, Christianity, and they think of this

412
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,930
guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper,

413
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,330
or Christmas, or Easter, or church, and that

414
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,170
couldn't be, you know, that's some kind of

415
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,830
demonic fantasia, you know.

416
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,750
So when you do have things in a

417
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,690
perspective, when you say the Christ, you know

418
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,210
he was born on the fall on a

419
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,670
tabernacle, and you know he was stoned to

420
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,830
death with two others on an almond tree,

421
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,910
and you know that he ascended, you know,

422
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,430
a month and a half later, roughly, and

423
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,210
you know this, and you know that, biblically

424
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,170
and historically, let's say, when you bring up

425
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,210
another subject, you can discuss it once you

426
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,870
have that mindset in line.

427
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,490
But when, again, just to go outside of

428
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,810
what we're discussing in this particular sonic, if

429
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,210
you were to bring up this argument or

430
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,510
debate on what's right or what's wrong about

431
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,630
scripture or any subject, usually the person you're

432
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,470
conveying these thoughts with have not established what

433
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,150
I just mentioned.

434
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,710
They're in this false reality, you know, they

435
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,150
think of crucifixion, they think of Easter, they

436
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,230
think of Christmas, they don't know.

437
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,690
So the double difficulty here comes in where

438
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,410
it's nearly impossible to seek information and research

439
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,569
and have discussions on this, because the mindset

440
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:04,950
is not there, the proper mindset.

441
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,910
So, you know, when you carry that forward,

442
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,069
again, to have the proper mindset, it seems

443
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,270
like it's taking a really long time, but

444
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,329
we know what happens.

445
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,510
Just to maybe interfere a little bit with

446
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,089
the progression of what you, the subject, I

447
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,270
mean interfere, because there's not much of a

448
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,390
discussion when you understand what's called, you know,

449
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,490
the second advent of the Christ and all

450
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,270
this, that Israel would be given preference, preferential

451
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,970
treatment to the majority of them, if not

452
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,970
all of them to a certain degree, regarding

453
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,650
the resurrection and imbued with powers of rulership

454
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,650
in the new society for mankind.

455
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,750
That's where it ends up, right?

456
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,430
That goes without speculation, that's stated as fact,

457
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:56,730
right?

458
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,270
So now we're at that time prior to

459
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,550
that.

460
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,030
So the question is, with any subject matter

461
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,190
discussion regarding Israel and eschatology and all this,

462
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,470
is, well, we know how it ends up,

463
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,530
and we know where we are now, and

464
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,610
is the discussion to bridge the gap?

465
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,390
Or is the discussion to correct misinformation?

466
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,630
Or, you see what I mean?

467
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
Because ultimately we know they're going to be

468
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,070
given preferential treatment, and they're going to have

469
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,290
partaken some, you know, pretty significant aspects of

470
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,610
the rulership, you know, meaning of other humans,

471
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,490
ultimately, is how they end up.

472
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,290
And here's the mistake that people, you know,

473
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,850
very few people put in perspective.

474
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,090
It doesn't happen immediately.

475
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,950
Apparently they're taken down to the wilderness, as

476
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,350
they were after Egypt.

477
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:58,300
So, again, that's why on previous Sonics I've

478
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,020
gotten into a little more detail when this

479
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,860
society ends, on the surface and below the

480
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,880
surface, you know, the powers that be underneath

481
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,740
there also, because there's a whole other world

482
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,000
there.

483
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,480
There's going to be about 40 years of,

484
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,980
you know, what the fuck happened here, you

485
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,080
know?

486
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd say more than that, but before the

487
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
dust settles.

488
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,450
So, yeah, most of what you say, I'm

489
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,430
sounding very echoey.

490
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,250
Yeah, a little bit.

491
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,910
Not too much.

492
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,530
It's audible.

493
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,290
It's legible.

494
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,670
Well, other things that I've looked at recently,

495
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,770
I don't know, based on the biblical information

496
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,370
about pre-Adamite man and the archaeological finds

497
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,890
in places like the Balkans in Eastern Europe,

498
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,890
where you have carbon dated items that go

499
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,610
to 6000 BC-ish.

500
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,250
What can be said about the Danube Valley

501
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,770
civilization of Eastern Europe?

502
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,110
Obviously, that's connected to a lot of goddess

503
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,010
religion things as far as, I forget the

504
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,630
lady's name, but I think it's like Maria

505
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,110
Gimbuta, with her books about the goddess religion.

506
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,810
She uncovered a lot of stuff, at least

507
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,770
archaeologically, in that place in the 60s and

508
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,050
70s, and in recent times you have certain

509
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,210
museums and universities in New York that are

510
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,170
putting a lot of things on display within

511
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,950
the past few years about that civilization going

512
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,910
back to pre-Adamite man, if you line

513
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,450
up the dates.

514
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,090
Right, well, with carbon dating, you know, it's

515
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,390
good for 80,000 years.

516
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,330
It's pretty accurate.

517
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,390
You know, after 40,000, you could say

518
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,390
the accuracy goes down.

519
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,390
It's good to about 80,000.

520
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,490
Anything past 100,000, by the way, doesn't

521
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:52,830
work.

522
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,510
So if anyone says this is X amount

523
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,350
beyond 100,000 years or 80,000 years

524
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,310
and it's carbon dated, you know you're being

525
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,330
lied to, just like DNA testing and all

526
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,210
this other stuff, right?

527
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,530
Like with DNA testing, if you don't have

528
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,950
110 samples or 111 really crossover samples, it's

529
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,190
a very speculative study, right?

530
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,250
You can take a banana and bring it

531
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,010
to a DNA lab, and in three days

532
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,510
they can tell you, well, it's probably 40

533
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,870
% human, right?

534
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,070
So, I mean, the information with dating, you

535
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,590
almost have to look at how they dated

536
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,250
it, and that's almost never offered other than

537
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,590
the label, carbon dating, you know?

538
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,610
So whenever I, there's very little online.

539
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,850
You can sometimes get it if it's in

540
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,150
print, but not online.

541
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,830
If someone says something's been carbon dated, well,

542
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,770
I want to see the report.

543
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,270
On the carbon dating, you know, how it

544
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,190
was done, who did it.

545
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,770
Now you sound like a total ass when

546
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,310
you do, right?

547
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,850
It's like, what's wrong with you, right?

548
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,090
But I'm serious.

549
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,690
That has to be taken because you can

550
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,290
take a banana peel, scrape off a micro

551
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,810
amount and give it and say, this is

552
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,950
someone's DNA.

553
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,550
Can you tell me?

554
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,370
In a week or three days, all they

555
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,630
can do is tell you it's about 40

556
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,750
% human so far.

557
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,630
Do you see my point here?

558
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,010
So when they throw all this stuff, you

559
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,530
notice how they never give you validation.

560
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,970
They just tell you it was carbon dated,

561
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,710
and it's the scientism, the God, it's a

562
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,150
religion, the God behind that, and everyone bows

563
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,030
down towards it.

564
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,750
And I'm calling foul and bullshit on everything

565
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,690
they present publicly, like I said before, nothing

566
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,090
that the public knows is true, and the

567
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,390
truth is not known by the public, and

568
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,230
whatever the public thinks they know is not

569
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,570
true.

570
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,050
But that is different than saying that the

571
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,730
information is not publicly available.

572
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,910
It is publicly available.

573
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,150
It is, but no one cares.

574
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,470
Because this is a society of idiots, as

575
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,570
a group, you know.

576
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,590
So I would say that regarding the goddess

577
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,770
religion, it's not only in one area, but

578
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,030
it's everywhere.

579
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,130
Another aspect of it would be, you would

580
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,470
want to ask about how did pre-Adamite

581
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,250
man expand on an even radius around that

582
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,050
part of the world, or did they take

583
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,770
certain paths?

584
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,150
You know, was maybe the north, you know,

585
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,470
the Caucasus, you know, or that area that

586
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,570
you mentioned, let's say, populated first, or did

587
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,030
they divide down to the African continent, right?

588
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,650
Or did they become seafaring and go across

589
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:33,910
first?

590
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,450
We don't know.

591
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,770
We don't have that much information other than

592
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,830
dispersion and the lineages given in Genesis, right?

593
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,070
Yeah.

594
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,250
I am referring to the archaeological finds, though,

595
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,490
which they don't go back that far.

596
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,530
It's just 6,000 BC.

597
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,650
So this is within a safe carbon dating

598
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:51,990
radius.

599
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,910
6,000 BC is on the money in

600
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,210
Genesis, six-day man.

601
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,130
Right.

602
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,850
And when they, by the way, when man

603
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,990
was made and put on this earth, or

604
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,570
made on the earth, let's say, though the

605
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,950
six-day man was made on the earth,

606
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,070
they were fully enabled.

607
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,850
You know, they didn't, they weren't running around

608
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,930
wondering what, you know, what, how to do

609
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,210
things.

610
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,270
They were enabled by spiritual beings, you know.

611
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,060
You know, they didn't invent the wheel.

612
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,120
They didn't invent swords.

613
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,240
They didn't invent the shovel.

614
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,920
They didn't invent farming.

615
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
It was given to them, right?

616
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,940
I know it sounds kind of far-fetched,

617
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
you know, but, and I don't need to

618
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,380
refer to works like Enoch and Jasher and

619
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,580
other things like that, Book of the Upright,

620
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,580
but you could refer to any old societal

621
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,960
mythology or legend.

622
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,400
Nowhere in any ancient culture did man invent

623
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,800
anything.

624
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,820
It was given to them, right?

625
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,900
Right.

626
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,080
Yeah, I mean, as far as what's been

627
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,020
found archaeologically, you have quite a few items

628
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,960
with writing on them that, you know, some

629
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,760
scholars will say it's not writing because it

630
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,900
predates the Sumerian script, so they're not really

631
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,560
sure what it says.

632
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
But you also have graves with a lot

633
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,620
of gold in them that sort of go

634
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,060
beyond, you know, the reasonable amount of gold

635
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,900
and valuables that have been found in other

636
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,220
places like Egypt and such.

637
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,660
So I'm not quite sure how to string

638
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,260
together all of that to form a conclusion,

639
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,720
because the writing is not decipherable, as they've

640
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,540
expressed anyway.

641
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,400
It'll come as time goes on.

642
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,180
Let's say you won't be asking this in

643
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,060
five or six years.

644
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,400
I think there'll be more information in public,

645
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,560
or maybe not, because you have to understand

646
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,660
this is a society of secrets, right?

647
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,940
So when you read stuff in scripture, for

648
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,220
example, about the coming world condition, you know,

649
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,360
it might just come and nobody will realize

650
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
it, but it's happening.

651
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,320
You know, because it's about secrets.

652
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,020
So I would say that the promise that

653
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,400
things will be revealed in the end is

654
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,120
still there.

655
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,560
I think that all this is known.

656
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,000
You know, the Fictionasia Scientifica is very quick

657
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,840
to dispatch anything that is not in line

658
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,780
with their teachings.

659
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,020
Right.

660
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,740
You know, like the Smithsonian Institution was the

661
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,500
first CIA.

662
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,420
If you ever found an anomaly, like a

663
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,640
giant skeleton, or something that resembled, you know,

664
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,440
an ancient spacecraft, or something, a hundred years

665
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,260
ago, the Smithsonian Institution was quickly sent to

666
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,580
you to cover it up, even though it

667
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,160
made the news.

668
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,940
You know, so and so was plowing the

669
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,340
field and found such and such, and the

670
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,900
Smithsonian's on their way, and then you never

671
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,600
hear of it again.

672
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,680
So the reason I brought that up is

673
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,340
because it may not make the news, right?

674
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:58,840
Right.

675
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,440
Because now you have the Smithsonian still, and

676
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,920
you also have the CIA, and the FBI,

677
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,880
and the FDA, and the University of buttfuck,

678
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,600
whatever, you know, excuse the medical term there.

679
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,250
So yeah, it's really bad.

680
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,910
And here, when I say it's really bad,

681
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,770
it's not going to get better as we

682
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,130
go closer towards the time appointed, let's say.

683
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,950
So you could piece that together.

684
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,990
I think understanding the historicity of Genesis is

685
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,730
the biggest advantage you have, other than, depends,

686
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,290
you know, if you want to be the

687
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,250
archaeological type, you know, an archaeologist is someone

688
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,870
who spends their life in ruins, right?

689
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,250
Anyway, bad joke, but, or do you want

690
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,770
to be the one that is just satisfied

691
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,330
with good, solid information?

692
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,210
I've been through both routes, and I found

693
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,590
out that it's the good, solid information takes

694
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,150
precedent over the experience.

695
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,380
Yeah, I mean, some people are trying to

696
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,760
be economical with their time and their energy

697
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,700
towards certain ends, and other people do need

698
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,880
the experience in order to internalize things, depending

699
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
on the stage that they're at.

700
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,040
But, you know, the tree falling in the

701
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,380
forest, and does anyone hear it?

702
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,140
Does it make a sound if no one's

703
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,360
there?

704
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,280
If you find it, the first implication, you

705
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,940
know, let's say the Freudian ego and all

706
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,340
that is to share it with others and

707
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,240
see, you know, self-importance, you know, but

708
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,060
you remember, I'm not saying this is you,

709
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,460
but I'm saying many people like to bring

710
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,600
forward discoveries and attach their persona to for

711
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,180
glory or profit or gain of some kind.

712
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,700
But you have to remember, when you go

713
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,660
beyond a retarded or moronic level or second

714
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,200
grade level or third grade level, people don't

715
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,760
care, you have to keep it stupid.

716
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,140
So now, bringing forward viable or valid information

717
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,220
about anything that goes against what's already been

718
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,260
put out, or the mindset, is not a

719
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,160
good thing, believe it or not.

720
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,800
It's actually a bad thing, because you're going

721
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,980
to be ignored by the population and targeted

722
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,100
by the powers that be.

723
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,880
Yeah, sure, that is understood.

724
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,680
My suggestion is take it as it comes

725
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,200
and watch what happens as this new world

726
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,040
system is put in place, what they allow.

727
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,280
As long as you know what you know,

728
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,500
you'll be fine, because this new world system

729
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,660
that's going to be put in place is

730
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,900
going to show itself as being good and

731
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,360
provide good attributes, social attributes, but it's going

732
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,340
to be downright the worst thing that's ever

733
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,800
happened.

734
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,390
And here's the other thing, even if everything

735
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,690
were to end tomorrow, and there was an

736
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,590
advent of overt spirituality, meaning we get to

737
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,190
see the spiritual world, and most of the

738
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,990
idiots on this planet are dealt with or

739
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,430
dispatched, and the evil is mostly tampered down,

740
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,330
you still have 40 years of smoke and

741
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,230
dust before it settles, roughly.

742
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,950
So, it's a long process, either way.

743
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:39,490
Have you read or heard of the idea

744
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,350
that, well I'm sure it's been expressed, but

745
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,330
if it's valid is what I'm wondering, this

746
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,570
idea that a lot of wars that took

747
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,330
place in the 19th and 20th century, and

748
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,530
perhaps even some current ones like this ongoing

749
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,210
Syrian one, or perhaps the Vietnam War to

750
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,830
an extent, have a covert purpose of bombing

751
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,830
or removing certain relics or remnants of older

752
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,990
civilizations from those areas.

753
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,450
Like, currently you can read articles about how

754
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,890
the Russians are bombing a city like Palmyra

755
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,790
in Syria, and then you look at pictures

756
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,550
of those cities in the news reports, and

757
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,670
you see this Greco-Roman ruin or something

758
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,030
near the city, which shows signs of prior

759
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,430
bombing, like you're bombing this almost obscure area

760
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,110
where there's nothing happening in the name of

761
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,590
getting ISIS people in caves, and it doesn't

762
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,590
really make any sense when you could have

763
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,550
gone in on foot to get them, like

764
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,790
it's just a few guys in a cave.

765
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,770
Wasn't there a lot of that in the

766
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,530
Iraq War?

767
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,200
I seem to remember hearing about that a

768
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,300
lot.

769
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
There's several ways to look at that.

770
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,700
One is, if they were so great, why

771
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,760
didn't they maintain it?

772
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,180
Those temples are pretty useless, because the gods

773
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,220
that they supported or were temples to in

774
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,980
the cities that were built on those gods'

775
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,600
names, by the way, you know, and usually

776
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,420
when you build a city, you dedicate it

777
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:05,920
to a god.

778
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,820
I know most people think that's crazy, but

779
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,740
if you do some research, you'll figure it

780
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:09,960
out.

781
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,360
For example, if the local post office was

782
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,420
blown up right now where you are, I

783
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,000
assure you, I'm not going to say guarantee,

784
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,000
but I assure you within a month or

785
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,660
two, it'll be rebuilt with no signs of

786
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,980
it ever being blown up, right?

787
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,080
It'll never be in ruins.

788
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,200
Even if the local Walmart was blown up,

789
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,200
or Target, or store, or church, or whatever,

790
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,720
they'd rebuild it within a very short period

791
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,040
of time.

792
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,500
But these things lay in ruins for a

793
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,640
long time for a reason, spiritual reason, right?

794
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,940
So, do they have any use?

795
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,660
And if they did, does it serve you

796
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:48,900
well?

797
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,400
And the answer is no all around.

798
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,880
What I say, I take the Stalinistic perspective,

799
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,060
these things, have you ever run into a

800
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,580
real communist, like a hardcore brainwashed communist?

801
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,780
I did in the 80s.

802
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,120
He was actually a leftover.

803
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,640
He was pretty old at the time in

804
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,040
the 80s.

805
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,740
He was around 80.

806
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,160
He was working for an engineering architecture firm.

807
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,640
I was at a place called Snug Harbor

808
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,720
in Staten Island, and they were restoring all

809
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,560
these old buildings.

810
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,340
And it was like an architectural fart where

811
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,980
each building represented a certain style of architecture

812
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,180
from Greco-Roman, Palladian, and Victorian.

813
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,660
They were restoring them, and I said to

814
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,000
the engineer, basically, in short, what do you

815
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,380
think of this?

816
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,500
He said, I think all these buildings should

817
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,180
be leveled down, and they should grow potatoes

818
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,120
to feed the people.

819
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,400
Right?

820
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,340
So, now, I wouldn't say I'm bitter.

821
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,460
I think I'm objective.

822
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,500
It just comes off as being bitter, because

823
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,860
when you're objective about a turd, it doesn't

824
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,620
sound good, right?

825
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,840
I think that these antiquities and stuff don't

826
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,440
mean anything.

827
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,860
No, I don't think they mean anything, but

828
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,720
the governments are busy doing their thing, and

829
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,500
there are certain high-net individuals that make

830
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,400
it a point to go into countries in

831
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,780
the Middle East and raid them for their

832
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,180
antiquities.

833
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,320
They think it means something.

834
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,120
And then there's also this aspect of covering

835
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,179
up past civilizations, like, you know, the Tartars

836
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,880
and things like that, where it seems that

837
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,219
these things shouldn't be talked about.

838
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
Or I would invite you to consider that

839
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,340
they think it means nothing, and we can

840
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,260
profit from it right now, like a mobster

841
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,600
does.

842
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,560
They know.

843
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,880
They know it means nothing, also.

844
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,960
Now, I know it sounds very, I don't

845
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,580
know, pick the term, but all this stuff

846
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,820
about these ancient antiquities is nothing more than

847
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,719
romanticism.

848
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,920
They have no use, if it's, you know

849
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,199
what I mean?

850
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,239
You know, if all the museums, all the

851
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,699
masterpieces were burned, and all the antiquities were

852
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,260
destroyed and leveled, and they built up ticky

853
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,180
-tacky houses, I wouldn't spend not even 0

854
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,880
.3 seconds saying, oh, all that stuff is

855
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,220
gone.

856
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
No, I get that.

857
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,700
It doesn't profit me anything.

858
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,980
It doesn't matter to me at all.

859
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,920
As a matter of fact, I encourage it.

860
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,320
Why?

861
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,340
That stuff doesn't serve anybody.

862
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,860
It's just somebody else's livelihood.

863
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,100
You know, I mean, what, they're still trading,

864
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,460
who was it, the guy who splashed paint

865
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
on paintings.

866
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,860
That was 120 million bucks for his, who

867
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,880
was the guy who just splashed paint on

868
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,360
a canvas.

869
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,400
I had an acquaintance, Dori Ashton, actually I

870
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,360
was a tenant of hers a while back.

871
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,160
She was one of the biggest art critics

872
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,720
in the world, and she had a bunch

873
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,100
of his paintings around, and they're going for

874
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,400
120 million right now.

875
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,720
I mean, I've been in the house where

876
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,540
Andy Warhol and other contemporaries were around, you

877
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,720
know, it was no big deal.

878
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,060
There's a bunch of people, they're degenerates if

879
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,660
you ask me.

880
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,860
I had Marcel Duchamp, some of his studio

881
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,200
equipment, and who the hell is Marcel Duchamp,

882
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,440
right?

883
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,020
Anyway, people don't, you know, so it's like,

884
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,000
screw it.

885
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,600
It's somebody else's, here, you want to go

886
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,520
into what the mindset behind this crap is,

887
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,700
the antiquities and the art?

888
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,420
Hello Kitty.

889
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,400
That Hello Kitty meme that they have in

890
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,060
Asia, it's worth like hundreds of billions, right,

891
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,460
in Asia, or whatever billions are.

892
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,740
It's garbage.

893
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,360
The Mona Lisa and all that stuff is

894
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,440
also, you know, if you ask me, that's,

895
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,160
you know, but it is commerce.

896
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,580
It's a form of, it's a complex attribute,

897
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,080
one of the complex attributes of society, because

898
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,580
when a society rises to, well, achieves a

899
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,060
certain point of, let's say, industry and technology,

900
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,460
they have a surplus of people called artists,

901
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,120
and they produce these works of arts and

902
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,000
these other things, right?

903
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,900
Now, you have to separate that from the

904
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,000
dedications, you know, because when they classify that

905
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,980
under post-immortality, yeah, like an apotheosis type

906
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,600
thing, maybe.

907
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,240
But whenever you have the, you know, you

908
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,780
could look in the anthropological aspect and standard

909
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,280
bullshit, they'll tell you, you know, when a

910
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,020
society reaches a certain level, then they go

911
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,480
into art level, art form, right?

912
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,020
When, you know, a small group of people

913
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,960
can sustain a large group, then that large

914
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,280
group doesn't have to work on sustainability, like

915
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,900
food and clothing.

916
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,160
They can take up other things like being

917
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,780
philosophers, writers, poets, artists, painters, sculptors, jerk-offs,

918
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,280
whatever.

919
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,360
I'm not saying that that's not a good

920
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,060
thing or a bad thing, I'm just stating,

921
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,860
you know, one of the things that we've

922
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:47,980
seen.

923
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,200
It's an emergent class or an emergent aspect

924
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,720
of society, as you see it.

925
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,100
I mean, even if you read in scripture,

926
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,520
there were classes of musicians, right?

927
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,260
And artisans, so I'm not saying it's a

928
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,100
bad thing, I'm just saying at this point,

929
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,540
it's pretty useless in terms of the value

930
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:09,880
aspect.

931
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,320
For what I see intrinsically, the only reason

932
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,200
these things have any value is because you've

933
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,860
been raised believing that they do.

934
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,750
Well, there's a sense in which value is

935
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,770
always a matter of perspective, like if people

936
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,390
say that gold suddenly isn't valuable, then it

937
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,110
isn't.

938
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,810
Unless you can show something empirical that says

939
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,690
that gold is valuable.

940
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,370
That's what I'm interested in.

941
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,770
Well, it is because the gods say it

942
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:39,970
is.

943
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,550
Sure, it becomes that way because when you

944
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,410
reach a terminus, whenever you're dealing with the

945
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,550
gods, you reach a termination point, and it

946
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,870
may seem open or more open sometimes and

947
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,570
more closed than others, depending on what they

948
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,230
want you to know.

949
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,830
If the gods don't want you to know

950
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,670
something, you might as well consider it a

951
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,870
termination, because you're not going to know.

952
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,010
But if they want you to know, and

953
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,850
they want to expand on that with you,

954
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,770
then obviously you get to see more of

955
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,330
why things are.

956
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,810
I think I've given many talks about what

957
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,330
money is.

958
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,510
It's just portable land.

959
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,010
So when you go from one place to

960
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,790
another, you bring what represents the value of

961
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,250
your land.

962
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,150
And the reason why you don't have substance

963
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,750
-backed money anymore, and I've been saying this

964
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,790
for a long time, and I ask people

965
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,690
and they still can't answer, not because I

966
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,190
say so, but because it's subjective.

967
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,270
When you lose substance-based money, what do

968
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,770
you lose?

969
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,430
Also, you lose law.

970
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,210
Now you go under what's called legal system.

971
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,090
Death, that's why I used to tell everyone,

972
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,350
the death to the legal system is species

973
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,130
-backed money.

974
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,850
It could be anything.

975
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,090
It doesn't have to be gold and silver.

976
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,930
It could be labor.

977
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,830
The reason why I used to argue with

978
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,370
these patriot idiots a decade ago that this

979
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,990
country and the world will never have species

980
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,250
-backed money is because then the legal system

981
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,410
goes under, and you have to go back

982
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,850
to law.

983
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,390
And you can't have a law unless the

984
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,670
people are educated in it.

985
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,730
So if you see the legal society falling

986
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,970
apart from the inside out and outside in,

987
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,790
meaning like hanging a million attorneys tomorrow from

988
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,810
lampposts, which is not going to happen, because

989
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,850
people think they're good, is you're not going

990
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,330
to get species-backed money.

991
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,050
Because once species-backed money comes in, you

992
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,150
lose your legal system.

993
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,530
You have to go under law, and you

994
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,850
don't need what's going on.

995
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,470
There'll be no charges and things like that.

996
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,060
I brought this up at a constitutional forum.

997
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,980
These people used to meet every week discussing

998
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,720
the Constitution.

999
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,680
And at one of the meetings, I said,

1000
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,060
well, Constitution, U.S. Constitution, you can wipe

1001
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,840
your ass with it.

1002
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,100
And they all got really upset when I

1003
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,460
said that.

1004
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,760
And I said, no, not really, see?

1005
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,100
Then they relaxed.

1006
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,540
And I said, well, you have to crumble

1007
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,400
it up really well to soften it, then

1008
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,900
wipe your ass with it.

1009
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,440
Right?

1010
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,060
Sacred document, my ass, it's toilet paper.

1011
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,620
And the people know that.

1012
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,180
And by the way, anyone wants to, I

1013
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,340
have a thing printed in 1952 by the

1014
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,120
Freemasons and another one by the Scottish Rite.

1015
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,340
Every Freemason needs to know the Constitution and

1016
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,400
Declaration of Independence.

1017
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,420
And if you idiots think the U.S.

1018
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,780
Constitution is valid in any sense for what

1019
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,580
you've been told it is, why don't you

1020
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,120
look up the Freemasonic Constitution of 1721, which

1021
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,620
is about 76, 77 years before it.

1022
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,960
If you print out the Freemasonic Constitution and

1023
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,480
the U.S. Constitution, hold it up in

1024
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,500
the light, it's almost word for word.

1025
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,070
There's nothing original about it.

1026
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,210
Garbage.

1027
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,590
It's not a sacred document.

1028
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,000
That's what you've been told.

1029
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,720
Yeah, look it up.

1030
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,260
It's a Freemasonic, that's why I like Dimitri.

1031
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,340
He doesn't know about the core of many

1032
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,420
aspects like the people that listen to Greek

1033
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,340
speak do, but he understands that it's a

1034
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,820
Freemasonic scenario.

1035
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,160
I think he blames it too much on

1036
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,780
the Freemasons.

1037
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,560
I think the Freemasons are idiots, but not

1038
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,200
because I read something online and criticized them

1039
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,780
because I've run into enough of them.

1040
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,540
Well, concerning what we were talking about before

1041
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,340
though, I was less on about the antiques

1042
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,560
aspect and more about the fact that certain

1043
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,720
aspects of civilizations and histories are purposely kept

1044
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,280
in the dark.

1045
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,020
So when you look at a list of

1046
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,420
wars that have taken place in certain time

1047
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,920
periods and you try and go and do

1048
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,060
research on those wars, it almost feels like

1049
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,940
that particular association is fake.

1050
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,560
Like there was no real war, but they

1051
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,020
went in there to do something else.

1052
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,160
Yeah, it is.

1053
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,580
Well, you know, the Vietnam War, I listened

1054
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,520
to someone that was pre-adolescent in the

1055
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,240
60s and his father was a colonel in

1056
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,860
the army and told him that, you know,

1057
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,400
I want to talk to you about drugs,

1058
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,640
son, you know, and what's going to be

1059
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,040
happening.

1060
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,840
And the child thought it was directed to

1061
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,420
him and the colonel was basically saying, we're

1062
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,740
going to go fight this war in Asia

1063
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,160
about controlling the drug trade.

1064
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,480
This was a few years before it went

1065
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,100
hot in the news, right, before the Gulf

1066
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,360
of Tompkins and all that.

1067
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,960
So maybe that's the perspective.

1068
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,460
In other words, why are they going into

1069
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,740
the Middle East then, right?

1070
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,440
That's pretty simple.

1071
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,480
Like, you know, they say the U.S.

1072
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,360
is after Assad.

1073
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,320
What a crock of shit.

1074
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,480
I wouldn't have said this in the past,

1075
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,280
but I'll say it now.

1076
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,060
Most people don't know that the DEA and

1077
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,200
the CIA work together and most people don't

1078
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
know that the DEA sends a lot of

1079
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,580
its people to a prison in Damascus, Syria,

1080
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,020
even today.

1081
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,520
Not today like today, but up to about

1082
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,080
a year ago.

1083
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,800
In other words, the American agencies are running

1084
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,280
a prison where they send people, you know,

1085
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,060
for whatever rendition or whatever in Damascus, Syria

1086
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,060
currently.

1087
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,180
So where's this whole overt bullshit about the

1088
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,240
U.S. wants to get rid of Assad

1089
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,220
when they're using his own, you know what

1090
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:19,380
I mean?

1091
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,820
It's all bullshit, right?

1092
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,620
Now, recently, I got an email about, you

1093
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,400
know, I pat myself on the back about

1094
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,140
Trump and Syria.

1095
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,440
Nah.

1096
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,680
When does the U.S. government not lie?

1097
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,600
When does the French government not lie?

1098
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,200
When does the Russian government not lie?

1099
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,600
When does the Colombian government not lie?

1100
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,380
When does the Chilean government not lie?

1101
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,120
When does the Arabian government not lie?

1102
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,060
They all lie.

1103
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,720
They're not pulling out of anything.

1104
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,900
They're just changing the way they're presenting it

1105
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,240
to you.

1106
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,120
I think I did a sonic a few

1107
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,660
months ago about revisiting a map or make

1108
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,080
a list, go into scripture of all the

1109
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,780
territories that David had conquered or subjugated and

1110
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,460
make a map.

1111
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,400
And you'll see that Israel went way up

1112
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,500
into Syria, east of Damascus, west of Damascus.

1113
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,280
They didn't take Damascus, but they were just

1114
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,200
all around it, right?

1115
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,880
It went all the way to the Nile

1116
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,200
and all the way to the Euphrates, pretty

1117
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,560
much.

1118
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,560
Definitely on the other side of Jordan, right?

1119
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,140
The river Jordan.

1120
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,860
You had Manasseh and a couple of other

1121
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,980
tribes settle in on the other side of

1122
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,580
Jordan, right?

1123
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,600
Where now is proper.

1124
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,060
All this stuff that you see about ISIS

1125
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,680
and all that is just to soften up

1126
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,280
the area for Israel to come in and

1127
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,760
take over.

1128
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,500
I know you don't like, people don't like

1129
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,960
to hear that, but I'm not making it

1130
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,280
up and I'm not taking sides.

1131
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,840
You know, it's interesting as the scripture says,

1132
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,580
those that bless Israel will be blessed.

1133
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,960
Doesn't say you have to take sides though,

1134
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,340
does it?

1135
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,350
You don't bless without taking sides.

1136
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,440
You can't bless somebody.

1137
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,400
And then when somebody comes and asks you,

1138
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,420
why'd you bless them?

1139
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,040
You say, well, I'm not on their side.

1140
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,860
I just blessed them.

1141
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,280
Sure.

1142
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,820
Why not?

1143
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,480
No, it doesn't.

1144
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,380
Enemies are going to come after you.

1145
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,080
Well, blessing is not arist.

1146
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,880
It doesn't, it's not constant.

1147
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,880
It's just an act like sneezing.

1148
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,260
I'm not sure I get that.

1149
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,860
It's not a constant thing that you do.

1150
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,800
A blessing is a blessing.

1151
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,440
Oh, like a one-time thing.

1152
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:32,820
Yeah.

1153
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,900
Remember he says, bless me so I can

1154
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,080
be, remember when in Genesis, right?

1155
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,360
He dressed up like his brother.

1156
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,200
It wasn't a constant thing.

1157
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,640
It was just, just do this one blessing

1158
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,680
for me, right?

1159
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,480
Yeah, they have my blessing, but they're all

1160
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,580
savages over there.

1161
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,360
They're all savages.

1162
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,500
Oh, wherever you go, humans are savages.

1163
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,480
So the thing is, if you, you know,

1164
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,960
anything to get the, the, the ball rolling,

1165
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,280
which no one can stop anyway, but you

1166
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,420
don't want to be rolled over by it.

1167
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,180
You see, I always bring up the thing.

1168
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,960
There's a fixed game.

1169
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,880
Team A is going to destroy Team B.

1170
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,220
Which one do you want to join?

1171
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Well, obviously, you know, it's rigged.

1172
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,120
Team A, I'm not going to join the

1173
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,900
losing side.

1174
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,760
And it has nothing to do with morals

1175
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,260
and ethics.

1176
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,020
But if you bring in morals and ethics,

1177
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,900
the, the one that sets morals and ethics

1178
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,460
for the universe is the one that's going

1179
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,220
to be winning and destroying the other side.

1180
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,480
So there's another rule that you can follow.

1181
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,440
It's morally and ethically correct to be on

1182
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,420
the winning team for that reason.

1183
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,520
And it's also for a plain rational reason,

1184
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,700
you want to be on the winning team

1185
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,320
because you don't want to suffer the loss,

1186
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,040
the consequences of what comes along with losing.

1187
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,210
And we know, I think I'm the only

1188
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,010
one that's expressed the verses in Isaiah that

1189
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,190
quote unquote, Israel will never be viewed as

1190
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,890
being righteous in any capacity until they run

1191
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:57,550
out of judges.

1192
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:06,220
It's in the first chapter of Isaiah, which

1193
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,040
is prime ministers.

1194
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,640
I mean, the whole scripture is pretty detailed.

1195
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,840
I mean, you can convey information by not

1196
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,980
saying something or by saying something, right?

1197
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,420
Directly, you know, sometimes by, by omission.

1198
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,760
You can focus on a point as well.

1199
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,800
I will return to your former judges and

1200
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,240
then you will be known as a righteous

1201
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,620
city.

1202
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,780
You meaning like after or righteous people.

1203
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:46,240
So but I would suggest that back to

1204
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,160
it's wintertime.

1205
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,520
So you're going to see a lot of

1206
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,140
movement, right?

1207
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,620
That's what happens in the winter, international movement

1208
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,640
or traveling and you don't do things that

1209
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,640
you're agriculturally demanding, like sowing and growing and

1210
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,200
harvest.

1211
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,320
So there's a lot of change in winter,

1212
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,520
you do things that normally don't happen in

1213
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:05,800
winter.

1214
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,480
So you're going to see Israel starting to

1215
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,540
get extremely aggressive.

1216
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,700
Of course, it's none of it's going to

1217
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,140
be shown in a good light.

1218
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,540
Also, you're going to start to see the,

1219
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,860
you know, the powers that be, especially the

1220
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,720
United Satanic America is taking a second fiddle

1221
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,800
to other powers.

1222
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,820
And the current leadership is going to be

1223
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,020
was worse than the previous and the next

1224
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,820
leadership is going to be over, you know,

1225
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,740
the the dog and pony show or the

1226
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,080
dog, what is it called the donkey and

1227
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,820
elephant show.

1228
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,120
It's already said, you know, there is something

1229
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,920
I put up on Chatterwild back the New

1230
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,940
Order of Barbarians 50 years ago, the deindustrialization

1231
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,980
and dumbing up of this country was already

1232
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,720
set and the homosexual agenda, the sodomites and

1233
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,940
lesbians and the food poisoning and all that

1234
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,580
was already set 50 years ago.

1235
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,560
The political stuff that everyone sees is just

1236
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,080
a show.

1237
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,520
Those are not the leaders.

1238
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,400
Those are the administrators for the leaders.

1239
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,500
We don't know who they are.

1240
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,780
Someone was asking me, Greek, unless you told

1241
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,220
me who the powers are, I don't believe

1242
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,520
that.

1243
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,880
And I was like, there's an Ocelli type

1244
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,320
character.

1245
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,120
And I said, well, OK, there's 400 Navy

1246
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,520
SEALs.

1247
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,800
Give me all the names and where they

1248
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,360
are right now.

1249
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:34,980
Can you do that?

1250
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:38,070
Right.

1251
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:38,630
No.

1252
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:39,310
Why not?

1253
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,110
I don't believe the Navy SEALs exist unless

1254
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,230
you tell me all their names and where

1255
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,290
they are right now.

1256
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,390
But we know they're Navy SEALs.

1257
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,350
We see them on TV.

1258
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:49,430
Yeah.

1259
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,110
But you see how stupid, you know, there's

1260
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,610
3500 FBI, you know, G20 FBI agents.

1261
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,790
Give me all their names and where they

1262
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,350
are right now.

1263
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:57,830
Can you do it?

1264
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,070
Well, this group that I'm talking about that

1265
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,190
are the leaders of the world are extremely

1266
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,650
secret.

1267
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,010
So.

1268
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,290
You see, it's very simple.

1269
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,370
I mean, they were able to blow up

1270
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:24,710
450 kilotons or 350 kiloton underground nukes in

1271
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,250
broad daylight for the whole world to see

1272
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,010
in lower Manhattan.

1273
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,870
And it's still, you know, well, we don't

1274
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,490
know what happened.

1275
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,770
We need to find out what happened.

1276
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,730
And obviously, you know, it's not fair to

1277
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,730
say it because this is not.

1278
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,910
But the information is there.

1279
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,410
It's right in front of everyone if they

1280
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,890
want to delve in.

1281
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,490
You know, I had a retired military person

1282
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,670
once said to me, I spent over a

1283
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,910
thousand hours researching 9-11 never did know

1284
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,970
that it's not nuclear.

1285
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,270
I'm like, you could spend 10,000 hours,

1286
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,170
10,000 hours researching on the Internet.

1287
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,570
You're not going to find unless your mindset

1288
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,150
is correct.

1289
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,540
Remember, you're living in a society where evidence

1290
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,400
doesn't matter.

1291
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,180
At all.

1292
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,220
I think I told you about the college

1293
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,120
professor who said that we went to the

1294
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
moon and I don't know who he is.

1295
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,220
But even if the astronauts went on TV

1296
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,000
and said it never happened, I still believe

1297
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,780
they went to the moon.

1298
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,240
So we're talking about deep psychosis here, too.

1299
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:39,450
I think getting a firm grip on prophecy

1300
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:45,450
is a very good way to answer a

1301
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,010
lot of questions regarding history, where things are

1302
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,130
going, how things are, and looking at it

1303
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,230
from the God's perspective.

1304
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,370
You know, Scripture was written to you.

1305
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,010
It's not for you or about you.

1306
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,550
It's about the gods.

1307
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,210
It's usually a discussion amongst the gods.

1308
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,290
But it was done in a way, Scripture,

1309
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,990
so that it would be given to man

1310
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,270
for man to have for as their own.

1311
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,020
So, you know, in other words, it's written

1312
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,100
about you and it's written to you, but

1313
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,340
it's not for you.

1314
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,480
Because here's the interesting aspect.

1315
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,040
I tell a lot of people, and I

1316
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,660
find this to be true still with most

1317
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,520
people, I say, don't even bother reading Scripture,

1318
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,560
because when you start reading it, you're going

1319
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,900
to notice that the actual text has an

1320
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,440
aversion for stupid people.

1321
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,920
Most people say, I don't understand it.

1322
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,780
And they say, well, that's your interpretation.

1323
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,640
It can't be known.

1324
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,300
Well, that means if it can't be known,

1325
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,520
the gods work in futility.

1326
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,480
No, it's just that gods don't like stupid

1327
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:46,940
people.

1328
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,860
That's the first thing you notice when you

1329
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,760
read Scripture, try to comprehend it.

1330
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,640
And if you read Scripture and don't get

1331
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,260
it, guess what?

1332
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,120
You're stupid.

1333
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,560
It's not my thing.

1334
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,680
Maybe you were born that way.

1335
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,820
Maybe you were raised that way.

1336
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,660
But just move on.

1337
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,780
Pick up something else.

1338
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,320
It's not for you.

1339
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,680
That's the harsh reality, you know.

1340
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,120
And stupid, I'm using in a very loose

1341
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,460
sense.

1342
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,180
You know, you're a moron or whatever, if

1343
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,100
you don't get Scripture.

1344
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,680
And I don't mean picking it up once

1345
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,060
and reading the King James or whatever.

1346
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,120
But you don't get that there's something different

1347
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,600
there.

1348
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,200
And the text itself has an aversion for

1349
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,980
morons.

1350
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,160
It's like self-filtering, you know what I

1351
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,280
mean?

1352
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,340
No, I get it.

1353
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,180
I know.

1354
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,760
Yeah, if you want to hear shit, it's

1355
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,380
off the cuff.

1356
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,640
You listen to Greek speak, right?

1357
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,280
I think most of us are used to

1358
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,640
it by now.

1359
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,720
Yeah, but no one else is saying that

1360
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,280
if you don't get Scripture, you're stupid.

1361
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,840
And the reason why...

1362
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,420
Yeah, it's mean.

1363
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,920
Yeah, because it was set up that way.

1364
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,840
It has an aversion for stupid people and

1365
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,540
ignorant people.

1366
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,000
And I don't mean smart in the way

1367
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,440
that people decide what is smart and what

1368
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:15,920
is stupid.

1369
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:29,780
Look, even

1370
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,640
the people that put the King James and

1371
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,500
the religions, you know, Judaism and modern Judaism

1372
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,780
and Christianity are pretty freaking stupid.

1373
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,740
How many Christians do you have running around

1374
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,340
and saying, well, we have to create some

1375
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,720
order and some accuracy.

1376
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,920
Why do we have a J-E-S

1377
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,480
-U-S when it's when the Joshua, if

1378
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,280
we're going to use the letter J, right,

1379
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,340
we use it for Joshua.

1380
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,260
And that's exactly the same name as the

1381
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,460
Christ.

1382
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,140
So why isn't the Christ called Joshua?

1383
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,600
If we have to use the letter J,

1384
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,060
right?

1385
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,840
Isn't that more accurate?

1386
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,300
What's the difference in name between Yahshua HaMashiach,

1387
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:17,600
the Christ, and Yahshua, what I call the

1388
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,900
prophet or a judge or, right, or a

1389
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,780
cohort of Moses.

1390
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,620
What's the difference between the book of Joshua

1391
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,600
and the character that's mentioned in the New

1392
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:29,940
Testament?

1393
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,540
What's the difference?

1394
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,100
There's none.

1395
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,980
Do you see how easy it is if

1396
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,220
you have to use the letter J?

1397
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,300
It's Joshua.

1398
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,630
Let's start there.

1399
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,390
I mean, is that so?

1400
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,190
Because they're not talking about anything biblical.

1401
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,790
It's Christian, right?

1402
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,950
The same with the Jews or the Muslims

1403
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,770
or the Hindus or the whatever.

1404
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,170
Just large corporations.

1405
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,170
It's Gustav Le Bon mindset.

1406
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,690
What you do is you make something so

1407
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,430
simple so the masses can adhere to it

1408
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,670
and you've simplified it so much that it's

1409
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,030
now distorted and no longer resembles its original

1410
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,250
form.

1411
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,900
Definitely being steered.

1412
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,380
Yeah, I mean, they condemn themselves.

1413
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,260
I mean, Scripture talks about Yeah, you put

1414
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,220
the curses on themselves.

1415
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,020
Look, you can talk to anyone.

1416
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,620
Is it so unreasonable to call him Joshua

1417
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,000
instead of J-E-S-U-S?

1418
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:41,460
Right.

1419
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,800
I mean, it's obviously like just pissing on

1420
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:44,980
you.

1421
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,380
They're just shitting all over you and you

1422
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,760
love it.

1423
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,700
I mean, you meaning, you know, the people

1424
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,240
of the planet.

1425
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,120
I mean, that's like the first thing that

1426
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,840
you can introduce as a not even a

1427
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,540
salient point, but just as a point that

1428
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:03,540
should be considered to start putting it in

1429
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,460
order, at least if you have to use

1430
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,120
certain terms.

1431
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,190
But it's not going to happen.

1432
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,190
You see, many times I've said this system,

1433
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,850
this society, this culture, these traditions cannot be

1434
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:17,250
fixed.

1435
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,670
They have to be flushed away, destroyed, cleared.

1436
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,450
What do you call it?

1437
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,030
Deleted.

1438
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,350
There's nothing to fix.

1439
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,730
The people cannot be fixed.

1440
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,930
They have to be deleted.

1441
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,230
And I mean physically as well.

1442
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,790
So, not because I say so, Scripture tells

1443
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,570
you that as well.

1444
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,290
It's not, it's not a, you know, here's

1445
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,250
the interesting part though, when you consider the

1446
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,030
natural world, you know, you want to use

1447
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,070
it in parentheses or whatever you mean by

1448
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,110
the natural world.

1449
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:59,510
You want to pick highland forests, low valleys,

1450
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:04,530
deserts, tropical, you know, desert, any, what's called

1451
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:08,230
natural environment, and go look up a doco,

1452
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,530
a documentary or whatever.

1453
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,690
It's one animal eating the other, isn't it?

1454
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:13,810
Right?

1455
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,770
Or even plants eating animals, and animals eating

1456
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:17,650
plants, you know?

1457
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:25,370
So, get your mind wrapped around that this

1458
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:29,010
idea of carnage, carnage, you know, or meat

1459
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,210
being handled and torn apart or discarded or

1460
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,670
killed or whatever, is the way of the

1461
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:34,870
earth.

1462
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,170
It's the way things are here.

1463
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,430
And it's going to carry through on to

1464
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,010
the end, right?

1465
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,550
Until it no longer is.

1466
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:49,270
Yeah, the older wars were more correct.

1467
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,990
Well, if you don't like those people because

1468
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,710
they could bring evil, let's go kill them

1469
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:53,030
all.

1470
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,350
Alright?

1471
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,670
That's more honest than the bullshit everyone here

1472
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,090
is now.

1473
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,930
Where you're still being killed off, you're just

1474
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,710
being poisoned slowly or whatever because it's just

1475
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,430
not time yet.

1476
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,020
Just the way that it is.

1477
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,260
The earth is a violent place.

1478
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,670
I have an unrelated question.

1479
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,310
I think you've talked about IQ before, as

1480
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,010
far as it being something suspect.

1481
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:48,870
It is and it isn't.

1482
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,770
It's just like university, you know, if you

1483
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:52,890
don't have it, right?

1484
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,690
PhD, you're not going to be considered at

1485
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,610
the top of your field.

1486
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,910
By the way, have you taken an IQ

1487
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,910
test or anything?

1488
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,050
Years ago.

1489
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,590
It was probably just...

1490
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,390
What did you get?

1491
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,850
Do you remember?

1492
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,610
As a 16 year old or whatever, I

1493
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,510
think I had 115.

1494
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,050
But I don't know if that's reliable.

1495
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:23,210
I think I got a 156 or something.

1496
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,070
You're so smart.

1497
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,050
Yeah, right?

1498
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,790
No, I'm not.

1499
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,370
But anyway, I shouldn't even be sad.

1500
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,390
It's embarrassing to say that.

1501
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,090
But go ahead, regarding IQ.

1502
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,570
No, I don't understand it very well.

1503
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,630
It's something that's...

1504
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,390
I mean, there's various levels of understanding of

1505
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,150
any topic where you have the sort of

1506
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:46,450
scholarly or the learned perspective for people who

1507
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:49,370
actually develop these propositions or work in the

1508
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:49,550
field.

1509
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,610
And then you have the sort of pop

1510
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,470
culture understanding.

1511
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,510
And IQ is obviously something that's well-existent

1512
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,710
within the pop culture sphere.

1513
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,270
Like, this is just something that you have

1514
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,810
to be smart.

1515
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:58,910
If you have a lot of points, you're

1516
01:01:58,910 --> 01:01:59,170
smart.

1517
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:00,890
So I don't know what it is per

1518
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:01,090
se.

1519
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,730
But my understanding is that within the social

1520
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:08,790
sciences, they would define intelligence as being sort

1521
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,530
of like how a computer works, like the

1522
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,250
aggregate of cognitive processing power that your brain

1523
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,970
has and then memory capacity.

1524
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,350
Right, because it's based on timing also.

1525
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,250
Right?

1526
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,030
You're timed.

1527
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:23,650
But that's okay.

1528
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,290
I don't think that...

1529
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,730
let's go back to the cognitive...

1530
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,350
about the headhunters, right?

1531
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,330
It depends on the culture.

1532
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,870
You know, you might be familiar with countries

1533
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,190
in the African continent.

1534
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,310
The majority of the people that work the

1535
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,330
land and sustain themselves from the land are

1536
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:48,690
far more intelligent than a PhD in technocracy

1537
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:52,890
or technical whatever in a Western country, in

1538
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,730
a general sense.

1539
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,610
But one would flunk in...

1540
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,550
you know, if you interchange them or exchange

1541
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,670
them, they would flunk in their corresponding...

1542
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,910
in their new environments, right?

1543
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,910
They would be viewed as total failures.

1544
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,210
The Bushmen would be a failure in the

1545
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,530
IQ test.

1546
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,590
And the guy who has the 156 IQ

1547
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,090
would be a total failure in the Bush,

1548
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,050
you know, PhD or whatever.

1549
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,080
But is there something to be said for

1550
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,800
the fact that perhaps in the long run

1551
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,560
you could teach the PhD guy to be

1552
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,160
successful in the Bush, whereas the Bushmen might

1553
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,480
never, you know, wrap his finger around the

1554
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,580
type of abstract thought that the PhD guy

1555
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,760
uses for his profession?

1556
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,340
Right.

1557
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,400
Because another way to use the abstract thought

1558
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,440
is, if it's not lawful or grounded in

1559
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,080
anything, which it's not, it's fallacial.

1560
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,040
It's fallacy.

1561
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,520
It's bullshit.

1562
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,180
If you ask the...

1563
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,100
even just a simple colloquial Bushman, what came

1564
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,240
first, the chicken or the egg?

1565
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,300
I mean, that's not...

1566
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,100
never pondered as something like a Westerner would

1567
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,620
be, you know?

1568
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,620
Oh yeah, that's a...

1569
01:03:59,620 --> 01:03:59,940
right?

1570
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,340
You'd be like, what kind of stupid shit

1571
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:01,820
is that?

1572
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,500
Addressing it is stupid.

1573
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,840
So, you know the old one, a rooster

1574
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,200
lays on the ridge of a roof and

1575
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,840
lays an egg.

1576
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,500
Which side of the roof does it roll

1577
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,100
off of?

1578
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,480
Yeah, roosters don't lay eggs, yeah.

1579
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:30,260
Well, hold on.

1580
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,600
One thing that they do know, the leaders,

1581
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,660
is that you have too much time on

1582
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,020
your hands.

1583
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:35,920
Have you ever heard that expression?

1584
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,160
So they have to fill it up and

1585
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,620
they have to keep you running.

1586
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,080
Which is okay, I mean, because they've...

1587
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,140
the moral, ethical and lawful abandonment of modern

1588
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,060
society, it doesn't matter what country you're in,

1589
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,980
but especially if you're in a country where

1590
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,080
you have too much time on your hands,

1591
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:53,180
you're going to have to fill it up.

1592
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,540
Especially the ones that have grid systems, you

1593
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,180
know, and educational institutions and medical institutions and

1594
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:57,900
legal institutions.

1595
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:01,640
They've abandoned all the things that are important

1596
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,160
that they still have access to.

1597
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,240
Like, take the western society.

1598
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:11,000
Any human in a western society, even machine,

1599
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,500
has access to biblical stuff, and how to

1600
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,280
put it right.

1601
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:20,020
Has access to law, has access to proper

1602
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,680
science.

1603
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,480
But none of them want to use it,

1604
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,760
or refer to it, or use it as

1605
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,280
a basis.

1606
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,980
You know, to give an example, that's why

1607
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,360
when you go online and you look at

1608
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:40,180
NASA, the National Aeronautics Agency, everything they've been

1609
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,620
putting out for the past decade is CG.

1610
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,680
You get no more photographs from telescopes, no

1611
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,660
more photographs of anything.

1612
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,580
It's all computer generated, all of it.

1613
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,420
And people are still like, wow, look at

1614
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,440
that, Mars, oh, wow, look at that, this.

1615
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,400
It's fake.

1616
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,260
All of it.

1617
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,150
So, you might say, well, they don't have

1618
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,650
access to it because they're given all fake

1619
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:07,930
stuff.

1620
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,690
Yeah, but who's raising their hand in class

1621
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,690
saying, why are we seeing fake images?

1622
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:19,030
You know, very simple.

1623
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,900
It's twisted and distorted.

1624
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,940
And the spiritual beings that have allowed this

1625
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,380
and inspired the leaders to be so twisted

1626
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,020
and distorted, they have an IQ of two

1627
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:35,340
million.

1628
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,800
The only thing to do is wait until

1629
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,260
they're gone.

1630
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:44,800
Displaced.

1631
01:06:48,710 --> 01:07:03,700
Sure.

1632
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:23,370
Well, actually, there's only one measurement of intelligence

1633
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,290
being IQ, and then it's expressed through different

1634
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,550
talents and temperaments.

1635
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:31,090
Well, depending on the social order and the

1636
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,330
culture, again, like Jack Fresco's, you know, if

1637
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,690
you live in a society of headhunters, to

1638
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,190
have a high IQ there, you have to

1639
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,010
be proficient in shrunken heads, right?

1640
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,410
So, which culture are you speaking on?

1641
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:48,910
In certain cultures, you're not considered to be

1642
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,510
intelligent unless you know a lot about the

1643
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:53,010
spiritual world, which in this culture would be

1644
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,630
considered paranormal and not true.

1645
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,070
It's bunk.

1646
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,410
You know, but getting away from the cultural

1647
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,890
aspect, there is an objectivity that we can

1648
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,790
bring to bear on analyzing what is intelligent

1649
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,530
and what is not.

1650
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,230
Like, if you pose a problem, can you

1651
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:07,670
solve it?

1652
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,810
If you can solve it, then by that

1653
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,110
particular metric, you're intelligent.

1654
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,650
Like, if you play the piano really well,

1655
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,350
it doesn't matter what country you go to,

1656
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:19,270
you're still an intelligent piano player.

1657
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,470
If you play it too well, they'll lock

1658
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:25,470
you up in an insane asylum.

1659
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,689
So, you have to play it much better

1660
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,529
than what's considered to be good, but not

1661
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,370
too well, because then you'll be considered a

1662
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:32,810
nutcase.

1663
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,979
Unless you fit some purpose or usefulness at

1664
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:45,439
the time.

1665
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,220
Sure.

1666
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,840
Remember, it's very, very twisted.

1667
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:51,760
So, yes.

1668
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,800
In other words, you could have…

1669
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,340
let's give another example.

1670
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:58,439
You've got 10 people, equally talented, you know,

1671
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,540
of course, with a variation of a small

1672
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,060
bit, but equally talented, and one will be

1673
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,680
extremely successful financially, culturally, or whatever, the other

1674
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,439
one will be homeless.

1675
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:11,700
So, the meritocracy falls apart there, right?

1676
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:16,120
Then it becomes, you know, is it fate,

1677
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,700
you know, or kismet, like they say in

1678
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,819
Islam, or is it, right, who you know,

1679
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:27,580
who you blow, your family, right place, the

1680
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,479
right time, there's too many variables to be

1681
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:31,920
considered.

1682
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:40,689
I've visited insane asylums in the past, as

1683
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:42,870
a guest, to get more detail, I was

1684
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:47,850
not an inmate, and I mean, because I

1685
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,910
am anyone on this planet is an inmate,

1686
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:53,430
but it is an insane asylum, but the

1687
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,710
ones that are in general quarters or general

1688
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:58,570
area all seem very normal within the first

1689
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,030
few minutes, right, you know.

1690
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,930
And then essentially you engage them and you

1691
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:06,290
see that there's something really wrong with them

1692
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:10,210
on a general level, but specifically many of

1693
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,530
the people that are considered to be institutionalized

1694
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,990
or whatever are quite intelligent and can be

1695
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:18,530
beneficial, you know, used in some trade or

1696
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:19,990
some science or whatever.

1697
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,650
So, again, how do they end up there?

1698
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,630
Why do they end up there?

1699
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,610
I mean, you understand the story, whether it's

1700
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,930
folklore or not, it's written in the story,

1701
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,410
Victor Schauberger was making all these advances with

1702
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:32,270
energy, water, and materials, and the powers that

1703
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,730
be, the Schusswaffel, the SS, didn't like his

1704
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,270
advances because he was shaming the academics with

1705
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:42,190
the classical training, so they decided to take

1706
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,630
him to a meeting, they said, and the

1707
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,650
meeting was actually putting him into an insane

1708
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,230
asylum, you know, they just locked him up,

1709
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,010
right, for a year or something.

1710
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,270
It's in his bio.

1711
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,110
It's a very, very unsure subject.

1712
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,430
IQ, intelligence, success, I'm bringing the element of,

1713
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,110
you know, success, you know, why are there,

1714
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:08,970
you know, you can have equally intelligent people,

1715
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,190
I mean, here's another thing, have you ever

1716
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,230
met any captains of industry, like I haven't

1717
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,770
met like Bezos of Amazon or Bill Gates,

1718
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,330
but I've met people on their level, and

1719
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,270
they're idiots, right?

1720
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,870
You know, you're an idiot, not in a

1721
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,790
sense, actually an idiot, actually in the definition

1722
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:28,110
of the word, right?

1723
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,870
You know, you keep saying that a lot,

1724
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,950
but anybody who works in psychology would claim

1725
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,310
that those definitions are archaic at this point.

1726
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:40,250
Okay, but psychologists are the witch doctors, you

1727
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,590
know, there's no science behind that, they're a

1728
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,630
wicked group of people, and they have a

1729
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,970
propensity of destroying their children and the people

1730
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,250
around them as well, you know.

1731
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,530
Using that art.

1732
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:54,190
Like, was it Golden, Samuel Golden, or Golden

1733
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,850
Meier, or the film, anyone who wants to

1734
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,770
see a psychiatrist should have their head examined,

1735
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,010
right?

1736
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,930
They're pretty sick, just like the people in

1737
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,790
the medical industry and the legal industry.

1738
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,570
Religious industry are pretty sick.

1739
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,040
Right?

1740
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:15,680
Sure.

1741
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,440
A lot of sickness going around.

1742
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,120
But no, the intelligence thing is hard to

1743
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,680
figure out, because other than IQ, you just

1744
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,140
have to observe how people's minds work and

1745
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,620
infer things from their choices and the way

1746
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,720
that they act to see how smart you

1747
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,040
would, you know, rate them.

1748
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,480
But it's hard to find an objective metric,

1749
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,400
especially when you have different types of aptitude

1750
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,540
that manifest in different areas, but don't necessarily

1751
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,460
triangulate into one thing that you can say,

1752
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,340
well, this person is smart overall.

1753
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,380
They're just good at different things.

1754
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,100
And not so good at other things.

1755
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,840
Yeah, you could take, well, if you want

1756
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,840
to, it's really difficult to keep anything sanitized

1757
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,460
and secular.

1758
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,300
You know, the moment you omit the spiritual

1759
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,880
realm, you fall flat on your face and

1760
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,780
the science or the understanding of the subject

1761
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,180
becomes paper thin.

1762
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,020
Right?

1763
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:22,980
Okay.

1764
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,580
There's a spiritual influence behind all this stuff.

1765
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:28,940
Yeah, but I mean, a lot of the

1766
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,580
ancient Greeks discarded their mythology completely and still

1767
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,020
came up with intriguing things.

1768
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,100
I mean, they don't last in the long

1769
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,640
run, but it's good conversation and it's, you

1770
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,960
know, you can take something from it.

1771
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,500
Well, you know, you've heard like of Enochian

1772
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,380
magic, which has nothing to do with Enoch

1773
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:45,940
or whatever.

1774
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,200
You know, they just branded themselves with that.

1775
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,920
But that was along the thought form that

1776
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,760
if you study, especially Pythagoras, right, who was

1777
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,600
trained in Babylon and was involved in a

1778
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,820
lot of mystic occult stuff, right?

1779
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,660
The moment you go back and look at

1780
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,140
philosophical sciences and science and philosophy, however you

1781
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,760
want to interchange it, there is no separation

1782
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,400
in the inner group between them and occulted

1783
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,060
knowledge dealing with spiritual stuff.

1784
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,640
Like, give you an example, like Aleister Crowley,

1785
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,320
on one aspect, you know, he gets the

1786
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,020
reputation that he has, but on the other

1787
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,900
aspect, he was pursuing scientific endeavors, right?

1788
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,620
He was too mixed up in the spy

1789
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,080
world and the political world and other things

1790
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:33,620
like that.

1791
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,820
But when he was doing evocations of Athena

1792
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:40,200
and Apollo and that creature, the lamb, you

1793
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,900
know, and all these demons and all that,

1794
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,080
that was a science, right?

1795
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,920
In other words, that was dealing with that

1796
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,300
world as being as anything real, you know,

1797
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,640
as real as anything else, right?

1798
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,860
If you look at the history of the

1799
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:59,440
jet propulsion, Jack Whiteside Parsons and Scientology and

1800
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,700
all that other stuff, all of it is

1801
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,380
occult, right?

1802
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:07,300
You could look at the Native Americans and

1803
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,680
the Skinwalkers, right?

1804
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,960
There's ritual, it's real, you know, the werewolf

1805
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,040
or the werewolf, you know, people transforming into,

1806
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,800
you know, shapeshifting into animals or other things

1807
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,040
like that is real, right?

1808
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,820
But there's no place for that in science.

1809
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,600
So, would a Skinwalker, someone who's done the

1810
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,160
occult rites of passage, which are pretty horrible,

1811
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,680
which was known all over the world, even

1812
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,660
since Babylonian times, to transform into another creature

1813
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:45,100
with those attributes, and it really happens, can

1814
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,720
modern day science or even then explain it?

1815
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:47,960
No.

1816
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,520
You just knew that if you did this,

1817
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,140
you did that.

1818
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,000
It was a ritual, just like today, science

1819
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
is a ritual, just like back then.

1820
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,900
When you get to a certain level, you

1821
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,480
don't understand it anymore, you just know if

1822
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,120
you do this, this happens.

1823
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,600
So, that's the ultimate intelligence at this point,

1824
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,520
when you realize the limitations, is how well

1825
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,920
can you do this to get that, right?

1826
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,600
Well, as far as being practical, yes, because

1827
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,520
you want a result.

1828
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,780
So, I guess in the sort of power

1829
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:28,540
game, yeah, the person who does this to

1830
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,680
get that the best way ends up on

1831
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,420
top and wins.

1832
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,880
But he's not necessarily...

1833
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,040
Not necessarily.

1834
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,740
Strategically, he's smarter, but he can still be

1835
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,080
an idiot.

1836
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,660
But you win what?

1837
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,700
See, ultimately, when you have a physical body,

1838
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,140
it's about territory, right?

1839
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,120
Like, give me an example, like technology is

1840
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,260
nothing more than more elaborate tools, right?

1841
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,540
That's all it is, right?

1842
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,680
What's a cell phone, you know?

1843
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,580
What's the difference between a cell phone and

1844
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,980
a pay phone once you're using it?

1845
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,620
Nothing, really.

1846
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,800
Then you have a smartphone, which is a

1847
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,540
combination of a computer and a phone.

1848
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:05,280
So, it gets more and more, you know,

1849
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,660
it's a tool, right?

1850
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,720
It's basically a tool.

1851
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,720
The spiritual world is also a tool.

1852
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,480
But when you get to the spiritual world

1853
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,900
and you're given certain instructions, if you do

1854
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,940
this, you get that.

1855
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,500
Well, how many questions do you want to

1856
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,700
ask in between, right?

1857
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,120
If someone wants to learn how to be

1858
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,200
a shapeshifter, you have to kill someone that's

1859
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,680
near and dear to you and give up

1860
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,160
something that's very precious to you, right?

1861
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,500
Then you have to do cannibalistic acts, and

1862
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,020
then you have to make things out of

1863
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,140
the body, and then you have to choose

1864
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,700
what animal you want to be at certain

1865
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,680
times, and then eventually you end up having

1866
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,700
that power, right?

1867
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,400
So, if you start asking questions in between

1868
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,660
all those processes that I just brought up,

1869
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,680
what kind of an answer are you going

1870
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,080
to get?

1871
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,320
None.

1872
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,780
They're going to say, well, if you really

1873
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,740
want to be a shapeshifter, you have to

1874
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,500
bring us your child or your parent or

1875
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,380
your wife or your husband and kill them,

1876
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,820
and then engage in cannibalism, necrophilia, right?

1877
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,800
And then you have to make all these

1878
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,380
things out of what's left of the body.

1879
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,200
And if you ask why, well, they're going

1880
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,500
to just basically tell you there is no

1881
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:20,880
why.

1882
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,800
You either do it or you don't, right?

1883
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,940
You see, when you get to that crazy

1884
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,980
– and the reason I'm bringing that up

1885
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,100
as an example is because you're going to

1886
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,780
see a resurgence of this stuff happening.

1887
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,540
I mean, if you go into the Native

1888
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,280
American and African continent, I mean, they see

1889
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,380
more of it happening than it ever has

1890
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,560
before, because especially now the white industrialists are

1891
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,880
like, oh, yeah, you could really do that?

1892
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,120
All right, here's a plane ticket and a

1893
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,300
place, so why don't you come and show

1894
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:50,860
us, right?

1895
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,300
Now, look, you're going to have a bunch

1896
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,580
of crazy white boys doing it, right?

1897
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,560
So if you start asking in between, why

1898
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,460
do I have to kill someone?

1899
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,000
Why do I have to eat their spleen?

1900
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,060
Why do I have to wear this animal

1901
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:02,240
skin?

1902
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,080
There's no answer for that.

1903
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,860
That's just how it's done, right?

1904
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,400
Like, for example, when you look in scripture,

1905
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,580
you know, my people will do these things.

1906
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,380
Well, why?

1907
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,160
Well, you ever heard of the game Simon

1908
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:18,820
Says, right?

1909
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,020
You just do it, you know.

1910
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:25,880
What's his name?

1911
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,340
Solomon asked questions, like he wanted to know

1912
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,940
stuff, and they said, okay, we'll let you

1913
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,000
know how to know stuff.

1914
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,140
Like, we might not tell you everything directly,

1915
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,940
but we'll give you the means to access

1916
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,280
what you need to know.

1917
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:41,340
Right.

1918
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,760
But you have to be specific.

1919
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,060
Go back and study that.

1920
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,920
Like, for example, I've heard people say, well,

1921
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,340
when you go to court, don't say anything

1922
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,300
or put words in my mouth, put words

1923
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,040
in your mouth, right?

1924
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,660
Well, I've heard people going to court say,

1925
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,320
I'm not going to say anything.

1926
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,220
They yell it up in jail, and they

1927
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,100
don't say anything, right?

1928
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,200
Because if the scripture is misunderstood, when they

1929
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,320
go back and read it, it says, if

1930
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,200
you are brought to court on my sake

1931
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,220
regarding me, I'll put the words in.

1932
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,680
But if you have a traffic ticket and

1933
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,840
don't say anything or whatever issue, you better

1934
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,680
speak up, you see?

1935
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,220
So there's a little bit of this and

1936
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,440
a little bit of that, right?

1937
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,400
Solomon wanted to know, if you look very

1938
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,580
closely, he wanted wisdom because he wanted to

1939
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,680
know how to approach the deity directly, right?

1940
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,540
Because he knows it's about knowledge and not

1941
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:35,640
about faith, right?

1942
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,680
It's not about faith going to the gods.

1943
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,440
It's about the faith, and the faith is,

1944
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,920
you know, how to do the right thing.

1945
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,320
Again, it goes back to knowledge.

1946
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,650
That's the faith, by the way.

1947
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,670
The only thing that I find sort of

1948
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,870
incongruent with that, even though it makes sense,

1949
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:58,150
is that nowhere in Kings or Chronicles or

1950
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,930
anywhere, maybe I haven't read songs of Solomon

1951
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:03,690
or Lamentations well enough, but I don't really

1952
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:07,930
find that Solomon ever uses his wisdom to

1953
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,010
access the main deity in any kind of

1954
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:10,230
way.

1955
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,670
Like, he's shown being wise.

1956
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:15,250
Yeah, in the Chronicles it doesn't, but in

1957
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,050
scripture it's written, I want to know how

1958
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:18,030
to go in and out.

1959
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,110
Yeah, but I mean, apart from that, he

1960
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:21,350
says that one thing.

1961
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,410
Why he wants wisdom.

1962
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,610
Yeah, but then show me the examples.

1963
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,990
Well, the examples are very simple.

1964
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,790
He was sequestered to live a material life

1965
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,030
like everyone else.

1966
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,500
He wasn't translated into another realm.

1967
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,400
He wanted to do the best he can

1968
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,020
to access that realm from this realm.

1969
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,700
Right, and we don't see displays of that.

1970
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,080
Like, we see displays of his wisdom in

1971
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,420
a kingly, administrative sense.

1972
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,020
Like when he judged between the two women

1973
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:56,960
and the child, or when he explained complicated

1974
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,580
things to the Queen of Sheba, even though

1975
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,840
details are not given.

1976
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,060
It's just said, look at these things that

1977
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:02,380
he did.

1978
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,320
He's a smart guy.

1979
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,780
How do you access the main god?

1980
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,060
I don't see him doing that.

1981
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,100
Well, no, yeah, what he did also was

1982
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:13,180
he negotiated a position that gave him the

1983
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,000
upper hand with all the countries and nations

1984
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,600
around him to maintain tribute.

1985
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,060
But it had nothing to do with the

1986
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:19,540
main god.

1987
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,760
No, because he was sequestered to living a

1988
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,940
mortal, material life.

1989
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,320
Yeah, but you can still...

1990
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,200
I thought it was to access him, to

1991
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:28,900
go in and out.

1992
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,320
So show me the going in and out.

1993
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,920
I don't see establishing a world empire as

1994
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,680
going in and out.

1995
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,240
Essentially, that's an interesting thing.

1996
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,920
You could say it's slighted in a way

1997
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,480
because who is really given the right to

1998
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:44,920
do that?

1999
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,640
It's the high priest, right?

2000
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,020
And Solomon is not a high priest.

2001
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,660
So it's a moot point.

2002
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,180
Again, futility.

2003
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,780
Like, if the temple were there and they

2004
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,740
asked you what to do, what you would

2005
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,220
like, and you'd like I'd like wisdom so

2006
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,300
I could know how to go in and

2007
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,420
out, meaning of the highest point in the

2008
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,780
temple, that's kind of a moot point, isn't

2009
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:04,900
it?

2010
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,260
Because you're not a high priest, so why

2011
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,380
would you ask that, right?

2012
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,440
But it's not denying himself.

2013
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:10,840
No, it's not.

2014
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,080
I wouldn't say that it was directly, but

2015
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,660
indirectly, he's not a high priest.

2016
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,520
The high priest was the only one that

2017
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,880
had the authority to do that on the

2018
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,460
time of the Day of Atonement.

2019
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,700
But then he can't be talking about that

2020
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,160
because it's given to him.

2021
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,080
Why not?

2022
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,160
Why not?

2023
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,460
Wouldn't you, if you had a strong desire

2024
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,540
and love for the Father, and His temple

2025
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,980
and His set-apart place was here, and

2026
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,460
you knew that it was, if it was

2027
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,700
knowledge-based, wouldn't you want the knowledge on

2028
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,740
how to enter that place?

2029
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,800
To be closest?

2030
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,120
Without dying?

2031
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,480
That would be the ultimate thing, right?

2032
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,560
Right, yeah, but let's be real, as far

2033
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,180
as just going into the temple and performing.

2034
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,100
I think he was pretty real.

2035
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,860
He was pretty real about it.

2036
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:58,300
I think the dedication that his father had

2037
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,400
towards Yahweh was also somehow realized by him.

2038
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,980
Maybe that's why he said it.

2039
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,720
But we can't be talking about the physical

2040
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,820
going into the temple, because that was already

2041
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,340
laid out in Leviticus, how it worked.

2042
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,040
That was not a secret, what the priest

2043
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,340
did.

2044
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,700
We know what the priest did.

2045
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,260
Obviously Solomon knows what the priest did.

2046
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,940
He built the temple.

2047
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:18,940
He already knows what's there.

2048
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,560
Sure, but his father was able to grab

2049
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,500
priestly garments that you can communicate directly with,

2050
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,080
that he allegedly was not of the class,

2051
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,100
but he did it anyway.

2052
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,930
Does it say you can't touch the garments?

2053
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:35,070
I don't remember.

2054
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,370
No, he accessed garments, the vestments and things.

2055
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,090
Yeah, but you can touch the garments.

2056
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,310
No, no, he actually placed them, he wore

2057
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,530
them.

2058
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,790
Okay, you can't wear them?

2059
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,150
I wouldn't say you should, no.

2060
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,950
Oh, come on, you can wear them, though.

2061
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,830
You just can't go into the space.

2062
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:52,710
Of course you can wear them.

2063
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,950
Well, he did.

2064
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,770
And he asked, should I go against the

2065
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:58,310
Philistines?

2066
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:00,410
And he's like, no, don't go against the

2067
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:00,870
Philistines.

2068
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,130
And the other place is, yes, go against

2069
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:02,790
the Philistines.

2070
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:07,550
Yeah, I don't know if that's exclusive to

2071
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:08,010
the priest.

2072
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:14,850
The priest was to wear the vestment, the

2073
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:17,590
breastplate, the shoulder.

2074
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,050
You can put on a police uniform, it's

2075
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,710
not illegal, but you can't go out and

2076
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:23,810
pretend to be a police officer.

2077
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:24,670
That's a different thing.

2078
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,570
Actually, what's interesting is the actual police are

2079
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:29,990
pretending to be police, but anyway, that's a

2080
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,890
whole other discussion.

2081
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,200
Right.

2082
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,420
But for me, it's the Solomon thing that's

2083
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,160
interesting because there's something about him in his

2084
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,340
situation that's being obscured, or at least it's

2085
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,520
not self-evident.

2086
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,300
Because he asks for wisdom for a particular

2087
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,340
thing, but he's never shown displaying wisdom in

2088
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,280
the going-ins and the coming-outs of

2089
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,660
anything.

2090
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,040
He's only shown wise as a king.

2091
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,600
What's chronicled in Scripture, no, we don't see

2092
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,180
him doing any kind of a liturgy or

2093
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:08,460
any kind of a let's say, presence in

2094
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:08,980
the presence.

2095
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:14,340
We actually don't have a lot of, I'm

2096
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,960
sure it exists, but Scripture doesn't give us

2097
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:17,980
a lot about Solomon.

2098
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,260
I mean, as much as you think, here

2099
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,200
we have the wisest man that ever lived,

2100
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,860
and there's what, maybe a dozen verses?

2101
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:27,860
If that?

2102
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:29,420
Yeah.

2103
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,880
Two chapters maybe, a chapter and a half?

2104
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,460
Here and there?

2105
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,260
And there's a couple other mentions, and that's

2106
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:35,420
it?

2107
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,380
And then you have the writings, if you

2108
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:42,780
want to attribute Koelath to Solomon, which is

2109
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:48,980
arguable, you know, Ecclesiastes or Proverbs, you can

2110
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:51,020
attribute that to him.

2111
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,640
There's speculation on that as well, the authorship,

2112
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,120
let's say.

2113
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:05,520
But directly on his works as a chronicle,

2114
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,640
memorialized in Scripture, there's very little that we

2115
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,700
know about him.

2116
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,560
You know, his actual doings, for what his

2117
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,700
request was based on.

2118
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,200
Right.

2119
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:26,220
Yeah, so, I think prophecy is the way

2120
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,500
to go, timekeeping is the way to go.

2121
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,620
What?

2122
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,040
No, everything is the way to go.

2123
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:31,860
What do you mean?

2124
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,580
Well, yes, the archaeology is a tough nut,

2125
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,060
you know, the history, the actual, what do

2126
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:39,800
you call it when you have physical history?

2127
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,160
You know what I mean?

2128
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,900
Yeah, those are probably in some rich guy's

2129
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,840
collection somewhere.

2130
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,500
Oh yeah, it's just not for you to

2131
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:47,680
know.

2132
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,700
Like, here's an example.

2133
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,940
Whether you, you know, every field you study,

2134
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,580
you'll notice that what the institution holds as

2135
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,840
being true is contrary to what's in their,

2136
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,000
memorialized in their field of study.

2137
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:03,500
Right?

2138
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,220
So, you don't have to, what I'm trying

2139
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,220
to say here is you don't have to

2140
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:12,260
go very far, even now, even though most

2141
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,260
of it has not been overtly brought out,

2142
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,720
to find the truth on any matter.

2143
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,200
Right?

2144
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,480
Like, if you want to talk about health,

2145
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,020
guess what?

2146
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,220
You know what it's about?

2147
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:22,820
Hygiene.

2148
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,680
And proper food and good water, right?

2149
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:25,680
Hygiene, again, clean.

2150
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,000
Right?

2151
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,520
Think about it.

2152
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,820
You know, you want to talk about law?

2153
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,220
Well, it's law, not legal.

2154
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,560
There's not an attorney in the world that

2155
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,700
knows or practices law properly as it's written.

2156
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,000
Because once they begin to do that, they

2157
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,120
lose their privilege to do that, and they're

2158
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,600
fired.

2159
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:44,720
Every time.

2160
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,680
They're all a bunch of liars.

2161
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,880
There's not a priest, a pastor, or a

2162
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,380
minister, or whatever, that knows scripture.

2163
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,200
Because the moment they do find out, there's

2164
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,340
no way they can do that, unless they're

2165
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,100
completely evil.

2166
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,380
Which, I would say a good percentage are.

2167
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,240
It doesn't mean they know scripture anyway.

2168
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,180
So, I mean, you go on and on

2169
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:05,840
and on and on.

2170
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:11,520
If you listen to Eric Dollard's recent ravings,

2171
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,700
the grid, especially in the US, is being

2172
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,480
dismantled.

2173
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,280
Well, not being dismantled, but it's being altered

2174
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,320
so it's subject to an EMP attack, right?

2175
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:24,220
So they're going to a Y connection wiring

2176
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:26,340
on the transformer ground versus a delta.

2177
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,220
Yeah.

2178
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,580
Which means that if you, you know, the

2179
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,740
ground goes to the transformer, so if you

2180
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:38,140
lean on something metallic, and there's a big

2181
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,000
short somewhere, like a power line down, you're

2182
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,240
going to receive that voltage.

2183
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:42,620
Right?

2184
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,980
It'll still filter through.

2185
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,000
Most of it will filter through your local

2186
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,740
transformer, but you could die.

2187
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,340
There are cows, farmers that have cows that

2188
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,300
are reporting the cows are falling down near

2189
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,620
transformer lines right now.

2190
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:00,820
So, as far as I notice, the skies

2191
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:01,820
are still being sprayed.

2192
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,420
These are all global agendas.

2193
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,900
So, my point here is, don't focus on

2194
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,440
the national agendas, focus on the global agendas.

2195
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,680
Because the instead of, or antichrist is a

2196
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,740
global thing, not a national thing, right?

2197
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:19,300
But it has to emerge from the nation

2198
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:19,900
of Israel.

2199
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,460
They are to provide the antichrist, right?

2200
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,760
That's why beware of those that say that

2201
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,000
are Judean, but are not.

2202
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:30,740
Not, you know, the King James says Jews,

2203
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:31,520
but are not, right?

2204
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,260
Isn't that talking about the Samaritans though?

2205
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,480
I would suggest that the antichrist is of

2206
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,240
Assyrian descent, but he's going to claim to

2207
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,860
be of Judean extraction.

2208
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,980
So, it gets complicated, right?

2209
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,480
I don't think that, you know, I was

2210
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,480
pondering this, I think last week when we

2211
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,420
were going to do a Sonic, it didn't

2212
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,960
happen, was putting together the pieces and just

2213
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,080
starting to discuss how when you read End

2214
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,720
Times scenarios, that most of them are not

2215
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:08,400
going to be known to the public, or

2216
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,520
by going on the internet, or whatever.

2217
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,660
You know, the specifics.

2218
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,780
It'll be a secret, it'll be very confusing.

2219
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,420
Like, the people will not know who the

2220
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,420
antichrist is, even till the end.

2221
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:24,370
They're going to fall for it, right?

2222
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,880
The Assyrian would have a mindset, wouldn't he?

2223
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,180
Well, he's of that extraction, he's going to

2224
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,300
have a Judean mindset.

2225
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,980
Because he goes to the Judean God.

2226
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,420
Like, if you met a person from Pakistan,

2227
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:47,820
very distinct, when you meet him, you know,

2228
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,640
the language, the mannerisms and stuff, wouldn't this

2229
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,400
fellow also display similar He might.

2230
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,320
But he could be raised in Judea.

2231
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,720
He could be raised in Israel.

2232
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,800
There are Assyrians living in Judea, just like

2233
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,480
if you were raised in a society of

2234
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,700
headhunters, you would act like one.

2235
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,760
But again, knowing prophecy, what's interesting, it's winter,

2236
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,940
the middle of winter right now, just past

2237
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:19,020
it, or the other side of the world

2238
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:23,580
is in summer, but it doesn't, these teachings

2239
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,040
don't go by the other side of the

2240
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,320
world.

2241
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,600
So, this side of the world, it's middle

2242
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,500
of winter, I would suggest that by the

2243
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,060
time we get towards springtime, you're going to

2244
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,520
see a little bit more of what I've

2245
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,800
been talking about, meaning the western world playing

2246
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,340
second fiddle, you know, and more of an

2247
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:47,400
emergence of a sense of drastic change leading

2248
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,820
to cooperation in the Middle East, which it's

2249
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,700
not time yet, it won't be until around

2250
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,440
2025 that you'll have that in place, the

2251
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,600
full cooperation.

2252
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,760
But those changes will still be there.

2253
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,180
I mean, the changes will be more evident

2254
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:03,920
as we get into this spring, you know.

2255
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:09,830
Watch Jordan.

2256
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,530
You know, people watch Syria, you know, don't

2257
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,570
forget about Syria.

2258
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:19,370
Syria is done.

2259
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:20,590
Yeah.

2260
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:22,850
Watch Turkey, watch Greece.

2261
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:25,530
You know, what's been popping up a lot

2262
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,670
on what they call the news is the

2263
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:31,910
settlement, beyond negotiation and complete settlement of a

2264
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:34,270
pipeline between Greece, Cyprus and Israel.

2265
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:35,770
Right?

2266
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:38,950
A pipeline is not just a pipe or

2267
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:41,050
a tube underground or under the sea.

2268
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:44,570
It requires a lot of maintenance and financial

2269
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:46,270
backing, scientific backing, right?

2270
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:51,150
It's like a subculture, right, that's going to

2271
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:53,390
be developed, which always existed.

2272
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,670
I mean, if you've ever, if you know

2273
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,670
people that live in Israel, they do appreciate

2274
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,470
Greek culture.

2275
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:00,850
Right?

2276
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:03,450
If you're like the Elvis of Greek music,

2277
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:05,050
you go and you do a lot of

2278
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,730
concerts in Israel, even though you're singing in

2279
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:08,010
Greek.

2280
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,750
It's just an interesting Hellenistic bond that's remained

2281
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,550
for a long time.

2282
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:16,590
There's a pretty large quote-unquote Judean or

2283
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,650
quote-unquote Jewish community that still lives in

2284
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:18,890
Greece.

2285
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,770
It's over 2,000 years old.

2286
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:23,210
You know, kind of protected, you know.

2287
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,490
But anyway, you could say that about any

2288
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:25,850
place.

2289
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,930
But my point here is that forget about

2290
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:35,670
Syria, watch Lebanon, watch Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, watch

2291
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:45,000
Jordan, watch Iraq, but don't forget about Syria

2292
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,540
completely because remember, the newest Syria is going

2293
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,360
to take land from Syria and Turkey.

2294
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,660
So, there'll still be an autonomous region in

2295
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:00,100
Syria, of course, what's known as Damascus.

2296
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:04,950
But watch Jordan.

2297
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:08,990
That little short guy there, the king in

2298
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:13,410
Jordan, that little guy, who the Americans got

2299
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,210
a leash around because they showed him, you

2300
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,770
know, they trained him as a helicopter pilot,

2301
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:17,170
you know.

2302
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:20,410
And he likes his Harley Davidson or whatever.

2303
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,550
He's got to go.

2304
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:24,070
Not because I say so, it's because scripture

2305
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:25,230
says so.

2306
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:26,410
So.

2307
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,290
And Jordan's going to be broken up.

2308
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,450
Maybe not next month, maybe not next year,

2309
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:33,350
but watch for it.

2310
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,650
I would suggest it's going to be an

2311
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:38,030
extremely fast maneuver.

2312
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:44,470
He'll either perish or he'll be in exile.

2313
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:48,510
But he won't, that kingdom will no longer

2314
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:50,870
be as it is in the near future.

2315
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:52,190
So.

2316
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:58,110
Lebanon and its history as it is right

2317
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,890
now, it's going to be part of Israel.

2318
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:01,310
Territorially.

2319
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:04,030
Not as you know, it won't be Israel

2320
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:06,170
proper, but territorially run by them.

2321
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,830
As parts of Syria will be.

2322
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:11,890
More of the western side of Damascus.

2323
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,610
That's why when I saw the pullout of

2324
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:19,170
American said they're going to pull their troops

2325
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:19,330
out.

2326
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:20,190
That's total rubbish.

2327
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:25,730
Wherever there's underhanded business, the Americans are there.

2328
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,990
You know, if there's rape pillaging and thievery

2329
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:31,150
drugs and whatever, the Americans are not going

2330
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:31,550
to leave.

2331
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,530
But it's interesting how they put that in

2332
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,970
the mindset, you know, publicly.

2333
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,550
Yes.

2334
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:50,350
You have what they call 2019 on the

2335
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:50,990
hopes work schedule.

2336
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:52,770
Isn't that the year that Blade Runner was

2337
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,410
supposed to be?

2338
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:55,070
Yes.

2339
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:56,370
Yeah, right.

2340
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:57,390
Yeah.

2341
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:01,150
So where are the flying cars and all

2342
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:01,950
this stuff, right?

2343
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,870
I'm not going to get anything like that.

2344
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:07,350
So they're probably going to make, you know,

2345
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:09,810
remember how cell phones were getting real small?

2346
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:12,350
You know, and then the smartphone came out

2347
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,470
and it got really big again.

2348
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,270
I think they're going to have to make

2349
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,050
those smartphones really small so you can put

2350
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:17,730
them up your butt.

2351
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:19,290
Yeah.

2352
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,290
That's your technology.

2353
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:28,280
So yeah.

2354
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,760
I think Back to the Future was last

2355
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:31,380
year or something.

2356
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:32,200
The year before.

2357
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:33,020
Yeah.

2358
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,000
And when he goes way into the future,

2359
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,920
meaning when he goes forward into the future,

2360
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:38,220
yeah.

2361
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:41,660
Yeah, yeah.

2362
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,500
The World's Fair in the 1930s they said

2363
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,940
by the 1990s you'll be, you know, on

2364
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:48,620
the moon and all this flying highways in

2365
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:51,020
the skies and what, 2001?

2366
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,240
A space odyssey, right?

2367
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,100
Remember the Hilton?

2368
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,900
Out in outer space?

2369
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,180
So.

2370
01:37:59,200 --> 01:37:59,840
2015.

2371
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,520
Anywho, just one last thing on this social

2372
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,720
science IQ stuff.

2373
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,840
In general, I guess the purpose of science

2374
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,900
is to uncover and rationalize how the natural

2375
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:14,500
world works.

2376
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,020
But as you've mentioned before with a few

2377
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,720
things, psychology and medicine don't really do that.

2378
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,260
And the closer that I look at them,

2379
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,520
the more it seems as if these are

2380
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,280
more like engineering fields than anything else because

2381
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,840
the aim of psychology and medicine seems to

2382
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,600
be more to build something or to construct

2383
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,820
something that is, you know, a human being

2384
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:35,880
that works a certain way.

2385
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,740
And even if you sit through a psychologist

2386
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:40,560
session, they'll tell you that their job is

2387
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,940
to help you get better.

2388
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,580
And get better has really nothing to do

2389
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,100
with science.

2390
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,220
So they're kind of already saying that they

2391
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,600
have a constructionist viewpoint and not a dispassionate

2392
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:49,820
one.

2393
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,760
Well, the ultimate society from the goddess religion

2394
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,720
is to have male with male union, female

2395
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,540
with female union, and they procreate hermaphroditic or

2396
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,120
asexual creatures.

2397
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,240
But this is a joke.

2398
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:05,760
Right?

2399
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,320
It's not possible.

2400
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,440
What I just said is the agenda.

2401
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,480
What they do is just a matter of

2402
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,800
the agenda has to happen over a certain

2403
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,240
amount of time and they just take up

2404
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:18,700
your time.

2405
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:22,760
They're just idiots.

2406
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,140
I mean, Freud visited the US for the

2407
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,120
first time, I think it was the late

2408
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,980
20s, early 30s or 30s.

2409
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:33,080
And he was quoted by the press and

2410
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,100
his colleagues more than once that he said,

2411
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,660
we're bringing the plague to America now.

2412
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,900
Meaning the plague, meaning psychiatry.

2413
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:46,980
What's the plague?

2414
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,140
It's disease, right?

2415
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:49,740
It's death.

2416
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:59,680
Again, what they say they do to the

2417
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,700
people and what they say they do memorialized

2418
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,260
in their own stuff is very different.

2419
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,840
Look at the legal society.

2420
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,480
Right?

2421
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,860
In America, for example, they say the Supreme

2422
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,840
Court is the highest court.

2423
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,320
Well, yeah, it's written in some places.

2424
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:19,120
But the workings of the Supreme Court is

2425
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,020
not a court of record.

2426
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,660
It's an appellate court.

2427
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:23,800
Right?

2428
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,200
So the highest court of record is the

2429
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,700
oldest court of record which would probably be

2430
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,400
in Pennsylvania or New York somewhere.

2431
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,160
But that's completely demonic at this point because

2432
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,100
what's demonic about it is most people don't

2433
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,640
understand that slavery is a voluntary concept.

2434
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,100
If you went throughout history and asked a

2435
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,820
slave how he got there, he would tell

2436
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,340
you exactly how he got there, and it

2437
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,340
was usually by consent of some sort.

2438
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,600
Even though it was not favorable.

2439
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,700
It was because they were too poor or

2440
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,460
there was a form of indenture they had

2441
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,020
to do, but they knew why they were

2442
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:58,220
there.

2443
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,260
Right now, most people don't know that their

2444
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,600
property, through the birth certificate and through their

2445
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,880
other contracts that they do.

2446
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,160
And by description, they don't know that they're

2447
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:08,500
slaves.

2448
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:09,560
That's why it's demonic.

2449
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:11,220
Right?

2450
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,980
Yeah, but you had people that were taken

2451
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:16,160
into slavery through war.

2452
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,780
Right, but they again, they were given the

2453
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,080
choice.

2454
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,160
You either die or you become a slave.

2455
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,380
And it may not be vocalized, but if

2456
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:28,360
you're taken as a slave and you try

2457
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,320
to escape, you die.

2458
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,620
Right?

2459
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,360
Yeah, but come on, it's not voluntary.

2460
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:35,680
Sure it is.

2461
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:39,460
You don't choose between dying or slavery.

2462
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,340
Sure you do.

2463
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,220
You're just psychologically not taught that anymore.

2464
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,320
When somebody stands over you with a sword

2465
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,340
about to chop your head off, that's not

2466
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:50,440
a bad thing.

2467
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,520
That's not a bad way to die.

2468
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,080
If your head is chopped off, you've got

2469
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,160
about 20 seconds of consciousness after that.

2470
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:56,020
That's a lot.

2471
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,700
Yeah, it can seem like an hour.

2472
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,880
You won't feel anything, or too much.

2473
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:03,780
Yeah.

2474
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,040
It'll just feel like a burn.

2475
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,160
Yeah, sure.

2476
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:10,800
It's better than 20 years in whatever.

2477
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:18,320
Look, biological and suicidal are the most successful

2478
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,100
way to wage war is biological.

2479
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,300
Poisoning the wells, spreading disease on the enemy,

2480
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,220
and then suicidal army, or whatever.

2481
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,000
The ones that don't are willing to give

2482
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,620
up their lives.

2483
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,980
But it has to be tactical and strategic.

2484
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:39,020
It can't be just go get slaughtered like

2485
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:39,880
the Americans do.

2486
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,060
They love having a body count.

2487
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,420
They don't care who it is.

2488
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,920
Or the English do that also.

2489
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,540
They don't care if it's their side or

2490
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:48,380
for their god.

2491
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,480
I'm not talking about the god they talk

2492
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,400
about, but behind the scenes.

2493
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:56,620
Right.

2494
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,740
The Japanese used human driven torpedoes.

2495
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:05,940
A lot of the American ships during World

2496
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:08,320
War II that were sunk, and the captains

2497
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:14,760
were taken for court-martial because of incapable

2498
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,920
or incompetence.

2499
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,580
There was nothing they could do because the

2500
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:23,300
torpedoes that were sent towards those American aircraft

2501
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,900
carriers, or battleships, or frigates, or whatever, were

2502
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:26,580
human powered.

2503
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,500
There was a little guy, a little Jap

2504
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:34,040
in there, sitting in a pronated position, laying

2505
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:34,720
on his stomach.

2506
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,700
A little nip.

2507
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,480
Nip is another term for them.

2508
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,180
He was laying on his stomach.

2509
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:43,460
They picked the smallest guy.

2510
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,660
And he guided the torpedo.

2511
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:50,180
So when the ocean currents he would adjust

2512
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:52,220
and speed up and slam it into it.

2513
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,060
There was nothing he could do.

2514
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,560
When you have a human guided...

2515
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,080
Right now they don't need human guided.

2516
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,100
They have drones with cameras on them.

2517
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:03,180
I had a conversation once with the first

2518
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,620
missile with a video camera on it.

2519
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,660
It was used in Vietnam.

2520
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,920
I had a conversation with the guy who

2521
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,260
actually piloted the missile.

2522
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:13,100
He was in an airplane.

2523
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:14,700
It had a camera.

2524
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:15,480
It was very grainy.

2525
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,260
It was to blow up a bridge in

2526
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:18,680
Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

2527
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,920
He had a joystick and the whole thing.

2528
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:21,920
It wasn't very accurate.

2529
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,880
When the camera showed that the missile was

2530
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,340
slightly off target and he tried to correct

2531
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,000
for it, it was very easy to over

2532
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,320
correct and put it off course.

2533
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:35,180
But it did hit the bridge and he

2534
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:36,840
steered it in with a video camera.

2535
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:37,540
It was very grainy.

2536
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,160
So right now you don't need suicide armies.

2537
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,620
Because they have drones and robots to do

2538
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:44,740
it.

2539
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,860
Isn't the army recruiting young people that are

2540
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:50,080
good at video games for that?

2541
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,500
It's been known for a while.

2542
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,460
They could steer the missiles in right now.

2543
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,500
What's the difference?

2544
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,100
In other words, there is a sentient intelligence

2545
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:05,100
behind the weapon that is the only way

2546
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,660
to be effective in war.

2547
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:10,220
Not dumb bombs where they carpet bomb everything.

2548
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,420
They have everyone still believing the atomic bombs

2549
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,980
had an effect in World War II.

2550
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,640
Douglas Dietrich talks a lot about it.

2551
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,580
He's pretty psychotic.

2552
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:21,000
Anything he says outside of World War II

2553
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,900
stuff is gibberish.

2554
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:27,220
But when he gives the points on World

2555
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,720
War II, he's on point.

2556
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:33,460
More people, more ordnance in terms of explosive

2557
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,340
ordnance and more people were killed during the

2558
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,540
firebombing of Tokyo which was upwards of a

2559
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,900
quarter of a million than both atomic bombs

2560
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:40,580
put together.

2561
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,660
But no one talks about that.

2562
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:44,080
They have to talk about the atomic bombs

2563
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,360
because they want you to worship atomic energy.

2564
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:50,620
But then they figured out that atomic energy

2565
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:53,580
was safer than they even thought so they

2566
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,120
had to reverse it and make it more

2567
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:55,660
dangerous.

2568
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,340
Do you know that when they tell you

2569
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:03,220
about radioactive waste and all that it's not

2570
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:06,880
so much the actual material that's radioactive but

2571
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,840
all the surrounding materials that you need to

2572
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,580
purify it.

2573
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,060
The distillation process is very nasty.

2574
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:18,780
I don't want to get in trouble by

2575
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,660
talking about how it's done publicly because they

2576
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,780
do guard a lot of that.

2577
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:28,720
But I would suggest that they do still

2578
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,440
worship it.

2579
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,500
Look at 9-11.

2580
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:35,620
Even the Pentagon was a nuclear event.

2581
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:36,520
It just didn't go off.

2582
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:38,120
It was a nuclear missile that was fired

2583
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:38,700
at the Pentagon.

2584
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:43,620
But it just the idiots that launched it

2585
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:45,620
didn't have the arming codes for it.

2586
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:46,640
How do I know?

2587
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:48,640
They didn't have the arming codes for it?

2588
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:51,840
Well, Washington D.C. is still there, right?

2589
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:56,320
So it was a nuclear event and it's

2590
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:00,160
still being used more than ever.

2591
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,240
They've even convinced people it should be medicinal.

2592
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,520
They do radiation treatment which is stupid.

2593
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:12,880
But nonetheless we were talking about war and

2594
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,000
they brought in the idea of the guided

2595
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
missile the human guided missile aspect and now

2596
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,720
it's been replaced by cameras.

2597
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,280
And young, snotty 19-year-olds or 18

2598
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,000
-year-olds or whatever.

2599
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,700
Yeah, but another aspect of the guided missiles

2600
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:31,040
was that they were kamikaze pilots and that

2601
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,780
they were sacrifices to the gods.

2602
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,120
Right, right.

2603
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:38,840
Sure, and the more they sacrificed, the more

2604
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,520
power they got.

2605
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,740
Which is, you know.

2606
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,040
They did win the war, by the way.

2607
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:44,840
The Japanese.

2608
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,640
But it wasn't so evident because you know,

2609
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:51,880
Hirohito had no less than 20 insurgencies inside

2610
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,620
of his own palace even.

2611
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,960
You know, people amongst him, admirals, generals that

2612
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,880
wanted to get rid of him.

2613
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,620
And there was even attacks on the palace

2614
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,120
by his own people, more than one.

2615
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,480
Where he was spared by hiding in secret

2616
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:05,980
rooms.

2617
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,980
Where is that memorialized?

2618
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,260
Is that Dietrich?

2619
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,980
Yeah, I've seen it in Dietrich and I've

2620
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:15,520
also seen it in other...

2621
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,980
You could do a research where I looked

2622
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:20,980
at this a little closer more than a

2623
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:21,620
decade ago.

2624
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:28,100
You could look up assassination attempts on Emperor

2625
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:28,640
Hirohito.

2626
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:30,360
Just Google that and you'll see there's writings

2627
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,280
about it.

2628
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,240
On the Showa.

2629
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,020
He was known as the Showa or you

2630
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:39,660
could put in Hirohito assassination attempts.

2631
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:43,830
43, 44, 45.

2632
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,770
Those three years were very difficult.

2633
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:54,540
Assassination attempts also on the Fuhrer of the

2634
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,120
Third Reich.

2635
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:57,940
Oh yeah, that we know about.

2636
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,180
Were prevalent, yeah.

2637
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,480
Both from his own people and international attempts.

2638
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,880
You know, people coming in as spies.

2639
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:17,760
Another thing that's not known is Roosevelt was

2640
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,000
assassinated, but it was secret.

2641
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,840
I spoke to someone once a long time

2642
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,760
ago that was alive then and he was

2643
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,540
part of the OSI or whatever, the secret

2644
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:26,780
group.

2645
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:30,580
He says, Roosevelt died of lead poisoning.

2646
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,500
Now you could say that publicly and most

2647
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,700
people say, yeah, I know you could die

2648
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:35,760
from lead poisoning, right?

2649
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:36,820
No, no.

2650
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,760
I mean like instant lead poisoning.

2651
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,760
Like as in a slug of lead.

2652
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:43,760
Yeah.

2653
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:44,760
Yeah.

2654
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:58,220
You know, for people that won World War

2655
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,720
II, the Japanese don't act like it.

2656
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:04,440
No, because the winners write history.

2657
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,120
The people don't know.

2658
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,060
The people are morons just like the Americans

2659
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:09,860
and just like the Iraqis and just like

2660
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:11,840
any other Russian or whatever.

2661
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:13,300
The people never know.

2662
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,820
They're just kept in the dark.

2663
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:15,780
It's none of their business.

2664
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:20,400
It's most, the larger the event, the more

2665
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,940
of it is a need-to-know basis.

2666
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,500
Yeah, but the leaders don't even act like

2667
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:26,920
they won.

2668
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,320
At the time they did, but now time

2669
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:31,800
has faded.

2670
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,220
The thing is they had suffered a lot

2671
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:35,820
of damage.

2672
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:37,060
Right?

2673
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,540
The Americans suffered a lot of damage too.

2674
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,140
It's not known because morally it affects morale.

2675
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:45,940
There were thousands of people killed in the

2676
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:49,980
US and a tremendous amount of industry proportionately

2677
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:55,640
was destroyed by sabotage, both of Japanese and

2678
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,020
German.

2679
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,960
You could look up factory sabotage during World

2680
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,500
War II.

2681
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,020
Munitions factories and I don't mean where the

2682
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:08,580
actual shells are being packed, but the places

2683
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,680
that develop the chemicals for the munitions.

2684
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:11,740
Right?

2685
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,840
You need a little potassium nitrate and carbon

2686
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:20,520
and borrow whatever chemicals to make explosives.

2687
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,260
Those factories were sabotaged.

2688
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,900
You don't have to sabotage where they're packing

2689
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,020
the shells with gunpowder.

2690
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,060
You just sabotage the suppliers.

2691
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,040
It's more effective because they're less secure.

2692
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,360
Ports were sabotaged.

2693
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,500
Ships were sabotaged.

2694
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,800
Factories were sabotaged.

2695
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,620
The American dirigible program was sabotaged.

2696
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,080
Flying blimps, hot air balloons, things like that.

2697
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,440
You don't hear about it because it was

2698
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,900
considered detrimental to morale.

2699
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:58,760
I see.

2700
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:04,580
It was not an attack like the Americans

2701
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,680
flying over Tokyo.

2702
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,620
They were people that would lie about their

2703
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:11,180
nationality or people that were hired to go

2704
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,120
work in a factory.

2705
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,580
You work in the factory for a few

2706
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:17,000
weeks acting normal and then you just unscrew

2707
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,820
some valve of a critical part of the

2708
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:20,240
machinery.

2709
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,840
It's like cutting the brake lines in someone's

2710
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,140
car.

2711
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:28,240
You don't completely cut the whole brake line

2712
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,840
because the moment they put it in drive,

2713
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,860
they notice there's no brakes.

2714
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:33,460
You cut it so it leaks.

2715
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,440
It's a very little volume.

2716
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,480
When they brake two or three times then

2717
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:40,380
all the liquid is out.

2718
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:50,740
There's a lot of stuff that people don't

2719
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:53,380
know about because it hasn't been presented to

2720
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:54,100
them publicly.

2721
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01,550
I guess I was more referring to being

2722
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:04,230
able to infer people's motivations by looking at

2723
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:04,770
the actions.

2724
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:06,310
If you look at the actions of the

2725
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:08,350
Japanese government and the people, they don't act

2726
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:11,050
like war winners even covertly.

2727
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:14,190
For several levels you want to see how

2728
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:15,450
they don't act like war winners.

2729
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:17,410
One is you have to consider the main

2730
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:19,890
aspect, again culture, is they're very feudal.

2731
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,270
Feudal society.

2732
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:23,730
Ancestral worship.

2733
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:27,050
So right there they're pretty good craftsmen.

2734
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:30,430
They're very disciplined but they're pretty moronic from

2735
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:31,530
a spiritual point of view.

2736
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:34,650
The second aspect is that they did suffer

2737
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:37,290
attacks.

2738
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:40,130
So you had displaced people.

2739
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:45,470
So basically the whole point about the media

2740
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:47,910
having them as losing the war actually doesn't

2741
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:50,890
really say they lose the war or surrender

2742
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:52,530
was never really used.

2743
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:55,690
It was acceptance of the foreign powers to

2744
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:57,470
come in and rebuild and clean up.

2745
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:00,230
You see, you've got to realize that Hirohito

2746
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:03,850
had tribute from everyone in Swiss Army.

2747
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,870
Swiss banks in American dollars.

2748
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:12,450
Internationally when a country admits defeat their current

2749
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:13,570
is reset to zero.

2750
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,770
So if you were the emperor Sam, and

2751
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:17,610
I said you have an equivalent of 100

2752
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:20,490
billion in dollars and we're going to reset

2753
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:21,390
the dollar to zero.

2754
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:22,110
Should we do it?

2755
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:22,730
Yes or no?

2756
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:23,990
What would you say?

2757
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:26,830
You're going to do whatever you can to

2758
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:28,410
prevent that from happening, right?

2759
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:33,870
But there's no like, if he had had

2760
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,490
the leverage he could have just made the

2761
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:37,330
Japanese currency the reserve currency.

2762
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:39,470
So clearly he was still taking orders from

2763
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:41,890
some bank or somewhere to not be able

2764
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:42,050
to.

2765
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,110
Well, here's the other thing.

2766
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:48,310
It depends on a basic financial level, yes.

2767
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:50,090
But on high finance, no.

2768
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:51,010
It's like bridge.

2769
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,230
There's no winner or loser.

2770
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:55,750
It's who controls what and what do you

2771
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:56,090
wager.

2772
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:59,790
You know, people say it's chess.

2773
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:00,370
It's not.

2774
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:00,990
It's bridge.

2775
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:03,670
You have partners and you wager.

2776
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,350
There's no winner or loser.

2777
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:07,450
It's just a matter of how well your

2778
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:08,130
wager is.

2779
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:15,880
And also Japan is a small country that

2780
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,380
doesn't have a lot of resources.

2781
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,140
It has resources but not a lot of

2782
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:19,620
resources.

2783
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:22,280
So why would you want to maintain an

2784
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,100
imperial, why would you want to be a

2785
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:25,620
target as an imperial nation?

2786
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,220
Do you want to seem like you succumb

2787
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,860
to world trends and always have the upper

2788
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:32,240
hand?

2789
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:36,440
It depends on how the posture of your

2790
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:37,280
society is.

2791
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:42,090
You know, there are people that tend to

2792
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:43,910
be modest, believe it or not.

2793
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:47,850
I mean, now everybody's out of control, I'd

2794
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,070
say.

2795
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:50,510
Have you ever watched Japanese television?

2796
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:53,850
I mean, like a Japanese television show with

2797
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:55,570
the commercials in Japanese and all that?

2798
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:57,810
I know their game shows are crazy.

2799
01:55:58,330 --> 01:56:00,210
Oh, I mean, I've had, I had a

2800
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,850
videotape, long story but I need to get

2801
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,130
into it.

2802
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:06,650
I got a videotape because I might as

2803
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:07,910
well say it, I was on Japanese TV

2804
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:11,990
a while back and the producers sent me

2805
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:14,690
the whole videotape, you know, and it had

2806
01:56:14,690 --> 01:56:15,770
the commercials and everything.

2807
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:18,070
It was aired and it was really bizarre.

2808
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:19,890
I mean, like totally bizarre, right?

2809
01:56:21,150 --> 01:56:21,430
So.

2810
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:25,560
Now, that's normal to them.

2811
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:29,930
Yeah, I guess you're right.

2812
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:33,650
Yeah, there's some very strange aspects to their

2813
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:33,970
culture.

2814
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:37,530
Say again, Sam?

2815
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:39,470
I've got to take a break for 30

2816
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:39,750
seconds.

2817
01:56:39,850 --> 01:56:40,410
I'll be right back.

2818
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:41,510
I've just got to go outside for a

2819
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:41,630
moment.

2820
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:42,690
I don't think this is going to work.

2821
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:43,770
I'll be right back.

2822
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,670
You guys speak amongst yourselves, okay?

2823
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:47,230
Sure.

2824
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,110
Speak amongst yourselves.

2825
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:51,570
What's that?

2826
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:53,430
No, nothing.

2827
01:56:55,230 --> 01:56:56,750
We're just killing the family, I guess.

2828
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:58,890
No, but I'm going to end up taking

2829
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:00,130
it off soon as well because it's getting

2830
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:00,590
late here.

2831
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:03,690
Yeah, and I get the pleasure of working

2832
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:06,930
early tomorrow, so it all fits in pretty

2833
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:07,210
good.

2834
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:10,450
Fascinating discussion, so.

2835
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:14,810
Yeah, it's been a while.

2836
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,790
Yeah.

2837
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:24,080
So, there was no broadcast last week, after

2838
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:24,280
all?

2839
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,080
No, there was a mix-up.

2840
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:28,160
No worries.

2841
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,550
Alright.

2842
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:49,230
Okay, so what's the consensus?

2843
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:51,490
We've been on long enough, right?

2844
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:53,450
Yeah, I would say so.

2845
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:54,290
Yeah.

2846
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:55,990
Just watch Prophecy.

2847
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:57,150
Learn about timekeeping.

2848
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:59,930
We're in the 11th month already.

2849
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,170
Right?

2850
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:02,810
It's the first week of the 11th month.

2851
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:04,570
No, the 5th.

2852
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:06,290
Yeah.

2853
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:07,790
I get something like that.

2854
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:13,950
And I would say that it's going to

2855
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:16,450
be a rollercoaster ride, especially after the next

2856
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:17,110
year and a half.

2857
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:18,170
Two years, I should say.

2858
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:20,510
Because we're one year into this period in

2859
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,050
springtime.

2860
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:23,270
So at the three and a half mark,

2861
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:26,030
it's, you know, another two and a half

2862
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:29,610
years, it'll be pretty evident to those that

2863
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:31,930
know what's going on.

2864
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:32,670
Right.

2865
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:36,190
Just keep your plans within, you know, less

2866
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:37,250
than a 10-year limit.

2867
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:39,430
Anybody comes to you with a 20-year

2868
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:40,510
plan, say, forget it.

2869
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:43,450
Even a 15-year plan, forget it.

2870
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:48,360
You can keep it short-term.

2871
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,340
Short and dynamic.

2872
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:54,300
And keep your head down.

2873
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:59,230
The reason I say keep your head down

2874
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:00,490
is because whatever you do, you're going to

2875
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:02,270
be dealing with these morons, you know, humans.

2876
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:05,430
So you don't want to get too deeply

2877
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:07,630
involved with their affairs.

2878
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:14,060
Wise words.

2879
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:15,680
Oh, yeah.

2880
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,620
And when it comes, it starts happening, you

2881
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:23,320
know, what you hear about culturally called as

2882
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:25,560
apocalyptic scenarios and all that, it's going to

2883
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,560
be very, very quick.

2884
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:28,660
You won't be able to react when they

2885
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:29,500
start coming, right?

2886
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:32,620
It's whatever mental preparation you have prior.

2887
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:34,920
And you don't want to get caught up

2888
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:35,600
in their bullshit.

2889
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,200
Actually, it's kind of hard to say that

2890
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,900
because it's all been bullshit for the past

2891
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:40,580
two millennia.

2892
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:42,820
So how can you not get caught up

2893
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:43,080
in it?

2894
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:43,880
But you know what I mean.

2895
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:45,820
The stuff that's coming.

2896
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:51,680
Indeed.

2897
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:54,950
All right.

2898
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:57,810
Well, thanks for coming on, Sam and Bruce.

2899
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:58,350
Thank you, Sam.

2900
01:59:58,510 --> 01:59:58,790
Of course.

2901
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:02,570
And I'm going to sign out unless there's

2902
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:03,130
anything else.

2903
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,290
I just looked at the chat.

2904
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:05,570
There's nothing on there.

2905
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:08,130
I see.

2906
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,290
Well, thank you both again.

2907
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:11,610
Okay.

2908
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:13,250
Fascinating subjects.

2909
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:15,410
Okay, cool.

2910
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,530
Yeah, look up a lot of the stuff

2911
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,210
that I brought up.

2912
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:18,250
Yes.

2913
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:18,950
Yeah.

2914
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:21,970
Okay, guys.

2915
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:23,130
I'll see you next week.

2916
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:24,530
Take care now.

2917
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:26,050
Good night, Sam.

2918
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:26,790
Good night, Bruce.
