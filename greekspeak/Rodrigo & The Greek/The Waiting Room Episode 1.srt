1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,350
Rodrigo. Yes, Stelios, how are you? Good, todo bien. I was outside, yeah, so I read

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,330
message and I just went out. I didn't think we're gonna go on, but yeah. So

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,650
what's up? How are you? Yeah. What's on your mind? Something I wanted to speak to you

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,610
about. I wanted to ask you if you know much about dreams, if they mean anything.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,170
Just like you said that there's no such thing as the subconscious, so what would

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:32,590
dreams entail? I wanted to discuss about that and also I do, I am wanting to know

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,890
more about the Jewish traditions, you know, of sacrificing to the gods or, you

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,550
know, like the Santa Claus thing, that that's actually pretty pertinent on my

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,990
mind. It's human, it's not really Jewish, it's basically the human thing, whether

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,410
it's every native culture on the planet has that. It's part of the human, one of

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,930
the things that they brush under the rug, and that's just to tie back into what

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,350
we said earlier about there's no such thing as a subconscious. Well, let's be

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,810
specific, that whole id, ego, conscious, subconscious, dreams, all that stuff now,

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,530
you're stuck in the realm of how I often discuss people think everything was

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,950
created a hundred years ago. So within that realm, that's a very Freudian, Jungian

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,950
construct, when what you actually, you cannot objectify anything that they're

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,030
saying, all you can do is subscribe to their ideology or their philosophy about

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,810
it. Now the reality of it is that you're either conscious or unconscious, just

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,330
like you hear multiple dimensions, those are technical constructs, there's only one

20
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,090
dimension, it's the raw crude dimension of space and everything in it, either

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,350
seen or unseen, perceptible or unperceptible, the concept of third

22
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,090
dimension, fourth dimension, fifth dimension, all that stuff is technical construct, like

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,290
architects use when they do a floor plan and elevation of a building or 3D, that is

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,790
absolutely, those are synthetic constructs for communication purposes

25
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,750
only. So going back to the dreams and the subconscious and the conscious, those

26
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,610
are synthetic constructs to basically communicate. So when you

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,970
start, let's say, bringing up the subconscious or anyone does, usually it's

28
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,570
within context that, oh, that person doesn't realize what they're saying, but

29
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,710
obviously they have something in their subconscious that's gnawing them away

30
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,850
and they're sort of revealing it, you see, in their conscious, that's not what's

31
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,610
going, I mean, that's fine if you subscribe to it and you can, if you

32
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,130
can make technical progress and technically communicate using that, that's

33
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,090
fine, but that's not objective enough for what I like to discuss. What's objective

34
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,590
is very simple, is you're either conscious or unconscious, and a state of

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,650
unconsciousness is temporary and permanent, temporary being when you're

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,070
asleep with your eyes closed and, you know, or permanent is when you're asleep

37
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,790
as in dead, and you're excarnated, right, and the soul is dead as

38
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,910
well, the spirit goes back to where it came from. So now let's go back to the

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,970
conscious part. What's happening is that people tend to tag things as not

40
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,930
being significant or being significant within a conversation or communicating

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,870
something, and that's how they are judged and whatever, like you see a protester,

42
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,830
they're yelling, well, stop this, stop that, the reason they're screaming about

43
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,750
and protesting is that's what they consider significant, where someone

44
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,350
passing by might say, oh, that guy's an idiot, I don't care about that at all, to

45
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,390
them it's insignificant, right? Yeah. So that's your basic communication, you,

46
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,950
people tend to go and talk about things that they think is important. Now, how do

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,630
people get that base? Well, I've discussed this publicly for years now,

48
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,330
what is important to you comes from, you know, your deity or your God, and, you

49
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,330
know, so the point here, this is not religious, of course, but the point here

50
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,970
has to do with the operating system. Going back to, again, the subconscious and

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,750
all that stuff, if you want to subscribe, I call it the quacademic, and others call

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,150
it quacademia, it goes across the board. How many times have you heard, for

53
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,830
example, electrons, you know, you go to a university, fire up a generator, and

54
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,610
they'll tell you there's electrons moving down the wire, really? Okay, so I'm going to

55
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,870
do an experiment, I have a live wire, and I cut it, and I have a dustpan in hand and

56
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,050
a microscope, so when I cut the wire, all the electrons will pour out, fall on the

57
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,030
floor, so I could sweep them up, right? And once you start saying that, you know,

58
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,870
they say, oh no, that's not how it works, and they cannot explain how it

59
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,630
works, they just give you a description, you see? Because there's no such thing,

60
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,990
blood pressure, viruses, electrons, protons, just about everything, money,

61
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,970
right? That's credit. Everything we're talking about is fake. Fake breasts, fake

62
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,090
teeth, fake hair, fake houses, you know, houses are fake because they're

63
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,330
built out of compressed sawdust. So, specifically, trying to

64
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,430
identify something by its description, rather than what it actually is. Yeah, and

65
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,490
let's stick with this, since you brought up the subconscious, and you have an

66
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,010
interest in consciousness, I think you've gone on public various sonic events

67
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,790
talking about that, and the thing is, here's the thing, whenever you're

68
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,710
speaking in public, and even in private venues, you have to remember that if it's

69
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,570
more than one or two people that you're addressing, you must accommodate their

70
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,150
thinking. Okay. If you don't accommodate them, they just either glaze over, tell

71
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,530
you I'm not interested, or they walk away. So, if you can garner objectively that

72
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,210
the entire human society on this planet right now is generally a group of

73
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,110
morons, all seven billion, with a very small exception, what makes them moronic

74
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,730
is they lack any, they're imbecilic, idiotic, moronic. They lack the ability to

75
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,070
objectify, and they're not interested in it either, you know. So, when you kind of

76
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,510
look at the society as a whole, it doesn't matter if you're in Russia, Iran,

77
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,810
the US, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, they're all morons. You can

78
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,790
wholesale group them as idiots and morons on this planet right now,

79
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,730
generally. I mean, that's a very accurate and very safe description. It's, no one

80
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,650
wants to hear it, obviously, but it doesn't matter. We want to be objective. So, what do you do

81
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,030
with a planet full of morons? Well, you have to accommodate them. Well, how do you

82
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,390
accommodate a moron, or an idiot, or an imbecile, or an uneducated, in other words,

83
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,270
a pagan, someone who's ignorant? They just, you know, they don't want it. Now,

84
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,210
here's the thing. You can have a conversation about objectifying things,

85
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,810
and people all of a sudden, you know, that no one wants to scorn any, about any

86
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,070
information, because most people say they want to learn. That's what they say.

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,350
They say, oh, you know what, you know, I really didn't know what you're

88
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,370
talking about, but you know what, I really don't want to know what you're

89
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,490
talking about, and I don't care. Because they're still going to base it on their own, on their

90
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,510
own beliefs, and their own ideas of what they think you're saying, as well.

91
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,870
Well, yeah, because you're dealing, you have to, what you're saying in public has

92
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,170
to accommodate the audience. Again, if you are... Isn't that a catch-22? Sorry for

93
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,850
interrupting, is that like a catch-22 situation? It's like, you're trying to

94
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,170
accommodate them, and trying to educate them, but they don't want to learn anyway,

95
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,530
because it's not part of their own mentality. It's a vicious cycle. Yeah.

96
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,550
They're stuck in a vicious, dog chasing its tail. At least the dog will run out

97
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,390
of steam eventually, and stop, but humanity, they keep making more and more

98
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,050
generational moves in the same direction. Yeah, yeah. So, but fortunately, they don't

99
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,770
have a lot of time left, and unfortunately, they don't have a lot of

100
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,970
time left, but that's the same, but it's not going to be unfortunate, because in

101
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,330
the next decade, they're going to be garnered with the ability to have a

102
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,610
perfect society, so when the earth is cleaned up, no one will be

103
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,650
without excuse. They can't say, well, we never had a chance, right? So here's the

104
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,950
point. If you have, let's go back to the, beat this a little bit. If you have a

105
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,710
concert, two concert halls, one is for a heavy metal rock band with an audience,

106
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,310
and the other one is for a classical, or an opera, with an audience. You have to

107
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,950
accommodate the heavy metal rock band with a heavy, audience with a heavy

108
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,010
metal rock band on stage, and the opera, and the classical music audience has to

109
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,170
be accommodated accordingly. Now, if you switch the orchestras, or the bands, and

110
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,370
you put the heavy metal at the opera, and the classical at the heavy metal audience,

111
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,070
what's going to happen? They're all going to start shifting, and move towards their

112
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,650
other... It doesn't work. Yeah, yeah. Now, so let's go this way. If you have two concert

113
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,910
halls, and one is completely full of morons and imbeciles, and the other one

114
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,250
is full of, completely full of morons and imbeciles, generally, as a wholesale

115
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,570
approach. Now, there might be one or two out of a million, or one or two out of a

116
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,250
hundred thousand, or even ten thousand. You're kind of pushing it, that are not.

117
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,790
So, if you have, no matter how many concert halls you have, it does, if you

118
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,650
see, if they're morons, you just have to give them their moronic stuff, their

119
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,730
idiotic stuff. Now, what I mean about that is, they lack objectivity, and they

120
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,310
lack the ability to see what's just right in front of them, and they go

121
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,090
through this hypocritical process, where they think there's always something out

122
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,010
there, at the bottom of the ocean, or out in outer space, and they can't even

123
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,250
realize what's happening within arm's reach. So, this is the problem, also,

124
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:45,070
the hypocrisy. Now, okay, this sounds like a rant, but it's not. It's actually quite

125
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,450
accurate. The point here is, when is there going to be a level of spiritual

126
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,870
maturity, meaning the spirit, meaning the mind, because the spirit is the mind, and

127
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,650
the soul is the breath. We've defined that many times, anyone can define it, but

128
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,870
they don't want to, because we just explained what they are. So, but here's

129
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:09,630
the point. The point here is very simple. The point is, if you're going to feed the

130
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,610
mind, are you going to feed it with things that are not in accordance with

131
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,410
the physical world? No, you can't, because eventually it's going to catch up. Now, how

132
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,590
do you prevent it from catching up? For example, if you have a generation on the

133
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,790
planet, it's not just one Western world. The Easterners are just as deceived as

134
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,390
the Westerners, and just as the Northerners and the Southerners, in every

135
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:38,490
latitude or longitude. Here's the point. The point is, how often can information or

136
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,450
communication be conveyed amongst the people that is false, where eventually

137
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,290
that falsehood catches up and becomes detrimental? Why aren't they matching

138
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,610
what they are being told and what they're thinking about with what they

139
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,230
actually see in the physical realm? Why not? Why aren't they doing that? You see,

140
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,670
well, we... I'm stuck with that question, but that's actually quite an

141
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,190
accurate description of how it is. I just came back from the shops, and I said,

142
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,230
what did you just slide through that machine? It's a credit card. I said, how

143
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,110
come they don't call it a money card? I don't know. Well, because it's a

144
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,290
credit-based economy. Well, where does credit come from? You know, little babies

145
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,530
ask where money... where babies come from to their parents, and... but how come

146
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,730
adults never ask where credit comes from? Yeah. Well, I did actually ask that

147
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,050
question myself, but I never got an answer, and I never really found an answer

148
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,530
to it. Yeah, it's very simple, but the money system is very simple. Okay, if you

149
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,770
ask questions regarding the physical environment, how are you going to do that

150
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,370
reasonably when everyone is walking around with a hot head and cold feet? Why

151
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,350
is it that when you heat or cool a room indoors, with the systems that are in

152
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,710
place provided by the engineering community to the rest of the population,

153
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,730
that whenever you heat or cool indoors, the heat always rises to the ceiling, and

154
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,250
the cold always descends to the floor? When... when it's hot in the valley, you go

155
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,150
up into the mountain, and it's cold. Now, if you called a medical technician and

156
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,850
said, my feet are cold and my head is hot, he'll tell you you're not feeling

157
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,170
well. Well, I thought heat's supposed to rise and cold is supposed to descend. How

158
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,210
come the idiots on this planet are not demanding from their researchers and

159
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:30,330
their engineers to... to create climate control devices that replicate the

160
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,870
biological condition of a rarefied rising cold and a densifying descending

161
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,890
heat? Why aren't they demanding those devices so they have a cool head and warm

162
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,190
feet all year round? Why aren't they demanding that? I think because people

163
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:49,270
are just complacent. Yeah, complacent. They just want to leave it the way it is, or

164
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,750
they don't want to question something that may be perceived as being

165
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,590
different to others. I mean, it's like just accepting things for the way they

166
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,150
are, and that everything is supposed to be perfect the way they are. The only

167
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,190
reason I don't ask... Yeah. You sound like you're an attorney for the

168
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,270
human race, or you're making excuses for it. I'm making excuses for myself, not for everyone else.

169
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,090
Well, here's the point. The point is, yes, they don't... Okay, let's stop

170
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,870
ranting about humanity, because that's been done. If you want to know how crappy

171
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,150
people are, just pick up... you don't need... it's not a new thing. Just read an old

172
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,170
book. It'll tell you how crappy people are across the board, through all the...

173
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:35,430
But here's the point. The point is, again, going back to the subconscious. It's

174
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,170
not a matter of being conscious or subconscious. It's a matter of, are they

175
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,370
paying attention? Are they censored? Yes. Have you heard about the 800-pound

176
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,470
gorilla in the room? Well, there's... you know, that people can't see. Well, there's

177
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,530
10 800-pound gorillas in the room that no one's looking at. How can that be?

178
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,790
Because don't you have tactile function? You know, don't you have perception? I

179
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,930
mean, you can smell it if you can't see it, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, all right, they...

180
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,470
Okay, so what's going on is that they're being censored. There's a... what I call

181
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,690
cosmic censorship. And I had one... I did a sonic event with someone once, and he

182
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,770
kept asking me on air, what is... what do you mean by cosmic censorship? And after

183
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,430
a while, I just gave up. I said, if you have to ask that question, guess what?

184
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,630
You're censored. It's very difficult to explain. Yeah. It's difficult to

185
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,150
explain, but it's very simple at the same time. Yeah. A governor has been put on

186
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,710
humanity where they cannot perceive right now, and they have... it's been this way

187
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,470
since 500 BC. That was the last axial period. You actually had an axial period

188
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,050
here in the States around what they called 9-11, meaning an axial period is a

189
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,730
time period when, after this time or this event occurs, it changes the

190
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,710
worldview, right? If you heard now, this is a post-9-11 world, right? Or post... the

191
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,890
world wars tend to be axial periods. You know, this is pre-war construction or

192
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,430
post-war construction. It's like a tipping point, tipping point into a new

193
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,630
direction, and I suppose a new way of thinking. Because since 9-11, nearly

194
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,910
everyone has become a conspiracy theorist, if you want to sort of label it

195
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,730
that way. Well, axial periods changed worldviews, essentially, and the major

196
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,430
worldview that people are still really operating under, it was changed around

197
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,470
2,500 years ago. That's when all of the major religions in the world and the

198
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,670
major philosophies emerged to kind of cover and distract. Now, what do I mean by

199
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,830
that? 2,500 years ago, the maiden axial period, at that point and prior, there was

200
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,090
full knowledge of where mankind came from, his purpose, and all this, commonly

201
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,170
known. If you do a little bit of historical research prior to that time,

202
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,250
that was also the time, by the way, that the... you've heard of the Library of

203
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,750
Alexandria? Yes. That was destroyed around that time. Most of the information

204
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,250
depositories of the world were eliminated from the public eye during

205
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,990
that time, okay? That was also the time of the Greek Golden Age. This is when all

206
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,270
this philosophy emerged. I hear a lot of people say, oh, the Greek philosopher is

207
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,970
this, the Greek philosopher is that. I say, okay, you moron. If the Greek philosophy

208
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:19,050
was so good, how well has it served you? Not. It hasn't. It's not. So, it's

209
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,510
just filler. You're in the waiting room for 2,500 years. Think about a

210
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,670
waiting room. You have a purpose during the day, but you have an

211
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,350
appointment, and you're sitting in a waiting room for another event to

212
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,770
occur, but it's a threshold moment. You're either... you're not doing what you

213
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,090
want to do, and you're not doing what you're supposed to do, because you're in

214
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,510
the waiting room right now, or the credits part of the movie is another

215
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,430
part in terms of wrapping things up. So, these things now are going to be

216
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,430
bubbling to the... things that I've been discussing for over a decade publicly

217
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,010
are going to be bubbling to the surface and starting at the end of the seven

218
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,230
year period now, which is going to end around 2018. Then, it'll be time to have

219
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,069
more of a reasonable discussion. Right now, even though these topics are very

220
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:07,310
important, it's no different than going and discussing a Windows computer

221
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:12,150
program in the 1890s. You know, they know what computing is, because they can do it

222
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,270
on paper, and they know what a window is, but they don't know what you're talking

223
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,250
about. Yeah, understood. You see? Yeah. So, I'm going to take a 30-second break. Go

224
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:32,680
ahead. Take the... fill up some time. I'll be right back. Yeah. So, um, ladies and

225
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,680
gentlemen, this is the waiting room discussions between myself, Rodrigo, and

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:45,040
The Greek. We're going to be talking various topics to do with the world as

227
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,400
it is today, and the world that may be coming. As The Greek said, we are in a

228
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,780
period of, let's say, the credits, and we're waiting for the end of the movie,

229
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,540
and possibly the beginning of a new one, but what is going to be the new movie?

230
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,040
What is that? And I suppose we can't... we've got to wait till the end of the

231
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:12,460
credits, right? The thing is, can you discuss the specifics deservingly? No.

232
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,700
Right now, you can't, because you can't take a pig to a debutante ball. In

233
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,940
other words, they need to stay in their pig pen until, you know, whatever, until

234
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,640
they take the bacon off their back or whatever, right? Right. So, here's the

235
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,160
point. The point is, any time you preach doom and gloom or change, any time in

236
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,420
society, it sounds correct, because what they do is they try to read into what's

237
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,140
going on, right? Yeah. You know, you could always, just like horoscopes, you know, you

238
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,600
could show someone a horoscope and they'll say, oh, does this apply to you?

239
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,360
Yes, it does. And just hand it to the person next to you, does it apply to you?

240
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Yes, it does. It's just written in such a way that... Okay, so the thing is, can you give

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,020
specifics? One of the specifics is that right now, part of the axial period and

242
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,380
the dumbing down... I wouldn't say dumbing down, but this cosmic censorship is that

243
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,200
the entire world is under the auspices of what I call the Pope's work schedule.

244
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,440
You're using the Gregorian calendar, which is nothing more than a work schedule. It

245
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,660
has nothing to do with keeping time. It has nothing to do... the year going

246
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,980
around the Sun is not a linear function. The moon-type calendars are not linear

247
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,940
functions. None of these things that they're putting in front of you are

248
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,460
linear. Like, for example, if you look at whatever day you might observe or date

249
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,300
during the year, you'll notice that the previous year and the

250
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,960
next year, it's going to be on a different day of the week consistently.

251
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,660
And why? Because it's a work schedule. You cannot keep time with it. I'm not

252
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,320
saying... look, it's fine. If you're under a corporate culture, they

253
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,040
hand you a schedule of when you go to work, and they can name those days with

254
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,900
numbers or colors or names of horses or whatever. It doesn't matter. But when you

255
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,860
look at what is going on right now on the planet, where time is necessary to

256
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,540
navigate, and you are not able to navigate because you have no time

257
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,820
function, you know, how are you going to... you see? So let me just reiterate that

258
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,340
again. You cannot keep time with the Gregorian calendar. It is a work schedule.

259
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,040
And when was the Gregorian calendar implemented? It was a

260
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,100
continuation of the Julian calendar. The Gregorian is around the 15... the

261
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,660
papal bull in the 1500s. These guys actually gave nations that

262
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,900
were working on different time systems ultimatums. You know, we'll wipe you out

263
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,960
if you don't accept this time system. Oh yeah, that was the last one in the 1920s. They were

264
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,000
demanded that, you know, we'll take you out as a society if you don't accept our

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
calendar system and all of your men and families take on surnames. But here's

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,640
the point. The point is, time is very important. And by the way, time is just

267
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,200
the recordation and memorialization of events. There is no such thing as time as

268
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,460
many of these New Age idiots talk about. It is just a record. And it's

269
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,120
important because the natural world that you're attached to, meaning the whales,

270
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,580
the tigers, the bees, the roaches, the flies, the rivers, the oceans, everything

271
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,980
natural, goes on a natural timekeeping which is basically the sun rules the day

272
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,040
and the moon rules the month. If you're not aware of memorializing that, you're

273
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,840
not going to be able to deal with nature accordingly. Yeah, I always thought that

274
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,480
there could have been a better way of keeping time to do with the human

275
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,760
biology, the human clock, rather than... There is no such thing as the human clock, but go ahead.

276
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,560
Well, you said the Pope's work schedule, right? So I wondered what is that based on

277
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,880
for what reason? Is it because they wanted to memorialize events?

278
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,400
Well, you can go, if you look at the history of the Julian date, it's an

279
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,860
offshoot of a Roman system, which is an offshoot of a Greek system. Now, a lot of

280
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:10,000
people blame Rome, as in Roman civil law. It's Rome we're living under and all this

281
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,480
crap. It's not. It's actually Greece. It's still the Greek system. Can you

282
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,800
show me anything, and either take five minutes or take five years, show me

283
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,320
anything that the Romans have that's original, other than the geographic

284
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,620
location? No. Isn't every sort of civilization a copy of

285
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,900
something that was prior to its existence? Like nothing is as original as

286
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,460
as what they seem to be? Not necessarily, but spinoffs and one hatches the other.

287
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,960
But the Roman system is very closely adherent to the Greek system. It's

288
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,740
just in a Roman Latin fashion, or what you might call Western versus

289
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,180
Eastern. You could look at the various aspects of culture as

290
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,880
well. The Romans will be more Western, and the Greek culture will be more Eastern.

291
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,960
If you go to Spain, you'll find more similarities with Rome than you do

292
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,220
with Greece. But if you go to Greece, you'll find more similarities in

293
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,400
Lebanon, which is East, the food and the language. So that's the division of East

294
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,640
and West, sort of in the modern time. But the point here is the learning how to

295
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
keep time. And by the way, there's a lot of morons out there talking about time

296
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,440
travel. There's no such thing. What they're actually trying to say, and

297
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,880
because they're so immature they cannot structure any definition, what they're

298
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,060
trying to say, they're going to past and future events. But you're not

299
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:49,220
traveling, because time is just the recordation of events. You have to

300
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,820
realize that the majority of academia, and what you call science, is based on

301
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,780
science fiction. That's why I implore anyone who wants to, if they want to

302
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,040
donate their bodies after they die, donate it to science fiction. They'll get

303
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,520
more out of it. But the point here is there's so much lack of

304
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,560
definition, and there's such a hypocrisy about not even noticing about what's

305
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,740
going on right in front of them, that these people, for lack of a better

306
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,400
term, want to go out and they think there's something out there, or it's

307
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,420
something they have to find. Well, why don't you take care of the things that

308
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,860
are immediate? So I've heard you say this in the past, that these

309
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,420
people who are purporting time travel or space travel or things like that, they're

310
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,320
pranking you. I've heard you say the word pranking. The majority is a prank.

311
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,000
A prank, if you look it up, is a ludicrous thing. Here's the thing, we feel, when we

312
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,300
bring up certain terms and words, we feel a certain way about them. We think

313
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,080
that we know what they mean, and we'd like them to mean whatever we want them

314
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,120
to mean. But we have no right to actually define the word that we didn't create,

315
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,920
because it was when it was created, right? So this is why I'd like to adhere to

316
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,720
what words mean. The definition of a prank is just a ludicrous trick, and

317
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,420
typically this is the nature of being on this planet. But yeah, a lot

318
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,640
of the time traveler people are the same as the little gray alien people, the

319
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,560
same as the legal people, you

320
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,360
know, the patriots, right? We've got to make our country like it was. What are you

321
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,460
talking about? The reason it's so screwed up is because of how it was back then.

322
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,000
So you want to go back and reset it again? What is it, like changing baby

323
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,260
diapers? You know, the diaper is going to be soiled by the baby, keep

324
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,140
changing it. Is that how you're going to look at your national history?

325
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
Like changing baby diapers? You're going to start all over again? Why don't you

326
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,800
grow up so you don't need diapers? But the whole pranking is based on just a

327
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,720
ludicrous trick. For example, the earth is a very violent place. I tell this

328
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,920
to a lot of these morons, and they say, no it's not. So we'll go ahead and turn on

329
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,940
one of your nature channel shows, and within five minutes you'll see one

330
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,380
creature eating another for food or whatever, for territory.

331
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,760
Predators and prey. Right, and most of the pranking that's done in

332
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,080
this society is done in a predacious form by your entitled classes,

333
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,800
your academics, your religious people, your attorneys, you know, your legal

334
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,140
people, not to confuse with law, your academics being scientific, and

335
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,500
your medical as well, your political. And when you take it all the way down, it's

336
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,420
really the parents that started the pranking while you were still in the

337
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,440
crib, in the child's bed. They started pranking you there. So this is the

338
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,000
place of the prank, and typically it's a ludicrous trick, but typically the

339
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,780
pranking gets dangerous where they put people in cages known as prisons, where

340
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,720
they inject people with toxic chemicals. You know that 80% of all medications that

341
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,580
are considered prescription medications are banned and considered illegal and

342
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,520
dangerous after 10 years. So this cycle has been going on since the 50s. So are we

343
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,300
just bandaging in symptom management rather than solutions and cures? Well, yes,

344
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,040
but be careful when you say we. Like, for example, I tend to be objective. If

345
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,480
humanity decides to kill each other off tomorrow or the next five minutes, it's

346
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,780
fine with me. If humanity wants to just take windy walks and love each other

347
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,540
and make a perfect society in the next five minutes, it's fine with me too. I

348
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,060
have to be objective. Have you ever watched a sports game? The guy with the

349
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,120
black and white stripes, can he pick up the ball and score

350
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,520
for a team? Isn't he there just to observe the game? He's supposed to be

351
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:41,020
refereeing. Yeah, people that are objective. Someone said

352
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,320
once publicly, oh the Greek, he thinks he's smarter than everyone else. I said

353
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,020
no, I don't. I'm just less stupid than you. So there's a difference there. So the

354
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,980
point here is when you get objectivity in such a situation, you see, if you

355
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,140
believe that things are not the way that we're discussing, you will never, you

356
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,680
know, your belief is not based on anything pragmatic or practical. It's

357
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,140
just this belief that is unfounded or baseless. Once you believe in something,

358
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,900
it doesn't matter what it is, whether it's the money credit system, the legal

359
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,820
system, religious system, whatever, start looking at what it's based on and you

360
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,140
will find it's based on nothing. You're being pranked. Whether it's Islam,

361
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,280
Buddhism, Hinduism, or Christianity, you are being pranked. There's no religion on

362
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,200
the planet that does anything at all that's in any of the texts that they

363
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,480
allegedly subscribe to in context at all. You know, you can actually start a

364
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,680
religion based on a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Well, they did start the

365
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,600
Spaghetti Monster religion and it was a parody and it took off. It actually took

366
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,140
off and it's supposed to be a bonafide religion, even though the

367
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,380
creators and the people follow it know that it's a parody. There's a lot

368
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,100
of criticism on Christianity, Islam, Judaism, where it comes from and these

369
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,200
people that are criticizing it, if you actually look at what they're

370
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,440
bringing up as findings, they're incorrect also. There's people

371
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,340
that have websites, written books on it. There are people that discuss these various

372
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,540
religions and they're incorrect also. So I don't know where to send people other

373
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,840
than if you're going to, you know, what makes them incorrect as anyone can see?

374
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,080
This is not an opinion, it's the truth. If you look up anything, regardless of the

375
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,060
subject matter, what was it based on in time? You know, first in time is first in

376
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,300
line. The oldest thing, investigate it. Don't read what someone else wrote about

377
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,080
it. Yes, it does take a lot of work to do it and you'll see that what

378
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,820
you're being told about it is just simply not true. I call it a lot of Chinese whispers.

379
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,460
Sorry for interacting there, Greg. For me it's like Chinese whispers. It's, you know, I read

380
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,580
something and it's just a little bit different from where it was originated

381
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,360
from and that is a little bit different from where that originated from and I

382
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,440
find it difficult to make an opinion and even be objective or subjective on a

383
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,300
certain topic because I have no clue where it started from. And to research,

384
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,560
because it's the internet, to verify its source is kind of difficult for me to

385
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:17,240
master, so I've given up. There's going to be a movement where those that have

386
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,600
given up or feel like they want to give up before they even start, let's say,

387
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,960
there's going to be a coming world trend in the near future where you're not

388
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,040
going to feel like you're doing it alone. There's going to be a

389
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,320
collective effort on this, so it's alright. Okay, and you did say the

390
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,140
waiting room. What is it that humanity or, as an individual myself,

391
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,020
needs to do right now? If we can't find the information we're looking for, what

392
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,960
is pertinent? What do we need to do right now that's right in front of our

393
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,440
faces? Like you said, the answer's not out there. Everyone's looking for an

394
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,620
answer out there far away from themselves. Well, the problem is, yeah, the

395
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:00,920
problem is very simple. Start being simple about things, you know, like

396
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,440
little children, you know, when you mention something and say, why? And then

397
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,900
you say, why? And they keep saying, why, why, why, why, why, why, why? You know,

398
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:14,440
you don't have to do that in a juvenile fashion. Just simply look at what

399
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,220
something is based on, and the thing is, be very careful with your movements. If

400
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,440
you're going to give anyone advice coming to this planet, let's just

401
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,860
preface this. Could it be that perhaps before you visit this planet, let's say

402
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,820
you're going through the galaxy in your mothership, and they send down a crew,

403
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,400
they give you a description of the planet, and then they want you to spend a

404
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,100
few days and come back and confirm what, you know, the report is. And before they

405
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,660
send you down to this planet, they tell you, don't talk to anyone here, because

406
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,920
anything you say is just going to confuse them. Unless you're within their

407
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,140
culture, speaking whatever rubbish they've decided to speak about. You know,

408
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,800
and here's the thing. Some people say, what's crawled up the Greeks' butt? Why

409
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,160
does he sound so pessimistic or hateful or whatever? I'm actually being

410
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,080
optimistic. You don't want to hear, and I'm really padding this and actually

411
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,300
putting a big buffer and a cushion on what I'm saying, because the reality is

412
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,060
too harsh for most people to comprehend, even at this point, because they're

413
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,760
censored. But here's the thing. The advice is, set yourself apart from it. In

414
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,780
other words, are you paying attention? You know, there's an old saying that said

415
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:34,180
that, you know, about discerning things of the mind or things of the spirit. It was

416
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,160
said once, and the people that asked, when will certain times come, and they

417
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,980
were called hypocrites, because they can discern when it's going to rain, you know,

418
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,100
they see the cloud, or they can discern when it's going to be warm, because the

419
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,100
wind is warm from a certain direction, but they can't discern these other

420
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,100
things. That's correct. They cannot discern time. But, you know, let's

421
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,780
look at it, what the advice is. You know, how can you advise people that anything

422
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,440
you say is just going to confuse them? I even had someone in public on a round

423
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,220
table on a radio on late nights once say, Greek, when you speak, I need

424
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,780
babblefish. I don't understand what you're saying. You see, so that's just

425
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,900
living proof of the censorship. Now, here's the point. The point is, look

426
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,160
around you. A thousand years ago, when structures were built, they were built to

427
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,240
last a thousand years. Some of the skyscrapers in these metropolises that

428
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,320
were built a hundred years ago are still very robust and standing. Right now,

429
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,440
public works and skyscrapers and things like that that are built are built to

430
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,480
last less than 20 years. The other thing is, I was conveying on what they call the

431
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,820
road the other day, and I saw a subdivision of houses going up, and they

432
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,020
were made out of compressed sawdust. They're not made to last. They're not

433
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,100
made to last. Yeah, there's no reason for it, because everyone sort of, like you

434
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,440
might want to say, subconsciously, meaning it's in the conscious, they can discuss

435
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,560
it, but they cannot. They don't understand the source of the feeling. We can just

436
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,800
come out and say, you've got roughly 15 years left, and there's a deniability,

437
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,659
15 years left of man's rule, as things are, meaning the pranking and the

438
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,480
ridiculousness. But here's the point. The point is that you still have a lot of

439
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,120
people that are in this self-medicated mind state. You could see them start off

440
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,199
a conversation. Well, no one knows what's coming in the future, right? You know,

441
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,719
like they're looking for approval, right? Yeah. You see, no one knows about this,

442
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,780
right? Oh yeah, I agree with you. It's like the one that's on the back and goes,

443
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,120
yeah, you're right, you're right. Yeah, you're right. And meanwhile, when these morons are

444
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,800
speaking, you know, one will be speaking, and the other one's like, oh,

445
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,420
when is he going to shut up so I can say what I want to say? So where's the unity?

446
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,560
It's just super superficial. It's paper-thin ridiculousness that humans

447
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,280
across the board are engaged in. And this is not just the Western world, this is

448
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,280
the Eastern world as well. And the Northern world, and the Southern world. Yeah, it's

449
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,760
across, it's the human, what you might want to call consciousness, what they're

450
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,620
aware of. Fortunately for them, before the many of the changes start coming, like I

451
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,440
said, this seven-year period that we're in right now will be ending roughly in

452
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,580
the spring of 2018 on the Pope's work schedule. There's going to be more of a

453
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,000
collective approach to things. Like earlier, you mentioned like, you know,

454
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:26,740
these, maybe I'm paraphrasing here, that it seems monumental and lack of trust to

455
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,460
research things online, especially, you know, big subjects and things. But there

456
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,500
is going to be a collective that is going to make it more sane and more

457
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,780
practical in the next couple of years. What I mean by collective, it's going to be

458
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,380
done just by the regular, you know, the bus drivers, the street sweepers, the

459
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,520
nurses, the plumbers, the carpenters, not these academic morons, you know, or these

460
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,160
entitled classes, you know, like the people that, you know, are up in, what do

461
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,180
they call them, white... Ivory Towers. Yes, Ivory Towers, yes. Not those idiots. A lot

462
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,140
of them are going to actually be falling more into insignificance. You could

463
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,720
actually read this very simply by looking at the alternative movements,

464
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,140
like you have an alternative media, an alternative medicine, alternative energy,

465
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,820
right? You've heard of these things, right? Yes. There's a purpose for this.

466
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,300
And no one is reading this. Now, within these movements of alternativeness, all

467
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,460
you see is false hope and idiocracy, meaning idiocy, because they're still

468
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,840
bringing the same mindset, because they don't realize that they're being

469
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,480
censored until the time is right, but these things are put in place. It's kind

470
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,800
of like someone who, you know, has one car, but builds a... and one garage, but

471
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,720
builds a two-car garage, and when he's doing that, when he's doing that, he

472
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,640
hasn't gotten the other car yet, but you see? Yep, yep. So it's fine to do

473
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,100
that. I'd rather build the extra garage before I get the car, than get the car

474
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,240
and then build the garage, right? So what they're doing, alternative media,

475
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,220
alternative medicine, alternative food, alternative thinking, alternative this,

476
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,840
what they're doing is, it's the shell that it's being put in place, but what

477
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,740
it's being filled with is the same rubbish. You can hear it. You go to

478
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,820
alternative media, 99% of it is just an echo of what the medium, the

479
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,360
mainstream garbage, or academic garbage, and you can tell that it's

480
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,940
still rubbish, because a lot of these alternative media places, the hosts

481
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,500
bring on guests, and they're so proud that this person has a degree in

482
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,120
something. The very thing that we're trying to escape from, because the

483
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,540
degree is censored education, isn't it? Mm-hmm, absolutely, and it's, yeah, see

484
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,620
the people don't understand that the university system that's in place was

485
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,500
started around the time of ancient Greece, and it was created as a buffer

486
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:54,060
zone, to make sure that if those that were in power, if just a common

487
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,100
person came up with something that was unusual, unique, or beneficial, they could

488
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,840
control it by sicking the academics on them. Yeah. Oh, you can't listen to him, he

489
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,560
doesn't have a degree like we do, or you can't, you know, and the people don't

490
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,240
realize it, and by the way, if you go to an etymological dictionary, because a

491
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,240
dictionary just tells you how words are pronounced, etymology tells you what

492
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,560
words mean, or the root meaning, look up the word academic, and if you look it up,

493
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,840
or paraphrase, what it means is basically theoretical, impractical, and never

494
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,300
leading to a conclusion. That's why debate, that's why they always like

495
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,760
debating and arguing, they're just a bunch of morons, and here's the thing,

496
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,800
anyone that has more than an eighth grade education in any system, private or

497
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,700
public, in any country of the world, has pretty much done enough irreparable

498
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,400
damage that they're probably never going to recover in their lifetime fully, you

499
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,180
see, this is how vile and vicious the mind has been attacked by main, by the

500
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,400
mainstream school academic systems, and this goes across, it doesn't matter

501
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,940
whether, which country, or whether it's public or private, this is part of the

502
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,320
censorship. Yeah. At this point, I'm embarrassed to have discussions with

503
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,520
people that are proud of having more than an eighth grade education. It's

504
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,220
embarrassing, it's just, I'm embarrassed for them, and you can't, but you know,

505
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:16,240
here's the thing, they have the support of the population, right? Right. That's why I

506
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,620
am embarrassed for them, because the whole situation is just in the shit, if

507
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,820
we could say that. So you're saying that you're embarrassed because

508
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,680
they're supported by other morons, supposedly, like... Well, it's embarrassed

509
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,420
because, let's say, you know, a ship just landed and they said we're from Beta

510
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,040
Reticuli, let's, we're here to meet you people, who the hell are you going to

511
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,860
introduce them to? Yeah, that's a hard question. I've always made the

512
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,820
joke that the ships would land in the North Koreans and, you know, the, these

513
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,700
visitors judge humanity based on the North Korean society. That would be a

514
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,780
fail for the Western world. Well, it's a metaphor, not that I, you know, I'm not

515
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,160
into the UFO stuff, but I like using that metaphor, because that's what people are

516
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,620
referring to these days, that's their new god, right? But the thing is, you know,

517
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,860
let's say, you know, that we want to, we just landed here, you know, we're, this is

518
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,540
our welcoming, where's your welcoming team? You know, who are you going to

519
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,540
introduce them to? I mean, could you imagine someone came here and they said,

520
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,100
well, what, what, how do you keep time here? And they submit, they start talking

521
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,320
about stuff between January, December, and Monday through Friday.

522
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,940
Ridiculousness and, or, you know, or this wind-up toy they call the clock. Is this how

523
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,040
you reckon time on the planet? You're kidding me. So what would be the best way

524
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,640
to keep time or to record memory? Well, lawfully. Well, anything you do, whether, yeah, whether it's

525
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,000
religious or time or food or education, has to be lawful. Okay, can you define

526
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,980
lawful then? Yeah, very simple. There is no deniability in lawfulness, and lawfulness

527
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:55,020
also goes based on the way things work prior to your existence, you see? Like, for

528
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,740
example, if you pick up a lawful book on geometry, it'll always say that a

529
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,200
triangle has three sides, and a square has four sides, and a pentagon has five

530
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,180
sides. But if you pick up a book on geometry and it says a pentagram's got

531
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,140
ten sides, a triangle's got six sides, and a square's got two sides, well, that's not

532
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,300
lawful. Right. Because now you're not communicating, you see, now, you know, now

533
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,060
we, it doesn't, it's not based on the definition of those things. So, like,

534
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,100
lawful money, right? You've heard of law, you have legal money. Now, legal just is

535
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,600
whatever you agree to. Lawful, it's based on the natural system. Like, lawful

536
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,960
timekeeping. Like, see, right now, with timekeeping, if you remember anyone who's

537
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,100
old enough, before the electronic convention, it's on these electronic

538
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,080
devices automatically, seemingly, you had to go at the end of the year and get a

539
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,720
calendar from a card shop or somewhere, they gave them away for free at banks

540
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,800
and hardware stores. Yeah. So, you knew what day it was next year, you usually

541
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,760
got it a month or two before the year ended, right? They print them up, right?

542
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,460
That's not lawful, because you have, you're dependent on something that is an

543
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,540
artificial construct and it's baseless. That was created by something that came

544
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:05,500
after your existence. So, it's legal then. Well, it's legal, definitely. Now,

545
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,440
you can't, there are no days on that calendar, there are dates. There's a

546
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,540
difference. There are dates. Now, here's the point. For thousands of years, people

547
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,820
settled their debt with the new moon, which is the full moon. They even reversed

548
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,840
that on you. That's why today you still get a monthly bill. Yep. Don't you? They

549
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,880
try to settle many of the utility debts and bank loans and things, alleged loans

550
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,280
and things like that, on a monthly basis. Yeah. The other thing that people

551
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,900
don't realize is the day starts at high noon, not at sundown, like some

552
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,180
ridiculous Babylonian convention or all these other things. And we can get into

553
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,840
how they got sundown in certain religions and the new moon being the dark

554
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,140
moon and with specificity, but the day starts at high noon. That's why if you

555
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,060
remember before the electronic convention with banking, if you made a

556
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,440
deposit at the alleged bank after noon, it was counted as the next day.

557
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,820
Right. I'm not sure. Do you remember? Yeah, I remember. It was prior to the

558
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:09,460
electronic conventions. So, yeah, and it's been memorialized, but people don't,

559
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:15,700
you see, they are so, at this point, modern. And by the way, any ancient

560
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,080
society, right before they fell or lost prominence in their writings,

561
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,620
considered themselves to be modern. So, another hint. But that's just the human

562
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,860
condition, isn't it? I mean, all societies, all civilizations, when they're

563
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,460
there, regardless of where they are, they're always going to consider

564
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,800
themselves as modern and up-to-date because, you know, while I was going to

565
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,300
say they love themselves to a degree. Let's think about this. This is kind of

566
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,740
a saturated discussion. Let's wrap. I want to maybe wrap it up here in a

567
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,380
minute. And I want to just present something that I've been presenting for

568
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,580
over a decade with the most vile resistance from everyone and anyone you

569
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,640
can imagine. And this is what it is. You have to understand that there is a

570
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,980
central point that things emanate from in many conditions, whether it's social or

571
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,700
personal. We can call it HQ. I call it headquarters, right? You've heard of

572
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,080
headquarters. How many times have you heard, like, certain agencies, you know,

573
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:15,360
we have to find out what's going on at HQ, right? What do they say? All right.

574
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,020
So, what is the HQ for the body? It's you. You are HQ. You are the headquarters

575
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,920
of yourself, of how you define yourself. And it's both physical and non-physical.

576
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,080
The three things that we define ourselves with is the physical body, the soul,

577
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,160
and the spirit. Now, the physical body is the carne, you know, the material

578
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,980
aspect that's basically a biological machine. Let's skip over that for a little

579
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,400
bit because discussing how the body really works, because the way people are

580
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,520
discussing how the body works with blood pressure and viruses and disease and

581
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,160
food is so ridiculous that they're so deceived about their own body that,

582
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,120
you know, if you're deceived about how your own body works, let's put it this

583
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,180
way. If headquarters is full of deception, what is going to emanate out of

584
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:08,360
headquarters? Deception. Yeah. And how many times have you heard something like,

585
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,340
oh, that doesn't resonate with me. I don't like that. Now, if you were raised

586
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,260
in deception and lies, that's what you resonate with. Think about it. The truth

587
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,960
is dissonant to you. You won't like it. So we can get into what I call the

588
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,660
container. Now, this is what all of your spiritualists, some of these people

589
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,140
have radio programs, write books, and they have thousands of idiots flocking

590
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,180
to them for guidance, and they don't know anything. There's a saying in Texas

591
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,320
that most of your spiritual guides, by the way, whether religious, alternative,

592
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,080
your tarot readers, your hermeticists, your seers, your psychics, they're idiots.

593
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,860
All of them. Not some of them. All of them. In Texas, there's a saying that

594
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,640
says that they couldn't even pour piss out of a boot, even if there was

595
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,540
instructions on the heel. This is how piss poor they are. And the reason why

596
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,920
I'm saying this is this. Go ask one of these morons what defined the spirit

597
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,480
and the soul. And I'm not saying this because I'm just being, let's say

598
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,140
bitter about this, because I've been going through this for 10 years now,

599
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,040
and there's no polite way to actually refer to these morons that are actually

600
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,200
everyone is going to. Now, I say everyone, meaning, please don't come to me,

601
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,660
or people like me, because I'm not looking for a following or anyone to

602
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,300
flock around. But the point is, ask them what the soul and the spirit is,

603
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,320
and they'll either tell you, well, no one really knows, or it's the same

604
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:42,940
thing. We're talking about your highly learned, most esteemed. You want to go

605
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,400
to the Vatican and ask the guy with the funny fish hat. He cannot define it.

606
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,240
You want to go to the highest rabbinical, or the highest Islamic, or the highest

607
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,220
Hindu or Buddhist. They cannot define it. Your common people cannot define it.

608
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,780
All of these other people telling you what spirituality cannot define. It's

609
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,960
ridiculous. We're going to define it right now, and it's very simple.

610
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,320
If you, let's do it using the English language, and you'll find this in every

611
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,680
language, but let's use the English language because the convention of the

612
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,700
sciences and spirituality in English in the Western world is based on the Greek

613
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,520
system. And I'm going to show you how this is a very simple proof.

614
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,460
If you look at what we call the soul, that is simply the breath.

615
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,060
Okay. It's meaning you inhale and you exhale. It's the ability to move air so

616
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:40,820
you sustain the body with life by this pulsing action we call breathing. So the

617
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,960
way you check if someone is dead, the first thing you do is you check to see

618
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,360
if they're what? They're breathing, right? And then you look for a pulse. And

619
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,860
you, and within that range, usually if you're breathing, you typically, right,

620
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,640
you have a pulse. So the point is, if you look at the Greek convention, the

621
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:04,920
pnuma, p-n-u, pnuma in Greek is the meaning for the soul, the breath. Now

622
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,640
that's why in English you still use the, this was structured very nicely, let's

623
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,720
say, years ago. Whenever you see the p-n-u prefix, it has something to do with

624
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:22,300
air, like pneumatic, pneumonia. It all has to do with the movement of air. For

625
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,260
example, soul is interchangeable, like your soul is interchangeable with an

626
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,820
elephant, a tiger, a bird, or a dog. In other words, you can breathe into their

627
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,840
mouths and they can breathe what you're breathing, you see? That's all it is.

628
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:42,880
Now that we, okay, so... So is that the life giver in the material world, the

629
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,700
soul, the animator? Well, yes, it's a part of the animation. Now the spirit, let's

630
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,780
go back to the Greek convention. You'll find this in the Arabic, Hebrew, and also

631
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:59,320
the other Eastern cultures, Asian cultures, and languages to match what I'm

632
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,720
saying, if you do a little bit of research. The spirit now is intangible, and that's

633
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,120
the mind. In Greek it's the psyche, the p-s-y prefix. So whenever you see the

634
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:17,780
p-s-y, like psychic, psychology, psychotic, psychopath, or the p-s-y means the mind

635
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,740
or the spirit. That's completely intangible. Now the essence that we are

636
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,120
right now, we say we meaning humanity, is that the spirit has to be animated

637
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,060
through the body and the soul. When the soul, or the breath, stops and the body

638
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,640
goes away, the spirit is no longer animated. Now we can get into the realm

639
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,280
of the spiritual realm and how these things work. We can do that for the next

640
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,560
show. For the next show, perhaps, but most people think that they are

641
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,640
reincarnated, or they can travel astrally, and they could do all this other stuff.

642
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,480
We'll explain how that works. By the way, folks, you will not make friends with

643
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:02,660
this kind of discussion. You're on planet Earth. Here's the thing. It's best to

644
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:08,480
know what's going on and objectify it than perhaps not knowing what's going on

645
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,900
and making up porcupines or Chinese whispers to define things around you.

646
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,640
The way that I would describe it is that if you're going to go over a cliff and

647
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,180
you're blindfolded, I would rather take the blindfold off and have an opportunity

648
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,040
to do something about it than just go over without actually seeing where

649
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,060
you're going, if you know what I mean. You try to flap your arms like a bird, you're

650
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,400
still going to hit the ground, and that's what they're doing right now. They're

651
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,160
flapping their arms thinking that some new science or new political leader or

652
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,360
new religion or something is going to help them. But here's the point. The

653
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,180
point is, we'll probably get into more specifics. Let's see what kind of

654
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,140
feedback we get from this kind of sonic thing, also. We'll get into more

655
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,160
specifics about the headquarters, which is how the body really works, and that

656
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,660
you, without the Hippocratic, no pun intended, but the hypocrisy of the

657
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:02,260
academia. And we'll also get into, we'll maybe leave the soul alone, because that

658
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,820
is so simple to define. It's a pulsing action of air movement through the

659
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,040
lungs. And we'll get into what the spirit is and the mind in the spiritual

660
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,340
world and how it really works and what it is. And this is not stuff we're making

661
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,740
up or what we believe or what the Greeks' opinion on it is, because if you

662
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,220
want to roll with that, there's plenty of other places to go to be delusioned

663
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:27,080
with. The whole thing is to just actually discuss things that people can access on

664
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:33,280
their own, simply, with a childlike mind, but not in a juvenile state, with a

665
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,060
mature state, you see. The problem now is humanity lacks maturity. You see, you

666
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,040
can have someone walk in with gray hair and a doctorate degree, and I could prove

667
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,900
to you in less than 30 seconds that this person stopped developing at around nine

668
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,660
years old. They all have a juvenile mentality. When I say now all, when I say

669
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,480
this planet is full of idiots and morons and the academics don't know anything

670
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,840
and the entitled classes are pranking everyone, this is a wholesale statement

671
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:04,380
that applies to 99.9999% of your population. There are a few people left

672
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:09,100
on this planet right now, very few, that are not subject to this and can see the

673
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:14,720
things that we're discussing. Can I just be a devil's advocate? Wouldn't that be a

674
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,000
subjective comment to say? I mean, because you're saying 99.9%, but there

675
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,540
could be maybe people who aren't indoctrinated. It could be 98%. Right. Well, here's the

676
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:30,320
thing. Now I'm speaking according to this, the wrap-up of

677
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,440
this axial period that we're living in. In the near future, you will have the

678
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,880
illusion that people are coming around to things that are more real, and we'll

679
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,320
discuss why it's an illusion as well. It's not a matter about being better or

680
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,680
worse. It's just a matter of is. The better or worse is a judgments call.

681
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:55,200
We need to define the thing first. The thing that's going on is that the

682
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,880
people are deaf, dumb, and blind, meaning they can't see, they can't hear, and

683
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,640
they're dumb because what they're saying is just noise. How many times have you heard

684
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,400
a conversation or been at a party or a social event and spoken to people for two hours and

685
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,160
someone said, what did you talk about? You're like, I don't know. It was just rubbish.

686
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:19,880
How many times have you can say that very often? I mean, just turn on anything, whether it's

687
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,300
a university lecture, alternative media, or mainstream. It's just rubbish.

688
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,040
Well, I find it's the same information as I would have heard a year ago. It's just regurgitation

689
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:36,100
and just with a few different things changed. Like I was listening to a radio yesterday,

690
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,120
and it was just the same thing. If people want to learn something new, I would hope

691
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,260
that the information would be different to as it was last year, but if I'm hearing the

692
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,440
same things, I'm not learning anything. Well, think about it this way for a moment.

693
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,160
I've been saying the same thing constantly for 10 years. Now, the reason why I say the

694
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,900
same thing is because I'm saying the same thing. You need to go and see that it's based

695
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,280
on something. What is it based on? Maybe what they are saying, whether it's the same thing

696
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,240
or different, is baseless. There's no foundation for it.

697
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,880
There's no foundation. Now, how many times have you heard of an impending financial collapse

698
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,500
that never happened or an impending virus? There's no such thing as a virus. That's

699
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,480
a medical prank. You can define it basically. You still hear idiots talking about viruses

700
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,260
and all this other stuff. How many times have you heard of financial disasters, impending

701
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:34,580
doom that never happens? Because it's baseless. All of their stuff is baseless. Killer comets.

702
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,700
All of these things are baseless. Extinction-level events. It's the modern thing

703
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,540
to say, but it's baseless. There's nothing to justify.

704
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,520
I don't mind the repetition because I run into people sometimes I haven't seen in five

705
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,220
years. We pull off to the side and we have a conversation for 20 minutes or 15 minutes

706
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,140
because I tend to be long-winded and wordy sometimes. They'll say, hey, Greek, you're

707
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,400
saying the same stuff you said 10 years ago. I'm like, what, am I supposed to change?

708
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,480
Let's use the conventional education system, let's say from kindergarten to twelfth grade.

709
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,200
If you don't get anything in second grade, do they move you to third? You have to do

710
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,220
it over, don't you? Whether it's second, third, fourth, or fifth. If you haven't gotten

711
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:24,720
anything, you have to keep at it until you get it and then move on. Even your video game

712
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,360
scenarios are like that. If you can't complete level one, they don't bump you up to level

713
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,400
two, do they? No, you stop progressing until you get past

714
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,620
that level you're on. Level one is, are you aware of what these

715
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,800
things are based on? Well, Greek, I didn't know that, but you know what? I don't want

716
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,280
to know and I don't care. That's the world view.

717
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,160
Is that really the mentality of most people? They don't care?

718
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:55,240
Oh, yeah. Apathy. So here's the thing. I'm not with you guys. In other words, I'm here

719
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,700
to be objective. Whether humanity does well or does poorly, and I know where it's going,

720
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:07,080
the thing is that when things are irrelevant to the objectivity that I try to provide. Otherwise,

721
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,880
if I start giving personal opinions and what I like personally to hear or what resonates

722
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,180
with me, then I'm going to have to join one of these idiotic groups or one of these sectors

723
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:28,000
of culture. So I try to keep that stuff out of my life. I try to be objective and pursue

724
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,820
things that are wonderful and pleasant. If you don't know what something is based on,

725
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,160
it's going to bite you eventually, right? Or you're going to find that you have nothing

726
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,220
to stand on. So this is where society is. But here's the thing, and just a word of caution

727
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:47,380
to people if they don't hear anything from us again, is coming in the next decade, you're

728
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,540
going to be pretty much poised to have a perfect society. The better things get, the worse

729
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:58,160
they actually are going to be. Not necessarily from a pessimistic point of view, but you're

730
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:05,320
being set up. Just like right before a scam is pulled on someone, everything is shown

731
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,120
to be really rosy and wonderful.

732
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,680
And that incites a person to persevere and continue, and that's when the blindfold's

733
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,400
removed and you see it for what it really is, and it's like, oh shit, we've been tricked.

734
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:24,480
At that point, the thing about this is even more ironic, is humanity will never realize

735
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,680
it's being tricked, because even when the trick is exposed, they're just going to make

736
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,520
an excuse for it. And we can give a lot of specifics on this, but let's just say we're

737
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:37,700
priming the well or the pump for maybe some other sonic events. And with that said, thanks

738
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,180
Rodrigo.

739
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,840
No worries, Greg. I appreciate the time you've taken to have a discussion. We're going to

740
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,580
put this up on YouTube and maybe even have a website set up for it. But in the next few

741
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:56,300
discussions I really want to expand on law, or lawful, as well as the blindfold that's

742
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,420
been put over us, what the pranking really is, and continue from there. But thank you

743
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:06,040
so much for your time, it's been a good hour, and we will have further sonic events.
