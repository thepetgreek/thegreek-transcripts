1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
We're live and recording.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,550
Yes, so...

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,030
Hey, what's on your mind?

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,490
Well, to let you know, I've got a domain, Rodrigo in the Greek.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,790
Just to, basically, all these, the waiting room recordings that we're doing now will be on that site.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,450
You can also put it on common radio, you know, there's no problem there.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,510
But just to keep it relevant, I suppose.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:30,530
So, basically, what's coming up is all the kids harping on about Christmas.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,490
I want to discuss the concept of where Santa Claus came from.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,630
What is this whole reason for festive seasons in the original reason, like the very most basic reason for it?

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,110
And why do we continue to celebrate it to this day?

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,330
Because it's not about Jesus' birth, or Christ, or Mass, or...

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,690
You know, I've heard you talk about it before, so where does it stem from?

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,630
Okay, well, the reason why it's still going on today is obvious.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,730
And I'm saying that facetiously, is that no one cares and no one's paying attention.

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,830
It's a planet of morons, or a planet of apathetic people.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,410
Now, on the other hand, does one understand the timeline of these things?

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:25,650
You know, just to preface, when one starts being objective on any body of information...

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,670
Let's say we're going to talk about the divine, the gods, you know, what religious matters are supposed to be based on.

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,790
Not what the word religion means, really, because it means to do something regularly.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,950
But people usually subscribe to a conventional religion, tend to change their lives and do things regularly anyway.

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:50,810
But if one starts to actually objectify, let's say, loosely starts to read and comprehend the holy writs of the world.

23
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:59,910
Whether it's from any indigenous tribe, their writings of ancient things, interaction with the gods, creation and prophecy.

24
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,670
All the way to the major, what I call secular religions, because they are secular.

25
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:14,890
And then we can swing it back around to show that if people are going to these concepts of religion and spirituality,

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,930
if they're secular, well, what does that mean?

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,830
Well, they'll tell you that it's always based on tradition and culture, that's just how we do things.

28
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,290
Just like any other industry.

29
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:35,130
But, again, just to be specific, if one starts to do research and tries to objectify what is memorialized about the gods,

30
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,870
and I'm saying gods because you'll find it plural everywhere.

31
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,830
And we're not talking about the convention King James and Bibles that are put out in version form.

32
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,330
Those are all erroneous.

33
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,830
So what springs forward is all this erroneousness.

34
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,510
But the concept to consider is that when you do look at what's been memorialized about the gods,

35
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:07,650
it is a very rich body of information, albeit it's them communicating with humanity through written form,

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,850
let's say through agents known as prophets and such, in a very simple manner.

37
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,890
And, again, they don't act in futility.

38
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,710
These are meant to be understood.

39
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,210
And all you see is argument about, well, that's your interpretation.

40
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,430
I don't believe that.

41
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,470
You've got it wrong.

42
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,870
So you've got to understand that this type of human nature is very clearly described in these ancient texts also.

43
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,730
So you must consider it.

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:41,550
Now, being kind of long-winded to get to a point, and that is that you will find the information that's memorialized about the gods

45
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,410
and or spirituality and all the other things that are affected by that to be very rich.

46
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,170
But what you hear, and let's just bring it fast forward to contemporary days like today, let's say,

47
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,810
and what you see being discussed is very, very poor across the board.

48
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,610
Now, there are a few people here and there, and none really come to mind that have come through in passing

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:13,470
that I could recommend anyone to go read their writings because, ultimately, they tend to find a golden nugget

50
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,370
and then they wrap it in bullshit.

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,410
So it's kind of like a metaphor I give.

52
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:25,030
You don't want to go, if you're hungry, you don't want to go sifting through somebody's shit to find poo that's undigested to eat.

53
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,790
Even though the corn looks viable, you shouldn't be doing that.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,890
And that's what I see.

55
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,730
And I'll give some examples.

56
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,550
And let's do it a little backwards.

57
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,710
Let's not go to the mainstream convention about knowledge of the spiritual realm and these holidays

58
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,670
and what people consider law form and just knowledge of the gods.

59
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,350
It's all the same, right?

60
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,170
If you go backwards, let's say, look at, let's say, on what they call the internet

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:58,370
or even publications that have been in magazine form or whatever in the past, let's say, several decades,

62
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,970
you have these people crying about these Satanists.

63
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,950
Oh, this is a Satanic cult.

64
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,110
Oh, they're a Satanist.

65
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,610
Oh, they'll tell you they're a Satanist.

66
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,350
Or they have a Satanic church or a Satanic Bible and all that.

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,870
That is completely erroneous.

68
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,710
Whether you're a participant or describing that condition, it is erroneous.

69
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,950
That is not Satan, meaning the adversary as memorialized as such.

70
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,030
What these people that are being dubbed as Satanists are, essentially,

71
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,030
and this is objectifying it and this has nothing to do with what you think about it,

72
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,410
but this is the truth of the matter,

73
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:40,550
all they are doing is reviving some ancient minor imp or demon from ancient cultures,

74
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,470
whether it be Egyptian or Babylonian or even some local geographic position on the planet.

75
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,570
That is not what is known as Satan or the adversary.

76
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,130
You also hear this being expounded by people that sound reasonably intelligent.

77
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,330
And because they seem to say things that are reasonably intelligent, this must be accurate.

78
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,490
This is one of the pitfalls of listening to academically styled presentations.

79
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,310
Because remember that these academics stopped developing at around nine years old.

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,570
They've just been trained to sound smart.

81
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,090
There's a very big difference.

82
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,330
They know how to string words together in a way that you would be familiar with hearing in a university lecture.

83
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,970
And then they always tell you that they have some kind of formal education

84
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:33,010
or been, you know, somehow addressing something along those lines that really keeps the human group,

85
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,130
let's say, in this piss poor quality.

86
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,250
Now, I just mentioned, I'm in no sense defending these people they call Satanists,

87
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,730
just like I wouldn't defend any group, because by any examination, any of these groups are just piss poor.

88
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,790
And you have, again, this is a contemporary thing.

89
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,690
You've heard of, there's a cultural, especially on the conspiratorial or alternative media or alternative discussion.

90
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,830
It's become a topic that does overtake the conversation many times.

91
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,990
This thing about being, you know, the prevalence of Satanism, you hear that.

92
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,650
And it's inaccurate.

93
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:21,390
And the reason, we'll probably maybe do a discussion on who Satan is and what that means and what the adversary is.

94
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,630
And I would actually send anyone back on YouTube, on Ocelli and the Greek, who is Satan or something.

95
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,750
There was an episode we did about what is Satan or Satanism.

96
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,130
And accurate, right?

97
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,930
So, there's this piss poor thing, you know, on that.

98
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:46,430
And even, please keep in mind that even the participants of the Satanic culture or whatever are ignorant.

99
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,050
Right, just like you will find the participants of any of the world religions to be ignorant.

100
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,330
And why do I say that?

101
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:59,150
Because if you subscribe to any of the world religions and you actually start informing yourself,

102
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:09,670
either from the texts that they allege to subscribe to and or the history or convention of these world religions,

103
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:16,130
you will, if you are a sane individual, and this is not just a criticism or being sarcastic,

104
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:23,250
but if you are sane and have any sense of morality, you will abandon that group and be more specific.

105
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,110
Talking about Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism.

106
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,690
That pretty much covers the majority of what is spread out through the world.

107
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:41,929
If you are a member of any of those institutions, organizations, faiths, beliefs, whatever you want to call it,

108
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:51,490
if you start informing yourself, again, regarding what these religions are supposed to be based on,

109
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,150
meaning the texts or the holy writs that they allegedly subscribe to,

110
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:05,030
and or the history of how what they're doing and what they subscribe to their believers as being the faith came from,

111
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:14,750
there is no way you can be sane or have any moral aptitude or morality and still adhere to these groups.

112
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,710
It sounds like, Greek, you're being a little harsh.

113
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,110
Well, you know what? It's just a very simple measurement.

114
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,730
And it doesn't mean that if you profess to be a participant or believer in any of these religions,

115
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,150
you need to abandon them just based on that statement.

116
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,290
That is even worse, because now you're aimlessly moving around.

117
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:45,390
But I assure you, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism, the major ones there, and Judaism,

118
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,950
have absolutely no relevancy to the texts that they allegedly subscribe to,

119
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:58,070
and also have a very high relevancy to anyone that wants to do the work and study why they do what they do

120
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:05,330
and what they say what they say, and finding out the relevancy and where it came from historically.

121
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:15,630
And you will find that it is nothing more than several revived, let's say, mishmash of pagan religions

122
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:24,550
that were geographically based within the areas that these religions still seem to be coming out of.

123
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,770
And these are just very minor, and it's a major distraction.

124
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,770
Greek, why are you saying this?

125
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:38,130
Well, someone might ask, and I'll say very simple, because you're being censored as a group.

126
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:45,990
Now, the erroneousness and the piss-poor quality of what humankind is involved in in spiritualism.

127
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:56,010
I actually did a call yesterday, and one of the co-hosts was proud of being a Wiccan or a witch, or whatever.

128
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:03,790
And, you know, when you're in public and making conversation, you tend to want to keep the group united.

129
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:12,710
But, I mean, I really had nothing to say to this person, because the level of lack of discernment,

130
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,610
and the lack of information, and the...

131
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,770
In other words, when someone approaches you and says,

132
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,130
well, I'm a priest, or I'm a witch, or I'm a spiritualist, or I'm a psychic,

133
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,130
you kind of have to... This is good advice, by the way, folks.

134
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,650
You kind of have to shake your head and sit back and say,

135
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,430
this is all for entertainment purposes.

136
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,710
What are you talking about? Are you kidding?

137
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,950
In the state that the world is today, in terms of the quality of these matters,

138
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,250
it is so piss poor that it's just ridiculous.

139
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,530
It's what I call a dummy load.

140
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,210
It's just a load put on you, because you've got a certain energy you want to put off in a certain direction,

141
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,550
and that energy needs to be dissipated.

142
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,390
So you just pick something, and people like it.

143
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,670
I mean, that's what the entertainment business is based on, you know?

144
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,970
The Hello Kitty stuff, and all the...

145
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,430
Sorry for interrupting there, Greg.

146
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,470
The way that I perceive it, it's a little bit like a big marketing campaign between Beta and VHS.

147
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,850
I mean, we've got the shitty quality, and it's marketed as being the right stuff,

148
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,410
but it's actually crap.

149
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,430
The original, the Beta, was supposed to be the better quality.

150
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,070
Yeah, that marketing thing that you just brought, it's kind of a two-way street.

151
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,650
It's what will the people find acceptable,

152
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:32,750
and then if it teeters and totters within, let's say, two choices,

153
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,790
then it just takes a little bit of the other side to market it and push it in that direction, right?

154
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,250
It's almost like a seesaw that's very close to being balanced.

155
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,950
A four-year-old can push down with their finger and move it.

156
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,170
So there's this teetering and tottering.

157
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,730
But the point that I'm trying to bring up is that the realm,

158
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,690
like you started saying this Christmas thing with Santa Claus and all this.

159
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,050
One must consider that when you, let's say, narrow it down to a topic as such, right?

160
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,170
Because it's the apparent season at this time of year for that.

161
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,750
One must give an overview of the entire condition,

162
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,970
because when someone is listening to, let's say, if we were to go and directly describe

163
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,110
what that symbology is and why they do it and all this,

164
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:26,650
without giving an overview on how piss-poor the quality of the state of humanity regarding these matters is,

165
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,110
that's why I brought up the trivialness of what they call Satanism, right?

166
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,310
Which is just the revival of these ancient minor imps and demons.

167
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,210
Like the most popular one is what they call the Temple of Set,

168
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,350
and anyone can research this in less than 30 seconds flat.

169
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,250
Set was the dark lord of ancient Egypt.

170
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,790
It was an entity, a demon, a minor one, in ancient Egypt.

171
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,870
I don't know how that can be confused with Satan

172
00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,110
any more than Tiny Tim would be confused with Arnold Schwarzenegger, right?

173
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,090
Tiny Tim and the Dickens. It just doesn't make any sense.

174
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,630
In my mind, though, I'm just saying from my observation,

175
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,750
Set is glorified as one of the biggest or the largest entity with the most power,

176
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,830
so that's censored, isn't it? That's censored information.

177
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,470
Misdirected.

178
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,810
It's misdirected and erroneous.

179
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,330
It's unfounded, but this is the nature of how things are.

180
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,670
Then we move forward to the major conventions.

181
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,210
You have all the little tiny other occultic subgroups,

182
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:43,570
even going down into the Buhiria and Santeria aspects of the Afro-Latin communities in South America and such.

183
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,050
They have their own little deities as well, right?

184
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:59,810
I think the various Christian spin-offs have other deities that they've either recovered to revive or just flat-out made up.

185
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,670
But it's really hard to make these things up because the multitude of the gods is so massive

186
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,030
that there could be 5,000 of them for each human.

187
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,770
I mean, there's that many, so making them up is not really the issue.

188
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,890
It's that multitude of existence of these things.

189
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,250
But again, I just want to really stress, and I don't know, even if I just dedicate the rest of the hour

190
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:27,730
to just stress how piss-poor not only the conversation and the imparting of the information

191
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,850
regarding the spiritual world is across the board throughout humanity.

192
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,430
This goes for east to west, north and south across the planet.

193
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,510
One has to just really shake their head before they address anything regarding this.

194
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:44,470
Again, there is no conversation that I have found viable or reasonable or rational

195
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:50,030
that is based on anything that is within the spiritual discussion of what holidays are based on,

196
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,410
who the gods are, or these religions or anything.

197
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,270
You will find nuggets and bits of truth here and there.

198
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,750
But now, you don't want to be sifting through poop to eat some corn, do you?

199
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,690
So if you can stomach that, go for it.

200
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:12,130
There's plenty of places where you can do, for example, go to YouTube and search

201
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,450
The Pagan Origins of Jesus Christ.

202
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,170
And there's a guy up there that throws up a three-hour video.

203
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,450
It's pretty good. It's close. You've got to sift through some stuff.

204
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,970
Or you can do a search on The Pagan Origins of Islam.

205
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,770
Or The Pagan Origins of Christianity.

206
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,910
Or you can write Hinduism and Paganism.

207
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,230
Or Satanism.

208
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,890
And you can start researching what's been memorialized on the internet.

209
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,430
Or go to a library and see it in print form.

210
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,270
And if you want to start sifting through all the poop to find something to eat, you'll be fine.

211
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,310
But otherwise, it's a really difficult subject to stomach at this day and age right now.

212
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,690
But fortunately, that will change.

213
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,050
So again, most people, if you realize, are so lazy.

214
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,930
Not only regarding this topic, but all topics.

215
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,849
The fast food, junk food scenario.

216
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,109
The poor quality of products that industry puts out.

217
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,569
All of this ties in.

218
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,890
Whether it's health or medicine, religion, politics.

219
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,270
I would say the political scene, governmental scene of the world right now is very poor quality.

220
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,710
The legal society that's supposed to manage the law of the nation, very poor quality.

221
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,730
It's just poor quality across the board.

222
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:44,570
And if you were to do a critique, not just on what we said we might discuss, which is Santa Claus and the origins of Christmas coming up.

223
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,830
But a critique should be levied upon the human society for acceptance.

224
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,130
Across the board.

225
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,730
Now, once you start seeing that humans are readily accepting crap across the board.

226
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,510
Whether it's industrial products.

227
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,650
Things that are based on health and medicine.

228
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,470
Things that are based on law forms and the legal nature of things.

229
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,410
Things that are even in the entertainment business.

230
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,110
I can't watch what's put out in the entertainment industry at large.

231
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,450
I just find it to be absurd and ridiculous.

232
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,090
And it's of quality that it's just substandard.

233
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,890
And this holds true also for their spiritual matters.

234
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,770
Now what's interesting, I'll throw this in, anyone can look this up.

235
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,370
When you bring up spiritual matters, there's a good and evil thing that comes up.

236
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,830
A very simple black and white.

237
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,570
Well, what people fail to realize, and you hear no discussion on.

238
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,170
That many of these ancient writs not only discuss good and evil.

239
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,710
But they also discuss another category that is just as dominant as good and evil.

240
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,970
And it's called worthlessness.

241
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,270
And it actually, let's say if we go to the biblical text.

242
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,390
It is very clear, beyond clear, it is razor sharp.

243
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,770
That the world religions are in the category of worthlessness.

244
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,010
They have no value.

245
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,970
Like Deng, right?

246
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,290
And actually there's many metaphors that are not.

247
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,190
Actually, yeah, they're pretty vile.

248
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,630
Viewed by as the gods.

249
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,410
Now of course, well then what are you saying?

250
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,010
Well the thing that I'm saying is.

251
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,990
The most minor and the most vile of the spiritual entities.

252
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,010
Are the ones that have been dishing this out to mankind.

253
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,670
And this is all just a preface.

254
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,910
This is all a build up to the Santa Claus thing now.

255
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,690
Very often, especially in the western world or eastern world.

256
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,430
Most people now are speaking English.

257
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,630
When the topic comes up.

258
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,550
What is, you know, regarding spirituality.

259
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,670
What is the first thing that they ask?

260
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,790
Or how do they broach the subject?

261
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,950
They say, do you believe in God?

262
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,470
How many times have you heard that?

263
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,390
In your lifetime, right?

264
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,530
And it's everywhere.

265
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,470
This is the most basic, most common question.

266
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,770
Do you believe in God?

267
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,710
Now right there, you've got to stop.

268
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,150
And let's just substitute the word God with the word army.

269
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,410
Do you believe in the army?

270
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,910
Now, the reason I'm using this is to illustrate something.

271
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,070
When you hear the word army.

272
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,250
Do you think of just a single toy soldier sitting there or standing there with a gun or whatever?

273
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,810
Or does that word in its singular form actually represent a multitude?

274
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,550
A multitude of different factions of various armies.

275
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,930
Yeah, or within the army.

276
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,990
When you say, let's say the Australian army or the American army.

277
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,810
Do you think of just one individual?

278
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,850
No, no, a multitude.

279
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,410
Exactly.

280
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,490
So why is it when people ask, do you believe in God?

281
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,730
There is a singular and a plural.

282
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,210
And they tend to just limit it where it's in defiance of everything that's been memorialized about them.

283
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,130
Okay.

284
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,530
Now, let's just tie this in.

285
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,390
Have you ever heard of what they call monotheism?

286
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,030
Yes.

287
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,270
That has really screwed the people up also.

288
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,290
Why?

289
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,950
Because, well, you know, on one side it might be virtually correct.

290
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,050
Where you have to pick a God, right?

291
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,410
Because you can only serve one master.

292
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,130
You've heard that.

293
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:25,550
Yes.

294
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,930
But on the other hand, what that monotheistic aspect does is in denial of all the others.

295
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,210
Existence.

296
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,490
It doesn't mean you have to believe in them or be a servant to them.

297
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,250
But you're in complete denial.

298
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,590
So either way, again, we go back to what I said a few minutes ago.

299
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,850
Humanity is sick regarding this subject.

300
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,010
And sicker than sick.

301
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:54,830
Just like, for example, if you were to look at how what's called health care, in parentheses, air quotes,

302
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,610
and medicine is dished out to people in society, you have to be sick to adhere to that.

303
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:11,470
Because every one of these drugs has a harmful effect and very few have ever been proven to be effective in any of the realms that they profess to be treating.

304
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,170
So they're sick across the board.

305
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,930
Now, let's go back to when someone says, do you believe in God?

306
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:29,510
Now, what would be the most accurate, relevant, and rational answer to that would be, which one?

307
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,410
Right?

308
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,090
Well, right away, now, someone asks you, do you believe in God?

309
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,970
And you reply with, which one?

310
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,570
You're not even maybe five or six seconds into the conversation.

311
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,630
And I assure you, that ship is sunk right there.

312
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,350
There is nothing else to talk about.

313
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,510
You know?

314
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:57,590
Yep, because it takes it in a direction that they weren't expecting, and they have got nothing to say when you mention something like that.

315
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,510
They've got absolutely nothing to say.

316
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,910
It's just like when I once was in the shops, and they have these pharmaceutical, like a little pharmacy in the shop,

317
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,510
and there was this old man there, yelling at the pharmacist behind the counter, saying,

318
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,210
I'm going to die if you keep delaying my blood pressure medication.

319
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,470
You know, and he's really getting irate with the clerks, right?

320
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,490
And they're like, you know, telling him, you know, well, we'll have it ready soon.

321
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,270
We just got, you know, the batch in.

322
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,730
We have to sort it out.

323
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,530
And he's yelling at them real irately.

324
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:36,650
And neither one of them are, I'm off to the side, and I'm thinking, what a pack of morons, because there is no pressure in the body.

325
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,910
There is no blood pressure.

326
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,710
And this guy is actually convinced.

327
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:49,970
Because if you actually look at the definition of blood pressure, it is a momentary pressure that is measured when the restriction is put on the limb

328
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,410
or the blood vessel between heartbeats to judge, you know, the heart's viability, let's say, right?

329
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,650
It's a very abstract synthetic construct.

330
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,830
There is no pressure, positive pressure in the body at all.

331
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,970
It's under a slight vacuum.

332
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,470
So how do you address, let's say, go back to these morons in public that I just brought up,

333
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:16,450
the imbecile that is yelling about he's going to die if he doesn't get the blood pressure medication prescribed to him when there's no blood pressure,

334
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:26,410
and then the other imbecile behind the counter who is a certified, state-certified clerk to dispense prescriptions saying, well, listen, idiot, there is no blood pressure.

335
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:26,930
Just relax.

336
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,690
So both of them are imbeciles on both sides, right?

337
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:37,950
That's why very often, let's go back to describing how piss poor and crap the human situation is.

338
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:48,770
How many times have you heard something put out on YouTube, let's say, or the Internet, which is the easy media, or Internet radio, alternative media,

339
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,450
and even maybe in some mainstream circles, I'm a survivor of a satanic cult, right?

340
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,070
And they give their testimony.

341
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,710
Or I've been around satanists, and this is what they do.

342
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,330
This is the metaphor that I just gave about the clerk behind the counter and the fellow.

343
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,750
So either one of them don't know what they're doing.

344
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,330
In other words, the satanists don't know what they're doing.

345
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:19,070
Or the person going out and giving testimony about it doesn't really know anything, even though it's clearly in front of them.

346
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,330
They can't communicate it viably.

347
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,850
The people that he was participating with or whatever didn't know.

348
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,910
And the audience doesn't know.

349
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,030
It's all erroneous across the board.

350
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,950
Now, it doesn't mean that a group of people can form a cult or a group, whether recognized or unrecognized,

351
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:45,950
cannot gather information about how to evoke or invoke or revive a minor imp or demon from the past,

352
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:58,010
and have that demon, let's say, manifest either amongst them or get them to have the demon manifest other things.

353
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,850
Because it's quite powerful.

354
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,950
I'm not denying that that happens.

355
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,710
Of course that happens.

356
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:11,370
But the way it's being communicated and the viability and the quality of the information is shit at this point, across the board.

357
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,390
And it's just pathetic.

358
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,810
Now, how does this tie back into Santa Claus?

359
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:22,710
Well, if you look at Santa Claus and all that, let's just really narrow it down very quickly.

360
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:31,130
If you were to describe, let's say, the question that we started off with earlier, how does it come about?

361
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,110
How can it be that this is being done in public as such, right?

362
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:35,930
It's in the shops.

363
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,890
It's in entertainment.

364
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,270
It's done by – it's even government sanctioned, right?

365
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,450
I mean, it's all the way around.

366
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,170
How can it be?

367
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,610
Well, let's start looking at what's going on on the planet today.

368
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,210
You've heard of, like, Ice Age and Bronze Age and Iron Age and all these ages, right?

369
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,490
Well, this is known as the Christian era, the past 2,000 years.

370
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,990
And this is not a religious category.

371
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:06,810
This is a secular historic category, the Anno Domini, the way the year clock is kept, right?

372
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,410
This is all Christian, quote-unquote, based, you see.

373
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,870
Most of the governments in the world acknowledge it.

374
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,650
And the ones that don't still acknowledge it because they're either allied or do business with them.

375
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:25,830
So this Christian convention that has been put in, it has been around for about 2,000 years.

376
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,910
Actually, more like 1,700, about 1,500, mostly.

377
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:43,630
Actually, this type of category that's called Christianity first became prevalent in ancient Assyria around 900 BC.

378
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,450
Now, what do I mean by that without spinning off the conversation?

379
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:57,690
Anyone can go to a computer and do research on Assyrian, that's A-S-S-Y-R-I-A-N.

380
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,330
Assyrian, not Syrian.

381
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,770
Just do a search. Put in Assyrian king wearing crucifix.

382
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,530
You will see a stone stela, which is a stone carving.

383
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,270
I think it's in the Museum of London or something.

384
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,310
And it's an Assyrian king around 800 or something BC, and he's wearing a crucifix around the neck.

385
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,350
Very much like any conventional, cultural, modern-day Christian does.

386
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:32,310
Whether it's a rapper on stage or someone in one of these European countries, they tend to wear it as a symbol of their faith.

387
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:41,350
So that's why I'm saying what you see about Christianity is a cultural, political convention.

388
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,590
It has nothing to do with any specific god at all.

389
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,790
They even tell you there is just one god.

390
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,090
I mean, if that's not a crock, I don't know what is.

391
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,050
So we have a really big problem as a human race.

392
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,270
Now it is so big that you can't see it.

393
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,750
No one can see it.

394
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,310
I mean, it has been seen, and the people that do see it, by the way, and I'm saying no one can see it,

395
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,950
is ultimately when you do see how severe this is throughout the planet,

396
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:22,070
it should disable one's ability to act on anything about it and just set yourself apart from it.

397
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,270
And the reason I'm bringing up this comment is very clear.

398
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,790
How many times have you heard of alternative Protestant movements and breakaways from the Catholic Church?

399
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,270
And we'll bring up, you know, the Catholic Church is the founder of this in the modern convention.

400
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,250
You hear of all these spinoffs.

401
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,290
I think there's 40 or 50 or even more, 100 spinoffs of Christianity, right?

402
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,650
Okay, well, that's what I mean.

403
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,210
See, these little groups, they said, well, we really don't like this thing, so we're not going to do this thing,

404
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,650
but we're still going to do the rest because we're so...

405
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:00,690
Like the Anglican and the Protestant and all the various denominations.

406
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,050
So if you want to end up in a group like that or whatever, that's fine.

407
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,330
So now you're not just eating corn out of someone's poop.

408
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,150
Now you just found a piece of carrot, you know?

409
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,010
So it's really, humanity is just in really, really bad shape.

410
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,890
Now, this has nothing to do with the people, though the majority of the people in any group,

411
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,870
everyone wants the same thing regardless what religion you are,

412
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,650
is you want a roof over your head, you want to eat food when your belly is growling,

413
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,790
you don't want to be sick, and if you have children, you want them to be safe.

414
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,170
This is the commonality of everyone on the planet.

415
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,690
And people that typically pursue those things in some virtuous way, with some moral standard,

416
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,810
are to be considered as roughly good people, in air quotes, right?

417
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,170
How many people like that, or good, quote-unquote, people, consider themselves to be Christian?

418
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:54,690
Many.

419
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,270
How many, quote-unquote, good people consider themselves to be followers of Islam?

420
00:30:59,510 --> 00:30:59,930
Many.

421
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,770
How many consider to be Buddhists?

422
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,150
Many.

423
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,590
Many, you know, in air quotes now, generally people that seemingly behave,

424
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,890
are considered, through their behavior and intent, good people.

425
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:21,210
When they have been joined through, you know, in this convention of modern religion,

426
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,730
or even ancient religion, they don't know what's going on.

427
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,550
They're just doing it to get along.

428
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,670
And within these groups, there's always a reformist group, right,

429
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,910
that says, we're better, and they'll make some...

430
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,390
They drag a group of these people over, right?

431
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,850
They drag them over, and then, you know, whether it's, you mentioned a few, and there's more,

432
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,170
I mean, there's many, we could spend the next hour just mentioning the list.

433
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,190
And any religion.

434
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,470
So we have a very, very big problem.

435
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,910
And the common denominator with all of these religions,

436
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,650
is the quality of the information is so low,

437
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,570
that it almost drives the information into irrelevancy.

438
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:09,690
What it's based on is conventions, tradition, and behavior

439
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,270
that has been in place for thousands of years,

440
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,810
even before the inception of these quote-unquote faiths.

441
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,710
So what would have been...

442
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,450
Now, just to go back to the Santa Claus thing,

443
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,010
if you actually look in what they call the United States of America,

444
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,830
you mentioned the Christmas,

445
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,610
that was considered illegal and unlawful up until the early or mid-19th century.

446
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,890
It was considered immoral.

447
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,750
The actual...

448
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,810
Now, whether you want to call it Saturnalia, or Christmas, or the Solstice, or whatever,

449
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,930
there was enough information about what that meant,

450
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,150
what that symbolized, whether it was working on the calendar,

451
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,290
the actual festivities, or the intent behind it,

452
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,210
was just unlawful and illegal, in what they call America.

453
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,650
I'm not sure about the European history on that,

454
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,990
because they had an emperor up until the early 19th century,

455
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,130
the late 18th century, that made sure these kept going.

456
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:19,710
But I would say that shortly after that early 19th century period,

457
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,510
it was brought in by some of the northeastern states,

458
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,210
and it became more traditional and more...

459
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,130
Now, I think around...

460
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:33,470
There is an identity crisis regarding what's called St. Nicholas and Santa Claus,

461
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,850
and how it's personified,

462
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:41,170
and various other, let's say, all the way from Nordic Druid cultural aspects of it,

463
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,590
known as Woden or Odin, have been mixed in.

464
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:53,090
And then you go down and look at the Proto-Canaanite, Phoenician, Babylonian entities of Moloch thrown in.

465
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,670
It's this morphing.

466
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,330
But if you actually look at it,

467
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,070
it is a revived Moloch worship,

468
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,630
or a revived Odin worship.

469
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,469
That would be the northern versus the southeastern part of culture,

470
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,070
southeastern being the Proto-Canaanite, Phoenician, Babylonian,

471
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:21,210
and the northern would be, let's say, the Celtic Nordic, northern Europe,

472
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,370
and western Europe, the god Odin.

473
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,150
And let's just throw in a little bit of smattering here and there.

474
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,949
Let's start maybe with the...

475
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,949
Do you want to start with the top left corner or the bottom right?

476
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,170
The bottom right being the Middle Eastern or the top left being the European origin of these things.

477
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,030
Let's try the European.

478
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:39,290
Okay.

479
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,550
Odin. This is loose because now, just like, for example,

480
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,730
let's just bring back the Christian thing.

481
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,790
There's like 14... People say, are you denying Jesus Christ?

482
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,010
Greek. And I'm like, no.

483
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,810
Do you believe in Jesus Christ? Greek.

484
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,989
And I say, no.

485
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,350
And they're like, well, what are you doing?

486
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,690
I'm like, well, you don't understand.

487
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:02,090
So you have to be more specific because there's about 14 Jesuses that I've seen in popular culture.

488
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:02,890
Right?

489
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,470
You see one that tells you, if you don't believe me, you go to hell.

490
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,910
You know, the followers.

491
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,050
And the other one says, oh, you can do anything you want.

492
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,910
It's all been forgiven.

493
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:12,970
Right?

494
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,190
And then you've got, you know, one group says, well, you know, this is how he died.

495
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,190
This is when he was born.

496
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,810
One group says he's black.

497
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,730
The other one says he's white.

498
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,750
The other one says he's Asian.

499
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,090
Well, which one?

500
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,550
Which one are you talking about?

501
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,670
You know, I'm confused already.

502
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:26,970
Right?

503
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,650
But none of them are biblical.

504
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,530
Zero.

505
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,090
So when we discuss Odin, we have to bring this up as well.

506
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,950
There's various traditions that have personified that character.

507
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:51,970
But let's just tie it back in for the discussion that we see how people might define what they're saying and doing regarding the Odin myth or the Odin explanation.

508
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,090
Like, for example, real quick, Odin, this is, anyone can start researching, or Woden.

509
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,610
I'll just make it short.

510
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,870
See, Woden, he was omniscient.

511
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,910
He knew what everyone was thinking and what everyone was doing.

512
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,850
And he flew through the sky with stag horned creatures occasionally.

513
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,910
And he rewarded the good and punished the bad.

514
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:24,210
And the way you worship Odin is by bowing down to a tree because trees are made of Odin.

515
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:24,830
You know, Woden?

516
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:25,890
Yep, yep.

517
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,750
Yep.

518
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,770
So this is part, a small part of it.

519
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:36,690
So you have some of the personification there of this bearded whatever, you know, it's a mishmash of stuff.

520
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:47,070
So the way that I can perceive it, it's like bits of this and there, here and from, and an amalgamation of different ideologies and different bits and pieces.

521
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,530
And then wrapped up in a lapsang and call it Christmas and Santa Claus and the Christmas tree.

522
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,630
Yes, yes.

523
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,530
It's kind of like, again, going back to, it might sound distasteful, but I'll keep using this metaphor.

524
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:04,190
If you're hungry and you want to pick corn out of somebody's poo, you might find a piece of carrot or pea in there partially digested also.

525
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,270
Right?

526
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,590
You see, it's really crap.

527
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,830
But here, let's continue maybe.

528
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:18,930
You ever notice how in the Christian convention they have, jokingly I'm just going to say that because what they're doing is an absolute joke, what they call Bible study.

529
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,670
You ever notice that conventionally they do it on what they call Wednesday?

530
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,670
They always do their Bible, across the planet.

531
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:25,950
Why?

532
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,550
Because, see Wednesday is not really Wednesday, it's Odin's day or Woden's day.

533
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,870
So they have to still do it on Woden's day, you see.

534
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,090
These are ridiculous, I mean, stuff.

535
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:51,430
This is just, the quality is so low of what is, in other words, what people regard as their faith and their culture and tradition and their God is so, the quality of it is so low across the board in humanity right now.

536
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:58,670
That it's just, actually, I feel actually ill, like I want to take a shower just thinking about what humanity is involved in right now.

537
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:11,570
All the way from the inaccuracies of calling those that have revived some minor imp or demon from ancient times Satanists, actually gives Satan a bad name, which he already has anyway.

538
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:28,090
But all the way to what they consider to be their venerated rites and rituals, which is so low that I don't know how anyone can really want to pursue and describe this culture without stooping down so low and just crawling on the ground.

539
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,950
This is your fellow man, folks.

540
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:37,730
This is where either you've been or where you are or the general state of humanity at this point.

541
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,690
It's just so pathetic.

542
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,130
Now, it doesn't mean that I don't want to speak bad about Odin worshippers.

543
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:53,830
There probably is a group that has stayed true to that cult or that particular, that is their master, that God.

544
00:38:53,830 --> 00:39:00,090
Now, I'm not sure, I haven't done enough research on Odin to have discovered if he has been killed yet.

545
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,910
Now, yes, you heard me right.

546
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,350
The gods can be killed as well.

547
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:14,150
So, I'm not really up to date on what Odin, if there has been a declaration formally that he was eliminated from the existence or he's still around.

548
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,630
So, yes, I know it sounds kind of crazy to most to hear this.

549
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:25,870
But, you know, so there, okay, so that's the northwest corner or the northwestern part of, let's say, what's called the Satanic or tradition.

550
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,470
And also they say he comes from the North Pole.

551
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:33,010
You notice that's why I said maybe let's pull it from there first and add that as well, right?

552
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,430
Yes.

553
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,770
Flying through the sky.

554
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:41,630
Now, you want to jump down to the lower, you know, the Mesopotamian region, the Proto-Canaanite, Proto-Phoenician?

555
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:48,470
Well, that ties in also to the metaphor of what do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common, right?

556
00:39:49,290 --> 00:40:06,250
Where the priests then had made the decision to, and inspired by these imps and demons, by the way, to have their followers sacrifice children to these lords.

557
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,050
That's why even today in the Christian convention you worship what?

558
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:10,650
Who?

559
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,490
The Lord.

560
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,910
The Lord is a very, it's a ball.

561
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,070
And it's just amazing.

562
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:28,150
Again, remember, to get into any more detail I feel it makes me very unnerved because it's a very low level of existence, a very low level.

563
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:35,810
It's vile in its most, probably most optimistic sense of describing it is actually a very vile thing to discuss.

564
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:41,650
How people have been enthralled in participating in these conventions and traditions.

565
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,690
They're just all vile.

566
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,750
Can I just interrupt there?

567
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:50,950
What is the purpose of continuing to subscribe to these faiths or worshipping, like Christmas?

568
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:59,210
What's the point of Christmas other than the default for me is the capitalism of trying to get money from the people and just full gifts and stuff.

569
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,830
I mean, does it provide any energy to the worship or celebration?

570
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,430
Yeah, it's a dummy load.

571
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,410
I've done a show on Ocelian Greek also regarding the dummy load.

572
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:19,210
What I mean by a dummy load is as living beings we have energy that builds up in the body or in the mind.

573
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,650
And we have to expel it, you know?

574
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,630
That's why people say I'm going for a run or even a sexual energy, right?

575
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,710
They have to, it has to be discharged.

576
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,350
You know, hunger is an energy and it's discharged when you put food in the stomach.

577
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,830
We build up energy as living beings, right?

578
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,150
It's chi, prana, you know, it builds up in us.

579
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,150
And if we don't release it, it can cause harm.

580
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,130
Okay.

581
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,770
So is it like a global ritual of some sort then?

582
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:49,880
Everybody focusing on the same day and then there's a release.

583
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:50,870
Yeah.

584
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,130
Yeah.

585
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,770
So maybe let's go back to the Eastern side.

586
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,190
I brought up the cannibals' birthdays and dolls and such.

587
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,270
But the Moloch, let's just bring up Moloch.

588
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:10,850
People were told to make a wish of prosperity and offer the child to, by placing the child on the seat or the lap of a bronze statue.

589
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:16,010
It typically had the head of a man, a goat, an eagle, a bird or some other animal.

590
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,490
It might have been human as well.

591
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:24,470
And this statue had been red hot because it either had a hearth within it or a hearth below it.

592
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,870
And the child was placed in its lap and seared alive.

593
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:37,370
And what you were able to see is a large red colored object with a baby or a young child placed in its lap searing alive.

594
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:45,410
And this was not done in private like many of the ways that people are suggesting human sacrifice is done today.

595
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:53,730
You know, in the basements of old court buildings or banks or hospitals or out in Bohemian Grove or whatever they might suggest, right?

596
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,650
And hint, hint, I've actually just brought up some of the things that anyone might want to research.

597
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,670
But this was done in the public, openly.

598
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:10,410
And if you wanted a wish of prosperity and you didn't want to sacrifice the child that was of your own, you just purchased one.

599
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,550
They had plenty of children that the poor supplied the providers of children.

600
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,850
And you will find this society was prevalent in the Old Testament, right?

601
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,670
And that's why the, I think we made a discussion, might have been maybe in another interview or discussion,

602
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:31,930
why people can never understand why the Israelites were told to go in and kill everything.

603
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,910
Because these people would not change these habits, you know?

604
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:41,570
Just like today, how many times have you heard of people say, well, this is what I believe and I will believe that to the death, right?

605
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,610
Well, guess what? You keep saying stuff like that, you just might be accommodated, you know, someday, right?

606
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,010
So, yeah, and they were back then.

607
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,730
So it was open to the public and this was common day practice.

608
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,730
Oh, yeah, it was common day.

609
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:05,630
Yes, and it was even on a non-common day as something that was an observance, it was even more prevalent.

610
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,670
I mean, they would probably do a few thousand children in a day like that, right?

611
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:17,810
And also, just bear in mind that when you're in the public square, you're having conversation, you're doing business,

612
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,930
you're getting along how people get along in public.

613
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,050
It's very unnerving, even though you've accepted this as being, you know, part of your culture,

614
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,190
it's very unnerving to hear a child being burned alive.

615
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,930
It's a blood-curdling scream, I would imagine, right?

616
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:38,010
Because it doesn't happen instantly, I'm sure it would take more than a few seconds or a few minutes.

617
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,450
And the child being conscious within, unless they clubbed them, I don't know how really they did it.

618
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,090
Maybe they made them unconscious or whatever, but there was the potential of screaming.

619
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:55,110
So what they had was they had bells ringing to drown out the screams.

620
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,210
That's why you see the bells on churches, that's why ringing consistently,

621
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:03,330
that's why you see the thing called jingle bells on the slate.

622
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,310
It's all been incorporated, you see.

623
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:10,130
So do you feel like you're eating corn out of someone's poop?

624
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,170
Because I sure do when we're discussing this kind of stuff, right?

625
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,210
To a certain degree.

626
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:21,750
Because again, how many times have you heard of censorship or things being hidden?

627
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:28,930
Any accurate records depicting these events have been absconded from public view, by the way.

628
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,830
So this sort of information is hidden away from everyone to try and find it,

629
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,930
unless they actually go digging and looking for it.

630
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,890
Yes, in its whole form.

631
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,050
So the only way to do it is by very good detective work here and there a little,

632
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:51,770
just like when an assailant performs a crime, he tries to cover it up, right?

633
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,150
By cleaning up the body or tracks or whatever, right?

634
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:02,570
But there's always going to be, let's say the forensic investigator might actually find some traces.

635
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,190
Sequel kernels.

636
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,850
Yes, a fiber, a footprint, something.

637
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,290
Corn kernels, yes, unfortunately in this case.

638
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,750
This is a really rotten subject.

639
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,210
And by the way, anyone who does a little bit of research,

640
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:19,650
they will also discover that the gods look down on what humanity is doing.

641
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:26,530
The hypocrisy of anyone to say that my faith is better or your faith is not is just ridiculous

642
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,090
because they're all in the shit, big time, all of them.

643
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,610
And the ignorance, now what's good about this is the ignorance of this will be lifted in the future.

644
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,470
Because you've got to realize there's three truths to this matter.

645
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:43,010
The truth, the basic truth, which is what the people believe in,

646
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,170
they don't know it, they just believe in it because it's convenient.

647
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,950
When someone puts something in front of you, just pick one and go,

648
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,370
that's what they do or it's within their family.

649
00:46:51,370 --> 00:47:00,530
The second truth is a smattering of how to administer the public that believes this, right?

650
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:05,730
The second truth would be, let's say if you're a priest, an imam, a rabbi, a guru,

651
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:11,190
you have to know a little bit about not only what these morons were told to believe,

652
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,590
but you also have to know how to administer it, keep control of them.

653
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,330
Because they're going to come to you on holidays,

654
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,990
you're going to have someone that might seem radical and question it, how do you answer?

655
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:28,710
You're going to have to have a pretty firm understanding on how the society is based on this,

656
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,810
to administer these idiots, right?

657
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,550
That's the second truth.

658
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,630
And usually when you get to the second truth, when you're having, let's say,

659
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,790
a conversation with a rabbi or an imam or a priest, a pastor, a minister,

660
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,350
not some of them, all of them,

661
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:48,230
or a guru from the eastern sides, or one of those monks,

662
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,450
they're very easy to confound, by the way, because none of them,

663
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:58,290
I mean, remember, they're just there because it's the way they make their living, right?

664
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,630
But they have to be able to defend what they're doing.

665
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:09,010
And also they all defend it in a very, very simple manner that's beyond childish

666
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,790
and almost arrogantly stupid.

667
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:16,630
But once you start getting to that point, they also have to have access to enforce their position,

668
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,870
where they usually, when you start asking questions regarding why are they doing what they're doing,

669
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,550
where did they get it from, and do they know what they're doing,

670
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,690
they tend to go purely emotional, and then they come in and basically say,

671
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,510
how dare you ask me what I'm doing, I have all these believers,

672
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,710
and there's a billion believers or whatever, how dare you, right?

673
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,930
So they have to know how to keep that administrative position through some,

674
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:46,850
a little bit more truth, when I say about how these things are to be administered.

675
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,070
Now the third, at the top, is the reality of it all.

676
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,370
And once you get to that point, you realize that the other truths are basically

677
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,270
picking corn out of someone's poop, right?

678
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,350
And you don't want anything to do with it.

679
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:04,150
That's why I really frown down upon, there are people that actually make a living

680
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:10,190
or make concerted effort to either write books, magazines, or go on radio or television or whatever

681
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,690
and expound how bad Christianity is.

682
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,010
And you gotta do X, Y, and Z, or A, B, and C.

683
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,710
Or other people do the same thing about Islam.

684
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,330
Don't even bother.

685
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,870
Why would you even go to that level?

686
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:29,150
Because the situation of the human spirit right now is so poor,

687
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,570
that you'll just either end up forming a cult or you'll just be squashed out.

688
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,610
Now let me just throw something in here.

689
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:45,210
Because we started off asking about Santa Claus and the second part was me bringing up how piss poor the information is.

690
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,930
And the first example I gave was how people are touted as being Satanists and all this, right?

691
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:58,150
When you start to examine how they're explaining and how they're describing things,

692
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:02,930
when you actually look at this entity known as Satan, this spirit being,

693
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,510
this is a fact folks, and this is not something you're allowed to make up or believe in.

694
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,250
You have to go look these things up.

695
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,190
This entire world culture, whether it's religious, yes,

696
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:19,950
let me just be very clear, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism

697
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,570
is under the auspices of Satan.

698
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:27,990
So when you say Satanism, right away you have to be more specific.

699
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:32,190
Because when you say Satanism, I'm thinking, are you talking about Christianity?

700
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,990
Are you talking about Judaism?

701
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,170
That's what I'm thinking.

702
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,730
Are you talking about which form of Satanism?

703
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,830
Because all...

704
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:48,210
You see, Satan doesn't mess around with a bunch of little guys wearing funny eyebrows and black robes

705
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,650
in the church of Satan with an upside down cross.

706
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,330
He doesn't move around that way.

707
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,430
What he does, he takes control of the major institutions.

708
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,150
So if you're planning on having a discussion about Satanism, please be specific.

709
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,030
Are you speaking about Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Judaism?

710
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,710
Which one? Please.

711
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:15,250
The second thing is not only is Satan in control of all of the religions,

712
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,870
the main religions of the world,

713
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,590
he's in control of your entertainment industries,

714
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,130
your circuses, which is your church,

715
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,970
your films, your theater.

716
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,090
He is also in control...

717
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,990
Not some little high school play, or little small film,

718
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,170
but the entire industry, right?

719
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,810
The core, the power base.

720
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,810
He's in charge of all of your political systems.

721
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,830
So it doesn't matter if you're in Washington, D.C.,

722
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:45,530
or in London, or Moscow, or Athens, or anywhere,

723
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,010
okay?

724
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,830
He's in charge of all of your judicial aspects.

725
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,950
He is in charge of...

726
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,010
It has been given to him by the Most High

727
00:51:55,010 --> 00:52:00,330
to have authority and control over all of your major institutions.

728
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,170
He doesn't petty and play around with some little group.

729
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,230
Or individuals.

730
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,130
At all.

731
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,030
There are minor imps and demons that do that.

732
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,870
Now, if there hasn't been anything more accurate than that said,

733
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,550
I don't know what.

734
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,110
Because this is about as accurate and as precise and as true

735
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,170
as this topic can be explained.

736
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,430
So, now, here's the thing, Rodrigo,

737
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,030
just between you and I right now,

738
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,730
and I know this is recorded and going to be put up,

739
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,510
let's say, on YouTube,

740
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,170
how many people listening to this are able to walk away

741
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,970
with information they could actually use?

742
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,990
And if the answer is zero, that is correct.

743
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,770
Because where and who are you going to go to tell this to?

744
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,010
Be mocked in the process, if you try.

745
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,430
So they're going to give you a mouth shot.

746
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,670
Even the most alternatively based,

747
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,470
knowledge, quote-unquote, seeking individual

748
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,450
will not be able to handle this information

749
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,510
because he'll turn to the person next to him and say,

750
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,510
that sounds too radical.

751
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,530
You know why it sounds too radical?

752
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,510
Because it's true.

753
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,130
Anyone can research and look into...

754
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,790
The amount of time that you're spending listening to what I'm saying,

755
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,110
using a keyboard or whatever,

756
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,150
you can actually look up and validate everything that I'm telling you.

757
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,050
If you go to the source, like if you, for example,

758
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,270
how many times have you heard people use things out of the Bible

759
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,230
but they do not use the biblical definition?

760
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,190
How many times have you heard people say,

761
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,430
oh, the number 666 is satanic?

762
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,150
No, it's not.

763
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,750
It's not.

764
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,190
No?

765
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,430
Well, what are you making up there?

766
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,770
Oh, that's the Antichrist over there.

767
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,910
That president...

768
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:32,570
No, because the Bible is very clear on defining who the Antichrist is.

769
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,070
Or this is, you know, that's the apocalypse.

770
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,350
Well, you know, I don't know.

771
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,370
What do you mean by apocalypse?

772
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,070
Because the Bible defines it.

773
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,470
So what they're doing is they're taking catchphrases

774
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,430
out of a certain body of work,

775
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,730
and they're not using the definitions that are within that body of work

776
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,250
to define it.

777
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,530
They're making up the definition for it.

778
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:53,110
Yeah.

779
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:53,690
Yeah.

780
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,030
They're collecting the scores.

781
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:56,850
Yeah, they are.

782
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:57,790
They're really, really bad.

783
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,490
And this goes across the board on the internet.

784
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,330
You have a lot of people saying they're, you know,

785
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,950
alternative researchers or academics, let's say,

786
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,170
that are mainstream and alternative, let's say.

787
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,970
You have religious people, religious scholars.

788
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,610
They're all in the shit right now.

789
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,130
And this is why you and I are saying what we're saying.

790
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,090
And I've said this publicly before,

791
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:21,670
and that's why the numbers are so against the individual

792
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,910
that discovers what is going on on this planet

793
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,190
that it's almost disabling.

794
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,850
Not disabling where you're going to be, you know,

795
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,770
sitting in the middle of the floor in a pile of poop,

796
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,710
but disabling where you really shouldn't do anything about it

797
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,230
other than separate yourself from it, quietly.

798
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,550
Because the people on this planet are wicked and vile and evil.

799
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,870
But fortunately, they're wicked, vile, and evil in a juvenile sense.

800
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,990
They lack the maturity to develop that wickedness, that vileness, and evil.

801
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:59,770
What I mean by they're juvenile in that way is if they want to get something...

802
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,410
Kindergarten stuff, yes.

803
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,090
They have to go, if they're going to act,

804
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,690
if the masses are going to act on anything or approach on something,

805
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,430
they always go to the entitled classes.

806
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,650
In other words, they're so juvenile that if they have a legal issue,

807
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:13,850
oh, I've got to find an attorney,

808
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,550
because of course I don't know how to read or know anything about it.

809
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,650
I spent 12,000 hours in public school

810
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,930
and not even have one hour on how the legal system works.

811
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,750
I'm fine with that.

812
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,650
I'll go hire a moron to tell me what to do.

813
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,630
Just like with the body.

814
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,570
Oh, I'm not feeling well.

815
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,310
Oh, you've got to go see a doctor.

816
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,530
How can someone else tell you about what's going on in your own body?

817
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,410
When it comes to spirituality, you've got to go find whatever.

818
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:47,870
Whatever entitled authorities in whatever realm you've been suckered in to be part of the faith of.

819
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,390
And yes, you are suckers.

820
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,750
Smokers are suckers too.

821
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:53,770
People say, are you smoking?

822
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,010
No, I'm sucking.

823
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,150
The cigarette smoking.

824
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,110
Smoking hurts, because when there's smoke, there's fire.

825
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,890
So the thing here is this.

826
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,830
There is no audience for what is being said here.

827
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,750
This is maybe revelatory, meaning exposing the reality that anyone can look at.

828
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,590
But there's no fun in being accurate, Greek.

829
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,630
There's no fun in being precise.

830
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,170
That's your truth.

831
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,490
That's your viewpoint, you see.

832
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,950
It doesn't resonate with me.

833
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,330
Yeah, it doesn't resonate with me.

834
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,870
Yeah, just go for it, man.

835
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:31,290
That's why the purpose of knowledge is in itself initially to get the information.

836
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,450
You don't have to act on it.

837
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:40,270
But if you are going to put energy into anything to act on anything,

838
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,010
it better be setting yourself apart, learning how to pull yourself apart first.

839
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:46,210
Right?

840
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,850
It's kind of like if you're going out in the woods and you're looking for bears,

841
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,570
before you start doing that, you better learn how to climb trees real well.

842
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,690
Right?

843
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,570
You better make sure you can do that.

844
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,470
Because you want to set yourself apart from the bear occasionally.

845
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:07,830
You don't want to go out there touting this particular episode and say that you know,

846
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:11,030
and try to separate yourself from everyone and touting it,

847
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,190
because you're going to get stomped on.

848
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,870
Well, you're going to get stomped on, but here's the thing also.

849
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,070
Have you heard of like, do the right thing?

850
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,150
Now, what is the right thing?

851
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,010
Well, everyone says, well, that's my opinion on what's right or wrong.

852
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:31,830
There seems to be through the ages a saying or a feeling that has gone through that says,

853
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:36,170
you should, if you know the truth, speak it, do it, say it.

854
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,050
Right?

855
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,370
Just put it out there.

856
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,510
If it is true, it will stand on its own.

857
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,370
Now, what I'm discussing here is not what I believe.

858
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:47,570
What I'm discussing here is what I've discovered and it is a rock solid report.

859
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,570
My belief is personal and private.

860
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:56,750
Now, what I mean by that is beliefs always have to be based on things that are going to happen.

861
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,450
If you believe just blanketly on something and it's not founded, you're an idiot.

862
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:06,330
And this is typically the category of your typical surface dwelling earth inhabitant.

863
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,190
They don't need any proof of anything.

864
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,110
Because somehow they've been convinced of that.

865
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:17,810
When I say my belief is private and personal, it's because the beliefs are constantly changing.

866
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:25,910
If I get a note from someone saying they're sending me a grand in American credit currency tomorrow,

867
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:32,650
well, between the time when I get the message and when I get it, there is a factor of belief there.

868
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,890
There are so many beliefs that we operate on.

869
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,990
The weather forecast is a belief.

870
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,010
Hey, looks like it might rain tomorrow.

871
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:46,910
So between now, when I've found out the information, and when it rains, I'm operating in belief, aren't I?

872
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,870
So if it doesn't rain tomorrow, that was a false belief.

873
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,790
And if it does rain, okay, it is a true belief, a good belief.

874
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:02,830
All of your religions in the world that are based on faith with morons that are participating is unfounded, baseless.

875
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,030
Don't even bother engaging them on that.

876
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,590
Because it's just worse than a baby vomiting chocolate pudding.

877
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:14,910
The reality of what is memorialized in their texts is very simple.

878
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:20,410
That the gods exist, the gods do things, and to prove that the gods do things,

879
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,990
they're going to tell you what they do before they do it, and that's what your belief is hinged on.

880
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,200
I've had actually the worst of the older people because, you know, why?

881
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,440
Because if you do something wrong five times, you might be able to, you know, turn around.

882
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,120
But if you do something wrong 500,000 times, you've already facilitated it, and it's the only thing you know.

883
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,540
That's why the older people are worse when it comes to this.

884
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:53,120
I've actually had conversations with an old Catholic man, and I brought up certain points in the biblical texts.

885
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,880
Like, you know, you really, if you read the Bible every day, and you spend an hour on it every day,

886
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,440
how about maybe spending 45 minutes on it, and just 15 minutes looking at an interlinear,

887
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,580
we actually see what was really supposed to be translated into English versus what.

888
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,080
You know what, Greek? I really don't need that, because I'm fine with that.

889
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:17,220
I just believe that I'm getting the truth in the King James.

890
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:24,680
When any moron in less than five minutes can easily pull up an interlinear anywhere in the Bible

891
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:31,660
and see that within a few verses is at least a half a dozen mistakes from the original text, right?

892
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,700
Anyone can do that very quickly, very rapidly.

893
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,980
There's even harsh criticism on what's been put, but no one cares.

894
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,200
So this old man, what did he say?

895
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,660
Oh, basically, I don't really care.

896
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,780
I just, because I believe in it, there's no mistakes in it, you see.

897
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,940
That's why I tell the young people, you have no future around this.

898
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,060
You know, years ago you were supposed to look up to the older people, right?

899
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,600
See, that's why people don't understand what's going on around them.

900
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,660
That's why they're stuffing all these old codgers into nursing homes.

901
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,380
Years ago, the older people were regarded as being wiser.

902
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,320
So, well, let's just say.

903
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,720
And now, what are they doing?

904
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,820
Oh, they're getting old.

905
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,200
Stuff them into a nursing home.

906
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,700
Fill them up with drugs, right?

907
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,240
Because they're worthless.

908
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,500
They have no value.

909
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,740
In the culture, tradition, and the gods say they do.

910
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,900
But the actuality of the matter is they have no value anymore.

911
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,200
Listen to them.

912
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,260
And, of course, there's an exception.

913
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,520
It's very hard to meet any.

914
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,140
But just look around, you know, whether you have family or relatives or friends or associates.

915
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,780
Go up to these old people that have been on this planet for either twice as long as you or much longer than you.

916
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,260
And ask them any of the questions that are actually relevant to reality.

917
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,480
About things like, maybe you might hear the Greek talk about.

918
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,080
And watch how quickly you'll see they recede back to the mind of a nine-year-old ignorant.

919
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,920
So, this is the, you know, are you paying attention?

920
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,080
What is going on?

921
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,760
These old people are being stuffed into the garbage can, basically known as a nursing home or whatever, for a reason.

922
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,060
Because the gods don't approve of it either.

923
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,880
There is no way you could see what's going on on this planet, whether you consider it good or bad, without the gods interfering.

924
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,340
So, what do you mean about that?

925
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,540
Well, let's tie it back, you know, with the Santa Claus.

926
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,680
Where is the interference with the gods with Santa Claus?

927
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:27,620
Right?

928
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Very clear that revived aspects, Santa Claus specifically, I would tie it in, being that it's red, fat, and a child placed under its lap,

929
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,880
would be more of the proto-Canaanite, Phoenician, Babylonian, Moloch.

930
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,060
Right?

931
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,860
Seated creature.

932
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,760
And the rest of the Santa Claus meme, you might want to throw in the Wodenism.

933
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,020
Ties in very deeply to Christianity.

934
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,780
Those that are supposedly active Christians, what do they do?

935
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,020
They go on Bible study, when?

936
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,040
On Woden's day.

937
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,160
Right?

938
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,240
His day.

939
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:17,160
Now, the other thing is, you know, there's the, let's say Phoenicians are a northern part of ancient Israel, you'll find memorialized in the Biblical text.

940
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,740
There was Baal of the Grove, the Lord of the Trees.

941
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:26,980
And it's interesting how they put the presents underneath the Christmas tree.

942
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,560
How do you get them from underneath?

943
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,540
You kneel down, don't you?

944
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:38,540
So, if someone were watching this at a distance, they're not looking at you trying to get a present from under the tree.

945
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,020
They see you doing what?

946
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,420
Bow down.

947
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Kneeling down.

948
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,760
It doesn't matter why you're kneeling down, as long as you get on your knees.

949
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:55,080
You ever watch some of these sci-fi films, where this, you know, supposedly an authoritative alien comes in, or something,

950
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,480
and they get all the subjects to bow down, or kneel down,

951
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,280
and if you don't want to, the guards will hit you on the back of the knee with a club, but you can do it anyway.

952
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,100
Stargate.

953
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,940
Yeah, right, there you go.

954
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,920
It doesn't matter if you want to do it or not.

955
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,700
It's that you are kneeling.

956
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,840
You're in the proper position.

957
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:14,880
Submissive.

958
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,320
Is that right?

959
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:18,640
Yes.

960
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,340
Being in the submissive position, and basically giving all authority to the person you're bowing down to.

961
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,360
Right, and it also makes it very convenient for the person you're bowing down to to do what they like,

962
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,900
because if they were to do a quick move on you, you really can't move that fast when you're on your knees.

963
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:33,780
That's right.

964
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:35,400
Okay?

965
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,640
Now, all this stuff might sound negative.

966
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,120
I'm telling you, we've discussed the most positive side of it.

967
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,840
That's why we're making all of the world's religions akin to picking corn out of someone's poop.

968
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,360
Now, it doesn't mean that the text...

969
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,240
Here's the complicated part.

970
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:58,960
It gets complicated, and the average surface-dwelling human inhabitant, or whatever you might want to call it,

971
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,900
lacks the aptitude or the skill or even the desire or the bravery to go into this direction,

972
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,960
and spend time and look at what these religions, their texts, are allegedly based on.

973
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:12,400
Right?

974
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,400
If you look at the various Sanskrit writings, you might go in the Eastern cultures,

975
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,340
and you come across all the way through the middle.

976
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:24,100
You might want to look at Hebrew and Arabic, and what's called the Koran in the Old Testament,

977
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,180
or the biblical texts, or in the Christian meme.

978
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,420
You might want to look at what's called the New Testament, Old Testament, and all that.

979
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,820
How many people have actually found a holistic foundation in these texts?

980
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,260
None.

981
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:35,800
You can't.

982
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:42,040
It's impossible to be sane and pursue these things with no understanding of what's in the text,

983
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,960
because I've said this previously, that pretty much what these religions are doing in practice

984
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,260
is in the forbidden or abominations list.

985
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,400
It doesn't matter which religion it is.

986
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,060
You'll find this to be true.

987
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,180
And that's why it's so disabling to do this, because who are you going to talk to about this?

988
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:00,940
It doesn't matter.

989
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,020
No one wants to hear it.

990
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,700
It's the bizarreness of it.

991
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:10,240
And when I say religion, religion just means things you do regularly.

992
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,340
Now, it's gotten so discounted.

993
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,040
Thankfully, from one perspective,

994
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,080
if you speak to most people, regardless of what religion they're in,

995
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,380
most people, actually,

996
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,920
and you start questioning their faith,

997
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,720
putting in quotation marks,

998
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,220
within 30 seconds to 3 minutes of the conversation,

999
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,540
they almost self-profess.

1000
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,780
The only reason they profess that faith is because either their parents did,

1001
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,120
and they're not really into it.

1002
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:46,300
Oh, I'm not really religious, even though I'm Christian.

1003
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,740
I don't really know anything about it, really.

1004
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,320
I'm just okay with going along, you know?

1005
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,800
This is 99% of the quotable faith.

1006
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,340
It accommodates their current lifestyle,

1007
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,360
because if they chose a different faith or religion,

1008
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,760
they'd have to change what's where they're complacent on.

1009
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,560
Maybe not even.

1010
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,000
They conduct their lives like they're staring at a government form.

1011
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,360
You know, like, check your name, what sex, which religion.

1012
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,440
Just check the box.

1013
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,080
So, yeah, you know, I'm Christian,

1014
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,860
but I just need to check that box and get over it.

1015
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,080
I really don't need to know anything about it.

1016
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,100
Or, how dare you, Greek?

1017
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,580
That's what I believe in, and that's good enough for me.

1018
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,300
Here's an example.

1019
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,880
Every Christian, bar none,

1020
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,240
when you corner them and say,

1021
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,000
hey, how come you're doing A, B, C, or D,

1022
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,140
or don't know about A, B, C, or D, or X, Y, and Z,

1023
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,160
they, within, again, 30 seconds or 3 minutes,

1024
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,400
just about every time, there's a spirit behind this,

1025
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,780
what they will do is renounce the text that the religion is based on.

1026
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,720
The majority of them will start saying to you,

1027
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,100
well, who knows who wrote the Bible anyway, and who cares?

1028
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,700
I don't need a Bible anyway, to base it on.

1029
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,800
Oh, so what are you basing it on, Walt Disney?

1030
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,160
But you don't engage these people, because they're insane.

1031
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:00,800
You know?

1032
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,160
The same thing with Islam.

1033
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,720
If you start engaging them, hey, why are you doing this,

1034
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,420
why are you saying, oh, well, you know, what you're telling me,

1035
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,360
they all say this,

1036
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,700
what you're telling me can't be in the Koran,

1037
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,460
because the Koran was written to be simple.

1038
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,479
And they'll say, oh, well, you know what,

1039
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,960
I have a copy right here, let's go take a look at it.

1040
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:19,760
Oh, no, no, no.

1041
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,080
That copy is not the one that we have in the mosque.

1042
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,000
No, no, no.

1043
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:24,979
That can't be good.

1044
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,260
This is like across the board, man.

1045
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,939
So, for example, if you speak to a Christian,

1046
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:34,460
and they renounce the Bible in 30 seconds or 3 minutes,

1047
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,680
and it happens once, it happens twice,

1048
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:38,880
it happens three times, it happens a hundred times,

1049
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,380
no matter who you're talking to across the planet,

1050
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,680
you're like, wow, there is a spirit behind this

1051
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,960
that has tied all these people together like the Borg, right?

1052
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
In Star Trek.

1053
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,800
Where there's this collective that they've been captured into,

1054
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,500
and what might that spirit be sourced from?

1055
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:57,939
Yes.

1056
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,979
The great adversary known as Satan.

1057
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,420
What makes him great is the magnitude of his influence.

1058
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,140
That's how Satan connects to these people,

1059
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:10,859
by sending in that thread like the Borg.

1060
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,160
I guess they had a tube in your neck or something,

1061
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,880
and there was a mainframe that was broadcasting.

1062
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:19,640
So go ahead, Rodrigo.

1063
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:24,319
So, yeah, no, just what I learned today is,

1064
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,279
in summarizing all of the world's institutions,

1065
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:33,200
whether religious, judicial, is all orchestrated or founded

1066
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,220
upon the adversary or Satan, right?

1067
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,279
Yes.

1068
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,080
So if you say you're a Christian,

1069
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,500
which is supposed to be non-Satanistic,

1070
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,680
is the very thing that you're adhering to,

1071
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,460
which is the Satan influence created?

1072
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,280
Oh, and actually more so because this is known secularly

1073
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,700
as the Christian era.

1074
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,560
In other words, the entire world is dominated by the Christian era.

1075
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,160
When I say the Christian era, this is the academic worldview.

1076
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,540
And most of these people are atheists anyway,

1077
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,660
but they still use it.

1078
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,000
So you would see that as the chief,

1079
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,920
and some people might say, as the chief religion of the planet,

1080
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,360
some people might say, well, that's the Western,

1081
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,080
the Eastern is, you know, other.

1082
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,340
And I say, well, no, actually, from an academic marking,

1083
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,620
the worldview is considered a Judeo-Christian ethic,

1084
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,880
which none of it is based...

1085
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,820
Yeah, so if someone says they're in Islam,

1086
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,180
that is 100% also under that control,

1087
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,860
because it is a major religion.

1088
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,600
This is not the time to expound the truth.

1089
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,620
I mean, look at your...

1090
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,160
Let's just change the subject for a moment.

1091
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,180
How many physics departments are there

1092
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,640
throughout the world in university?

1093
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:49,060
Many. Every country, every city probably has a college of some sort.

1094
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,160
And they're all talking about what?

1095
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,920
The atom and electrons and protons.

1096
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,420
Now, hold on. All of them, right?

1097
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,940
You know there's no such thing as an electron or a proton or such, right?

1098
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,500
This is a made-up construct.

1099
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,100
It's a mathematical equation that they think is the basis of them.

1100
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,640
Yeah. And they talk about it like it's physical.

1101
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,280
So are they all insane? Absolutely.

1102
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,740
But are they prevalent everywhere? Absolutely.

1103
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,480
Does that make them true and correct? No, it doesn't.

1104
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,440
This is the state of humanity, and that's why I say it's disabling.

1105
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,940
If you find out the truth, if you've got all this pent-up energy,

1106
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,020
don't necessarily keep it to yourself.

1107
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,760
You might want to talk about it somewhere publicly.

1108
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,480
But spend the time separating yourself from the rest of it.

1109
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,920
Insulate yourself. Learn how to bring humor.

1110
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,680
So when a moron comes up to you and starts talking about electrons and protons,

1111
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,860
learn how to bring humor into the situation, and then disembark.

1112
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,580
Because if you start engaging these idiots with the reality of things,

1113
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,840
they begin to get a look in their eye like they want to bring physical harm to you.

1114
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,700
And then you should learn how to read those things.

1115
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,200
If you start discussing anything with a Christian in person,

1116
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,300
start to read their body language.

1117
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:01,060
Because they actually start getting to the point where they want to bring bodily harm to you.

1118
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,820
Have you ever heard of burning at the stake?

1119
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,960
Witch hunts or whatever? Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,080
Okay, same thing. If you're in court over a traffic ticket,

1121
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,580
you'll see the guy in the black dress behind the tall thing there, podium.

1122
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,080
He has a look in his eye that looks like he's ready to bring physical harm to you.

1123
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,960
You better learn how to read these subtle things.

1124
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,940
You could even be in bed with your loved one, bringing this up.

1125
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,560
You better learn how to read their body language when they're looking,

1126
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,760
because they want to bring physical harm to you when you broach these subjects.

1127
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,220
This is very important. That's what I mean by set apart.

1128
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,420
Not only in your thinking, but in your physical reality.

1129
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:47,180
In my experience, a long time ago, the reason why I detached mainly from major religions

1130
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:50,880
is I had a group of friends. One was Christian, one was Muslim.

1131
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,340
Actually, a couple were Christian. And we used to go night clubbing.

1132
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,440
But you know what they used to do on the Friday night?

1133
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,820
The Christian would remove the cross from his neck,

1134
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,800
and my Muslim friend would remove the insignia for Islam.

1135
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:06,480
He had a ring. He'd take it off. Then they'd go night clubbing and take drugs.

1136
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:10,560
And I'm like, the hypocrisy. I was very young then.

1137
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,820
I was like, that's disgusting. That's disgusting.

1138
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,120
They'd be Christian every day, and then they'd go clubbing and take drugs.

1139
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,340
Here's the thing. Fortunately, yes, it seems like hypocrisy,

1140
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,980
but it really isn't, because they don't know enough about what they're doing

1141
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,960
to actually be hypocritical about it. They're actually just ignorant.

1142
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:34,360
They're just taking up space, going through actions and acting on impulse.

1143
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,800
In other words, they took up Islam and Christianity based on impulse or convenience,

1144
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:43,920
and they're going clubbing and doing drugs based on what? Impulse and convenience.

1145
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,340
So these are people whose lives are based on impulse and convenience.

1146
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,840
Do you really want to go out in public and start trying to convey anything

1147
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,120
that even approaches the truth to people who are spurred on to action by impulse and convenience?

1148
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,960
The answer there, the rational answer is absolutely no.

1149
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,280
There's only a very small group of people anywhere in any generation

1150
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:09,280
during mankind that are actually worthwhile speaking to you.

1151
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:13,840
It is worthy to speak to everyone, but I think we just gave a few reasons

1152
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,460
why maybe you shouldn't.

1153
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:21,180
Okay. Well, Greg, it's gone 15 minutes past the hour.

1154
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,740
I wanted to wrap this up for today.

1155
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,840
We spoke of a lot of truths, and not perceived truths, not my truth or your truth,

1156
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:37,120
but the way it is. And just to summarize, we've discussed about Santa Claus

1157
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:45,280
and the reason why it's a mishmash of various ancient, I suppose, rituals and gods.

1158
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:50,680
We've established that there's not just a god, some monotheistic,

1159
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,800
but that's the denial of other gods.

1160
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,760
And yeah, I think we've covered quite a lot of track here.

1161
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,840
So I wanted to thank you, Greg, for joining us on The Waiting Room on Rodrigo and the Greek.

1162
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,620
And yes, you'll find this episode and others on Uncommonradio.com

1163
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:09,300
as well as Rodrigoandthegreek.com.

1164
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,420
Okay, man. Thanks. We'll do it again soon.

1165
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,440
Yes, for sure. Bye-bye.
