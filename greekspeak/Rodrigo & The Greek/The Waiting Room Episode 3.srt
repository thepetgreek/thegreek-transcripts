1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,400
Still sound like you're coming out of a can or something, but that's all right. How are you? Are we recording?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,300
Yeah, we're recording the live on the third installment of Rodrigo and the Greek

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,140
Rodrigo and the Greek in the waiting room waiting room. Yeah. Yeah

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,280
All right. Yeah, we haven't had a large attendance on the other two, but enough

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:27,100
I think the attendance that's there people are really ready for what's being said, especially when there's this voyeuristic approach

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,820
You know when we're just having a conversation. So what's on your mind? It's been a little while

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,040
And we had one inquiry about you know, are we going to do this again? And apparently we are so

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,900
Any thoughts anything you want to get into? No, I wanted to let you have the lead

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,340
Nothing's really been on my mind or anything. It's a terrible actually everything in this world is not the way it seems

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,620
So I don't know what we could start. I mean, I was gonna say happy new year, but in relation to who?

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,900
So it's not it's uh, we talked a little bit about keeping the time what the calendars for

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,340
It's a memoir memorization of events. Yes, right

13
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,600
But the thing is, is it lawful? It's not done lawfully and it hasn't been for almost a thousand plus years if not more

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,140
what I call

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,720
affectionately or

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,220
Disaffectionately the Pope's work schedule is just that it's for powerful subjects and it's not lawful meaning

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,100
nothing natural nothing in creation

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Goes by that timekeeping other than the Pope subjects

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:41,140
Okay, so I mean there that's about as clear and succinct as it to I mean, I've got nothing against the Pope

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,620
I mean, it's all it's ridiculousness

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,720
If you put a pile of ridiculousness on one side and reality and lawfulness on the other

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,120
99 out of a hundred people will pick the ridiculousness

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,200
So who am I to say who what people are going to pick and choose, you know, but beyond making choices

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
what it is is

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
It's thoughtlessness

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,280
worthlessness and debased

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,199
Listen, it's lawlessness

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,840
So so how can people you know start?

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,360
Prejudicing

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,540
Their woes and their blame on certain groups, you know

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,240
I was having a conversation with someone recently about how the majority of the people on the alternative media and internet have fallen

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,320
for a bunch of nerds

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,580
that sit back and write up websites about Illuminati and

34
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:39,220
Certain individuals and certain agendas and they've got everyone in a tizzy where the basic the basic reality is we're here to

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,860
Prosper be healthful be healthy and

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,800
You do that through good company good food and good drink and hit the part of the conversation

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Which you might find funny or not is that these nerds that sat back, you know

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,200
It doesn't or two dozen years ago to write up all these conspiracies, which I'm not saying they don't exist

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,260
But to escalate them to the point as a focal point of interest and discussion

40
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,720
If you were to visit these nerds that wrote this up they couldn't even prepare a boiled egg for you

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,720
They're they're not very they're not very skilled at what it takes to be human. Mm-hmm. They probably couldn't help you fix your car

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,100
They probably don't know how to clean they probably don't even know how to dress

43
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:31,200
So, you know, this is what's going on and it's why because it's worthlessness that mankind chooses to be

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,380
occupied or preoccupied

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,760
with and

46
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:42,380
Hey to each his own, but what happens is when you're completely surrounded with it now to each his own becomes

47
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,400
To your own self. How do you separate yourself from it and still function? Yeah

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Where you seek prosperity healthfulness being healthy

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,740
Basically good food and good drink. I bringing this up because you know, we've reloaded Ocelli and the Greek and yesterday we

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Continued the food talk which I had done on uncommon-sense radio. It was basically about quality of food and other things like that

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,560
We might go back. I was suggested to do recipes and things

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,500
But this is a statement that rings true if you really think about it that good food and good drink promotes good character

53
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,560
Typically people that have good food, you know consumables and good good food and good drink

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,640
Tend to be a better character than those who don't

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Simple, you know, it's not an excuse. It's not a it's just a very simple observation that one can have, you know

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,540
If you look at people who don't know good food preparation don't mind what they put into their body

57
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't know if they call it in Australia junk food, you know, yep. Yep fast food

58
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:45,900
Macca's

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, yeah all those other things, you know not to bring up those brands

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,100
But but no harm done because this the the the corporate leaders of those companies will tell you you shouldn't be eating it anyway

61
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,940
So anyway, if you if you have a discussion and and really assess the character of individuals

62
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,820
you'll see that one of the things that you'll find is people of good character tend to mind what they put into their body and

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,860
Those that are poor character don't this is not a fact or the truth

64
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,580
But it's an interesting observation that one can let's say is part of the accumulation of what's going on here

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,920
So, I mean you can have a psychopathic killer who is a food connoisseur, too

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,560
You know, don't don't mistake it for an all be all whatever. But now what else do you put in your body is your thoughts?

67
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,240
you know you

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,100
You when you interact with people basically the way most interaction is done on international or distant level is

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,620
Digitally, let's say electronically sonically

70
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,760
When you interact with people through Skype or whatever

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,060
Chat rooms or whatever, you know, we're discussing the computer-based stuff right now

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,080
You you're not you're not only interacting with their character based on their what they consider to be important or what they put in their body

73
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,880
Topically or internally but also what information they take in

74
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,720
For example, you wouldn't believe how many people not many because I tend not to put myself out there but enough people

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Always are most likely let's say are sending me information for approval

76
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,900
Yep, it's like well, why can't you discern it yourself? Why does it matter what I think about it if it's a right or wrong?

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Are you asking me to give you fish or are you asking to learn how to fish, right?

78
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,260
so

79
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,280
I'll tell you just about everything that I'm sent from the outside in you know, the web-based stuff, you know everything from

80
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,040
Fukushima's gonna kill us all there's an old fool that goes around the internet

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,860
I'm not going to mention him by name and he and he's he's got a pretty good following which is good for him

82
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,760
but he there's a couple of old fools out there by the way that have been doing this for a long time and

83
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,080
No one holds their feet to the fire about when they say we're all gonna die very soon because of Fukushima

84
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,940
We're all gonna die. You ever notice that so I get a lot of this crap and I

85
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't know how to send it back or reply to people if you're looking for approval

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,160
That shows a deficiency of character when it comes to your ability to discern information

87
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
You see yep, yeah

88
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,820
Yeah, and that leads to gossip. It leads to Chinese whispers. It leads to that and that seems what people really like

89
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
No, that's fine

90
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:32,380
Does that refer back to the point like no one wants to take responsibility as well lack of responsibility for their own actions and decision-making

91
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,220
They want someone else to make the choice for them

92
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,640
Because I mean they're wanting approval from you so that they might consider you as a guru status

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,080
and therefore if you

94
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,820
Agree to what they're asking of you, then they're patting themselves on the back

95
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,020
So does that mean that as I said before about not want responsibility for the choices they make?

96
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,720
But you know and it's not even that it's whether

97
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,940
The issue of responsibility might be too high tiered for most people think about it for a moment

98
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,800
I think what they're trying to do is shed liability

99
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,400
There's a difference when you're responsible for something you take on a certain

100
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's say

101
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,080
Stance on how are you going to deal with something?

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,720
Another stance is who's going to be who's going to take the blame or who's going to be liable for something?

103
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,520
That's a much lower tier

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,540
Of accepting let's say the risk or the reward right and what you see other than people asking for approval

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,860
Is who is liable for this every returned on the mainstream TV, and they do a report

106
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,700
And they said we don't know who to blame for this yet

107
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,500
Well if you're gonna blame someone look in the mirror right if you're watching it

108
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,460
So so the thing is now it's not even forget about humanity is too far

109
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:54,100
Removed from anything practical or lawful to take responsibility for anything at this point all they do is shift liability

110
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,900
Which is who's going to get the blame and then again leads to the Chinese whispers and the gossiping and it just makes people rest

111
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,500
Better when they feel they can blame someone else for something that may not even exist, but they perceive as being negative

112
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,680
And you see this and this is nothing to really harp about

113
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,660
Because if you're going to look at it objectively

114
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,620
You could simply say this is part of the the human culture as part of human tradition

115
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,580
Part of the character of people right now, and it's very low tier very low level

116
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
And it's it's okay

117
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,420
It's okay, because that's how it is now

118
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,940
taking responsibility for oneself

119
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,880
Is different if you're mixed in with what's going on?

120
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,740
How do you how can you take responsibility when you're full of dirt?

121
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,660
You have to clean yourself up first you have to separate yourself set yourself apart

122
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,200
Right and then take responsibility that way yeah

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,780
You know how can people say what they say and do what they do

124
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,260
Regarding others when they don't even know how to position themselves amongst the muck you ask people

125
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,180
You know many things you know you hear people

126
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,260
Researchers and people pontificating on the internet, and they ever hear people use terms like oh, it's our government

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,940
Pay your taxes or our military our University our churches, man

128
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,800
That's a that is a very poor mindset when people say that because when you say it's our government our military our money our banks

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,500
Our whatever institution you are now taking the hit you are taking the liability for their crap

130
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,020
And it's very easy to establish that right now just about all actually

131
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,820
All of human institutions are either corrupt

132
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,700
miss

133
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,980
Misdirected or full of misinformation about all of them are I can't imagine one that isn't

134
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,520
That's that people know about whether you're talking about medical

135
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,760
social

136
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,740
Media judicial economic it's they're all in other words if you pull a common oaf from the street and ask him

137
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,680
Let's say what the judicial system about what he thinks

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,680
It's about is completely contrary to what's memorialized or written within the documents of how the judicial system functions

139
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,200
If you pull a common oaf off the street and ask him what the university system is about

140
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
What he'll tell you or she'll tell you is completely contrary to what the university trustees

141
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:27,000
Save the universities for the same with the medical system same with the government system same with all so right now

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,220
There is a huge disconnect and there has been for a very very long time, but it still exists right now

143
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,400
Was it designed that way to?

144
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,940
Yes

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,780
It was designed that way by de facto because whenever you're gonna present something to the public you have to accommodate the mindset

146
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,000
Which is a catch-22?

147
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,700
So all of these things accommodate the mindset right like I've heard recently had a discussion about the police state

148
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,760
It's impossible because the police are not really police. They're all freelancers. They're subcontractors. They're private agencies

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,180
They have nothing to do with the government

150
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,980
This has been ruled on many times over but your perception is different because everyone thinks their government

151
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,760
They even think they're government, but they're not if you look at the administrative policies and all that

152
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,920
That's why when a police officer gets in trouble anywhere in the world

153
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,740
They take his badge and his authority away and the his own bosses throw him under the bus

154
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,020
It's because the entire group can't take the liability because they're not what they say

155
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,660
They are right the same thing with the university professors the same thing with the doctors

156
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,520
What was the last time you heard of a doctor?

157
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,640
Getting in trouble whether he spoke out against something in conventional like vaccines or certain procedures or whether he was charged with negligence

158
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,400
When did you ever see all the other doctors stick up for him never?

159
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,220
What they do is they throw him under the bus?

160
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,020
Because what they're doing like again if you go to the universities

161
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,060
It's been very well documented that the university trustees those who run it

162
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,920
Basically tell you the purpose of the university is to produce good corporate workers

163
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,380
And it's a form of mind control in other words if you pass through the university with a degree it shows that you're trained a bull

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,680
Yeah, right. Yeah, and and they're not they're not there to teach you anything

165
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,420
They're there to see if they can instill a certain way of thinking

166
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,580
This is within but most people think that you're not educated if you go to university

167
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,780
I mean if you see even if you're just traveling down the street if you see university

168
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,800
You should go the other way even if you don't plan on attending it because it's such a negative place

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,160
so

170
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,000
In other words what right now and has been for a long time and the religious institutions are exactly the same all of the institutions

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Of mankind can be objectified this way now if you start discussing this with your common person

172
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,360
Let's say a man woman or young or old

173
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:49,060
They will think that you're being sarcastic. It's not true or whatever because they have a perception now. Let's go back to

174
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,940
What you said about it being designed this way?

175
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,020
You know if you're going to incorporate or present the public with anything you have to accommodate the mindset now

176
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,440
Here's the catch-22. Let's go for example

177
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,640
With the education system if you go to a society that is ignorant

178
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Can you present them with an institution that will give them knowledge no way?

179
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,320
Because it doesn't resonate with them because it doesn't accommodate the ignorant

180
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,020
So you have to create something that makes them feel better emotionally like oh if you go here you're educated

181
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:28,640
But you fill them with more ignorance because that's what they resonate with and that's what accommodates them as an ignorant society is accommodated with ignorance

182
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,040
So the university system is accommodating ignorant people. It's a catch-22

183
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,040
So it's not it's not a it's not an institution to make them more knowledgeable. It's just to give them more of what they already are

184
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Right. Otherwise, it wouldn't work

185
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,700
Yeah

186
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,280
If it really was giving knowledge the people in the society would go there and say I don't understand a damn thing

187
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
They're saying don't go there

188
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,160
It would close down in a year or two

189
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,760
But if you make it sound a certain way the same thing with the medical system if you have a sick society

190
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,040
you can't go in there and

191
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
reindoctrinate them and how to be healthy because

192
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,000
The reason why they're sick is of all their practices you're gonna have to take all their traditions and cultures and all their the way

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,460
They do commerce and all that stuff and flush it away and they won't do that

194
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,300
So what you do is you say we'll present you with better medicine, but the more but it actually makes you sicker

195
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,860
Because you cannot present a sick society medically sick, for example

196
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,080
with true medicine because

197
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,740
There is no such thing

198
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,760
In other words, the reason why people are sick is because of how they behave what they eat what they drink how they work how they rest

199
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,420
How they think

200
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,800
So what you do is, you know, it's already within human convention to have these society

201
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,920
Institutions in society and they just make it worse. And if you don't believe me

202
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,100
There's a lady who had done

203
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,060
Research on socialism and she found out that when in socialist countries when doctors go on strike the morgues are empty

204
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,460
People stop dying and when the doctors go back to work the morgues get full again

205
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,040
Think about that for a moment now the same with the religious institutions people think

206
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,120
You know

207
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,720
They get spiritual by going to a religious temple of any denominator of any type of religion and that couldn't be further from the truth

208
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
the best

209
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,340
Religious institutions on the planets and the biggest all they do is bring you closer to certain minor imps and demons that have been revived

210
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,400
from ancient Greece and ancient Babylon at best at best and

211
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Take you further away and further away from understanding how the society of the gods work completely

212
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:41,480
So they so if you want to be an expert in demonology go ahead and join either one of the 34,000 sects of Christianity

213
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,540
1,200 sects of Islam

214
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,620
400,000 sects of Hinduism. I mean they're all ready for you. They're ready to accept new members all of those religions are right

215
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,900
So you when you join those you become far removed from what is going on with the gods and

216
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,160
You'll probably be an expert in demonology of some sort

217
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,460
And this goes on and on and on and on give you another example

218
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,720
For example, let's say someone is doing research with spark plugs or sparkers or they call them I guess in England

219
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,220
you know, it's a fitment that goes into the motor provides a high voltage spark so the

220
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,660
Get ignition in the motor, right?

221
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,780
So let's say you design one, you know, basically spark plugs have not been

222
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,940
Changed much haven't changed much for about a hundred years

223
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,200
They were sort of standardized around what they call World War two because the military wanted a standard for all the thousands

224
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,940
If not millions of vehicles that were producing

225
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,580
So really hasn't changed since then. So if you simply reconfigure it and design it so it works

226
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,980
let's say twice as good as a regular spark plug and you

227
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,880
Encounter someone who is in the field

228
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,000
The first thing they'll tell you is that oh that doesn't mean much, you know, we can do that, too

229
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,200
And I'm like, well, then why don't you and they don't answer?

230
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,860
And then the next thing is you say well, you know when you configure the spark plug this way

231
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,300
You get less pollution less, you know toxic emissions and you know what their answer was their answer was well

232
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,060
You got to have some pollution. You got to have some toxic emissions

233
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,280
This is coming from people in your industry

234
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Right, yeah

235
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,380
Yeah, so I mean this sounds unbelievable. Yeah

236
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,580
Yeah, I mean yeah, you're talking this is someone who is in the industry

237
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,580
I mean in in a righteous world this person would should be taken out back and shot blindfolded, right?

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,920
Because they're promoting the opposite of what is beneficial to humankind and you will find this

239
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,760
Across the board pick any institution. I think there's something called the Tomcats registry which lists all industries

240
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,600
Like if you're in an industry you get that there's volumes of books now

241
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,720
That's electronic and it has any industry you can imagine in it

242
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,400
I think man engages in over 30,000 different industries right now and institutions

243
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,680
You can pick each one and if you have an objective mind

244
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:05,120
You can show how they're all not doing what people think they are but they're doing exactly what's memorialized in their administrative paperwork

245
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,580
Right, so no one is paying any attention. So

246
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
How do you do I mean how you know

247
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,100
How many times have you heard people pontificate an alternative media radio and written word?

248
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
they pick a subject and they pick a

249
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,820
Conspiracy notice I didn't say conspiracy theory because many conspiracies are just blatant, you know

250
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,660
Meaning, you know two or more coming together to do harm

251
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,740
and end injury

252
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,320
So how many times do they get this narrow-minded focus and make it their focus for weeks or months on end?

253
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,460
and then

254
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,780
They pick another topic and they start shouting about that

255
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:51,880
right and back and forth right and that sort of legitimizes what we just said because you can pretty much pick anything humans are

256
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,860
engaged in right now and

257
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,620
Become a quote-unquote harsh commentator on it do a website radio show or whatever and most of the time you will be true

258
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,500
but what's not true about what's being said is

259
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,680
that

260
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,720
There is a false

261
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,600
Hope and a false desire to change it. They think that if they fix this one thing

262
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,460
Oh if this individual on the international this international billionaire is arrested not going to mention his name

263
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,080
You might it starts with an s and it ends with an s

264
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,040
If this individual is arrested the world would be better. No

265
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,200
You know what? Wait a second. You still have attorneys down the street. You have a university and a medical doctor

266
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,600
No one is addressing that

267
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,540
You know, you ever look at all it's the Illuminati's

268
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,000
Illuminati's are gonna get us. Yeah. All right. So get rid of the Illuminati's you still got a doctor and an attorney and a church

269
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,700
down your street

270
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,440
You didn't change anything

271
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,420
It's what's going on in your locale. Just look at it that way

272
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,680
It's very toxic and it's accepted

273
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,200
You know, if you were visiting the earth and cataloging the characteristics and traits of things here

274
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,480
Let's say you go to a place called the rainforest

275
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,420
You'll find that there's a the most colorful frogs and insects and some plants are also the most dangerous

276
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,680
As if nature has set it up that way to let everyone and everything know look

277
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,540
It's so beautiful and colorful for a reason right now

278
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:26,060
If you go into where most humans get their food in urban environments, you'll find that the most colorful packaging

279
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,540
that they offer for sale is the children's food and

280
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:38,240
If you can concur or anyone can if you look at what's in that children's food, it also happens to be the most what?

281
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,180
Toxic sugar most toxic. Yeah. Yeah, so you see how things are in accordance with each other whether you're in the rainforest or at the shops

282
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,420
There's this underlying thing. That's very easy to see that follows through, right?

283
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,200
So, you know and then he just to tie it in, you know, this is this is not a rant or anything

284
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,180
But when you start studying

285
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:07,300
Objectively that humankind has been obsessed with human sacrifice and the destruction of children for thousands of years and it hasn't changed today

286
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,760
It's just not in the forward-thinking

287
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,940
aspect of people's conversation

288
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,000
It still exists today

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,060
You know

290
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:21,380
if you start piecing it all together you have people that on the planet that essentially always will pick the worst if it's

291
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,440
If it's packaged as being just good

292
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,940
And also are heavily involved all of their traditions holidays and religions and stuff on the under undertone is

293
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,080
About human sacrifice particularly that of children

294
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,160
What would you say about a society like this can you say we have to make the world a better place

295
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,860
Are you joking? It needs to be scraped and redone. Yeah, there's nothing to fix

296
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,340
So what I'm actually viewing the world in from this

297
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,580
Glasses that I'm looking through now the way you're describing it. It's like it's oh, it's one

298
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,240
It's obvious like it seems obvious like it's run under my nose and I haven't even seen it

299
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,140
But two it's like you can't sort of fix something

300
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,280
To make it better because it just wouldn't work. It seems like it needs to be like another flood needs to happen

301
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,520
It's just kind of

302
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,160
Right, right. It's it's gotten to the point where I've seen you've perhaps heard me say it's unrehabilitate able

303
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,300
Yeah, now it's just because something can't be fixed. It doesn't mean you have to discard it right away

304
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,380
You can still keep it around as a paperweight or just to take up space and that's exactly what's going on right now

305
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,100
And mankind will not do it right now

306
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,360
They've mankind has fallen for everything the gods are in control. The gods are going to do it

307
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,740
They're going to clean it up and they're going to use nature to clean it up

308
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:45,220
And I was discussing this with someone recently and they said well, what do you mean nature? I'm like, okay again

309
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,940
Do you know the remember the analogy?

310
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,060
I just gave about the bright colored creatures in the rainforest and the bright colored

311
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,920
Food that man prepares for children is or boasts the most toxic both the most toxic

312
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,960
Look at look at this when I proposed if you understand prophecy of all culture

313
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,620
the gods will use nature to take care of it and clean up the earth and

314
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:09,300
Fix, you know get rid of most of mankind so they can get a limited gene pool to start with again

315
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,160
They're going to use nature and this person didn't see it and I said well look

316
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,540
If if one countries or one group of humans are going to go to war with another group of humans

317
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:26,140
They also use nature to do it and they and I gave them the full complete analogies. I'll give it here. Okay Rodrigo

318
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,220
let's say Australia is going to go to war with Chile and

319
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,240
The first thing they do is they want to build airplanes. Let's say what do they do?

320
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,360
Don't they go out and have to need a bunch of aluminium?

321
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,260
Where and where do they get the aluminium isn't it? Don't you have to mine bauxite and

322
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,140
Refine it to aluminum from the earth and then mold it and shape it and engineer it into an airplane

323
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,180
right if you're going to make a rifle aren't you going to mine iron and

324
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,200
Cast it and machine it into the form of a barrel and maybe make the stock out of wood

325
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,020
You know the stock of the rifle that you make out of wood from a tree

326
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:10,480
Maybe if you make it out of plastic, don't you have to refine the the crude petroleum into plastics?

327
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,180
So in order if you're going to make a spear or an arrow or a crossbow

328
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,060
Don't you have to get those materials from nature?

329
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,720
Yeah, you see the analogy see how it's complete

330
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,560
Can you show me anything that mankind uses to go to war that they haven't gotten from nature?

331
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,400
No other than their mind on how to do it so this is a strategy and the tactics are different now

332
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,380
So the gods are going to use nature and like I've mentioned there's going to be three major kill shots

333
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
There's actually more than that

334
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:48,440
but the basically two strikes upon the earth what you call asteroids and the other one is going to be a major solar event and

335
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,560
And then the rest of it's going to there are about seven major events

336
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,320
There's going to be some major events when certain laws are instilled the people will will be

337
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,700
doing a fine job of

338
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,180
Eliminating each other and it won't be some dictatorship or police coming and doing and the people will do it themselves

339
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,200
You know family members to each other and all of this we will discuss more detail

340
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,180
Maybe in the next year or two on that because right now it just doesn't quite make sense to most

341
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,340
But let's just refrain from saying that you know

342
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,720
The people that come and listen to these types of sonic events, they've really got their shit together. I'll use that term

343
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,220
Fortunately there aren't too many people that come across that are

344
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:42,460
Trying to profess how wonderful a life of baselessness is right many people that come to these sonic events and listen

345
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,220
I'll be a few

346
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's say several scores of people they tend to be thinking men and women they tend to be people who let's say

347
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,900
Are looking for substance or looking for things to measure other things by instead of this?

348
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,880
He said she said let's just hope for the best you know kind of thing right yeah

349
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,600
So it is fortunate

350
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,440
And I do feel fortunate that when I put out sonic events the people that are typically attracted to it are substantive

351
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:18,440
They are looking for lawfulness. They are looking for substance. They are looking for reference points you see so

352
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,640
The from that point of view still I think many things cannot be discussed at this point in great detail

353
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:32,240
For example I had someone that you know I won't mention by name as well. They came to me very excited about several weeks ago

354
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Speaking to someone else that you know of and saying that you know the Greek is right the Greek everything has been saying is coming

355
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Along and I was kind of glad to hear that because it's kind of like confirmation

356
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,940
You know that other people are seeing it and I asked this individual

357
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,060
You know you got into this conversation about how what the Greek said was right, and it's coming around

358
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,240
What was it he'd give and this person couldn't give me any specifics on anything you can't

359
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,620
So what does that mean so that means do we disregard the entire thing?

360
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,780
You sort of have to because they didn't they didn't come back validating with any substance or any references

361
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,460
So but emotionally made you feel good, right?

362
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,460
Like if someone said hey Rodrigo's right about what he said a year or two ago

363
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,000
And and then you go and ask them well, what was it specifically and they don't know well

364
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,420
You have to discard it because it made you even though it made you feel

365
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:28,360
Really good at the moment because it's like wow you know it's like. I'm actually it's like payment for what I'm doing right

366
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,140
Yeah, it's like you know people appreciating it not just liking it and then when you go to them to for them to validate

367
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,400
You know let's give you some substance behind it. They can't you must discard it because it's purely emotional crap

368
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,900
And

369
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:48,780
That's what you're getting right now. There's plenty of old guys young guys popular guys not so popular guys

370
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,260
Millions on the wet on the internet can I say millions perhaps?

371
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,200
That are pontificating all of these things and when you start looking into it guess what?

372
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,500
Very little substance and even even if there is substance. They don't know how to handle it lawfully

373
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:13,820
They don't know the lawful approach, and they and and what's their reward it when they become overzealous like they push too hard

374
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,680
You've heard of people getting very adamant about certain beliefs that they have on online and

375
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,740
They push too hard and that seems like you know very narrow-mindedness

376
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,660
If you push too hard, and you're overzealous about anything especially if it's unlawful or unfounded or on or baseless

377
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,060
You're going to be rewarded with error

378
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,400
You're going to find yourself tripping on things

379
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,640
Are you going to be and I've seen this over and over and over you find it a lot in these alternative religious groups?

380
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,820
that I think that they're going back and

381
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,980
Giving a true interpretation of the bible and they spin off and they're mixing all these pagan concepts

382
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,500
And what happens they fall apart in a year or two you've heard of that, right?

383
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,140
So because they're they're trying too hard if you try to go with maybe haste makes waste

384
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,780
Is that another way to say it if you're doing it too fast, right? Yep?

385
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,120
And and also if they if they don't understand timing there's a right time for everything especially information

386
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,540
So anyway, I've been kind of long-winded there

387
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,860
Give us it gives a little bit of

388
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,400
Rodrigo speak in the meantime

389
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Now I was just thinking about

390
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,420
When you were talking about the institutions on how they're not

391
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,380
What they're doing is not the way that it's perceived by the general consensus of the population

392
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,980
It's it's they're giving you more of the wrong stuff rather than the right stuff

393
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:44,000
And what bothers me is that you said that child sacrifices that you they're still happening to this day, right?

394
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm just one wanting to know what is in the mindset of these people that actually go and do it. Are they

395
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,720
worshipping some sort of input demon themselves or

396
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,280
It seems like it's gone underground in the last

397
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,760
You know thousand years or so

398
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,780
And yeah, what the world is perceiving as this bright rainbow, you know pot of gold at the end of the rainbow like this nice

399
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,440
Utopian society is actually being run by something a little bit more sinister

400
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,860
But I want to know what why it is that way

401
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:29,620
It's I did I did explain it several times recently if you like I can go through it again very quickly

402
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:37,400
It also you have to tie that in with the what's considered to be gynecophilic symbols

403
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,700
Or have you heard how there's architecture of the human genitalia and churches and spires and and you see that being used?

404
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,160
Even in what's called Disney. They used to actually outwardly show

405
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,720
Pornographic scenes

406
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,760
Yeah, they're they're obsessed with that but also, you know

407
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,000
it's not we're not really putting a certain group of people on the hook because the majority of the people feel good when they do a

408
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,220
birthday cake celebration and

409
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:11,000
Whether they know it or not that celebration is a parody of the human sacrifice. Also, so

410
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,580
you know

411
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,280
if you start

412
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,700
Pushing the issue of that you're now you're getting in between

413
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,300
Someone and what makes them happy and you're gonna have a fight if that happens, right?

414
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,920
Yeah, like if you ever interrupt someone while they're doing something that brought them joy. Yeah, they don't they want to get back to it

415
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,960
as soon as possible and

416
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,560
but if you push the issue they want to bring violence on you, so

417
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,940
that's the same thing with

418
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,500
The majority of cultures right now. They're engaged. They don't know it

419
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,740
Just because you don't know it doesn't mean that you're off the hook you're still not taking liability for it, right?

420
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,000
But where it started very simply is this and this is a I

421
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,760
Hmm how would you say this? I've changed the world I've changed

422
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,160
Not the world my worldview

423
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,820
But I've changed the way I describe things about the worldview and many of the things that I've been speaking about in the past few

424
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,860
Months publicly, let's say even conversations like this if you put a gun to my head a year ago

425
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,160
I said, there's no way I'm gonna say that but now I've changed the mind about that mindset and said

426
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,520
You know what? Screw it might as well, right?

427
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,280
Because you just never know

428
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,400
You know who it's going to affect and who's going to take the ball and roll with it a little bit further

429
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,680
And this is one of the things that I've always kept close not to discuss

430
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,620
Why because it took about 10 years of study to do that

431
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,420
So imagine you went deep sea deep sea diving for 10 years Rodrigo and you finally found a treasure

432
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,480
Would you start giving all that treasure away to just anybody?

433
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,340
No, you should get something for it, you know, I mean it's it's treasure, you know

434
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:59,980
I mean, you just don't hand it out like candy to just anybody they especially faceless anonymous people on a sonic event, right?

435
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,640
So but I've just I've changed the mind about that and this is one of the things and this is not the you know

436
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,300
The deepest part of it. Let's just go on a cursory part and keep going on that. What is human sacrifice and why it's very

437
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,860
Have you ever heard me say how savagery has been legitimized?

438
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,159
Okay, well think about that term what is savagery and what is lit legitimizing something

439
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,860
Just set the two together

440
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, but yeah and you could look up those words so right now you're in a society where things that are just

441
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,679
Appalling a moral unlawful are considered the norm not by certain groups in high ivory castles

442
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,800
But the irregular people, you know the population at large on the planet

443
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,420
Western Eastern Northern and Southern

444
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,739
But let's go back to why you asked about the human sacrifice

445
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,360
And this is an answer that can be given and believe it or not

446
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,500
I've said this with you at least once before and maybe two or three times on other sonic things

447
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,620
But we'll go over it again. And the reason I said that it's very important

448
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:11,200
I've noticed that what the deeper the subject matter gets and the truer it is the less tendency people have to remember it

449
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,940
Isn't that funny really?

450
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,220
Yeah, and that ties in with what I've discussed as cosmic censorship, yeah

451
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,560
Do you remember the movie men in black, you know, and after you saw the event thing

452
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,740
They say everybody look here and they flashed a little red thing and yes, they plant they plant a new memory in your head, right?

453
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,360
It's I found there's a phenomenon when I start discussing the nature of things people say hmm

454
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,820
That's great

455
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,740
And then when we change the subject go to the next thing it all gets washed away and even if they go back and listen

456
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,080
To it over and over again

457
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,100
They still can't remember it. I just find it to be

458
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,100
Kind of cutesy

459
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,560
Because the gods do have a sense of humor that way, you know what I mean

460
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,440
It's kind of a very juvenile way of affecting the mind from the divine level and I appreciate it

461
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,980
Not not that I appreciate it. I appreciate noticing it

462
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,300
But I don't appreciate it because it gets

463
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,400
Frustrating when you explain things to people and they and they ask you to explain it and you're like, wait a second

464
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,720
We explained this already. So after this long-winded bill, let's get let's cut to the chase

465
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,520
Years ago and really whether it's

466
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,380
religious philosophical or contemplative

467
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,420
We're talking ancient societies

468
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,040
They had people that were inspired by angelic beings demonic beings and minor gods and all these things

469
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,300
to be supported and to delve in things in matters of the mind or the spirit and

470
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,580
It's also stated in some of the holy writs of the world

471
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,000
That the human body from its physical side

472
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:53,020
Is very limited where the spiritual side is almost unlimited, right, you know a person's mind or spirituality has no limits when you think about it

473
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,920
But the physical is limited and we look at it as a container it's basically it's a heart structure of

474
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,820
skeleton wrapped in muscle

475
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,680
Containing organ and the whole thing is wrapped in a slight vacuum with skin

476
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,180
And you have protrusions of organs and ears and or things like that and it's very finite, you know

477
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,420
it can be defined and

478
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,460
amongst the definition of the human body

479
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,460
Amongst the organ functions. They said well, you know, there are certain organs that are most important and

480
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,300
the way they were deemed most important because those were the organs that human the progression and

481
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,580
The posterity and the continuance of humankind relied on and what organs would they be?

482
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,320
the genitalia

483
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,440
Because if you've removed everyone's genitalia in 40 years, there won't be anybody left

484
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,560
right

485
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:52,880
Just like a farmer. We've remember the analogy of the farmer the reason you farm to go to commerce and to produce food that you need

486
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,080
But also it's important to save some seed stock because if you don't have seed stock your farming career is over in a year

487
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,620
Now sans purchasing like did he say?

488
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,120
Well, you can buy seats, but the person that you're buying seats from also had to save them somehow, right?

489
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,140
So where's the seed of humanity held?

490
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,980
Well, it's the organs that are beneath, you know that lower part of the body

491
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,040
you know where you want to get into the testicles and the ovum and the sperm and the fluids and the you know,

492
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,600
Prostate and the fallopian tubes you get the picture right? There's an entire complex there. That is

493
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,520
And now we're just talking about the carnal side the material side and the ejection of fluids and all that

494
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,420
We're not talking about the desire part. We're just talking about the physical part, right?

495
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,560
so

496
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,320
They considered the human or the most important part of the human body not necessarily for

497
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,580
You to function because guess what? If you remove the lungs, you're not going to live that long

498
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:54,440
If you remove the heart, you're not going to live on those are very important to at the moment very important, right?

499
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,580
But in order what is most important is that humanity continues?

500
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:05,780
Have you heard the term the species must continue, you know how some their sacrifices even animals do so the young survive and all that

501
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,840
You've seen it

502
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,240
Memorialized and romanticized in Hollywood, you know, I'll give up my life so you can continue

503
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,120
why they there's a sense of

504
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,840
Continuance that that needs to be propagated spiritually and the way that is done again is through the genitalia

505
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,540
male and female man and woman and

506
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:33,140
Because they were considered so important what they did is they memorialized the through iconography through imagery through symbolic

507
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,960
representation and through architecture

508
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,580
The gynec symbol meaning the woman's

509
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,600
Genitalia and the phallic symbol meaning the man's

510
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,640
Genitalia in architecture iconography art pattern work. You've seen it all around, right?

511
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,160
Like for example, most of your traditional church doors

512
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,540
The door has that almond shape that is walking through the gynec symbol

513
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:02,220
Yeah, right once and above it you usually have a round window which symbolizes the rear view of a woman

514
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,160
Because the rear view of a woman would be the genitalia below and the anus above

515
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,540
now if you now if you'll see that persona or actually

516
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,220
Manifest in most of what's called your Western Christian architecture

517
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,600
right

518
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,620
Pretty pretty fascinating when you let that sink in let's not even get into more of that

519
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:30,160
Right, and the only reason why is it because if you brought someone back from two or three thousand years ago to a modern Western

520
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,080
City or village or town or whatever and when they walk through the area

521
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,520
They said I didn't know you had a sex temple in your neighborhood and guess what building they would be pointing to

522
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,260
Yes, and there's no reason I can get I can bury you with the details on that but why

523
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,380
So right now we see how it was decided from the spiritual perspective them

524
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,760
It's very important for a species or a group to continue

525
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,480
Multiple generation and that it and the the physical part that that allows that to happen is the genitalia

526
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,000
And that is the sole reason why you see the genitalia. I'm repeating myself. It's kind of redundant, but it's important to say it again

527
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,300
You see that manifest in architecture pattern work art iconography. I guess work, you know, you name it right Rodrigo

528
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,800
You've seen those symbols especially in the art and and it's censored as well because you don't think about that when you see it everywhere

529
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,780
It's sort of like it's everyday thing and it's like that. Okay, whatever. It's just architecture and it has no relevance or anything

530
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,380
But now that you're bringing it up and sort of thing. Wow, the world is inundated with this everywhere

531
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,800
Yeah, and because of the prudent nature of many mainstream religions

532
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,400
They a lot of filmmakers can't show let's say

533
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,380
If there's a sci-fi film and an alien is going to come out of an egg

534
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,900
They have to they can't make it you can't look gynec because they say well if we show this movie in a Catholic country

535
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,360
It's too prudent. They're gonna cut the scene out because it looks like a woman's vagina, you know

536
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:04,840
So that's still considered and the reason why you have that prudence that prudence not prudence, but prudish this

537
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,400
you know subverting the

538
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,600
The erotic or subverting the genitalia is because it's done traditionally because the the people that were in those institutions traditionally

539
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,320
They considered this to be very high occult knowledge

540
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:26,280
And if people acknowledge these things everywhere they would question it and then eventually they would discover that's why they're doing it

541
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,500
So there's no reason you look if it's considered a high occult secret

542
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,600
What a better place to do it on a minor conversation that might be published on YouTube

543
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,800
I can't think of a better place, right? So and also other sonic events

544
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,280
Yeah, now, how does the child how does this fit into child sacrifice? Well, what is the product of?

545
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,080
Genitalia

546
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,620
Population

547
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,200
After nine months the child. Okay. Now now the new child represents a new generation

548
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,380
limitless potential spiritually

549
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,460
Right anything that child can do anything that they still tell you Pete in a lot of Western societies

550
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,400
They still if you're in a non-feudal non-caste system

551
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
They still tell children you can be anything you want. You can do anything you want when you grow up

552
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,820
How many times have you heard that said right in feudal and caste systems?

553
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,460
They don't if you're born in a certain system like as a slave or a serf you can't marry out of it

554
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,160
You can't travel out of it either, right?

555
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,820
so and by the way, that's how they are anyway today and they don't realize it, but

556
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,360
Okay, let's now the child is the product of that now when people

557
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,700
It's very easy and very clear to see that all the religions of the world the major ones

558
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,800
Especially are nothing more than demonology what they've done is revived ancient pagan gods minor imps and demons

559
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,400
Now it doesn't matter how much you cry about you think you believe in some holy book that you they're putting in front of you

560
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,040
You know nothing in that book

561
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,980
In any religion and that's easy to prove

562
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,880
If anyone has what I'm saying in doubt

563
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,660
Go pick any holy writ of the world any of the major religions and study it a little bit and then go find someone who

564
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,160
Professes to believe in that religion and question him and quiz them a little bit about it

565
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,520
And then you'll see they will know absolutely nothing about it

566
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,200
It's a phenomenon it's an incredible phenomenon

567
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:21,150
It's all it's almost this cannot happen with rational people. It can only happen when people are under the influence of

568
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,540
something else

569
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,580
Okay, let's put that aside

570
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,220
when you look at the people's interaction with these imps and demons that

571
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,540
Have you heard of bringing a sacrifice to a god? Yes, right. They demand it sacrifices

572
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,940
Would do you bring yesterday's leftover supper to a god as an offering or your old shoes

573
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,440
Or do you bring him the best of your stuff?

574
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,140
Yes, so we just

575
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,340
Discussed what was the most important organ and what is the product of it?

576
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,640
What is the product of the most important organ that and it's that's been used in symbology and also in your architecture

577
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,600
What is the product of those organs?

578
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,440
And what so wouldn't the child be the product of the best of the best and wouldn't then the child be the best of

579
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,180
The best of the best. Yes

580
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,120
Do you see how this has been rationalized for thousands of years and I'm as far as I know

581
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,240
I'm the only one that's broken it down. I could have broken I've usually

582
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,960
Break it down in less than two minutes, but we've taken about 15 here to be redundant deliberately

583
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,420
Don't do you see how it all ties in together?

584
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,360
Yes, I do and I'm not I'm not this is not reading into it this is

585
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,300
This is actually what's occurring and for this is what's been occurring and it's become tradition now

586
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,520
So they're sacrificing to

587
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,940
Lower imps of demons or higher beings of some sort. Yeah, though

588
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,980
Well, they're higher than the lowest infant demon is higher than any human

589
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,140
Yeah, because they have the ability to go into the spiritual realm. Well, you don't yeah

590
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,920
They can manifest things that you can't right. Do you remember the genie in the bottle give me three wishes, right?

591
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,560
That that that creature was able to manifest your wishes in physical reality. Think about it

592
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah

593
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,440
so

594
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,440
And that by the way, that's a corruption of the jinn in them

595
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,760
another

596
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,520
Tradition. Yes. Yeah

597
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,360
so

598
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,700
This is this is not this is the level of insanity

599
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,040
like

600
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,620
Wolfgang Goethe said you need not visit an insane asylum to meet disordered spirits because the earth is

601
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,840
The insane asylum of the universe

602
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,880
So if you're born here, you're in deep shit

603
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,480
If you recall reading any of the Holy Writs, they tell you it's better to not have been born here

604
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,100
But the gods don't act in futility if you have been born here and come through here you will be rewarded for such

605
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,800
Well, you'll see later there, you know, you could look at all your you know for such an action in other words becoming here

606
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,340
There's a lot of information that we don't get about why mankind is here why he is the way he is

607
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,640
Well, we do get a little bit about it or enough. Let's say to satisfy and in someone inquiring

608
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,100
Well, we really don't have the full picture

609
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:29,180
You see of everything and that's because we're limited in maturity. You understand the concept

610
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,080
Yeah, well we have so very juvenile spiritually like for example

611
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,600
You can think of all the things that can be talked about in all forms of knowledge

612
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,800
And you have to look at who you're going to speak to about it

613
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,760
Like for example, if you have a four-year-old child

614
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,300
You cannot just pick any subject you want to speak on and speak to them about it

615
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,560
You probably could but they might lack the maturity

616
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,980
To further it right, you know, like if you were you have to go down to their level and give them a little bit extra

617
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,120
And then a little bit extra a little bit extra so that they grow. Yeah, you can't give them

618
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:04,960
Sure

619
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,240
You know, like if you lecture on astrophysics to a bunch of five-year-olds

620
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:17,380
They're all quiet after an hour you say any questions and they all raise their hand and they all ask do you have any candy?

621
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,880
right

622
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,840
And this is exactly what you hear going on in alternative media, by the way

623
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,240
yes, so

624
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,540
Yeah, and by the way, one of the unfortunate things that you will find in culture is the kids culture

625
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,880
You know the little goats, of course

626
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:42,060
They've created a subculture within the culture for children. They have children's television children's movies children's books

627
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,600
Children's clothing

628
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,940
Specifically, you know patterned a certain way for children, right?

629
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,920
And I don't mean that you should put a child in a large size adult clothing

630
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,640
I mean you should be fit to their body, but

631
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:00,540
the children's foods children music children this that is a big disservice because

632
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,420
they do not provide a

633
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:08,280
Transition period from childhood to adult they think they do but it's very corrupt and very negative

634
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,120
Yeah, it's like a jumpstart like jumping over a huge ravine to get to from childhood to adult with this

635
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:21,840
Yeah, and that creates a dysfunctional but that was said 300 years ago Goethe he says, you know

636
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,780
This is the if you're this is an insane asylum if you're living in an insane asylum

637
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,500
Who's to say what's right or wrong? Just give it two minutes the entire concept of right and wrong will change

638
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,480
In an insane asylum

639
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,260
Yeah, and the thing about being in an insane asylum if you visit one they have like certain days where you have a visitor's day

640
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:40,720
and

641
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,540
The ones that are not dangerous

642
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,980
They let them out into the open area and you know family and friends come and greet, you know

643
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,820
But there's several of them that don't get visitors, right?

644
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,500
so you go into one of these on visitors day and sit down to some of some of the people that are locked up in

645
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,540
There and you sit down and have a conversation the first few minutes to say I don't understand why this person is here

646
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,680
They seem very rational very thoughtful

647
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,720
But you continue for another three or four minutes and then you'll be like, okay now I know why you're here

648
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,520
Because you just fell apart

649
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,700
Right. Yeah, and you know, of course this doesn't this is just a metaphor because

650
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:26,300
these things these institutions prisons insane asylums hospitals are also used to buffer down those that

651
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,500
Are not towing the line whether it's political religious or philosophical, right?

652
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,960
How many times you've heard people going to what's called the judicial the judge?

653
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,480
Courts which are based on justicia the goddess religion and if you start bringing up law to the judge

654
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,380
He wants you to have psyche vow on you, right psychologically evaluated, right? Because you must be crazy

655
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,160
I mean everyone else is believing this. Why aren't you?

656
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,900
It's a very harsh tool. And by the way, whenever you see the PSY prefix

657
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,360
That means spirit. Yes

658
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,720
So it's funny to see how ignorant these people are if you go to a psychiatrist or psychologist

659
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:10,840
You just ask them what they do and the minute they profess anything with the PSY prefix. They also you're a spiritualist and watch what happens

660
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,900
They don't know what the hell they're talking about and they don't want to either so anyway

661
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,780
There's the other one there's PSY and then there's PS honor

662
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,720
Well the PN well the PSY means mind or spirit. It's the same thing. Yeah

663
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,620
Now in other cultures, it's the it's a rook like a rook

664
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,280
Okay, or rook

665
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,840
In in ancient Egyptian. It was the rook in Hebrew. It's a ruach in Arabic is rook. That means spirit

666
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,420
So but the soul I think you're referring to that's the PNU

667
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,500
PNU whenever you see PNU like pneumatic and pneumonia is silent the PSI

668
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,920
Pneumonia pneumatic that has to do with the movement of air. The soul has to do with the movement of air

669
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:03,440
The soul is interchangeable if you're breathing like if you have a dog a frog a fly

670
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,440
Elephant or a gorilla and yourself in the room

671
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,740
All of your souls are interchangeable. How do we know?

672
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,540
Because you're all breathing the same air. Yeah, if if the if the

673
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:22,900
If the elephant got arrhythmia and fell on the floor and stopped breathing you could try to administer resuscitation to the elephant, right?

674
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,380
And you could bring it back by putting your soul into its body, right?

675
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,960
And if it starts breathing on its own now it has its own soul

676
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,920
But in the while it's not breathing you're putting your soul is it so in other words, what's interesting?

677
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,420
You know how we started off how the things are not what people think they are

678
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,420
But they're self-professed

679
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,400
You know, we brought up the police the university and all that

680
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,860
If you ask anyone who's let's say a spiritual person or a contemplative person

681
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,400
Someone who says they're educated or ask them to define spirit and soul watch how they unravel

682
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:05,360
Yeah, and yet it's their self they're easy to define but they will go they'll give you a million reasons why it can't be

683
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,180
Defined but they will never go to see what the definitions are

684
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,460
They can't why because they're all put together like cheap sweaters and you know

685
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:20,040
One of the characteristics of a cheap sweater is that if you get a cheap sweater or a cheaply knit or crocheted garment

686
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,360
If you find a loose thread

687
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,800
All you have to do is pull on it and keep pulling on that one thread and what do you think happens to the entire?

688
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,900
Garbage, yeah

689
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,020
Yes, so when you run into these people that allege themselves to be

690
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,040
spiritual awake

691
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,860
Whatever psychic. I love those guys

692
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,080
I

693
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,940
Asked them to define spirit and soul and keep just stay on that point and in five minutes

694
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,980
there'll be nothing but a ball of yarn or a pile of yarn on the floor or

695
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,280
If you're in present if you're presently with them and if you look at their face

696
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,760
They they start to put on an expression like they want to bring physical harm to you. Now. Welcome to planet Earth

697
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,260
if you're if you're

698
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,160
Spiritualists your psychics and those that say I'm awake. I'm contemplative. I'm educated

699
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,400
Can be pulled apart like a cheap sweater, where does that leave the common man?

700
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,740
If those that profess to have exceptional talent and cannot back it up with anything

701
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,120
What does that leave those who say they don't have any they're not exception

702
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:28,380
Actually, it is. Yeah, it's even worse. But on the other hand, it's wide open for them is yes

703
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,340
It allows them to

704
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,300
Fit right in if they explore. Yeah

705
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,620
Well, it allows them to allows them to notice that there's that person that said they were exceptional advanced awake

706
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,260
Spiritual was nothing but a pile of crap

707
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:48,180
You know those gurus those teachers and I'm not saying some of them I'm saying just about all of them because you know what

708
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,520
If I have come across anyone who was really close to that position, I'm not saying I am in terms of being psychic

709
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:05,320
I would I would give their name. I would suggest go to the go seek them. I would I would not fully endorse them

710
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:11,380
Let's say unless I knew them. Well, but I would say go seek this person. I

711
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,080
Haven't found any

712
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,160
This is really a sad situation

713
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,160
So the thing is to be have you ever heard of the term being self-sufficient

714
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,500
Yes, what does that mean? You have to operate? You have to have you have to be able to be self-sufficient?

715
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,060
Everything that you need in some

716
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,420
Level not an abundance and not in want

717
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,740
You have to be efficient with it

718
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,660
And you have to know you have to be skilled with it to be self-sufficient, right?

719
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,740
So whether it's a matter of health whether a matter of knowledge education whether a matter of spirituality

720
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,060
spirituality or a psychiatry or anything

721
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:54,980
Isn't it? How do you feel if we say Rodrigo the people should be self-sufficient? I

722
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,440
Think that's a very good

723
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,840
advisory statement to make to anyone

724
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:08,440
Yeah, but based but based on the conditions that we described it is most prudent to be so

725
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,120
because if you go to a doctor you're not going to get much help if you go to a psychiatrist like any or a

726
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,360
Priest or an imam or a rabbi or a university education or even getting your car fixed

727
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,520
Because all of them think good enough is what they should be doing and you know what?

728
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,060
Think about it this way. Could good enough be the enemy of perfection?

729
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,980
Yes, yes because it leaves you like giving up and not wanting to attain perfection

730
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,200
Yeah

731
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,920
So I mean if anything the gods were considered perfection in comparison to us

732
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,580
It'd be like looking at a scum

733
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,100
looking at humanity

734
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,880
Right. That's why when you read a lot of the holy writs of the world nine out of ten times humans are described as such

735
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,520
That's no mystery now, is it?

736
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,080
Yeah, that's why you're only only 5% of the population is going to be here in the next two decades

737
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,600
Then I'm not say this is not a fear porn or scare tactic or anything like that because I tell people you people that

738
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,820
People that say they know the truth or they're looking for the truth or really not because if you're really

739
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,980
Discovering the truth you will probably lock yourself into a room and cry for a week and wish you were never born

740
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,440
So don't look for the truth folks unless you have the intestinal fortitude to do so

741
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,880
But on the other hand that's reverse psychology, right

742
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,320
Look if you're nine years old, you know, yeah, you've been around, you know when they have these family gatherings and

743
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:56,260
You have all the multiple generations from the young children the adolescents the parents the aunts the uncles and the grandma great-grandma sitting around for a

744
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:00,520
Feast or get together. You've heard of such things perhaps maybe have attended some yourself

745
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:08,700
And they go around sometimes and ask the children what they would like, you know after they're done, you know, whatever and

746
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,220
Imagine they go across to a nine-year-old child and said what would you like to get out of life?

747
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:18,360
And you say for example, I'd like to know what the truth is and auntie

748
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:23,620
Daddy, mommy and grandma take you to the other room and smack you around and say never ask that question again

749
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,980
Well, that means it's something very important and that's all you should be doing

750
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,820
Yeah, yeah, I mean I remember the age of 21

751
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,740
And the only thing that I asked myself I want to know the truth about everything and I realized that was a big ask

752
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:52,080
Because the more that I find out the more that I the more that I don't know then I realize it's actually

753
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:53,980
forever

754
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,900
Because even though I have

755
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,260
Minutely gone a little bit of truth since the edge 21 to now 37. I know there's a lot more that is hidden

756
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,620
To know to want to find out more if you don't remain like there's a lot more than I know that I don't know

757
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,600
Well, well, let's let's look let's look, you know, how we mentioned being self-sufficient consider this one of the holy writs of the world states that

758
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,600
If you want to pursue the truth, I'm saying I'm paraphrasing here

759
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,560
There are three qualities you have to have

760
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:32,280
And they're actually bestowed upon you like wisdom, you know, you can get all the knowledge you want, but wisdom is given right?

761
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah, there's a there's a goddess

762
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,640
Behind that and she's a benevolent one

763
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,860
Just keep that in mind

764
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,080
Three things that in one of the holy writs of the world. We call the scriptures

765
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:50,340
I'm paraphrasing here when in order to delve in the matter we call truth Alif. Yeah or Emmett in different languages

766
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,740
Or love it's not right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes to

767
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,360
There are three qualities one of them is you have to have exceptional memory

768
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,040
You have to be able to bring things to recall

769
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,840
the other thing is

770
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:13,920
You have to have knowledge into all things and the other thing is you have to have knowledge of things to come

771
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:15,900
Right

772
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,940
Those are the three characteristics. I'm going to name them again

773
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:23,920
One is be able to bring things to recall which means memory

774
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,100
The other thing is knowledge into all things

775
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,160
And the other thing is things to come when you think of a let's say a good engineer

776
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,580
for example

777
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:42,820
Let's say a structural engineer civil engineer designing a bridge what makes him very good. He has those three characteristics

778
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,300
He remembers all of the engineering concepts principles

779
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,000
right

780
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:48,860
He

781
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,960
He has knowledge of all of those things

782
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,000
basically

783
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,620
You know the wide knowledge of all not only the bridges

784
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:03,080
But the who and what's going to be covering the bridge going over, you know, whether it's cars or people or trains

785
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,140
Knowledge of the earth, you know many other things

786
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,520
And also he's gonna have knowledge of things to come if the bridge is done, right?

787
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,540
How long it should last when it needs maintenance and or if it's not done, right? What will happen?

788
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,200
Predictable you see? Yeah the same in any field even with medicine

789
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:22,880
right

790
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,440
Only so those three rules apply to anyone that is a true quote-unquote professional. I don't like using that word professional

791
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:37,440
I like to define I like to define a modern professional as someone who is always learning more and more about less and less

792
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,160
So, I think we're about an hour in time, what do you think yes, it's exactly an hour

793
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,860
Do you

794
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:53,320
want to top it off with with a good ending or something and to look forward to because I mean a lot of information was

795
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,100
presented today and

796
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:02,160
I think we just did. Yeah, well three qualities that you're gonna have to good memory sitter to pursue the truth

797
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,120
And one of them is memory. The other one is knowledge into all things and the other thing is things to come. Yep

798
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,100
And that's a really and I believe this hasn't really been given out very much and clearly like that

799
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,520
I'll repeat them again a good memory

800
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,880
It would be maybe let's say it this way Rodrigo

801
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,800
Everybody's got a photographic memory, but most people are just out of film

802
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,440
Okay, yeah, the other thing is knowledge into all things

803
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,160
How many times have you heard that if you study something and you have a true desire to learn it?

804
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,680
You could probably learn it in 1 5th or 1 10th the time if you did it on your own

805
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:45,600
And you could probably be a local expert on that field within six months to a year a national expert within a couple of years

806
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,240
And a world expert on it in less than five years

807
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,840
If you really really got into a field or a subject, right?

808
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:59,000
So to have knowledge into all things, you know that if for example if you wanted to read a thousand page book

809
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,320
You just read three pages a day and you'll be finished with it in a year. Yeah, very easy

810
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:11,500
Very simple right now if you can read 30 pages a day you open 10 books

811
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:18,620
And you read just three pages out of each one every day and at the end of the year you've read 10,000 pages

812
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,400
right now

813
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,120
Very simple, but I'm not saying now to be book smarter because I've said

814
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,420
Several people said to me. Well, I don't need to get any information from a book

815
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:32,680
Well, they forget that the reason books and scrolls and computer files

816
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,100
Hard drives and things exist is for what?

817
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,480
to memorialize information

818
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:46,800
So it could be accessible to others. So whenever you hear someone says I don't need to get information about spirituality out of a book

819
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,320
Right. There is a space heater that person takes up space and they give off heat

820
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,000
So the next thing is you have to have knowledge of things to come

821
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,160
Right, look for example, let's say in terms of health if you see someone eating just sweets consistently and

822
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:09,840
You have knowledge in too many things. Let's say and you have good memory. Can you tell them about things to come?

823
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,880
Yes, of course with the knowledge that you have in the recollection of what you've studied

824
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,440
What did you tell that person if you eat too many sweets you might be diagnosed as being diabetic

825
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,860
You might lose your teeth. You might have

826
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,620
poor blood quality

827
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:24,720
Kidneys, right?

828
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,160
Aren't those things to come? Well, they might say well, I don't have that right now

829
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,960
Yes, but those are things to come just like the engineer. Hey, you know, I tell you, you know

830
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,720
They when they built that bridge they use faulty rivets and he's gonna say well that bridge will collapse where the faulty rigid rivets are

831
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,400
But it hasn't yet

832
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,540
So I don't need to read

833
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,360
Things to come and what's another term for things to come prophecy?

834
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah, you ever you ever wonder you know how we mentioned before

835
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,520
When you try too hard you're rewarded but the gods reward you with error

836
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,140
Yes, and if you're inefficient, let me add another thing if you're inefficient the gods take it away

837
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,220
But anyway, you ever notice how many of these let's just harp on the Christians for a minute how many Christians are

838
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,720
Professed proof they know prophecy and they don't they don't even know what day it is

839
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:19,540
By the way, it's the 18th day of the 11th month apparently and it's what they call December

840
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:26,060
What 30 is 30 ish something like that on the folks work schedule. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and by the way

841
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:30,220
Australia is behind the Western world. We I have someone down there. You might know it by the name of John

842
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:35,040
We did some measurements and you guys are not a day ahead. Neither is New Zealand and parts of the world there

843
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,600
You're actually behind so they've really mucked it up. They've really screwed everyone really good on the whole planet

844
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,340
We've done that little through lawful measurement using the moon

845
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,660
Okay, right which doesn't the moon doesn't lie

846
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:51,040
Of course, yeah, and you don't have to rely on some Jesuit in the basement of the Vatican to draw up

847
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,100
Whatever, how are you gonna run your life now?

848
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,340
I'm not saying that there's some Jesuit in the Vatican do it drawing up the calendar

849
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,840
But it's a it's a it's pretty I mean if they're not who is

850
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,680
So basically that the new moon occurs way in the u.s. Before the Australasia

851
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,920
Does okay. Yeah

852
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:16,340
Visually say that the whole thing flips to the next day around the Levant around the east coast of the Mediterranean

853
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:26,380
Between between the east coast of the of the Mediterranean and a city in Iraq called her between there that distance of about

854
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,960
500 or 800 miles is where the transition takes place

855
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,740
the datum point so you see

856
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:38,660
Let's leave. I think there's a lot to be constructive about there's a lot to do

857
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:43,640
But you can't do it if unless you separate yourself. In other words if you're working in the sewer

858
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,800
And it's lunchtime. Are you gonna take out your lunch and eat it right there?

859
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,380
Are you gonna get out of the sewer wash your hands and eat it?

860
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,120
Yeah, okay, so

861
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,240
Whenever you hear about affecting the sewer the sewer

862
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,040
Purpose is to keep the waste moving and that's what you see online. That's what you see in the media

863
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,480
That's what you see in the universities. That's what you see coming out of institutions

864
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,700
They're keeping it moving right keep it moving move along move along move along nothing to see here

865
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:23,720
The only way you can be constructive is to learn how to set yourself apart from it and learn to view it objectively

866
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:30,200
And the reason it might sound dogmatic to some that's the only way well just think about it

867
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,080
If you really want to find out

868
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:38,060
What a hundred and fifty thousand volts and a thousand amps is you're gonna have to touch it

869
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,440
To find out the truth about it, right?

870
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:46,400
But what happens when you touch that you end up with just a pile of dust don't you become a pile of you, you know?

871
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,480
Doesn't matter what it is. You know those high tension power lines, right? Yeah

872
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,940
Yeah, if you short that out with your body

873
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:59,920
You'll just see a puff of smoke and some some black and white and gray and orange ash fall to the ground

874
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,320
And that's the truth of any matter

875
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,540
So that's why when you do the gods do not act in futility

876
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:13,280
When you go out into the public and you talk to a common oaf about the Pope's work schedule

877
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,000
And how you discovered these laws are contrary to how these institutions are behaving or whatever

878
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,399
They look at you with a blank stare like you're speaking a foreign language

879
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,680
Because the gods have shut their eyes and shut their ears and shut their mind

880
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,760
Until the time comes where it is to be open and right now is not the time yet

881
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,520
So

882
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:40,700
Enjoy good food good drink. It breeds good care promotes good character

883
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:45,960
I believe somewhere it was written there. It's all futility good conversation

884
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,620
Good drink good food a good time is all you can really call good here

885
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,300
you know with others so

886
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,960
Go build some bridges if you have

887
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:02,460
Yeah, so what do you think

888
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,760
By the way, thanks for coming back and everyone that's listening

889
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:13,260
Thanks for listening and we will try to keep these conversations going in their raw form. Thanks to Rodrigo

890
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:20,060
And yes others that won't listen and if if listeners want to contact you break, how did I read you?

891
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:24,859
The best way to do it most directly would be at go to

892
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,680
www.uncommonradio.com

893
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:31,340
you will find a email there, which is a

894
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,800
Uncommon sense radio one at gmail

895
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:41,020
You and there's a contact form there and I answer every email within a day or two fantastic

896
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,500
There there is also a Skype group

897
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,060
that is

898
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,760
You could contact on Skype called

900
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:59,540
You could send a contact request there and we will probably either revive or begin small conference calls there

901
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,800
And how does that sound to you?

902
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,660
Nothing to mind here. Yeah

903
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,200
Thank you so much for your last hour of your time. Thank you for

904
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:19,960
And I do recall you telling me about the child sacrifice before but for some reason I had forgot

905
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,220
Yeah

906
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:33,880
That's fine no worries, I'm sure we will get into it again. Yep. Fantastic. All right, and many other things. Yes

907
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,600
Ciao
