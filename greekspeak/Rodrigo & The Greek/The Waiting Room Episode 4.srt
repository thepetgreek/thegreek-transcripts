1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
All right all the better

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,290
How have you been?

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,790
Could be better. But yeah, okay as the new year. I'm pretty sure it's the first month

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,050
yet, is it not or

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,990
What what's the date the proper date today?

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,310
hmm

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,450
Well, that's that's an interesting question because most people are operating as if it is the first month

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,310
So maybe we'll leave it at that. But it uh, it really seems to be

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:34,410
We're really into the second week of the twelfth month really, okay, meaning the when you when you say month, it's

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,310
Should be based on something

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,810
And what months are based on are the movements of the moon?

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,770
And what the day is based on is the movements of the Sun, but they've got everyone

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,590
Thinking that the the Sun is the movement the earth around the Sun is the movements of the year

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:01,470
It's not the months and days seem to be arbitrary because you guys I mean you guys meaning, you know, everyone else

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,170
Think the day starts in the middle of the night. Yeah. Yeah, it's it

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,110
well

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,770
Look, you know if if living a life of baseless abandonment brings joy

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,930
It will bring joy but what'll happen is when when you follow things that are baseless and

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,570
Fiat or fake or

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,530
Presumptuous to the point where they cannot no longer be found to be based on anything

21
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,430
It brings a certain amount of order systemic

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,330
Order, you know like a system you've heard of that. Yep

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,130
but it'll bite you in the ass because

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,510
You're going in a direction that has no

25
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,210
No start and no finish. So it's just basically

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:58,690
Baseless I mean what is there's any advantage to anything being baseless? It is only perceived and it's usually short-lived

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,730
This particular timekeeping

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,930
Convention has been in place roughly for 2,000 years, but mostly

29
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,630
500 maybe 300

30
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,250
And is it important to know how to keep time?

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,810
If you're going to relate with the dolphins the birds the whales the bees the goats the chickens the plants the rivers

32
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,950
relate as on a stewardship level or

33
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,690
Even from an observational level. You can't use that silly thing. They call

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,550
You know the Roman calendar Gregorian calendar or the World Convention

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,070
but you know if you look at the

36
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,630
World conventions and by the way before we get into that if we do

37
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,750
It's around the 12th moon, it's the first week or so of it. So so what that means is

38
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,710
It's it's it's pretty soon approaching the first moon again. You see because the cycle is usually 12 to 13

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,030
Moons and then we make a determination for the year. So before we get into other topics

40
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,450
Do you think that people calling it New Year right now are a little early or are they really late?

41
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,410
And the thing is to judge whether if someone is early or late you have to still have a reference point, right

42
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,150
so most people will

43
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:29,830
Yeah, it doesn't really matter

44
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:37,650
Because I think that so much baselessness fiat or fakeness or deceit when it goes

45
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,390
What we see when you have a normal or quote-unquote?

46
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:50,350
Healthful or healthy environment whether it's an individual or a political system or social system. You can impose on it a fiat or

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,970
deceitful degrace

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,470
degrading or whatever system and

49
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,010
It views it as a form of oppression

50
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,070
Because things aren't going well or suppression and then it bounces back, right?

51
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,790
It's as if you were kidnapped and thrown into a room tied up for three days

52
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,450
You're looking for a way to get out. You're looking to cut the rope and get out through the window or something

53
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,829
You know, but what's happened is it's been in place for so long that the actual victims

54
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,830
That's an interesting word, by the way victim

55
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,370
It means something sacrifice to a god in short you could look it up

56
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:34,150
The victims of these systems that are fiat whether it's the economic the medical the legal or the calendrical system

57
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,610
have now been

58
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,290
Bred into it and down bread meaning down bread meaning it has degraded

59
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,830
Their ability to defend against it and to rise into something that has substance

60
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,970
And when I deliberately use the word rise because it's a very low

61
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,590
Sense of existence to rely on things that have no basis, right?

62
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,070
something like that would be

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:10,390
You know imagine people add sweetener to their food and that sweetener is completely synthesized and it just has the appearance of being sweet

64
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,950
but it's really a

65
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,590
Very processed synthesized chemical that gives the appearance of sweetness, but once it enters the body, it's very toxic

66
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,190
Right, you've heard of things like that in food

67
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:28,050
Now it was those people that typically indulge not just engage but indulge

68
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,230
You know engage meaning once in a while that indulge make that their staple what what happens to their system it breaks down

69
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,570
To the point where applying remedy or getting away from it. There's so much damage. You can't get away. So

70
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,470
Yeah, I mean it's okay

71
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,730
You know and by the way

72
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,730
The year always started in the spring and always ended in the fall and the winter was an interim period and what's interesting

73
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,130
You know being here on the northern part of the world where it's winter, you know

74
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,890
You've heard of the saying the grass is always greener somewhere else. Well, it is down by you, isn't it?

75
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:13,890
Yeah, so it is greener by you yeah, you see so that that statement might hold true it's always greener somewhere else, right

76
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,830
Yeah, there's always some some other pursuit that if you have a desire to do such

77
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,670
but the worldview

78
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,830
Still is is a matter of baselessness and its victims meaning a mankind

79
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,750
you know, this is the

80
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,850
difficult thing for people to comprehend that

81
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,910
The the initialization of the species, you know, the humankind mankind

82
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,830
Was at its pinnacle when it was initialized and has been degraded since a

83
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,690
simple way to observe that would be

84
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,450
typically what you would see

85
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,270
Someone gets a brand new car, right? Yes. It's got that new car smell. The tires are fresh. Everything is totally fresh

86
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,090
Yes

87
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,670
Pair of shoes or anything now, this is a you know, we're talking about the gene pool now

88
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,790
What's happened is, you know, if one of the things that the establishment is is

89
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,590
terrified of

90
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:26,250
Allowing to be realized is ancient history real ancient history on how the lifespan of mankind was very very long and

91
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,050
the

92
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,450
Veracity of the of the human character was very very high. You know, I mean it was we had people that were

93
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,090
You know imagine someone who's extremely talented at what they do

94
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:46,570
super professional in any sport or craft or mastership the people back then they had a level of mastership and performance and

95
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,270
Based on their character and the fortitude of their character. That is nothing like we see today, right?

96
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,770
That's why you see a lot of the superhero the Zaro ism and all that stuff

97
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,390
It's still you know legends or the age the Greeks had the age of the heroes, right?

98
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,910
Hercules and all that so you imagine society take the best of the best of your society today

99
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,510
physical

100
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,410
Intelligence, let's say I mean everyone has the same intelligence, but you know wit

101
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,410
Being able to perform fortitude of character and that would have been your your average person back then

102
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,690
You're right. Just like the brand-new car again, right? So

103
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,470
So this is a these are things that really are not discussed and maybe shouldn't be discussed to an unaware juvenile mindset

104
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,730
But you know, here's the interesting thing Rodrigo and we actually if you could remind me we were gonna we brought up the time

105
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,890
We're getting to

106
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,210
Probably baselessness and things but we've always discussed that

107
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,870
But always meaning, you know

108
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,450
It's something that needs to be brought out because we're not talking about

109
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,010
You know being probed by space aliens time travel and all that other hoopsie-doopsie

110
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,710
Stuff on based on intention and quantum all these things that people have been sidetracked with

111
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:04,050
You know the main thing that you cannot sidetrack and the main thing that everyone and anyone can indulge in in this

112
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,710
ridiculousness that we're in right now is

113
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,810
The basic comforts and how do you know what makes you comfortable or uncomfortable?

114
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,470
Well, you perceive it in your mind, but you actually manifest it in your body, right?

115
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,450
Like you might like to sleep on a firm bed if someone asks you but you're not on a bed

116
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,010
But you know when you want to experience that comfort you actually seek out a firm bed to lay down on

117
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,310
Someone might perceive in conversation or you might perceive in conversation

118
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,390
They might like a soft bed, but they really don't experience that comfort until they actually physically do that, right?

119
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,950
You know someone might like let's say for food

120
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,210
I enjoy fish and

121
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:46,810
They're just speaking in conversation, but they really don't experience that level of comfort until they actually partake in fish

122
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,210
You see so one of the things people can express is if you notice very often is you know?

123
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,290
How to make the world a better place. What are we going to do? Why is this so bad?

124
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,390
How is it going to get better or this and that this is still the cerebral spiritual?

125
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,810
Communication of things to come or things that people prefer their heresy, you know what they like

126
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:11,650
But the bottom line is until those things are actually experienced through the body the physical. You know modality, right?

127
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,550
You know like when you say you're not feeling well or crook or whatever

128
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,090
Well it depends you know you might be in an uncomfortable chair or you might be in the most comfortable

129
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,090
Physical position and if you're still not feeling well, then it's something that needs to be remedied further

130
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,230
But typically when people are not quote-unquote feeling well if you actually change the physical setting

131
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,090
To the most pleasurable one they tend to feel better

132
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,170
You know just as simple as if you're tired go take a hot bath. You know thinking about it's not going to do it

133
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,690
You have to actually do it to be feel better

134
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:51,070
So one thing that everyone and everyone can still experience are this this wonderful thing that we call comfort pleasure

135
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:59,730
Well-being how else would you say it energizing the body you know or retiring the body to sleep if needed, right?

136
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,750
That's a simple way to reenergize also

137
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,090
You know all these things so how why why isn't there talk?

138
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:14,550
On how to remedy or not even remedy means that you have something that's specific, but the general comforts

139
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,210
You know why is it that we always are perceiving in discussion or in?

140
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,650
Media that it's the the very wealthy. You know that are being the jet-set

141
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,930
Let's say right that was an old term in the 50s because you know the Jets were afforded

142
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,550
Why are they the only ones enjoying themselves?

143
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,690
You know it's not true anyone and everyone can enjoy some kind of what they call creature comfort, right?

144
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,390
What do you like to do right?

145
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,530
What do you find comfortable? What do you find pleasurable?

146
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,550
What do you find in aiding in your recovery? You know from the day or the week or the year?

147
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,810
people go on holiday, so

148
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,130
one thing that anyone and everyone can partake in which I find lacking in general discussion is

149
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,530
And even in specific discussions because they're so it's very the discussions are too narrow and shallow

150
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,770
But how do you increase the quality of your comfort?

151
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,550
Level on this planet because basically let's take it that you're not

152
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,630
suffering some kind of ailment or a

153
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,470
Condition that you're in a constant state of pain or discomfort

154
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,450
But let's say you know your everyday people that work or don't work, or you know are up and about

155
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:27,230
Why not discuss things that just make everything a little bit better now everything would be what you eat what you wear?

156
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,290
What you drink how you rest?

157
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,530
How you travel how you communicate all these these little minor you've heard of like tips and tricks and things like that well

158
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,290
What are the most important things to being on this planet or any planet?

159
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,390
Let's say you jumped on a starship and went somewhere

160
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,370
And they dropped you off on the planet Rodrigo you'd say but wait a second

161
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,970
I need food clothing and shelter right in that order pretty great. I

162
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,770
You know I mean you know you can't just leave me here

163
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,050
And most people complain that it's just not good enough

164
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,390
Yes, I've got nothing to compare it because I haven't actually had anything better like you said before you haven't actually done it or tried it

165
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,650
So what is it that we're complaining about?

166
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,870
Hmm well not so much a complaint, but if maybe let's say some people how many people take it for granted it don't complain probably the

167
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,350
majority

168
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,250
there's a group of people that do complain, but I think that's also a

169
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,350
the

170
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:37,970
The the marketing gets a little perverted where they actually market to people the desire to go into the market and buy new products

171
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,410
through

172
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,830
Complaining you know like aren't you tired of this being this way?

173
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,090
You know whatever you know the marketing aspect, but how about just?

174
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,530
Optimizing what you've got is the point that I want to make is like food

175
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,090
How many people do you know or at least is a rhetorical question that actually take the care?

176
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,370
Today that in preparing meals as it was let's say 30 years ago. Maybe do you want to go 50 years ago?

177
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:13,810
You know an average meal. Let's say a dinner or supper took an hour to prepare on average years ago

178
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,550
Now it might be less than 15 minutes 20

179
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,610
Yeah

180
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,370
So take time. You know here's the thing

181
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:29,110
You know people get into their work into their projects and things and it's good to do that if it's a full-time endeavor and have

182
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,130
Someone else cook for you

183
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,530
You know slavery is a lawful thing

184
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,210
if you can afford a

185
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,170
Servant or a slave and you have to take care of them well by the way

186
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,110
And I'm using this to kind of eat some people on because those words have taken on bad terms, right?

187
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,870
If you have someone to wait on you

188
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,110
Or you have a someone in that is considered in the servitude position take care of them

189
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,690
And they will take care of you. We've been told that

190
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,830
Servants and slaves are always mistreated which is not true

191
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:02,970
There are many slaves that have lived in splendor and there were many sovereigns or kings that lived in squalor, right?

192
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,710
so

193
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,410
So the the thing is many people can't don't want to afford such

194
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,590
Company because that's what it is when you have someone with you regarding of regardless of their status their company aren't they?

195
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,050
they're accompanying you even if you're alone or you have a small quote-unquote family unit or

196
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:28,150
Accompanied by associates or friends or lovers or whatever you want to call the people around you relatives or kin

197
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,870
Try to come into agreement because what's interesting is if you want to do something and you're living in a particular household

198
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,270
It's best when everyone is in agreement with it because they might be either

199
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,810
Apathetic or indifferent to it or they might be in opposition. So it's always good to see if there's agreement on a thing on

200
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:52,050
The easiest thing to increase one's quality of comfort in life is to increase the quality of their food

201
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:59,150
Not only how it's prepared and how you eat it, but the actual quality of the produce itself or the materials that you use

202
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,210
so

203
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,290
You know when you go to the shops

204
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,650
Take your time

205
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,210
And buy the highest quality, you know, sometimes, you know, let's just speak to the more of the urban environment

206
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,210
These large shops these large. What do they call them down there? They call them supermarkets groceries

207
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,950
Okay, there you go

208
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:24,790
You notice that even the most of the things that are supposed to be fresh or wrapped in tightly wrapped in plastics. Yeah

209
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,430
And they seem to be fresh but you know what one well

210
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,350
Here's a little thing. I tell people is if you're just limited to that type of market

211
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:41,130
Why don't you they usually have a department whether it's the vegetable stock area the meat fish stock area

212
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,470
ask for some help in the service and ask if they perhaps something have something in the back that is not been

213
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,290
Wrapped in plastic and sitting out there and they might say yes, we do have

214
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,250
You know a grouping of this in storage cold storage back here

215
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,110
You know very often they there is enough courtesy in these places

216
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:07,329
because they do sense competition that if they know the managers do tell them to you know, give good customer service and

217
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,670
You will find out like

218
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,130
They might bring you out something that is you know, you might you might end up taking it

219
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,030
Home wrapped in plastic, but it won't be sitting around

220
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,390
They'll wrap it for you and weigh it and price it immediately, right?

221
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,590
Yeah, so always make the best choice

222
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,550
You know there there are tips and tricks like for example

223
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,510
There's certain restaurants have pre-prepared foods and if let's say the chips or something has been sitting for a while

224
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,830
You might just say I'd like to have that but I'd like it without any salt

225
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,770
Well everything the whole batch that they're presenting to the public salted

226
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,030
So now they have to go and prepare a small batch for you without salt, right?

227
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,150
I'm not saying that you should eat it without salt

228
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,290
You don't want to eat fried food without salt because the salt helps digest it

229
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,650
So once they produce a fresh batch for you, whether it's chips or whatever

230
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,610
You just take it aside and you go ahead and salt it

231
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,790
But don't let them see it too evidently because they might wonder what the hell you're doing, but right

232
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:17,290
Yeah, and this way you have something that's been more freshly prepared because things that are food that is freshly prepared or freshly

233
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,030
imparted from where it's

234
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,170
Harvested from always tends to be a little bit better than that stuff. That's been sitting around

235
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:32,850
So you can increase your food in produce quality that way the other way is to when you prepare it learn

236
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,430
How to be skillful in food preparation now that that's going to be difficult because there was

237
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:45,230
There's a thing called cable television, and there was a large boom of cooking shows that started about 20 years ago

238
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,110
Right if you're familiar with it, and I've been watching them

239
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,650
I haven't really subscribed to any of that for over a decade but ever since then and I and I've watched you know they look so

240
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,770
fanciful and so

241
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,050
indulging and

242
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,110
Enthusiastic to the to the viewer, but I watch them

243
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,490
I said you're not going to learn how to cook by watching these cooking shows because they never discuss the subtleties and the things you

244
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,670
Should do to to actually you know lead to a more digestible meal, right?

245
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,730
So learn how to do proper food preparation. There's some very simple tricks actually we did

246
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,330
If you go to uncommon radio archives

247
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,130
With I did with Seth Michael a way back

248
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,790
We did a show called perfect rice and we gave about a dozen cooking tips there

249
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,250
Anyone who tried them found them to be beneficial so anyone could go to

250
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,170
uncommon radio.com go to the archives

251
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,790
And you will find a show called perfect rice and then some more on cooking we've discussed over a dozen maybe two dozen

252
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,230
ways to improve various

253
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:50,370
preparations of foods from rice to veg to meats to stocks to soups to roasts and

254
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,070
Very simple yeah, very simple

255
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,870
You know one of them was called how to make the perfect rice and with the interesting thing the reason I mentioned that Rodrigo

256
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,550
Is I remember traveling and cooking rice off of the back of a vehicle in a camping situation?

257
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,410
And I told the people asked me. What are you making and they?

258
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,190
Said preparing rice, and they were shocked because they know they're thinking like you know that's almost an impossibility to cook rice properly

259
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,790
So it's very simple

260
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,770
You know and and you know things veg like potatoes you know baked potatoes tend to be some of the most delicious

261
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:26,270
Well, you know you don't have to fire up an oven you boil the potatoes unpeeled in water for 15 or 20 minutes

262
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,130
Depending on your altitude on the end the potato and then drain the water and just gently

263
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:36,050
Stovetop bake it in the in the pot with the lid on just turn the potatoes every five minutes

264
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,030
Let the pot get warm not too hot if it's a thin bottom pot it won't work too

265
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,050
Well, and you could do stovetop baking right?

266
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,490
I've even cooked a pizza on a Barbie. You know where you think that's something that should be you know you think a pizza

267
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,230
How well how are you gonna do that right?

268
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,410
Well, it's simple you you make your dough, and you put it right on the grill

269
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,450
Don't let it fall through right and have all your toppings ready to go and after 30 seconds when you flip it

270
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,530
You know you put the the side that was on the grill now up you immediately apply your sauce and your cheese

271
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,750
Yeah, and that's already very hot you see and

272
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,830
And you get a very quick pizza in a minute and a half on the Barbie

273
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,430
Which is typically when you tell someone you're gonna cook a pizza

274
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,570
You know that's you're gonna have to fire up an oven and that takes a lot of energy and time yeah

275
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,750
So I'm not suggesting you try to cook pizza a fresh pizza on a Barbie, and you'll and it'll work for you

276
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,070
But I just gave you that how to do it really quickly you can imagine that you can do it if you need to

277
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,950
and if you have to

278
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,050
Yes, you've got nothing else to wait and that's I mean not like you're gonna have pizzas laughing

279
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,510
You're gonna have in your fridge, but at least you are able to do it if you need to so yes

280
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,010
Flatbreads of flour is still relatively cheap just get some flour add a little bit of water perhaps an egg and some fat

281
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,970
Could be animal fat like butter or vegetable fat and just knead that dough and let it cool down

282
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,330
And you have a flatbread which you can actually cook on the grill or on a frying pan

283
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,810
You just 30 seconds on each side, and you have this wonderful fresh flatbread

284
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,550
It doesn't have to be leavened because when you say bread typically it's leavened

285
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,790
You know the yeast rises, and you have to temper it and all this

286
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,050
It's a lot of work, and if you don't do the yeast properly if it's too active you might have

287
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,310
Digestive problems you're gonna put this super active agent into your body

288
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,730
And you'll wonder why you're getting up in the night wanting to blow hot air balloons through your backside with it. You know so

289
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,730
It's not good. Yeah, so so there are lots of tips so the thing is learn about good food preparation

290
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:47,130
Don't be hasty with your food when I mean with your food meaning start learning to take time. It's a stress relief

291
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,850
Many people tend to focus you see they let's say they have what's called

292
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,730
You know their occupation and their family life and all this and you'll notice if you watch if you watch the silent

293
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,030
Videotape of your average human especially in the Western world you watch

294
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:08,970
They're very contemplative even when they're working and doing repetitive tasks or with their family members or friends

295
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,350
They're not they're idle. They're really just they're not doing much. You know I mean they could be still working

296
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,090
You know or again. You know at a job or traveling or whatever, but they're they're very so they think too much

297
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,770
There's too much

298
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,270
You'll see like a family you know now that prepares a dinner in five or ten minutes or 15 or 20 like we said maybe

299
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,150
They have plenty of time during the evening to actually spend an hour hour and a half to make the dinner

300
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,570
But they don't they sit around watch television they might talk that might each go to their own room or whatever why not?

301
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,250
Make it a point to spend at least an hour or even more to make a home-cooked meal

302
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,810
And the quality if you don't most people

303
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,630
Still don't know how to prepare food. I've discovered

304
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,870
There's a thing that I call it

305
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,090
I call it white people food right and it has nothing to do with the color of your skin and I have to

306
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:05,570
Bring this up. You know in ancient Egypt and in ancient cultures when something had no flavor or no lack of character

307
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,410
It was called white

308
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,050
Not not not based on its color like white rice or white snow or white robes

309
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,650
But when something lacks like it's it's

310
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:24,470
Yes, yes, like it's got everything out of it, so what's left is just it's no color right that was a popular ancient Egyptian term

311
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,250
So when I say white people food it does you could be Latin or?

312
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,770
Black or you know Asian it doesn't matter. It's just this lack of character

313
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,710
And it's taken out of connotation, but but quote unquote you know when I say white people food if you go to the American Midwest

314
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:47,130
Or certain northern Europeans where the people are more what they call waspy white Anglo-Saxon Protestant right that type

315
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,850
you know there's these are maybe pejoratives or whatever, but

316
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,450
You'll notice that their food is not very good like let's take for example England. Have you ever seen?

317
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,910
English restaurants being propagated throughout the world no

318
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,810
No one wants that kind of food right or American diner. You know and all that those are European

319
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,230
You know when you get to the southern Mediterranean rim certain parts of Asia

320
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,490
coastal cities, it's very the culture are more

321
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,030
exciting and

322
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,050
whatever if you go to like the northern latitudes of Europe like

323
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,110
Netherlands Norway Holland

324
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,550
England or whatever the food is just like you got to be joking. You know this is not very good preparation

325
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:34,430
You know what is the most popular food in England? It's Indian food. That's the national dishes chicken tiki marsala

326
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,430
Mm-hmm, right

327
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,270
so

328
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,790
So now here. We're crossing over in a white meaning. You know you know the white yeah

329
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,890
With some sense it is

330
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,390
That way to that the best foods in the world you'll find

331
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:55,850
Along the Mediterranean rim and the central parts of Asia coastal parts of Asia. This is a matter of taste now

332
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,170
This is being subjective right?

333
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,090
But if you look at the food combining and the skill and the level of flavors and all that you you you

334
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,130
want to avoid

335
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,670
northern parts of Europe Midwest America probably

336
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,910
Central parts of Australia as well these these areas the foods are not regarded as very well

337
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,890
Does it mean that there's still people there that can't cook or whatever, but the culture seems to be very base

338
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:28,330
Lacks and eloquence and it lacks of finesse and it lacks flavor right

339
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:30,750
So

340
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:38,690
You know that, but again. There's levels of it, so this again the you know pursue things that are pleasant

341
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,450
Pursue things that are what would you say?

342
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:50,350
From a subjective point of view you find pleasurable and the easiest thing to improve your quality of life

343
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,770
Is to pursue better food stuffs food preparation food quality?

344
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,190
You know and and whatever

345
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,870
so

346
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,510
Current lifestyle people eat just for the sake of

347
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,030
Just having to need to eat not because they need

348
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:14,210
Sometimes sit around at dinner table and converse with a family or enjoy the whole food preparation process

349
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,110
It's they just want to get in the gate and get over and done with so you can you do it when I've done before it's

350
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,410
not

351
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,570
Yeah, they deprive themselves

352
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:30,150
You know a lot of pleasure can be gotten through the mouth right as the ancient Greeks used to say meaning through food, right?

353
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:37,830
The Japanese call it umami, which is a very savory flavor. You know delicious. You know something very pleasurable

354
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,590
I

355
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:46,410
Have seen through going through parts of America here again the the white people food thing where what people were eating?

356
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,850
I found to have no flavor and the quality was so low and this was their staple

357
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,890
And when I would stay with them and eat like that for a few days

358
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,450
I really got sick. I felt very low energy

359
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:03,250
Sore throat kind of feeling like it, and this is how these people eat every day all their lives no wonder

360
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,590
They're dependent. I mean there's such a low quality of life based on what goes through their mouth and

361
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:17,330
You know it's it's it's sad sad by the way stands for set standard American diet by the way

362
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:27,450
So yeah, so food is the other thing the other thing is we said food clothing and shelter clothing is very important as well

363
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,850
You know wearing things that fit well. You know never

364
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,330
Never ever ever ever ever shortchange yourself on shoes

365
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,430
Right cheap shoes. You've heard that could you could actually

366
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:44,130
If you don't have a good constitution a skeletal constitution

367
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:50,930
It could actually damage the feet if the bones you have more bones in the feet than anywhere else in the body

368
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,830
You know in terms of the the size of the body right yeah feet and hands

369
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,010
So you you know there's a

370
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,910
Saying European saying that you if you can fit Italian shoes, you're blessed right. It's wonderful. You know

371
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,710
Italian made shoes, but also the Spanish and and

372
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,210
Portuguese they

373
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,570
Make wonderful shoes

374
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:19,750
So the with clothing to start from the bottom up you you never want to get quote-unquote a cheap pair of shoes

375
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,490
Now cheap doesn't mean price. It means the actual quality is cheap

376
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,270
Yeah, you always want to get the best shoes you can afford or want to afford

377
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,210
Right so and you most people would get a pair of shoes it might last six months to a year

378
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,710
I when I get quality shoes I can have them for 20 years

379
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,130
right and I

380
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,650
Have several shoes now for I've been rocking for 15 years

381
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,910
And they feel just as good as you know the the week that they were broken in so

382
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,530
The thing about making a move on buying shoes for example is let's say you do need a pair of shoes

383
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,290
And if you're not in a desperate place

384
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,430
That you absolutely positively have to have a new pair of shoes right now

385
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,340
start investigating what type of shoe it is and you know when in a

386
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,380
Purveyor of high-quality shoes see what the price is for something that you

387
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,200
consider to be high quality for yourself and

388
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,960
Start setting some aside for it

389
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,300
You may not be able to afford them you may not want to afford them right now

390
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,940
But if you think that way you might be able to

391
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,580
Afford them in a week or a month or so you see so think ahead when it comes to buying shoes

392
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,260
And just for using the you know the the common fiat currency

393
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,880
Upwards of a hundred and fifty to two hundred for a good pair of shoes is not unusual

394
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,680
That's where they usually start, and we're not talking about needless markup either

395
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:52,060
You know what I mean. We're not because some of these clothing outlets have a fivefold markup. You know what I mean

396
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,600
There's a there's a couple of stores. We have names for them like one of them

397
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,360
We I'm not going to name it, but we call it needless markup. You can imagine what it's

398
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,600
It's it's an NM is the is what the store is but so so yeah, but pursue and also with the advent of

399
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,520
Electronic commerce right eBay and all these other things you can actually you have more

400
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,060
Mode you say more leeway or more freedom to seek out a better price like for example on

401
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,340
yeah, like cycling shoes that I used to prefer were upwards of three to four hundred and

402
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,400
Kangaroo leather by the way kangaroo leather is very good because it's resistant to moisture

403
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,880
If they would ever get wet they don't shrink and they're very elastic when they're wet

404
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,780
You know some of the finest shoes are still kangaroo leather those ruse do provide good skin for that

405
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,180
So I would say

406
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,600
You know now I've heard that similar shoes like that can be gotten for less than half on what they call

407
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,180
We know some of the outlets on on the internet. You know you know commerce, right?

408
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,740
eBay and Amazon or whatever so

409
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,260
So a shoes and then from the from the bottom up there

410
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,320
You know you consider you know how we've discussed lawful food and things being lawful

411
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,640
When you when you start researching law which is dreadful to humanity all of humanity by the way

412
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,220
They don't want to they want to go and study what they they're told law is and if you look at

413
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,380
What you're told law is just like what you're told what the gods are just what you're told what money is or the calendar you'll

414
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,060
Find out it's fake. It's nothing, but you just have to do it anyway if you're going to function with these idiots, but

415
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,200
When you find out what law is it comes from your God even in the Western civilization?

416
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,640
They tell you the law is the justice system

417
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:48,100
Which is the revived goddess religion the Babylonian goddess it goes on and on and on that's so that's why you know when you get

418
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,660
Entangled with these legal monsters. You know you always it never ends up well, right?

419
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,660
but but nonetheless

420
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,140
You're if you go to the highest form of law that has been given by claim

421
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,180
It's not what you believe you just seek out claims

422
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,160
You know there are claims of low nature and then claims a very high nature

423
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,200
There's only one that claims that created everything and gives law right and it has nothing to do with your belief

424
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,860
This is from a literary point of view right

425
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,460
So when you understand what has been given or communicated you'll find that what is lawful for people

426
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,680
There are laws in there about food and and how to do commerce and even

427
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,380
How to keep time and even know what to wear and he says my people when you wear clothes on your body do not wear

428
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,060
mixed fiber

429
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,380
So and it gives an example like don't mix the wool and the linen

430
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,740
And you know some people miss you know most people lack reading comprehension and most people can't hear what you're saying

431
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,060
Because when they hear things or they get these visual impulses or sonic impulses

432
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:56,340
They're trying to compare it to things that they already know it's a comparative thing people really are really not open to new information

433
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
That's why it's so easy to

434
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,600
See how so much is being disclosed the people yet are complaining that none nothing is being disclosed right?

435
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,699
They don't pick up on it, but what I mean by what is lawful about wearing on the human body is not mixed fiber

436
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:17,780
So it would be hundred percent of a particular fiber and some people have come back say well synthetics

437
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,040
You don't want to wear them as well. It doesn't say anything about synthetics the thing is if it's a synthetic

438
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,460
It should be a hundred percent synthetic not you see a lot of shirts now

439
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,560
They're wrinkle-free and they're 80% cotton 20% polyester right you've seen that

440
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,940
Yeah, that's not lawful, but if you were a hundred percent polyester

441
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,739
It would be lawful or a hundred percent cotton and also you it says also that you can sew one

442
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,719
Fabric on another like for example. I have a 100% worsted wool

443
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,520
suit jacket let's say a

444
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,719
Sport jacket and the lining is made of 100% silk and the lining is sewed on to the wool outer layer

445
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,780
That's lawful because the lining is not mixed fiber and the outer is not mixed fiber

446
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:06,200
So you so you can layer different types of material now also. There's another interesting thing about it certain

447
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,040
Synthetic fabrics are all made from petroleum

448
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,700
you know like

449
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,620
nylon polyester

450
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,960
Lycra those are all oil petroleum products to a degree

451
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,860
There's that's kind of open whether a blend of those would be considered mixed fiber or not you see

452
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,220
So that's that's a gray area

453
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:33,300
But certain things that are very close, and if you want to get look in the chemistry that maybe like a 10% lycra

454
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:41,600
90% polyester it may not be mixed fiber, but even though it's being called that because inherently they're both petroleum products, right

455
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,100
So with clothing. I guess the shoes are important because can you think of another article of?

456
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,860
Clothing that could change the skeletal formation on a body, and you know create an ailment of some sort other than shoes

457
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,900
It's kind of hard to maybe if your pants are too tight your voice

458
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:09,060
Well I was saying underwear yeah, yeah, I have a reason like if you're if you're a man or not in Italian compressed

459
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,340
Right right the the male that needs to stay away from the body for regulation and whatever and for the women

460
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,280
there's the upper the the

461
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,500
Trusses and bras and things like that. I think used to be called trusses years ago, right

462
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,700
Yeah, those create circulatory issues thermal issues, right

463
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,460
Yeah

464
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,820
So

465
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,120
Yeah, and you notice the fitted aspect of clothing you know

466
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,980
With the buttons and the zippers and all that if you go back thousands of years

467
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,080
It seems that there was thousands of years where people had more wraparound clothing

468
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,940
You would have a sheet. You know like a toga something that was cut to your height, and you would wrap it

469
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,720
a covering right

470
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,040
Interesting isn't it yeah?

471
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,980
So you didn't yeah more free-flowing and more easy on the on the body. It's like it's not fitted

472
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,200
Yeah

473
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,320
Yeah, I know everything is really specifically fit and almost unfit you know

474
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,760
Yeah

475
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,740
So consider really good clothing and really good clothing, okay?

476
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,940
the lawful aspect is

477
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,560
No mixed fiber and the and the really good shoes again would be a good recommendation and like Rodrigo said

478
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,980
The undergarments the way they're structured today could cause maladies in the body right so

479
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,520
So the next thing would be perhaps on clothing anything else you think on on how to experience

480
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,560
Comfort you know we got food

481
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,980
Pursue good food preparation good produce spend more time on it

482
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
A lot more time and then good shoes and good clothing if you can

483
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,960
Think about how to you know increase the quality and that on your own preference

484
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,000
And then we then there would be food clothing and shelter

485
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,740
Yeah, but

486
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,580
Furnishings may be in shelter. Yeah, uh-huh you don't necessarily wear them, but you lay on them or you you

487
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,120
Yeah, yeah, think about a bed a one-third of your life is spent on in bed

488
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,370
Isn't it if you sleep eight hours a day every day?

489
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:26,820
Yeah

490
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,960
So that's a third of your yeah, you made your bed now you got to lay in it right so

491
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,760
That's say no more

492
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,760
See what you prefer again things that if you're you know that's that's a good point Rodrigo the furnishing of the bed

493
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,000
You should also just like the shoes get the best one you want to afford or can't afford yeah

494
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,400
Right yeah, and there's a certain mattress

495
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,260
Suit all people like does a bed have to be firm or can it be soft and be firm is it just preferential?

496
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,720
Yeah, yeah

497
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,540
Like an example is someone who's let's say recovering from certain injuries might prefer or certainly has a certain condition

498
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,420
Sensitivity might prefer a softer

499
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,580
bed and

500
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,460
Someone who is more athletic more toned

501
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,960
More robust skeletal you know features might prefer a firm one

502
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,720
Much to say about beds. I don't know if we could even start beginning the topic and to cover it

503
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,720
but you know the one thing about beds are you know there's a

504
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,260
Fellow Abraham Kareem, I believe it gets into biogeometry

505
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,400
They did some study around turn of the century about people who had certain cancers

506
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,680
And they would go around with dividing rods like dowsing rods to find ley lines through the earth

507
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,520
And they found that like a lady who had died of stomach cancer in the 30s

508
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,920
They went around and doused the ley lines through the earth and magnetic and water lines coming up through the earth on the property

509
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,900
And they found that there was a very powerful negative energy one coming up on this property

510
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:14,680
And they followed it and it actually went across the house through the bedroom, and it was over the bed

511
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,620
Underneath the bed coming up through the earth where this woman slept around the region of the stomach

512
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,020
Interesting right

513
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,620
So actually I had recommended. There's someone

514
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,700
I know another part of the country and her husband was diagnosed with the C word right yeah

515
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,400
Cancer and I said well, why don't you start? It's early on why don't you move the location of where you sleep?

516
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
You know they didn't have much choice

517
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,400
I said we'll sleep on the couch sleep on just change the location by at least five or ten feet or another room

518
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,120
But not in line maybe a diagonal from the card in the line

519
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,420
Right cardinal meaning north southeast west don't you know and actually within two months later. She called me says he's recovering

520
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,540
You know he's getting to as he seems much better

521
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,200
so

522
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,740
Yeah, so where you sleep a third of your time would imprint certain things

523
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,880
Getting it getting into that topic. Yes, the earth does emanate ley lines

524
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,580
How would you how else would you see you've heard of this Rodrigo?

525
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,180
I'm sure the listener has perhaps might have as well those things could be checked out

526
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:22,700
Nothing to panic over, but just really simple simply from an innate perspective

527
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,840
If you're not feeling well, or you're you're plagued with a particular

528
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,900
What would you call it chronic thing change where you sleep?

529
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,200
This is the very old adage. I've discussed before when people go to certain people says you know

530
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm not feeling well

531
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,100
What should I do and then the proper answer is how the hell would I know what you should do?

532
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,760
I don't know what you're doing. You know what you're doing. Just change what you're doing

533
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:51,200
The way you feel whether it's good or bad is is a product or a symptom of everything else

534
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,100
So if you're feeling really good, let's say you're in you're in good health, and you're vital

535
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:01,740
It's because of all your other behavior and what you like and don't like right if you're not feeling

536
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,280
Well, that is actually a product of what you're doing as well

537
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,380
So just stop doing what you're doing and your condition will change right yeah

538
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:10,740
so

539
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,140
That's just one of the simple

540
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,040
applications of

541
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,240
You know you know where where you sleep, and how you sleep

542
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,380
There's also a lot of discussion should the head be towards the north should the head be towards the south that's open for investigation

543
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,620
There's no place. I could really send anyone to start looking at it

544
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,760
But just consider if you're feeling a certain way

545
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,900
It's because it's a byproduct or a product directly related to everything else you're doing and if you don't like the way you feel

546
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:46,120
Or are just change everything else and that condition has to change also right usually does unless it's very heavily

547
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,160
Based on one's Constitution you know

548
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,020
So the conditions can't change so this in terms of the shelter being comfortable

549
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,420
Ultimately when it's hot out you want it to be cool, and when it's cold out you want it to be warm, right?

550
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:10,060
You want you there's a certain median temperature that is most comfortable so learn how to manage the temperature and air quality first

551
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,260
Of course you don't want leaking roofs and other things like that

552
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,280
But if you can up the quality of where you live the easiest way to up the quality of

553
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,040
Where anyone lives or their shelter is to keep it clean or cleaner?

554
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,060
Learn cleaning practices and cleaning practices does it mean going to the shops or the grocery store and buying all these?

555
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,520
Funky chemicals and spraying them everywhere

556
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,360
some of the best cleaning

557
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah, they have residues and some of the best cleaning

558
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,220
Products to use it's just plain water and just a very basic, so

559
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,760
Vinegar can be a vinegar tends to break down a lot of finishes, and it is pretty stinky

560
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,800
You could use a little bit of vinegar when you want acidic you could also use something called borax of 40 mule team

561
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,520
You could put a drop of dish soap in there

562
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,440
Also with soaps and cleaning things do you know that especially the synthetic ones have you heard that you these?

563
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Industrial chemicals cause cancers and things like that. It's not so it's actually the fragrances that are the can't carcinogens

564
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,220
Have you ever seen like the commercial dish soap or laundry soaps and?

565
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,620
Things that are very strong are synthetic fragrances as they say they're supposed to smell like this

566
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:35,440
Yeah, yeah, it's really the fragrances that have been discovered to caught be the carcinogenic aspect so fragrance free tends to be

567
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,360
cleaner

568
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:43,230
Most of your if you have like rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle is

569
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:50,060
Very good also for cleaning surfaces that are resilient or non-porous from grease and things like that

570
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,900
You could look up. You know natural or less

571
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,160
Industrial types of cleaning like windows for example. I've seen

572
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,060
Housekeepers go into houses and spray this blue liquid all over the windows

573
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,220
Window cleaner and all that well alcohol is

574
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,920
Sure alcohol is far superior with distilled water, or if you can't if you have rainwater. That's just as good

575
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,740
And just keeping a clean house if you have a vacuum cleaner

576
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:28,060
You have to mind that what's blowing out the back end is not always filtered as well as you might think it is either

577
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,100
Keep what I call a chemical shed

578
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,620
Even if you have an apartment if you have chemical cleaning chemicals and things like that a group them all together

579
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,480
Don't have them distributed through the house and storage and and put it in a box outside of where you live

580
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,860
Right yeah

581
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:51,280
Yeah, you know even like you mentioned the window cleaner if you do have any of these industrial cleaners

582
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,880
Put them in a box outside or a cabinet outside where you live

583
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,900
It's it's kind of difficult in a very urban environment in a studio apartment. Let's say to do that

584
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,520
But you'll always find some way to do it

585
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,320
Just don't have it where you live inside with where you live would be defined as you know if you

586
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,940
Where you live would be when you close all the doors and the windows that space defined on the inside is where you live

587
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,880
Right yeah, yeah, so that would include the closets right so you want to

588
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,480
Maintain what's called. I call it chemical shed

589
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,120
Someone asks me. Do you have such-and-such cleaner? I say yeah, it's in the chemical shed

590
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,500
And

591
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,760
That would be just a box or a cabinet outside of the living space a

592
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,500
Closet or storage within the living space is not outside the living space

593
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,180
It's still within that would out gas and right an interesting way to view

594
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,740
This is you ever go to the supermarkets when you start going to the house cleaning aisle and as you're walking down

595
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,680
You're being fumigated you ever notice that

596
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,640
stinks

597
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,440
Yeah, yeah, and the same things

598
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:53,900
It's

599
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,220
It's within the same building yeah, yeah, it gets sucked up and recirculated yeah

600
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,900
So that is also happening in a we even with just one bottle in the house

601
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,060
It's just that it's not as you're not as sensitive to pick it up

602
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,440
So keeping chemicals it's around you 24-7 if you do that as well

603
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,340
I mean compared to the supermarket you're in there for like 10-15 minutes

604
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,880
But at home right if you keep it in science 24-7 just that little bit is enough just to make you sick

605
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,760
Yes from from a homeopathic point of view even though

606
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:33,860
It's you know in homeopathics the stronger the dilution the more diluted the stronger its potency in one effect, right?

607
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,500
Yeah in the field effect, so yeah absolutely in

608
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,980
Considering that its presence is enough not the volume as well

609
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:50,180
And that could be considered as an absolute that if something is present it is giving it

610
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,940
It is affecting the field and the environment just by its presence

611
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,840
You know it's interesting in a lot of sports drug testing when they test these athletes for drugs

612
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,980
They test them for the presence of drug in the body right not how much right?

613
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,520
So it's the same concept here

614
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,480
You know is it present at all so so clean?

615
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,200
Avoiding things that would be intrusive to the system. You know the biological systems

616
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,760
The other thing is if you have

617
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Animals in the house make sure they have access to outside if they're not their areas must be kept very clean

618
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,420
Because typically the way animals live is when they're out in nature. They do their business and nature takes care of it

619
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,720
Where when animals do their business in a cage or in the house there you have to take care of it, right?

620
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,260
So be diligent with that

621
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,960
the other thing about

622
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,260
keeping

623
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,520
enjoying your time at home

624
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:54,020
what you call home, let's say the place where you rest and you have your possessions is

625
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:01,800
Other than cleanliness and keeping a chemical free and keeping even the animals clean clean clean is that you enjoy going there?

626
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,160
you know for example if you have

627
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,400
Relatives that might live with you or roommates or even a spouse that you don't appreciate their company

628
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,320
eventually

629
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,100
You will not

630
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:21,140
You will find that you lack the comfort that can be gotten from a peaceful or happy place you might call your abode

631
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,340
It might even go to the point where the where you the actual abode itself is fine

632
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,960
But the neighbors are not where you what you you know they kind of stress you out

633
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,360
How many times have you heard people you know I'm not going home after work

634
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,320
I'm going to the pub because going home stresses me out right have you heard that you know?

635
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,420
So it's all too common

636
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,100
So those things need to be resolved

637
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:50,320
It should be a place that you find welcoming to yourself and others and is a place that you

638
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,580
Enjoy going to and you find pleasure

639
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:53,860
in

640
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,100
So that that would be the spiritual or the psychological site. You know PSY again

641
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,560
Same thing make sure that those things are in order and believe it or not

642
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,220
It's real easy to clean the house real easy to put all the chemicals outside

643
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,540
But sometimes it's nearly impossible to get that side fixed

644
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:16,460
You know a bad neighbor or a spouse or a family condition or roommate condition that is

645
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,520
Something that I don't wish on anyone, but those things have to be

646
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:26,680
Addressed because you know what if it's if you feel like where you live is not a good situation

647
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,540
It's going to fall apart eventually, or it will make you so sick that you will fall apart eventually

648
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:37,540
So it's always best to start addressing those things the emotional spiritual. You know aspect first

649
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:52,460
Yes, it doesn't mean to be transient it just means that if you need to move sometimes that's the best thing

650
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,360
It's always hard to move and restart somewhere

651
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,840
But when you settle in just make sure you have everything in place that your mind and your spirit

652
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,660
You know or spirit right same thing can rest there

653
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:09,400
And that is what makes what they call a happy home or abode is ultimately the mindset, right?

654
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,720
So I mean, I think we've covered quite a bit there. Yeah

655
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:20,840
Those basic things food clothing and shelter do you notice how I mean you've been around

656
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,060
radio and whatever

657
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,520
This this digital format on discussions and countless hours about this than the other

658
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:36,100
I think we did a tidy little explanation that could applies to everyone and could probably help everyone don't you think the last 50 minutes?

659
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,560
So it can be of them basically this

660
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,520
50 minutes for the discussion you don't have to be a believer of follow-up anything. It's somewhat common sense

661
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:52,640
Yeah, and even if the Illuminati are threatening to kill everyone who cares if you've got a good meal good good shoes and

662
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,260
Good a good place to live. Yeah

663
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,060
Right, you see what I mean?

664
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,540
Or if those bad aliens are gonna, you know fold the space-time continuum or whatever, you know

665
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,500
It doesn't matter really, you know

666
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,960
And if they do come to the house invite him in for some, you know

667
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,120
Freshly baked flatbread or something or a pizza that you made on the Barbie

668
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,640
And by the way, just just to throw back to shoes never buy shoes. You can't run in think about that

669
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,280
Yeah, right why would you buy a pair of shoes you can't run in and I'm not mean

670
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,180
Yeah, you might want to run to something or you might want to run away from something. Yeah. Yeah

671
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:34,500
So what's the point? Well, you you tell me Rodrigo. Have you seen you know, I was out at the shops yesterday

672
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,260
And it was quite a shock. I try to keep to myself, but I was at what they call a mall

673
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,620
And where I'm at

674
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,340
Yeah, they have a real they have some really elaborate

675
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,960
I mean, I I tell you was as soon as I walked in I found it to be very pleasurable

676
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,180
Because it's some of it's like some of the high-end casinos in Las Vegas where they pump this

677
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,500
Smell of fresh sea air, I guess they have a concoction

678
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,640
you know have you been to any of the these casinos where it smells like you know when you go to the beach you have

679
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,020
That salty fresh air and the the faint smell of cocoa butter

680
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,440
suntan lotion in the background, you know

681
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,560
It's kind of pleasurable and you walk into this mall and the ventilation is very the air is very fresh almost perfumy

682
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,860
But not sickly pleasurable and I'm walking through there and I'm looking at the way

683
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,940
People looked and how they oh, man, I was just humanity you're in really but anyway

684
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,840
I was in quite a shock, but and I looked at what people wearing on their feet and you know

685
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,380
There's a big fat about these things called sneakers. I guess like what do they call them running shoes and other things, right?

686
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,240
Yeah, those things are not very good for your feet. There's a few I've actually purchased one years ago. That is a

687
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:46,700
Forgot the name of the company, but it was purely ergonomic. I mean the laces don't go up the middle

688
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,100
They kind of go on a diagonal the cover, you know

689
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:55,160
Because the top of the foot is not high up across the middle the last kind of turns towards the ankle, right?

690
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,480
And they're they're very ergonomic

691
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,740
But most of these shoes that I see these people don't look like they're walking to this around on earth

692
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,760
They look like they're ready to walk on the moon

693
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,240
With them, you know

694
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,560
Yeah, those things that yeah, so

695
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,300
Yeah, even those I and I've seen some that's been a fact where they wear them with no laces or not

696
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,360
I'd you can't run in that either folks. So and then some of the high-heeled shoes. I've seen women wear

697
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,080
Things like that, I'm not saying don't necessarily get them but have you ever seen even in

698
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,780
Shown and memorialized in film where there's a scene where there's let's say

699
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,020
Some well-dressed people let's say in an evening affair and though and it's time for everyone to run because the the big monsters coming

700
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,440
And the women take their shoes off and run barefoot, right?

701
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,520
Yes

702
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:50,260
So there's always going to be a need that you should have very functional shoes and the food of course take more time and

703
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,480
Make your abode or where you rest your head for a third of your life when you're sleeping

704
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,860
And we're not talking about those other people that partake in really

705
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:05,780
Substances and lifestyles that where they don't sleep used to that will and by the way, you can never make up for lost sleep

706
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,760
Once the body is taxed or degraded from it

707
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,240
You can sort of recover from that condition, but it never you could never you see right

708
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,000
You could never really recover from even though you might get a little bit better and seem better

709
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's it's very important to get that rest

710
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,080
So yeah, so you see we can actually continue

711
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,560
We could have done an hour just on food an hour just on clothes in an hour just on the house, but I think

712
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,240
Putting a little thing like this together

713
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,700
where we just

714
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,980
It I wouldn't say it's really happy talk

715
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,760
I wouldn't say it's doom and gloom, but I would say that it's very practical that anyone everyone is

716
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,300
yeah, and I need to think about these things more than they than their thought a lot of the

717
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:55,060
People these days are going to the internet and they're thinking looking for what's called current events politics or things that share their point of

718
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,840
View, but I noticed there is extremely lacking on how to make their lives better

719
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,680
And and a lot of people have mistaken, you know going and getting a product like some special drops that they take

720
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,140
or some powder or

721
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,520
You know, whatever

722
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,740
Joining a website or whatever is going to improve their life quality

723
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:20,900
if you don't have a concept of good food preparation and actually taking the time and good good shoes you could walk in and a

724
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,140
Very comfortable house. You're you're yeah, you're not

725
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,140
Being dummy loaded so there's much to do again uncommon radio.com you'll find

726
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:40,980
Archives perhaps under with the Greek and Seth Michael on the perfect rice is the episode and the one following that also we discussed food

727
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,280
Had gotten a lot of feedback on

728
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,960
People preparing the perfect rice where they were just definitely scared of making rice

729
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,520
It was whenever they try to make rice Lee having to go given it a crack at making that. Oh

730
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,320
Yeah, I've gotten many many responses back. That was terrified of making rice whenever I do it

731
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,940
It was just a lump of starch and this is just perfect

732
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,020
Also the stove pot we actually had a caller in on Ocelli in the Greek about

733
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:13,100
I told the wife about the potatoes and that's how she does them from now on, you know, the stovetop baked versus, you know, and

734
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,520
You know just

735
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,700
Certain preparations also when you're let's say cooking a pot of beans or a stew or a soup

736
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,260
From scratch you ever notice when you initially bring it to a boil

737
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,140
There is like a froth or a scum that comes to the top of the pot

738
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,400
None of that. Yes

739
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:32,800
Yeah, you want to scoop that off? Maybe one not only once but twice but three times

740
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,760
There's a joke in America where if you eat beans, you're supposedly it's supposed to bake you gassy. Have you ever heard of that?

741
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,960
Where in Latin cultures that is not to joke

742
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,480
They don't even consider it because they tend to take these things in consideration

743
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:53,220
Whenever someone jokes about eating beans and having being gassy or flatulent is because they don't know how to prepare them properly

744
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:59,320
And the preparation thereof whether there can be prepared or from scratch

745
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:06,400
When you initially bring the pot to a boil, you'll notice this whatever you cook. There's a froth that comes to the top. What is that?

746
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,620
Skim that off. That is the the gas that's being produced in the liquid

747
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,840
And if you don't skim it off that will that will probably sink that

748
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:21,420
Constituent will go back into the pot and when you eat it, it will make you gassy or heartburn or indigestion

749
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,860
So just skim it off whether it's a chicken soup or a beef stew or a vegetable soup or beans

750
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,400
when you initially bring it to a simmer and you when you bring it to a simmer depending on how big the pot is you

751
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,500
Want to wait a little bit because that initial simmer is just the outer edges of the pot bringing that you want all of the material

752
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,200
Too that's why sometimes a three-time

753
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,780
Skim is a good procedure

754
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:50,800
Separating the weight from the chef and that's just the chef as well and just reusing it like it where the crap

755
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,280
Can be yeah

756
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:01,600
so these these are some of the tips on the stove pot baked potatoes versus and also how to prepare flatbread and the perfect rice and

757
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,520
So put on your running shoes and check those archives

758
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,240
I

759
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,180
Brought up with Ocelli in the Greek going over food again

760
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:14,180
And I asked Chuck whether we should cover those again or direct people to the archives and suggest

761
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,760
Both people go to the archives. Otherwise, we might be redundant, right?

762
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,260
But see we'll see how we

763
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:24,240
Fair on that. Maybe I'll do a review on those food

764
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,540
Shows, let's say and see what else could be added or taken away

765
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,140
But food clothing and shelter. Yeah

766
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,480
Okay, so

767
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:54,060
Again soon. Thank you for your time. Yes. Thanks for Rico. Ciao
