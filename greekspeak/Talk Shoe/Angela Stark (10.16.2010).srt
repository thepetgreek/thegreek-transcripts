1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:12,100
Great, Angela, thanks very much for persevering for all this time.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,260
I came on about an hour and a half ago, as a long-time listener and a first-time caller,

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,960
and I just want to thank you personally for what you're doing.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,920
And my purpose of calling...

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,200
Oh, it's my pleasure.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,760
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,480
Great, and I'm calling because I share the same heritage as the fellow, I think his name

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,380
is Greg, the Greek?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,440
Yes.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,480
That's on?

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,600
And what's interesting, I came on the call about an hour and a half ago, and I was listening

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,860
to your explanation of your history and past, and just on a personal note, very quickly,

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,240
I've traced my lineage back to Titus, and actually one of the family names in my lineage

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,940
is Apostolakis, which actually means descendant of the Apostle.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,280
And I've awakened about 10 years ago, finding out what's going on, and I've been a student

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,440
of the Bible, and I got into it because of law, and then I found out pretty much everything

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,600
in it is true, and it's not a religious document whatsoever.

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,460
And I've been studying and teaching Greek and Hebrew, because it's very easy to learn

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,240
those languages.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,380
If you look at the Greek and Hebrew, most people are afraid of it, but all you have

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,800
to do is download a coloring book for four-year-olds, color those letters for a few days, and they'll

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,760
be familiar, right?

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,940
And you can actually end up reading it in a few days, and that's an organic way of learning.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,880
You're not going to learn a language from Rosetta Stone.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,020
I speak five different languages, and I've taught myself in just a matter of days or weeks,

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,960
by just downloading a coloring book or a child's primer in that particular country, and that's

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,280
the organic way of doing it, because that's how you learn a language, unless you brought

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,300
it up in the jungle, right?

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,820
And I just wanted to also see if there's a way to get in touch with you.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,740
I have a lot of information regarding prophecy and proper interpretation of Scripture.

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,300
Is there a way to get in touch with you, to perhaps lend you this information, because

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,100
a lot of it is not for what I call public consumption.

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,700
Sure, sure, yeah.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:30,420
My email address is my initials, gptruth, for Greg Pappas, and it's at gmail.com.

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,160
gptruth at gmail.com?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,740
Right, and my family name is Papavassilopoulos.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh, okay, Papavassilopoulos, that's the father of the king.

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,820
Right.

39
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,520
So, on a personal level, am I allowed to speak Greek?

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,540
Poly-legal, very little.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,460
Okay, okay.

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,660
You can teach me the Greek that I never learned.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,960
I dropped out of Greek school when I was a kid because I pissed off the priests, okay?

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,980
Oh, that's fine.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
I hope you were never a kid, because kids are goats.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,200
You mean a child.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,140
When I was a child, I rebelled against the formalities of religion.

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,400
My first name, Gregory, obviously means watchman.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,860
My whole life, I've always had this propensity to find answers, and for some reason,

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,040
all the kids I was in Greek school with at the Greek church just drove me crazy,

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,860
and I couldn't get out of there.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,200
And they were all so petty, little.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,220
You start knowing that there are certain people that are more of an indigo nature

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,880
than others that didn't understand that concept back then,

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,420
but I now understand those that are on the spiritual path

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,760
and are seeking the truth no matter where it leads them

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,220
are a little bit different than the average guy out there.

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,820
Thank you, and again, this call has been very long.

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,260
And something for your listeners, Angela, I just wanted to say to everyone,

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,200
we need to look at the cause, not the symptom.

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,520
I like listening to a lot of the calls, but they're addressing the symptoms.

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,060
And on a very quick note, the cause is based on this.

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,820
Everyone understands that knowledge is power.

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,820
So that means that people in power have a certain knowledge

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,180
that others don't, correct?

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,000
And that knowledge is that we do not live in a universe.

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,100
We live in what I call a multiverse.

68
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,540
There are many layers to it.

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,160
And they have knowledge of the spiritual world that is not taught.

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,940
And this outline is in scripture.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,200
I don't want to say the Bible, and I heard Greg say earlier

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,240
that they've taken the divine names and turned them into titles of English nobility.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,780
I've done a lot of research.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,060
Here in Arizona, we have a library in the university that's a lot of books

75
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,080
that were bequeathed by wealthy sunbirds that came here.

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,140
And no one reads them.

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,240
And I found some very interesting books.

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,160
And I can tell you, after 10 years of research,

79
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,600
everything that can be known was known over 200 years ago,

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,720
or I'd say about 150 years ago, in science, math, physics, and all this.

81
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,440
And the stuff has been buried away, and everything's been convoluted.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,620
And along this path, I found out how to understand the meaning of words.

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,420
And by listening to the callers, and they use words like justice, for example.

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,500
When you read the Constitution, it says they wanted to establish justice.

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,980
Well, not to offend anyone, but this might be news to most, not to some,

86
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,580
justice has nothing to do with law.

87
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,740
Justicia is an ancient religion.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,460
It is a revival of an ancient religion.

89
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,020
It's a statue of a woman carrying scales and a sword.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,780
It has nothing to do with law.

91
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,420
So beware, people.

92
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,060
Justice has nothing to do with law.

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,280
It's in the name of law.

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,360
It is a different type of law.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,840
In short, I tell people, if you do not understand the relationships

96
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,140
of cannibals, birthdays, and dolls, you will not understand this society.

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,280
People say, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

98
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
And when I explain it to them, they are floored.

99
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,580
And if I do explain it on this call, it might offend some people.

100
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,460
And the intent is not to offend, but inform.

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,660
And this is the knowledge that is being held.

102
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,980
What they are doing, they understand we live in a multiverse,

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,880
and the spiritual world affects the physical world.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,620
Just like, for example, there are very toxic gases

105
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,860
that are odorless, tasteless, and colorless.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
And you can put that in a room of people, and everyone will die.

107
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,260
And no one will even know.

108
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,980
The spiritual world operates on that level.

109
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,220
And really quick, what cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,900
is in the ancient Mesopotamian societies about 5000 years ago,

111
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,860
during the times of Noah, let's say, for those who have read scripture,

112
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,740
it was a primarily agricultural society.

113
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,480
And when things didn't go well, they had these guys called,

114
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,880
they had a little idol called Baal, or Baal, that people were told to worship.

115
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,640
And the priests of Baal were called the Qahans of Baal.

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,620
And they told the people, if you wanted prosperity,

117
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,800
you brought a young child to us.

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,780
And what they did is they put him up on an altar,

119
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,000
and they killed the child. They sacrificed him to Baal.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,400
And everyone, including the parents, partook in the ceremony,

121
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,960
and they each ate a little piece of flesh and drank a little bit of blood.

122
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,020
That's why eating of human flesh is called Qahan Baalism.

123
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,440
In other words, cannibalism. Just take out the H.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Now when the parents went home, all the other children would say,

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
where's our brother? Where's our sister?

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,880
But the altar boys of the Qahan Baal, or the cannibal,

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,700
made an effigy of a child, which is a small doll.

128
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,320
And they said, give this to the other children to play with.

129
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
And they'll forget about the child.

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,420
So now you know the history of dolls.

131
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,820
And if you ask a mother, why do you give a doll to your child,

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,700
she doesn't know.

133
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,560
But the Puritans and the Quakers, when they first came here

134
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,040
and they saw a family giving their child a doll,

135
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,220
they knocked on the door and said, we're going to raze your house in 15 minutes.

136
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,440
In other words, we're going to burn your house down

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,540
because you're involved in human sacrifice.

138
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,760
You can either choose to stay in or leave, but we're going to purge you from here.

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,680
So now you know the history of dolls.

140
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
It's very macabre.

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,540
The powers that be worship the adversary, and they feed on negative energy.

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,600
And they don't care whether you know it or not, as long as you do it.

143
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, obviously, that's not going to bring you prosperity.

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,559
So next year, you come back and you bring another child.

145
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,000
And if they keep taking all the children, someone's going to figure it out

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,179
and they're going to run them out of town, which they were run out of town many times.

147
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,140
So the Qahan Baal, the priest of the Lord,

148
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,460
that's why in today's churches, the priest tells you to worship the Lord, which is Baal.

149
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,720
Again, not to offend anyone, but we have to be very careful what we're being directed here.

150
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,180
Well, next year, again, they bring the child back and the Qahan Baal, accountable, says,

151
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,220
you know, instead of taking this child, why don't you go home and put him in a tall chair

152
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,760
and give him a pointy hat like we wear and bake a loaf of sweet bread

153
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,980
and put candles in it, ask the child to make a loaf, a wish of prosperity,

154
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,260
to blow out the lights, which symbolizes taking the life out.

155
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,120
And then everyone eats a piece of the sweet bread, which represents the body.

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,760
And to show that this wish of prosperity works, everyone attending the ceremony has to bring a present.

157
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,260
Now, if that doesn't sound like a birthday cake celebration to me, I don't know what does.

158
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,260
And I read this in a little tiny book that was published in the 1820s.

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,600
Now, what do you, what do you, I think this book escaped the incinerator.

160
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,410
Now, what we're doing is absolutely, we are a sick society.

161
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,610
And if you read scripture, you know, voting doesn't matter.

162
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,250
The Creator puts the leaders in and he says, I will put the leaders in based on how evil the society is.

163
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,710
So if you see a society that has a horrible leader, that is a very evil society.

164
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,630
And I'm not saying this to offend anyone. I'm just saying it to inform.

165
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,190
And now, the thing about the truth is it doesn't have prejudice.

166
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,150
In other words, the truth is the truth.

167
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,250
And if it offends anyone, it's not meant.

168
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,210
But again, in scripture, someone who knows the law cannot be offended.

169
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,270
Right.

170
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,710
Right, because if, you know, you got a big bump on your head and it looks ugly,

171
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,390
if someone says you got a big bump on your head and you know it, well, thank you for telling me.

172
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,890
Or if you didn't know, you thank them because now you know.

173
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,590
Instead of saying, why are you making fun of the bump on my head or something.

174
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,770
So these things, I've done a lot of research I've got.

175
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:59,370
I can have reams of information and I can take up 14 conference calls on things that I've discovered.

176
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,130
And sitting here, very few people want to hear this kind of information.

177
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,490
Oh, you'd be surprised.

178
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,490
You'd be surprised.

179
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,150
Yeah, I want this.

180
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,930
This is ancient.

181
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,570
Now, when you read the scripture, it talks about mystery, Babylon, the revival of an ancient religion.

182
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,830
Very little is talked about the times of Noah.

183
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,250
Now, whether you believe in scripture or not is irrelevant.

184
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,710
You'd have to go back to the epic of Gilgamesh King first.

185
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,390
Well, here, this is my perspective.

186
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:41,670
I'm one of the few people that I know that has a very accurate perspective and interpretation of prophecy.

187
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,520
In other words, very specific stuff.

188
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,210
And I see it and my track record is impeccable.

189
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,890
And this is the logic behind it.

190
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,750
The future minus the past equals the present.

191
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,690
So you don't know where you are unless you know the future and the past.

192
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,730
It's basic math.

193
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,650
So, you know, everyone's going around scratching their head and I'm saying,

194
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,850
well, this is going to happen, this is going to happen, and this is going to happen, and it's happening.

195
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:16,070
You know, when I go out and speak in public on this, I'm just this crazy guy that everyone's wondering what I'm saying is true.

196
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,610
Just like a prophet.

197
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,050
Nobody will call you crazy in our groups.

198
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,290
So this is, I can go into some real interesting detail.

199
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,150
I know that people would like to hear it, but here's the other kicker to this.

200
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:39,390
This information, this kind of stuff, you can't, from a spiritual level, unless you're prepared and you walk a certain path,

201
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,090
you don't pick it, it picks you.

202
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,790
You have no choice in the matter.

203
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,190
See, ten years ago, if you gave me a Bible, I said, what?

204
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,670
That's written by Shakespeare.

205
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,490
Throw that away.

206
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,850
God, what are you talking about?

207
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,930
Creator, what are you, delusional or something?

208
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,490
So I went to a seminar here where someone was explaining there is no money and this is a mortgage is a fraud,

209
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,250
and I was like, what?

210
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,950
No one ever told me this.

211
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,970
He says, well, man makes statutes and codes and the creator makes law.

212
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,990
And I'm like, wait a second, where do I get law?

213
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,210
He says, you've got to go to the Bible.

214
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,390
I said, no way.

215
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,330
That book?

216
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,850
You've got to be kidding.

217
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,790
So I read it just for the law and then I started reading that everything the scripture,

218
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,330
pretty much all the information contained was contrary to what man was teaching.

219
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,010
Now, man was teaching contrary to scripture.

220
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,190
Now, if you're seeking the truth and you have two different opinions or bodies of information,

221
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,070
only two things can be true.

222
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,530
Either they're both wrong or one of them is right.

223
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,750
So I put them both down and I started researching man's system and then the scriptural system.

224
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,230
And I've written many things and, for example, the creator's economy is different than man

225
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,670
and the adversary's economy.

226
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,230
When I say economy, it's a Greek word meaning the management of the house.

227
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,850
That's literally what it means.

228
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,890
Eko means house and nomos means the rules of the house.

229
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:05,450
In the father's economy, you have gold and silver and substance for trade, balanced scales,

230
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,390
no cheating, you have certain laws, you have certain ways of cultivating your crops.

231
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:18,070
One of the reasons this country will never prosper is because they don't let the fields go fallow

232
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,110
every seven years.

233
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,650
They just keep farming and farming and farming.

234
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,870
This is a very small example.

235
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,290
That's not even one hundredth of one percent of why.

236
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,230
I can give you 10,000 reasons why we're in deep doo-doo.

237
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,670
Don't have to be, but we are on a very practical level.

238
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,190
And another thing, just to segue a little bit of information,

239
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,470
because I don't want to get into things.

240
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,470
There's a million websites following the creator's law,

241
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,870
but the stuff that I've researched and I have stored up information,

242
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,550
there's nothing on it online.

243
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,610
Absolutely nothing.

244
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,750
And I'm not about to put it on online right now.

245
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,530
It's not ready.

246
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,850
The time isn't right now exactly.

247
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,310
It'll be ready in seven years.

248
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,830
I hate to say that, but I wouldn't mind coming on a conference call and giving it.

249
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,690
You should do it.

250
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,550
You should do it.

251
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:17,390
And because, you know, what you said, you said a great number of very profound things,

252
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,550
and the history behind everything.

253
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,590
And you said something that really got me.

254
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,310
You're compelled.

255
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,490
I've been compelled to this thing my whole life.

256
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:32,450
I was in Vestal in 1983, and I was visiting a friend up on the top of the hill above the city,

257
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,130
and I was staying at a hotel down on the port.

258
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,330
And we spent 12 hours together going over why it was that I needed to come to Greece

259
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,170
and work with this ministry at the time that was with Campus Crusade for Christ,

260
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,530
and they tried to convince me why I needed to be there.

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,890
I had already applied to go to seminary when I got back in August,

262
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,690
and I got to Greece on a variety of things that happened.

263
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,090
It was a very strangely orchestrated thing by the creator.

264
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,650
I would not have been there otherwise that summer.

265
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,790
Anyways, the long and short of it is that I'd been asking, ever since I was a kid,

266
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,550
for the revealing of the answers to me, that I'd understand what's going on,

267
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,230
how does this world work, and what are we all here for?

268
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,930
Are we all here to be somebody else's slaves?

269
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,770
Are we here to be free?

270
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,910
Is this a growth process?

271
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,430
I knew it was something beyond what religion taught,

272
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,230
because religion within the Orthodox and the Protestant tradition was, to me,

273
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,930
largely designed to keep all the slave workers in line

274
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,270
and not to allow us to rise to the level that we're supposed to be.

275
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,130
I never took a regular job.

276
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,770
When I got out of college, I applied for corporate jobs

277
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,070
and saw how horribly miserable these people were

278
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,750
and didn't take a regular job and sought out to find the answers to life.

279
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,250
When I went to seminary, I never actually ever said I was going to be a pastor

280
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,170
or a missionary or anything.

281
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:47,950
People kept asking me,

282
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,730
well, what are you going to be when you get out of here?

283
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,330
I said, I don't know.

284
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,950
I'm only here to find the truth, not to become anything.

285
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,730
I just want to know the truth.

286
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,730
You're not going to find it in seminary though, sorry.

287
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,310
I know, I quit.

288
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,210
I quit seminary halfway through.

289
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,350
I went out and started my own study.

290
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,849
I've studied philosophy and I'll direct people to de-philosophers.

291
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,550
I've studied a lot of things.

292
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,690
I understand that we are one with each other.

293
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,150
I understand that we're one with the universe.

294
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,010
I understand the power that's in us if we just wake up

295
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,310
and figure out what our pre-life purpose was before we got here.

296
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,869
Anyways, I put out a big question to the Creator,

297
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:21,910
and I got an answer.

298
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,630
I'd like to contact...

299
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,430
I'm going to interrupt.

300
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,010
I'd like to contact you and maybe give you some of this information.

301
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,210
Some of it is so profound that if I did speak it on this call,

302
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,730
some of the people might go and throw up,

303
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,710
and a whole bunch of other people might just freak out.

304
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,610
It's that kind of information.

305
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,130
Have you seen the movie The Fifth Element, anyone?

306
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,430
Yeah.

307
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,890
Yeah, okay.

308
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,550
That's my life.

309
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,790
Who's in it?

310
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
That's what's going on.

311
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,830
It's very close.

312
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,830
There's some stuff going on that...

313
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,690
My purpose is not to go to the average person on the street

314
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,430
or, let's say, on a call,

315
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,350
not to belittle or try to remain humble.

316
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,230
This information has to go to the leaders of the world.

317
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,450
Yes.

318
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,070
Because this is very specific.

319
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,850
I'm talking about...

320
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,930
For example,

321
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,570
the people are so brainwashed that the clock on your wall

322
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,610
and that calendar is totally false,

323
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,910
and I'll prove it to you right now.

324
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,470
It's so simple.

325
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,990
If you really want to wake up, even though it's been four hours,

326
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,890
this will be like drinking four espressos in a row.

327
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:28,910
Go ahead.

328
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,290
Okay.

329
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,230
Sept is the prefix for seven.

330
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,650
Oct is the prefix for eight, like octagon.

331
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,010
Nov is the prefix for nine,

332
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,990
and dec is decimal, meaning ten.

333
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,790
So why is...

334
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,410
If December is the tenth month,

335
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,650
why are they telling everyone it's the twelfth month?

336
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,090
Why is November the eleventh when it's really the ninth month?

337
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,770
Why is October the...

338
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,670
You see, it's right in front of your face.

339
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,430
September is the seventh month.

340
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,810
It's right in your face, and no one...

341
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,670
is saying,

342
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,510
wait a second, this is erroneous.

343
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,450
This is more erroneous than the straw man.

344
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,010
Give us the punchline.

345
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,450
Okay, the punchline is we don't even know how to keep time

346
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,430
with nature.

347
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,630
This is a multiverse.

348
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,630
When you read about prayer

349
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,770
and scripture,

350
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,690
that is a technology like someone setting up an antenna.

351
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,450
Yes.

352
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,510
And there's timing in there.

353
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,030
Now, if you're reading scripture,

354
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,430
if anyone's ever read it,

355
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,070
it says, these are my appointed times.

356
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,630
These are my appointed times, yes?

357
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,010
That's how they translate it in English.

358
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,190
It's moed and moedim in Hebrew.

359
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,290
Right?

360
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,470
If you read it, it says, these are my appointed times.

361
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,570
How many times can you miss an appointment

362
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,710
with someone when they kind of, you know,

363
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,030
say, well, this guy's not serious?

364
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,350
Yeah, really.

365
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,170
Do you see my point?

366
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,830
Now, again, knowledge is power,

367
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,830
and this kind of information is held by those in power.

368
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,310
But they're doing these procedures,

369
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,770
there's procedure involved.

370
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,970
And they're doing it for another character.

371
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,970
Now, I'm going to drop maybe,

372
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,470
with Angela's permission,

373
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,350
can I drop a bombshell of information?

374
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,010
Oh, please do.

375
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,870
I did some research on this ancient religion

376
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,730
that existed 5,000 years ago that was wiped out.

377
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:18,210
It was revived partially around the 4th century

378
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,750
and it's been revived in earnest in the past 50 years.

379
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,390
When I mean in earnest, I mean with turbochargers on it.

380
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,250
And this religion, for lack of a better name,

381
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,990
is called science.

382
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,210
Now, let me explain.

383
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,710
Let me explain why it's a religion.

384
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,390
The way they drag you in is by receiving a benefit.

385
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,130
A cell phone, a computer,

386
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,570
TV, you know, nanotechnology, whatever.

387
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,030
But that is not the purpose of science.

388
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,410
The purpose of science,

389
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,670
you know the white lab coats on the stethoscopes?

390
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,690
I've traced that back to 5,000 years.

391
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,630
There was a group of people that wore,

392
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,110
they tried to mimic the temple priests,

393
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,750
but I don't want to get into that detail.

394
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,230
Science basically teaches that man and woman

395
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,210
once was godlike.

396
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,870
And in that godlike state,

397
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,950
this is an ancient religion that's revived now.

398
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,670
In that godlike state,

399
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,750
they were hermaphroditic, meaning they had both sexes.

400
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,670
Or they were asexual, no sexual gender at all.

401
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,710
And what science teaches

402
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,930
is that in order for man to attain that godlike state,

403
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,690
what you need to do is have male with male unions

404
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,090
and the males become fertile and become drones.

405
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,350
And you have female with female unions.

406
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,170
And the females become emasculated

407
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,750
and they procreate children without man.

408
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,090
And the procreation,

409
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,110
the product of that female with female union,

410
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,790
will be hermaphroditic or asexual child.

411
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,230
So I just gave you a little bit of prophecy

412
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,850
that you're going to start seeing this

413
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,930
happening within the next decade.

414
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,750
So you know where you heard it here.

415
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,390
What's your name?

416
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,650
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

417
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,510
What is your name?

418
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,130
My name?

419
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,590
I don't know if I want to disclose.

420
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,390
Actually, a lot of people did know of me.

421
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,770
Well, if I want to get in touch with you,

422
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,830
would you email me or something?

423
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,490
Well, I'll message you an email and you'll give me a name.

424
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,090
How's that?

425
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,710
Oh, that would be wonderful.

426
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,270
I think you will like it.

427
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,470
I can have so many,

428
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,650
I don't know if the science was really a bombshell.

429
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,530
I was holding it back.

430
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,510
I do have some bombshell material that,

431
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,670
I don't know if people want to be woken up.

432
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,130
Yeah, I want more bombshell stuff.

433
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,210
But hermaphrodite would then reference,

434
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,230
you're not talking about a female,

435
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,230
some of these people that have been born with genitalia.

436
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,970
Yeah, that's what he's talking about, yes.

437
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,350
Actually, when I started teaching this,

438
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,530
exposing this,

439
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,950
there was a man in Britain

440
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,370
that actually legally is considered asexual.

441
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,150
He went from a man to a female sex change.

442
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,390
He wanted to go back to a man,

443
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,350
and they botched it up,

444
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,330
and he can't be neither.

445
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,610
In other words, they hollowed him out completely.

446
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,050
So he legally is genderless.

447
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,290
There is one genderless person.

448
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,550
What's that?

449
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,690
You're saying that both parts worked?

450
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:12,810
No.

451
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,930
There's a genderless being,

452
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,230
a legal genderless being right now

453
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,270
recognized by the British or English.

454
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,430
The English and British are not the same

455
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,310
as most people know.

456
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,050
Right.

457
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,690
There's a registered genderless

458
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,630
status being in England.

459
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,570
You could go look it up.

460
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,490
But what I'm saying,

461
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,350
this is a product of what I'm talking about,

462
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,130
but it's not going to happen that way.

463
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,330
It's going to be through birth,

464
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,450
or being born.

465
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,530
You're going to see this in the near future.

466
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,790
Well, there's many a hermaphrodite

467
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,710
that have been born already.

468
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,950
Yeah, but what they want to do

469
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,630
is produce a society of that.

470
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,710
Wow.

471
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,430
And this is coming,

472
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,010
but this is,

473
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,870
that's actually,

474
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,690
there's other stuff.

475
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,590
A lot of the bombshell stuff is,

476
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,250
you see,

477
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,290
people complain about the government,

478
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,970
but they don't know

479
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,690
who the government really is, really.

480
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,750
You know, it's a corporation.

481
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,670
You think they're aliens.

482
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,690
We know it's a corporation.

483
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,990
It's an organized crime syndicate

484
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,630
is actually what it is.

485
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,230
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,490
It's in name only,

487
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,050
but let me drop something on you,

488
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,950
and you're going to think about it.

489
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,290
It's going to cause a little bit of thinking.

490
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,330
Okay, let's say you've got a country

491
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,070
with churches,

492
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,510
and you have a particular religion entrenched,

493
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,790
right,

494
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,050
like Protestantism or Catholicism in Italy,

495
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,810
right, let's say.

496
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,130
Now, the government is overthrown,

497
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,190
what people call the government,

498
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,150
and they get a new government,

499
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,270
just like that old song,

500
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,730
and here comes the new boss,

501
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,850
same as the old boss, right?

502
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,750
Right, right.

503
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,230
And it goes over and over,

504
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,230
and the cycle keeps going.

505
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,150
That's why it's a revolution.

506
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,570
It goes over and over and over.

507
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,210
But everyone fails to notice

508
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,750
that these churches and cathedrals

509
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,530
are still here,

510
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,450
and it's the same thing.

511
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,410
They are the government.

512
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,730
Right, they are.

513
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,810
The religion,

514
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,430
when the religion,

515
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,410
for example,

516
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,870
you know how they painted the Muslims

517
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,570
as, you know,

518
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,490
hating the Jews

519
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,630
and hating the white,

520
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:51,970
you know,

521
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,310
Western culture or whatever?

522
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,630
I read the Koran,

523
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,990
and there are verses in the Koran

524
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,830
that tells, commands the Muslim

525
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,070
if he goes against anyone

526
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,790
that is of Israelite descent

527
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,590
or their land,

528
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,570
they're going to be cursed.

529
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,270
And I know some Muslims,

530
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,930
and I read these verses,

531
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,910
and they say,

532
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,750
and I ask them,

533
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,550
where does this come from?

534
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,090
And they're like,

535
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,630
I don't know.

536
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,850
I say,

537
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,990
this is from your own book.

538
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,990
You don't even read it?

539
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,410
And these imams

540
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,290
and these priests,

541
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:18,770
you see,

542
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,090
I had a business

543
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,990
and another business next to me

544
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,910
sold sporting goods,

545
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,010
and I walked in one day,

546
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,950
this was years ago,

547
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,930
and I said,

548
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,190
hey,

549
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,490
how many of those baseball bats

550
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,570
do you sell every month?

551
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:29,970
And he said,

552
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,010
I sell a lot of them.

553
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:31,810
I said,

554
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,190
okay,

555
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,010
how many of the baseball bats

556
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,510
that you sell

557
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,510
are actually being used

558
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,090
for baseball?

559
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,290
He says,

560
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,470
you know,

561
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,810
I never thought about that.

562
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,790
You know why?

563
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,770
Because baseballs

564
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,770
make a great club.

565
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,050
I mean,

566
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,650
baseball bats

567
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,270
make a great,

568
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,410
inexpensive club.

569
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,370
People put them

570
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,130
in their backseat.

571
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,950
Every store owner

572
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,490
has got one.

573
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,930
Old ladies buy them.

574
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,050
Okay,

575
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,950
that's how they're using

576
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,250
the Koran and the Bible.

577
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,150
The Koran actually

578
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,850
was written by Hebrew rabbis

579
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,450
at night.

580
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,130
I'm not going to get into that.

581
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,510
But the scripture,

582
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,550
when you see someone

583
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,490
walk into a room

584
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,270
wearing black,

585
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,050
carrying the Bible,

586
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,790
he's using that on you

587
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,690
like a baseball bat.

588
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,310
He doesn't know

589
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,290
anything in there

590
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,030
at all.

591
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,190
That's right.

592
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,030
It's an intimidation.

593
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,430
That's right.

594
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,390
It's all intimidation

595
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,950
to the ignorant.

596
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,550
You got it.

597
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,270
If you study Christianity,

598
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,050
that was born

599
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,430
around 400 AD

600
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,690
by a man

601
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,750
named Constantine.

602
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,030
325.

603
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,670
325.

604
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,470
And it wasn't

605
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,150
the Romans

606
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,670
that threw

607
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,990
the Christians

608
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,970
to the lions.

609
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,530
The real history

610
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,130
in that

611
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,790
is that the Christians

612
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,390
were throwing

613
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:31,990
the Bible

614
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,630
and the followers

615
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,670
to the lions.

616
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,510
Christians have been around

617
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,210
for a very,

618
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,190
very long time.

619
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,670
I've clocked those guys

620
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,190
back to 3500 years

621
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,590
already.

622
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,210
It has nothing

623
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,870
to do

624
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,750
with the scriptures.

625
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,390
And Constantine,

626
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,610
around 300 to,

627
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,130
you know,

628
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,250
386 or so,

629
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,590
when they had

630
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,350
all these councils,

631
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,610
he was the Walt Disney

632
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,330
of his day.

633
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,930
You know how you have

634
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,730
Pixar pictures

635
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,890
and all the special effects?

636
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,130
That's how he got

637
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,870
people in.

638
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,110
For example,

639
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:03,650
again,

640
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,570
not to offend,

641
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,830
if you read

642
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,390
the Bible

643
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,350
forensically,

644
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,690
in other words,

645
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,330
you haven't watched

646
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,890
those gifs

647
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,490
of the movie,

648
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,850
the conference is

649
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,350
scheduled to be

650
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:12,910
broken down

651
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,150
automatically in

652
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,810
5 minutes.

653
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,750
To extend the time

654
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,630
by 60 minutes,

655
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,750
press star 8.

656
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:21,530
Uh,

657
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,450
I don't know how

658
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,070
Oh, sorry.

659
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:23,710
Angela,

660
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,650
I'd like to shoot you

661
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,210
an email

662
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,530
and maybe we can

663
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,790
speak and I'd love

664
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,070
to speak with Greg

665
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,510
as well.

666
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,410
And I've got some

667
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,710
stuff that maybe

668
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,630
shouldn't be said

669
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,390
right now.

670
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:33,670
Oh,

671
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,690
this is the time

672
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,330
for all these

673
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,050
things to come out.

674
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,010
This is the time.

675
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,490
Yeah,

676
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,770
contact me

677
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,590
and we'll set up

678
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,110
a call.

679
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:42,990
Well,

680
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,530
I'd love to

681
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,210
and I'd love to

682
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,170
also tell you

683
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,310
why I think

684
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,690
something shouldn't

685
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,050
be said.

686
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,670
And then you might

687
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:48,930
say,

688
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,250
hey,

689
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,810
you know what,

690
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,550
maybe you're

691
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,970
kind of right

692
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,690
about that one.

693
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,390
Or,

694
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,670
if you're

695
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:53,770
uh,

696
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,010
unintimidated,

697
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:55,750
if you feel like,

698
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,290
you know,

699
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,350
you want to just

700
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,090
go all the way,

701
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,710
I don't mind.

702
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,290
I've already been

703
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,410
down this rabbit hole.

704
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,490
I've been studying

705
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,490
for 10 years.

706
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,650
And I'm going to,

707
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,990
so you won't be

708
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,350
dropping any bombshells

709
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,770
on me,

710
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,250
but I'm always

711
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,130
willing to have

712
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,810
other people

713
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,610
wake up to,

714
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,970
I mean,

715
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,930
it's like part of

716
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,370
the deal,

717
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:14,770
you know,

718
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,510
learning this

719
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,390
esoteric stuff

720
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,730
is part of the deal.

721
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,430
You always wind up

722
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,150
on these paths

723
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,890
when you're

724
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,830
researching government

725
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,770
and the truth.

726
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,290
We've got to break

727
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,070
the image training.

728
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,370
You know,

729
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,170
you read the

730
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:27,650
Constitution,

731
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,770
I read that thing,

732
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,710
the first thing

733
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,570
that pops out of me

734
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,270
is to establish

735
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:31,870
justice,

736
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,770
holy crap,

737
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,130
what are they

738
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,490
talking,

739
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,210
this is horrible.

740
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:35,710
And then they

741
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,510
say the operation

742
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,290
of this document

743
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,290
is the law of nations,

744
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,350
that's merchant law.

745
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,470
And then it says

746
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,990
there are no more

747
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,350
slaves,

748
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,310
just U.S. citizens,

749
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:42,690
okay,

750
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,190
so instead of

751
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,790
calling you stupid,

752
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,490
I'll call you ignorant,

753
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,230
how do you like that?

754
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,850
That's exactly right,

755
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,710
even in Article 1,

756
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,350
Section 9,

757
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,170
Paragraph 1

758
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,370
talks about

759
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:50,850
the migration

760
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,610
and importation

761
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,110
of persons,

762
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,830
which is slavery.

763
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,590
It's right there

764
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,150
in the Constitution.

765
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,770
And there's some people

766
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,490
that I fed some

767
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,450
information a couple

768
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,110
of years back

769
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,690
and I showed them

770
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,090
about the

771
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,190
Uniform Slave Codes

772
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,270
of 1760,

773
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,070
because they wanted

774
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,090
Uniform Slave Codes,

775
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,450
because, you know,

776
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,950
if you had an

777
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,490
escaped slave

778
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,150
from one state,

779
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,030
it was death penalty

780
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,610
in one state,

781
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,210
not in another,

782
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,650
so you needed

783
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,750
a Uniform Slave Code.

784
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:10,990
And it actually

785
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,030
states that

786
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,070
when a slave

787
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,750
leaves 15 miles

788
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,770
beyond the plantation,

789
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,650
you need the passport.

790
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,670
Well, now you know

791
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,930
why the International Line

792
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,190
is set at 15 miles.

793
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,050
Yep.

794
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,390
Okay,

795
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:22,890
then it says...

796
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,870
Let me try to...

797
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,110
The slaves were white.

798
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,350
I'm going to

799
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,730
disconnect

800
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,050
and come back on

801
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,270
to see if that

802
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,630
does anything.

803
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,750
Maybe that'll

804
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,510
extend the call,

805
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,070
I don't know.

806
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,110
Otherwise,

807
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,290
it's going to

808
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,490
turn off

809
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,030
any minute.

810
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,130
Well, that's fine.

811
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,650
Either way,

812
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,870
I will try to

813
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,430
get in touch

814
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,150
with both of you.

815
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,370
Actually,

816
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:41,910
tonight I'll just

817
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,670
shoot you an email

818
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,410
and I'll bring up

819
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,250
the subject matter.

820
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,050
I'd love to...

821
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,670
Please do.

822
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,230
That would be great.

823
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,670
I've been sleeping

824
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,330
on this stuff

825
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,490
for almost a decade,

826
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,930
so I think it's time.

827
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,410
It sounds like

828
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:53,990
both of you

829
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,670
and Greg, too,

830
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,310
you're just like

831
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,110
bursting out

832
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,050
with this information.

833
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,610
That means it's

834
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,290
got to come out,

835
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,890
so I'm always

836
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,970
willing to facilitate.

837
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,610
If you say so.

838
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,810
It's your call.

839
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,170
Again,

840
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,410
I'd rather discuss

841
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,110
some of these things

842
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,710
with you first

843
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,250
or email them

844
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:07,510
and say,

845
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:07,710
hey,

846
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,230
maybe we don't

847
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,630
want to talk

848
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,250
about this one.

849
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,210
I think,

850
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,590
listen,

851
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,070
we're all

852
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,470
big boys and girls.

853
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,890
Those of us

854
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,810
that don't want

855
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,250
to hear it

856
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:16,990
can hang up.

857
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,990
I think the majority

858
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,670
of the people

859
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,190
want to hear

860
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,130
what you have to say.

861
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,870
We're all

862
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,750
wanting to

863
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,450
find the truth

864
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,930
and we have

865
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,730
an open mind

866
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,470
and we'll listen.

867
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,230
If we don't

868
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,510
agree,

869
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:28,930
fine.

870
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,530
If we do,

871
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,750
all the better,

872
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,230
right?

873
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,390
I agree.

874
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,690
Yeah,

875
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,010
it's time.

876
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,130
I'd like to

877
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:38,810
just preface

878
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,450
very quickly.

879
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,110
I want to talk

880
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,510
a little bit

881
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,250
about prophecy

882
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,250
that will astound you.

883
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,930
I'm not talking

884
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,810
about generalities

885
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,610
like all the crap

886
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,770
you see on television

887
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,970
or the Internet.

888
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,690
The Internet's

889
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,330
full of rubbish.

890
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,670
99% of the stuff

891
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,110
on the Internet

892
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,750
is rubbish.

893
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,210
I think everything

894
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,010
is foretold

895
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,650
in the Bible.

896
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,950
It's like instructions

897
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,010
on how

898
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,450
to carry them out.

899
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,910
The formula is

900
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,530
the future

901
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,690
minus the past

902
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,630
equals the now.

903
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,910
So if you're

904
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,130
missing the future,

905
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,890
you don't know

906
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,490
where you are.

907
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,410
And when man

908
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,050
writes history,

909
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,690
he writes about

910
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,230
the past.

911
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,230
When Yahweh

912
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,910
writes history,

913
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,570
he writes about

914
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,170
the future.

915
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:12,850
It's backwards.

916
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,390
We project

917
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,550
everything we see.

918
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,110
Right,

919
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,050
and also your intent.

920
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,850
The multiverse

921
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,550
operates on

922
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,270
several levels

923
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,270
and I'm not going

924
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,050
to give you theory

925
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,630
and opinion.

926
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm going to give

927
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,170
you stuff that

928
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:25,790
on the call

929
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,450
you can try

930
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,190
and it works.

931
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,470
I'm talking

932
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,650
about here

933
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,390
now stuff,

934
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,770
not the

935
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,830
material seminar

936
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,270
stuff,

937
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,790
or you got

938
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,110
to come

939
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,510
into my,

940
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,930
join my group

941
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,230
or something.

942
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,930
Right now,

943
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,950
if we do a call,

944
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,290
this second,

945
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:40,950
I'll show you

946
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,830
some technology

947
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,570
verbally that

948
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,070
you can do,

949
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,650
a four-year-old

950
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:43,950
can do,

951
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,270
and you will

952
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,950
see the effect

953
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,390
immediately.

954
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,830
It's like

955
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,790
pushing a spring.

956
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,890
When you have

957
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,770
a spring at rest,

958
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,250
when you have

959
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,090
a spring at rest,

960
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,570
and you push

961
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,010
down on it,

962
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,890
when you let it go,

963
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,350
it actually expands

964
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,530
longer than it was

965
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,030
at rest.

966
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,910
It actually creates

967
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,670
something that

968
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,050
shouldn't be

969
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,430
happening.

970
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,210
In physics,

971
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:02,610
it's called

972
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,290
period movement

973
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:03,850
and all that.

974
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:04,890
I'll show you

975
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,410
how to push

976
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,470
on this thing

977
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,850
that's in

978
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,210
tension,

979
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,910
just waiting.

980
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,390
I'll show you

981
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,110
how to push
