00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,050
Hi everyone, it's Thursday, October 21st, and tonight our special guest is the Greek.

2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:22,190
Maybe you heard him last week when we were on and he spoke a little bit about some esoteric things and Bible prophecy.

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,830
Hi Greek, how are you tonight?

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,410
Well hello Angela, and hello everyone. Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,070
Oh yes, looking forward to this one. I'm excited actually that you're on.

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,310
So you're going to fill our heads with all kinds of new things, right, that we've never heard about.

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,390
I hope so, in a good way.

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,150
I'm going to get some critical thinking going and powers of discernment,

9
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,890
and when we take in information we can process it right.

10
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,050
Not to say that I have the right way of processing it, but we all are so capable,

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:10,490
and I look around and I see just people operating not in a way that they can.

12
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,810
And it's kind of like you have a Ferrari and you're going down the road at 50 miles an hour all the time,

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,090
and I say, well this thing does 80 miles an hour in second gear, did you know that?

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,290
And it's like, well no, well there it is, go for it.

15
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,390
So we have a lot of potential and there's so much information to take in,

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:38,110
but all that information is not really useful unless you can use it or process it right.

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,050
And I came on the call and I wanted to get in touch with Greg because we have a similar heritage

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,370
and kind of give out some information along the lines.

19
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,930
And he did bring up the scripture and what people call the Bible,

20
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,090
and by the way the Bible just means the book.

21
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,330
And years ago they used to call it the good book, right?

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,790
It's kind of a cultural thing. I like to call it, I go between the Bible and the scriptures.

23
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,150
And I figured, well, if people are on this call for four hours and he's making biblical references

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,270
and they haven't thrown eggs and tomatoes yet,

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,570
maybe I can go on there and speak on the Bible a little bit one day.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,010
And here I am.

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,650
Well, have at it. Where would you like to begin? I know there's so much.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,750
What intrigued me about what you said was you mentioned something about the months,

29
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,350
like October and November and December and what those words mean,

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,250
but they don't correspond to what we think they mean.

31
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,990
Why don't you go start with that a little bit.

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,030
Time. Yes, time is very important.

33
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,790
We need it for navigating. We need it for keeping appointments.

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,930
It's part of our sensory perception.

35
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,570
And again, part of the critical thinking aspect,

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,310
there's a saying in every lie there's a little bit of the truth.

37
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,670
For example, something that's counterfeit has to look very much like the original.

38
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,230
And all these things are in front of us. We just can't discern them and don't discern them.

39
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,490
Like, for example, sept is a prefix for seven. Oct is a prefix for eight.

40
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,210
Nova is a prefix for nine. And dec or decimal is a prefix for ten.

41
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,830
So sept in its name itself is actually calling out the seventh month.

42
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,030
October is the eighth month. November is the ninth month.

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,450
And December is the tenth month.

44
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,110
Yet, in the legal commercial system, they stick a number in there

45
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,010
and they make September 9 and so on and so forth up until December being 12.

46
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,610
And no one's standing up and saying, wait a second,

47
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,490
if December means 10, why is it the 12th month?

48
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,450
Right. I never even thought about it, you know?

49
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,630
It's right there in front of our faces, but don't even think about it.

50
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,630
Right. Now here's another little interesting anomaly.

51
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,589
If you look up the history of the U.S. presidents,

52
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,710
then you'll find that George Washington is the only president that was born in both 1732

53
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,970
and he was also born in 1733. Can you tell me how that's possible?

54
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,670
No. How does that work?

55
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:35,310
Right. In 1750, they went into the current reckoning of time that we're using today,

56
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,750
or I should say the people of this planet are using today,

57
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,690
and they went ahead and made some adjustments before that.

58
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,570
So they wanted to just change the records to reflect that change in 1750,

59
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,310
so they went back and started changing records and just bumped everything up a year.

60
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,670
So you really don't even know what year you're in, really.

61
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:55,770
Really.

62
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,070
And what day is it?

63
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,870
Here's the interesting part.

64
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,930
The days are functions of weeks, the weeks are functions of months,

65
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,390
and the months are functions of years.

66
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,430
You'll say, well, there are 12 months in a year,

67
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,490
there are four weeks in a month, and there are seven days in a week.

68
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,330
So you have these various functions.

69
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,070
So I started looking at the religious groups,

70
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,390
and they say, well, the command says on the seventh day you should rest.

71
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,330
Well, if the week is a function of a month,

72
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,610
let's start with the Christians first.

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,470
Well, they say they're observing the commandment,

74
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,070
and Sunday is the seventh day of rest.

75
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,590
But what if it's June 1st on a Saturday?

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,310
Well, isn't Sunday the second day of the week there?

77
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,470
Or third day of the week?

78
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,450
How are you resting on the seventh day of the week

79
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,890
when the first day of the month was just a day or two ago?

80
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,190
Do you see my point?

81
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,490
Yeah, but explain it to me, because I don't really understand it.

82
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,390
Okay, in Judaism they say we observe the Sabbath,

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,650
and Saturday is the Sabbath.

84
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,570
Okay, so let's say it's the first day of the month on a Wednesday.

85
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,870
Well, let's see, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, that's the third day.

86
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,130
So how can it be the seventh day when your month just started a few days ago?

87
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,230
See, the week is a function of the month.

88
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,170
The first day of the month is the first day of the month.

89
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,910
The day after that is the first day of your first week.

90
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,530
That's complicated very quickly, doesn't it?

91
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,870
Yeah, it does. I don't quite get it.

92
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,090
It's the first day of the month.

93
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,410
Well, here's another way.

94
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,750
Let's look at another function of time.

95
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,970
It's 2010, right?

96
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,090
Well, you turn on the TV or something, go to the history channel,

97
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,790
and they say, well, the dinosaurs lived 60 million years ago.

98
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,250
Well, why isn't it 60 million 2010, then?

99
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,870
What happened to all the other years?

100
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,480
It's kind of like the emperor has no clothes kind of thing.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,360
Well, they just rounded it off, or what?

102
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,600
Nope, nope.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,120
It's just when I was speaking to someone that does manage time,

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,680
they said, well, this is just something that we all agree on.

105
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,060
Oh, really?

106
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay.

107
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,640
So because everyone agrees on everything, it makes it true.

108
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,080
I see.

109
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,300
How about if everyone agreed that the Earth was flat?

110
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,500
So when you turned on the television, you know, everything on TV said the Earth was flat.

111
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,720
The church, the school, your doctor, your priest, everyone says the Earth is flat.

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,960
Government says the Earth is flat.

113
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,760
So here you go, and you make this globe, you know, globe of the Earth,

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,360
and you start proving the Earth is round.

115
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,140
It's not flat.

116
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,360
You know, everyone's going to say, well, everybody knows the Earth is flat.

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,200
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,200
No, they just don't see.

119
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
You see, it's information that's in front of us.

120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,300
It's very easy to prove the Earth is round and it's not flat,

121
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,340
but yet everyone can be convinced the other.

122
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,020
Here's another maybe way to look at it.

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,700
I'd like to go maybe through some mental stretching before we go right into the run.

124
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:26,060
And time can be complicated because we're taught time probably before we're taught how to tie our shoelaces.

125
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,539
And if you were to bring an ancient that really knew how to tell time into our modern system,

126
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,179
he'd have a difficulty with the calendar and the clock as well,

127
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,900
where we just look at these things and they're automatic to us

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:48,160
because we've been trained to reckon time with these artificial creations,

129
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,680
and they're just tools.

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,220
But there is a way of keeping time that transcends the artificial and man-made creation,

131
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,540
and it's far more accurate.

132
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,640
But, again, this is like getting into an athletic event without stretching,

133
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,840
and my concept of conveying information might be to best do a little mental flexing first

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,980
and kind of get people in the mindset that maybe is required to convey this kind of information.

135
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,380
And it's very similar to how you asked about the monks.

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,780
And these things are all in front of us.

137
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,620
It's right in front of us, and we just don't see them because we've been told not to look at them

138
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,480
in a way that's not direct, but because everyone else does it this way

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,680
or this is the way it's done, we accept it as well.

140
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,600
Like everybody knows the bank lends money, right?

141
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,100
Everybody knows this is that, and everybody knows this is that.

142
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,660
You can find out otherwise.

143
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,880
Well, you're going to have a little bit of a struggle with it in your own mind as well.

144
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,060
Yeah, the bank doesn't loan money.

145
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,780
Yeah, but even when you first found it out...

146
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,560
Everybody doesn't know that.

147
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
I know, but even when you first find it out, you're like,

148
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,560
well, wait a second, how come my parents and my neighbor and everyone else told me they did?

149
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,300
So you kind of have to relax and meditate on it and say,

150
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,960
okay, everything's going to be fine, all right, I'm finding out the truth.

151
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,780
This is a different path now I'm on.

152
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,100
Here's another way to think about things that are right in front of us.

153
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Okay, you notice how when the weather gets colder and winter comes around,

154
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,860
people start getting what's called the common cold and the flu in the colder weather.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:54,120
We have refrigeration in our houses to put food in there to prevent it from spoiling

156
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,360
because the cold temperature prevents bacteria and other critters from growing

157
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,340
and actually makes them dormant, right?

158
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
That's how you preserve food in the cold.

159
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,920
But yet when cold weather comes around, people are getting the cold and the flu

160
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,260
and these little critters are being blamed for the cause.

161
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,220
But yet at the same time, we're creating a cold condition to slow these critters down.

162
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,540
So why are people getting sick in cold weather

163
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,000
when the actual cold weather is eliminating the bacteria

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,260
or making them dormant or slowing them down?

165
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,220
Why do people get sick when the weather changes to a colder temperature, you see?

166
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,160
It doesn't make any sense.

167
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,940
You see, when something is warm and then the bacteria are living on it,

168
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,120
they're going to multiply at a very high rate compared to when it's cold.

169
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,360
So why aren't people getting the common cold or quote-unquote flu season during the summer

170
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,300
when these little critters, you know, it's a perfect condition for them to be active and growing?

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,400
So why is it in the cold?

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,620
Why does it seem like the description of these little critters that are causing all these diseases

173
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,360
is going to be flipping and doing the opposite?

174
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,600
Why? Or maybe it's not these little critters that are making people sick in the first place, maybe.

175
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,920
You see?

176
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,620
What is it? Why?

177
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, it has nothing to do with these little bugs

178
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,920
because in the winter when it gets colder, all these little bugs that everybody is blaming,

179
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,320
the scientific community is blaming all these diseases and colds and flus on,

180
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,280
well, they're just decreasing in number and going to sleep in the cold.

181
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,980
So what's really causing it, you see?

182
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,180
Because if you go to a regular biology class,

183
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,280
they'll tell you the cold will stop these pathogens and bacteria from growing.

184
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,900
So there's probably people saying, get to the point.

185
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,880
The idea is your body takes in food.

186
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,600
And the food that you take in, based on where that food will grow or does grow,

187
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,300
adjusts your body chemistry to that climate.

188
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,040
So if you're living in a cold weather climate and you eat tropical food,

189
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,360
like an orange or a banana,

190
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,820
that banana or orange is going to adjust your body chemistry to the tropics.

191
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,280
And your body is going to want to thin out your blood for the tropics,

192
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,040
but you're living in a cold climate or cold season when you should have thick blood.

193
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,760
So it's going to try to eliminate all those chemicals that are blood thinners

194
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,620
and it's going to make you sick in the process.

195
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,120
And if you ever notice all of the quote-unquote holidays that come around in the winter,

196
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,920
all the sugary treats and all that stuff,

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,480
where do those foods come from? The tropics.

198
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,180
So you end up eating all these foreign foods,

199
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,480
things that are not grown within your temperate climate,

200
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,960
and your body chemistry is adjusted to those foods, and now you get sick.

201
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,300
It's a very simple rule of thumb.

202
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,040
And if you look at places that have not commercialized transporting of food

203
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,240
from one region of the world to another, they have no common cold, they have no flu.

204
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,680
And if you study how commerce has advanced,

205
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
where it's okay to eat a banana or an orange in the winter in New York,

206
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,460
you'll notice that the amount of people that got the flu or the cold have increased since then.

207
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,710
It's very simple.

208
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:25,030
So your food should be more with your habitat, more in line with where you live.

209
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,110
Right. And then you've got, well, I'm a school teacher,

210
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,850
and when the children get a cold, I catch it too.

211
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,970
Well, not really. What happens on the weekend,

212
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,630
you'll see the school teacher pushing a food cart through the grocery store,

213
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,710
and there are the parents with the other children, and they're all buying bananas and oranges,

214
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,650
because they read somewhere that vitamin C keeps colds away.

215
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Very few things are actually contagious that way.

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,340
I'm not a doctor, but I'm just doing this from historical observation

217
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,820
by just observing what's been going on historically.

218
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,060
So you're saying we get sick because we eat the wrong kinds of food at the wrong time of the year.

219
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah. Now, here's a very, yes, precisely.

220
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,540
Yep. Very simple, but very difficult to do.

221
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,270
You go into a grocery store, you see all these wonderful fruits and vegetables,

222
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,470
tomatoes all year round. Yeah, okay, great.

223
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,990
Bananas all year round. Go ahead. Enjoy.

224
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,780
It doesn't work. Let's look at the antithesis.

225
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,180
If you lived in the tropics and you ate some whale blubber,

226
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,960
which is what's used by the inhabitants of the northern climates,

227
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,380
they eat that because it thickens their blood to deal with those northern climates.

228
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,240
If you ate that whale blubber in the tropics, you'll probably die in a few days.

229
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,040
Sure. Yeah.

230
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Some disease or something, you know, that they label.

231
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,040
We're going around, and what we're doing is we're claiming things by our wants

232
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,560
and our ignorance that we shouldn't be claiming.

233
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not saying you shouldn't, but I'm saying if you do claim it,

234
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,220
you have to pay the consequence.

235
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,440
It's all action, reaction, you see.

236
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,540
Yeah.

237
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,460
Now, whether you know about it or not, you know, you've heard, like,

238
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,260
ignorance of the law is not an excuse.

239
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,920
You know, if a yellow light means stop in China, and you just don't know that,

240
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,500
and you run it, well, they get stopped.

241
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,440
Well, now you've got to argue. I didn't know. It doesn't matter.

242
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,280
You have to sort of understand the rules and the laws of the place

243
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,340
before you start operating there.

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,740
Yeah.

245
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,680
And we are on the planet Earth, and things are set up a certain way,

246
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,080
and we're just trying to change them.

247
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,060
You know, here's maybe another thing in science.

248
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,280
For example, when you heat and cool your house,

249
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,200
the hot air always rises to the ceiling, and the cold air always goes to the floor.

250
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,280
Right.

251
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,260
So all year round, you've got a hot head and cold feet.

252
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,280
But in nature, when it's hot in the valley or at sea level,

253
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,079
where do you go to cool off?

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,040
Go to the mountaintop, higher in elevation.

255
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,660
So in nature, cold rises and heat goes down.

256
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,619
It becomes dense, and it sinks.

257
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,640
So why is it that when we either cool our houses or light a fire,

258
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,660
the heat goes the other way?

259
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,740
There's two opposite forces working there.

260
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,000
One is explosive, one is implosive.

261
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,340
One is based on the life-giving cycle.

262
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,560
The other one is based on the death-giving cycle.

263
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
One is based on growth.

264
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,380
One is based on chemical decomposition.

265
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,160
And that's why we're not getting a lot of progress in society scientifically,

266
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,920
because for the, let's say, good past 5,000 years,

267
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,280
most bodies of knowledge that are preserved and taught

268
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,800
are based on the death cycle, not on the life cycle.

269
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,380
That's why, for example, the medical community studies the death cycle.

270
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,240
They take cells, and they take them in the laboratory.

271
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
They've separated them from the living being, and they start decomposing.

272
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,260
And they study the chemicals that these decomposing cells give off.

273
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,100
So now they find a way to counteract the decomposition,

274
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,980
and they give it to you in a pill or an injection.

275
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,020
That must be good for you.

276
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,820
But when you study a living being,

277
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,140
there's some very complex processes going there.

278
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,000
So it sounds like we need an instruction manual.

279
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,420
It's kind of like no one's read the instruction manual.

280
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,560
Well, we have, but we read it wrong, I guess.

281
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Yeah, where is it?

282
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,240
You know, here's the thing.

283
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,380
You know, there's a premise.

284
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,300
You can say that there is a supreme being, that there is a creator,

285
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,260
or you can say there isn't.

286
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,080
And if you're rational, either way,

287
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,500
you would accept statistically or mathematically,

288
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,660
if you were, let's say, adamant that there wasn't a creator or a creation,

289
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,320
in a debate or an argument,

290
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,540
you would have to accept the mathematical probability,

291
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
even how small it would be, that there is.

292
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,360
And then you can start looking at, from the point,

293
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,420
where it is possible that there is a creator.

294
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,200
Is it a benevolent creator or a malevolent creator?

295
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,800
Well, it could be one or the other.

296
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,620
If we look, we pick and see the benevolent route,

297
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,600
that he's a good creator,

298
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,260
just like any good creator or creator of a thing.

299
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,220
When you create something, you put an instruction manual in with it.

300
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,880
So if you create dishwashers, you have a dishwasher factory.

301
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,380
When you pack and ship these things, and they get to the end user,

302
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,940
when you unpack that dishwasher, you'll see, lo and behold,

303
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,620
there's an instruction manual in there.

304
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,880
Same thing with a television or a car or anything you buy

305
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,780
that requires some form of operation or usage has an instruction manual.

306
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,940
So if we follow on the premise that there is a creator and he is benevolent,

307
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,680
did he give us an instruction manual?

308
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,420
And could it be possible that this instruction manual was dictated to men

309
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,420
over a period of maybe 2,000 years?

310
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,260
And could it be possible that when we look at this instruction manual,

311
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,640
it tells you that one of our days, meaning the creator's days,

312
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,700
is equal to 1,000 of your years?

313
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,640
So if you start accepting the possibilities that these things are true,

314
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm not saying to believe in them, but look at them from a mathematical perspective

315
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
and start reading the instruction manual.

316
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,460
In this case, I'm referring to the scriptures or what people call the Bible.

317
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,960
And understand that this is a message from another dimension,

318
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,440
from extraterrestrial beings.

319
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,780
When I say extraterrestrial beings, I'm not speaking of little green men

320
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,400
in a flying saucer.

321
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,900
It just means they're not here present right now on the planet physically.

322
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,900
You'll start to see that it actually makes sense.

323
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,040
And from that point of view, you see the content of what's in there.

324
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,440
And you'll see it does not agree with anything that's been taught about it.

325
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,880
If, for example, the religious aspect of the world says,

326
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,840
you've got to do this, this is this.

327
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,900
For example, this is who the Christ is.

328
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,120
This is what angels are.

329
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,260
This is what they call God is or whatever.

330
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,440
Well, you go and read the manual or the Bible,

331
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,060
and you're like, well, none of that seems to apply here.

332
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,480
I don't know where they got that information from.

333
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,640
It's not in here.

334
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,780
And when you look at it, and people will say,

335
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,140
well, you're taking that literally.

336
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,940
Well, guess what?

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
It's a literal document.

338
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,960
It's not oral.

339
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,600
I have to take it literally, right?

340
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,280
Written.

341
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,520
Right.

342
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,720
Right?

343
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,560
So when someone says you're taking that literally,

344
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,760
you should stop and say, well, is it literal or is it oral?

345
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,540
If it's oral, it's hearsay.

346
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,660
If it's written, and it hasn't been rebutted,

347
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,560
and it isn't in the declaration form,

348
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,900
you have to take it literally.

349
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:18,900
You see?

350
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,640
So it's very interesting.

351
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,020
So I started taking this perspective on it.

352
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,900
And you kind of feel like you're going insane,

353
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,840
because the world says up, and the manual says go down.

354
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
You know, the world says black, and the manual says white.

355
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,720
You know, regarding a particular subject or something, you know?

356
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,800
And, you know, you can't listen to both.

357
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
But here's the thing.

358
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,000
They're both in agreement.

359
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,800
I found that what man teaches,

360
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,260
and I'm not talking about modern times.

361
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm saying this goes back a very long time, recorded history.

362
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,140
I can't find anything that agrees with any of their information in Scripture.

363
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,000
But I do find all of the information in Scripture

364
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
agreeing with what man teaches.

365
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,340
What I mean by that is basically the Scripture very clearly tells you

366
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,440
that you're going to have a lot of messing around with information on the earth.

367
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,180
And I see that.

368
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,060
You're going to have a lot of deceptions posing as benefits on the earth.

369
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,740
I see that.

370
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,500
You're going to have these events happening very specifically

371
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,620
at these very specific people, places, and times.

372
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,080
And I see that happening.

373
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,220
And I look at the information that man has been putting out

374
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,820
regarding a creator or this manual, the Bible,

375
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,660
and it's all incorrect and erroneous.

376
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,540
That's some of it, all of it.

377
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,780
And I decided to speak out on this a few years ago,

378
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,700
and as I started learning more about time,

379
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,300
I was wondering why it wasn't accepted,

380
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,320
because the timing isn't right.

381
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,480
The actual time where the people on this planet

382
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,420
will start to learn and discover what's in Scripture,

383
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,760
it will be coming within the next 14 years.

384
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,140
Actually, 11 to 14 years.

385
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,480
So the reason I have a desire...

386
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Well, what I mean by that,

387
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,960
oh, there's going to be a public disclosure.

388
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,060
In other words, within the next 11 to 14 years,

389
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
the majority of the planet's going to be pinned to their TV sets.

390
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,020
You know, like for a week.

391
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,080
In disbelief or in belief.

392
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,580
And it will be proven to them.

393
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,860
There's going to be an event.

394
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,580
And it'll be proven to everyone that without a doubt,

395
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,780
all the inhabitants on this planet will all be in agreement

396
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,360
that everything in Scripture is true.

397
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,060
You know, there won't be any more TV shows that Moses exists

398
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,660
or was the Ark of the Covenant real or this, that, and the other, right?

399
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,880
Okay.

400
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,180
It'll be things that'll be discovered and brought out.

401
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,180
And it will be...

402
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,640
Okay, let's check this one off the list of, you know, fairytale list, you know?

403
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,640
This is fact now.

404
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,600
This is real. This time is coming.

405
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,520
It's a little too soon to fully disclose what's going to happen.

406
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,460
But the point that I'd like to make, at least at this point,

407
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,500
is the reason why I'm speaking on these things

408
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,480
is because in the prophet Ezekiel, there's some passages there

409
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,300
and it talks about a watchman.

410
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,000
It says if you're a watchman on a city wall

411
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,500
and you see danger approaching the city,

412
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,460
you must let the inhabitants know.

413
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,600
Now, if you don't warn them or blow the horn,

414
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,180
if anyone is hurt,

415
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,360
their blood will be on your hands.

416
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,820
But if you blow the horn and you warn them and they do nothing

417
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,540
and they're hurt, the blood is on their hands.

418
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,920
And that's fair enough, right?

419
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,180
It's like the boy who cried love.

420
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,720
You don't want to do that either.

421
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,720
So in a way, it's not to clear my conscience,

422
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,380
but it's in a way to say, well, if you know these things,

423
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,160
you need to speak them.

424
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,660
And if people don't want to hear it, it's irrelevant.

425
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,520
It's been said.

426
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,620
So from that point of view, that I'm not here to warn anyone,

427
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,840
but to give information,

428
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,360
what you do with the information is up to you.

429
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,340
And none of this is based on belief

430
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,380
because all of this information is literal.

431
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,120
And I can start getting into a little bit of what I've learned

432
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,680
that really shocked and bothered me

433
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
from reading the Bible

434
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,780
that I found is not taught and not known

435
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,100
by the inhabitants of this planet.

436
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,420
And, you know, when you read the scriptures,

437
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,440
there's one of the main characters,

438
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,940
if not the main character, actually, is the Christ,

439
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
or they call him the Messiah.

440
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,620
They call him the Savior.

441
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,860
And when you look at what the persona, let's say,

442
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm using legal and lawful terms here

443
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,120
because legal and lawful, it both applies in scripture.

444
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,560
There's been a great identity theft

445
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,560
in the image and the character and who this was

446
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,760
and when he came and what his purpose was

447
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,620
is not being portrayed by any religion

448
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,680
or any academic sense at all.

449
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,240
There are very few people on the planet

450
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,860
who actually even know what his purpose was,

451
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,640
who he was, when he was born, and how he died.

452
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,720
The images and the information that religion is putting out,

453
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,980
organized or unorganized,

454
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,500
because today there's so many groups.

455
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,240
You have the Christianity aspect, by the way,

456
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,160
this historic era for the past 2,000 years

457
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,640
is called the Christian era, right?

458
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,400
So you have the Christianity,

459
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,540
then you've got those that are the messianics

460
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,620
who kind of mix Judaism with Christianity,

461
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,600
and then you've got Judaism and you've got Islam,

462
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,720
and I've been looking at all of their information,

463
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,680
what they put out, what they preach and teach,

464
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,620
and none of it is accurate, not even in the slightest,

465
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,540
according to the literal message.

466
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,690
One way to start before I get to the identity of the Christ

467
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,090
is, you know, a few years ago,

468
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,190
do you remember they wanted to take the Ten Commandments

469
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,250
written on the stones out of the courtrooms?

470
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,450
Right.

471
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,090
They did, didn't they?

472
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,430
Yeah, they did.

473
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,350
Yeah, I think they, yeah.

474
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,270
And actually, when people were calling me,

475
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,830
I said, you know,

476
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,770
are you talking about the Ten Commandments

477
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,110
that were written on stone?

478
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,390
And they said, yeah, they're taking it out of the courtroom.

479
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,270
And I'm like, well, can you, like,

480
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,610
give me, like, maybe two or three of those commandments?

481
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,950
Maybe they're not accurate.

482
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,230
Maybe it's not the right ones from the scriptures.

483
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,930
No, they're the ones from the Bible.

484
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,950
Well, like, can you give me, like,

485
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,270
maybe two or three commandments,

486
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,330
so maybe identify them, maybe so, you know,

487
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,790
we're talking about the same thing here?

488
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,210
I said, yeah.

489
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,150
It says, do not steal, do not murder,

490
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,030
respect your parents, and I'm like,

491
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,950
yeah, those are the Ten Commandments,

492
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,530
but those weren't written on the stones.

493
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,870
These stones, they look like big tombstones.

494
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,450
I'm like, yeah.

495
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,330
Well, they could take those out of the courtroom.

496
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,950
Those weren't written on the stones.

497
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,250
That's all mixed up.

498
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,530
Yeah, that's fine.

499
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,130
They could take them out if it's not accurate.

500
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,230
They're like, what are you talking about?

501
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,790
I'm like, do you have a Bible?

502
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,690
They're like, yeah.

503
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,090
I said, go read Exodus 34.

504
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,510
Call me back.

505
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,310
Never get a call back.

506
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:33,970
Never.

507
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,550
I've done this over a dozen times.

508
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,910
I said, I promise you're going to call me back.

509
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,130
Go read Exodus 34.

510
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,790
That's where the Ten Commandments written on the stones are.

511
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,530
Can you call me back and we'll discuss it?

512
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,130
No one has ever called me back.

513
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,150
It's right there.

514
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,610
If you read Exodus 34, he told Moses,

515
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,710
cut out two stones like the first that you broke

516
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,570
and write on them exactly what you wrote on the first stones.

517
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,850
And the commandments are listed there.

518
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,570
And if you read them,

519
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,110
it's not what you've been told in Sunday school.

520
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,210
Kind of shocking.

521
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,310
Well, what is it?

522
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,110
Well, it gets a little lengthy to get into it.

523
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,390
If anyone has the Bible, you could read Exodus 34.

524
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,130
What everyone thinks are the Ten Commandments written on the stones

525
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,250
were the commands that they were given when they came out of Egypt.

526
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,210
And that's in, let's say, Exodus 21, where he says,

527
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,470
you shall have no other God before me.

528
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,490
Do not make any graven images to worship.

529
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,290
Do not murder.

530
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,070
Do not steal.

531
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,050
Keep the sap.

532
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,950
Those are the ones they teach in Sunday school, right?

533
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:36,850
Right.

534
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,570
Respect your parents.

535
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,910
Okay, those were not written on the stone.

536
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,210
Those were oral commands, like no shirt, no shoes, no service.

537
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,470
Like rules of behavior, because they had just come out of Egypt.

538
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,630
They didn't know how to act.

539
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,890
They were the first time in the presence of the Creator at Mount Sinai.

540
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,390
So they're acting like a bunch of Egyptians.

541
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,390
And if you actually look at those commands that were given in Exodus 20,

542
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,070
they were oral.

543
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,850
They were not literal.

544
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,450
They were not written to be part of the covenant, let's say.

545
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,110
It was what you would tell a disorderly mob, right?

546
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,530
Like, don't do these things while you're in this presence.

547
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,790
It's very basic ways to act.

548
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,510
And also, if you study the laws in ancient Egypt,

549
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,890
each one of those rules actually counteracted one of their laws.

550
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,050
In ancient Egypt, they had child informers.

551
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,430
So he said, well, you can't do that here.

552
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,670
Respect your parents.

553
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,290
If you had enough money, you can go and buy your neighbor's wife.

554
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,950
You don't do that here.

555
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,970
These were very basic rules of behavior.

556
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,810
What was written on the stones were things completely different.

557
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,830
Two of them, I think.

558
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,910
Actually, only one or two of the commandments that were written on the stones

559
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,870
are the same as the commandments that were given orally.

560
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,290
And they weren't written on these large stones that look like tombstones.

561
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
To give you an example, the first commandment was,

562
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,480
do not go into a covenant with the pagans.

563
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,640
If you go into a covenant with them, you will stray away from my laws

564
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,260
and your children will marry their children and you'll forget about me.

565
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,440
You won't worship me.

566
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,600
You're going to follow strange gods, let's say.

567
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,580
Another commandment would be, all men are to appear before me three times a year.

568
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,260
Another commandment would be, you are to ransom a donkey with a lamb

569
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,680
or break its neck.

570
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Do not mix the blood of the Passover with leaven.

571
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,320
Another commandment would be, do not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

572
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
These are things that are not taught,

573
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,120
but they're actually the ones that were written on the stones.

574
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,320
Now, this doesn't make the Ten Commandments that are, let's say,

575
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,000
taught by the churches or whatever invalid.

576
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,580
It's just, these were the ones that were written on the stones.

577
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,420
Do you see how subtle the confusion is?

578
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,480
It's very subtle.

579
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,880
It's kind of like when you have a Federal Reserve note and you say it's a dollar.

580
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,060
It's not really a dollar because the word dollar means the weight of precious metals.

581
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,420
It's like pounds and ounces.

582
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,780
Eventually, you should be able to get something for it.

583
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,420
It should be a dollar, but it's not.

584
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,700
These commands that people think they know were not written on the stones.

585
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,980
It doesn't mean they're invalid.

586
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:44,670
It's just there's a problem with accuracy here and discernment.

587
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,230
Another example, well, again, back to the Ten Commandments.

588
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,470
When you say the word Ten Commandments, what's the image everyone thinks of?

589
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,110
Charlton Heston carrying these two stones, right?

590
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,230
Looked like tombstones, right?

591
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,970
When you say Noah's Ark, they got that from Cecil B. DeMille.

592
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,030
When you say, for example, Noah's Ark,

593
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,210
they think of this big boat and there's a rope off the back

594
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,250
and there's another little boat with two skunks in it.

595
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,610
They got that from Walt Disney when they were five years old.

596
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,170
These things are not accurate.

597
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,070
They're not in Scripture.

598
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,190
For example, in Exodus, when they did cross the Sea of Reeds,

599
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,989
in Cecil B. DeMille, he used Jell-O for special effects.

600
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,830
The waters are parted and all these people walking on the bottom across.

601
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,949
I don't know where he got that from.

602
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,610
It's not in Scripture. It didn't happen that way.

603
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,530
If you read Exodus 15, it's very clear that he says

604
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,790
there was an easterly wind blew all night, right?

605
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,790
And even today, if you go and look at the weather at the Sinai,

606
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,450
it's 20 degrees in the springtime, in the evening there.

607
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,050
That's enough to get really cold at night.

608
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,630
A wind blew all night and the depths of the waters became solid.

609
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,370
Hmm.

610
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,050
What do you call solid water?

611
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,690
Ice.

612
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:12,890
Ice.

613
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,670
And there were 600,000 fighting men that left Egypt.

614
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,650
Not a one of them was crippled or incapable.

615
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,290
And in Cecil B. DeMille movie, he kind of, little wink-wink,

616
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,270
three or four times they show an old man being carried in a stretcher.

617
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,690
That's like saying, okay, you guys that know, read Scripture and know it,

618
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,630
don't say anything to those that don't know it,

619
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,730
because you'll ruin it for them.

620
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,990
So to show you that I know what I'm doing here,

621
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,410
I'm going to show you a man in a stretcher,

622
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,310
because if you read Scripture, you know no one was carried in a stretcher, right?

623
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,950
So he's telling you right there, this is all, you know,

624
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,390
these are all fictional events.

625
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,770
Anything that resembles anything living or dead is by coincidence only.

626
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,110
But it's very hard to pick up on that.

627
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,990
So if there's 600,000 fighting men that crossed over,

628
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,670
and if each one had one or two family members,

629
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,790
that's at least 1.8 million people.

630
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,090
If they had three or four family members,

631
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,650
you're getting into the three to four million people crossing.

632
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,470
And that's going to take roughly 10 football fields wide.

633
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,010
At four miles per hour, that's roughly going to take the whole night.

634
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,670
And then if you read in Exodus 15 further on,

635
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,410
he says, when Pharaoh tried to cross,

636
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,810
they fell to the bottom like a stone,

637
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,510
they fell to the bottom like lead.

638
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,770
Well, if they're already walking on the bottom,

639
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,330
how do they fall to the bottom like a rock or like lead?

640
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,330
It's not much of a fall, you're already standing there, aren't you?

641
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,490
Yeah.

642
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,170
See, so the ice bridge collapsed and they went down.

643
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,070
So where did Cecil B. DeMille get the idea for those special effects?

644
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,550
I guess it looks better in Hollywood

645
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,090
than, you know, some ice breaking and falling through, doesn't it?

646
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,210
That doesn't say in the Bible the parting of the Red Sea?

647
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,470
Yes, yes, you got it.

648
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,970
You know, when you put a bridge across a body of water,

649
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,690
it's called a parting of water.

650
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I didn't know that.

651
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,440
Yeah, it says the water was piled up in Exodus 15.

652
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,660
Well, how do you pile up water?

653
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,140
Well, the only way would be to, yeah, frozen, freezing it.

654
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,860
Yeah, I love watching the academics.

655
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,460
You know, you can't pile up water,

656
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,520
you know, these biblical scholars of 50 years,

657
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,460
14 PhDs, you know.

658
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,640
You can't pile up water.

659
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,880
Here comes a four-year-old that says,

660
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,500
go get a bucket of ice to a four-year-old.

661
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,320
Come here and just dump it at his feet, pile it up.

662
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:35,880
What's that?

663
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,820
Oh, it's a pile of water.

664
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,280
Okay.

665
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, you see, no one could ever really figure out Scripture.

666
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,860
No one really can understand it.

667
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,600
So why bother even making the message

668
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,180
if you knew no one can understand it?

669
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,460
Why is it 900 pages long?

670
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,720
We're lacking discernment.

671
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,320
Critical thinking as you started out with.

672
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:00,820
Right?

673
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,900
Right, yeah.

674
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,160
I mean, we just take what it says at face value

675
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,120
and leave it at that.

676
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,080
Plus, it's reinforced by what we've learned in school,

677
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,960
in church, and so forth.

678
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,080
But no one questions these things.

679
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,820
Just like the IRS.

680
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,800
You can grow up watching your parents

681
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,160
doing their 1040s every year on April 15th.

682
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,300
Right?

683
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,240
You never questioned it.

684
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,660
Just did it.

685
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,780
It's a thing to do, yeah.

686
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
And all of this, again,

687
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,880
everything is backwards.

688
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,160
Just to jump around a little bit,

689
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,100
you know, when you look at

690
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,880
the political system and all that,

691
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,060
and you become a little more awake

692
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,340
and alert to what's going on,

693
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,200
you know your voting doesn't really count.

694
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,780
You know, I mean,

695
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,380
you could vote all you want.

696
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Voters don't elect.

697
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,840
Electors elect.

698
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,720
It's in the word itself, right?

699
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,880
You vote at a poll.

700
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,360
You know, like CNN and Fox News

701
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,640
do polls all the time.

702
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:55,780
Right?

703
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,980
But this poll you have to go register at.

704
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,720
You know, oh wow,

705
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,700
that feels so important now, you know?

706
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,580
But they tell you, electors elect.

707
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,820
Voters vote at a poll.

708
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,620
Electors elect.

709
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,260
It's not a voting.

710
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,080
It's an election.

711
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,640
They're telling you.

712
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,140
You need a dictionary, you know,

713
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,740
and just read your dictionary.

714
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,080
Well, I think everybody does it.

715
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,840
I think everybody does it

716
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,260
just to feel like they're doing,

717
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,400
they're taking part in the, you know,

718
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,420
whole thing, you know,

719
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,800
so they can say they, you know,

720
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,700
did their part.

721
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,020
You know, it's just like

722
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,100
paying your fair share.

723
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,960
It's all these soundbites,

724
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,800
stupid things.

725
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:32,860
Right.

726
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,660
When you read scripture,

727
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,440
it tells you that man will tell you

728
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,260
to do things that will make you feel important,

729
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,400
but if you do things the creator tells you,

730
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,500
you won't necessarily feel important,

731
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,760
but you will be empowered.

732
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,900
I think being humble

733
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,420
and not feeling important

734
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,940
in a particular system

735
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,660
is not a good trade for being empowered.

736
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:53,760
You see?

737
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:53,960
Right.

738
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,540
There's a difference.

739
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,660
If you could actually put the leader in,

740
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,020
you would be actually empowering,

741
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,740
but it's not empowering to vote.

742
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,840
You just feel important.

743
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,040
It's just a feeling.

744
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,220
There's nothing really there.

745
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,220
Right?

746
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,220
Just like a bank account.

747
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,420
Show me what's in the account.

748
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,660
They can either tell you a number

749
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,760
or show you a printout

750
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,660
or something on a screen

751
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,440
because there's nothing really there.

752
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,440
Right?

753
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,040
It's the same thing

754
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,860
with what's been taught

755
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,940
for 5,000 years.

756
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,020
It's not this country

757
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,300
and it's not recent history.

758
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,140
This has been going on

759
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,160
for a very long time,

760
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,060
but again,

761
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,900
if you read scripture,

762
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,340
he says,

763
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,760
I put the leaders in there.

764
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,860
He says,

765
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,240
I put them there.

766
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,300
I put the rulers there.

767
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,540
I am the ruler of rulers,

768
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,940
so everyone can vote

769
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,020
for one candidate

770
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,600
or everyone can try

771
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,620
to elect one candidate,

772
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,820
and if it's not the one

773
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,720
that he wants to put in,

774
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,500
he puts in another.

775
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,200
How many times have you seen

776
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,560
elections where they have

777
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,280
one guy win

778
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,640
and then they recall it

779
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,460
and they put someone else

780
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,420
who was just meant to be.

781
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:47,680
Right?

782
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,060
They say,

783
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,040
just meant to be.

784
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,560
Well, no.

785
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,760
Someone's actually in control

786
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,160
doing that.

787
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,940
Well, yeah.

788
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,380
They did, I think,

789
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,600
with every single election

790
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,060
there and then.

791
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,040
Well, I mean,

792
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,920
the creator actually

793
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,820
puts the leader in,

794
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,080
so if you actually read scripture,

795
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,260
you don't care about voting

796
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,860
because he tells you

797
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,520
it doesn't matter.

798
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,300
I put them in,

799
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:09,780
he says,

800
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,600
and he tells you

801
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,740
how he puts them in.

802
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,100
He says,

803
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,360
well,

804
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200
the less agreeable

805
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,040
the society,

806
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
the less agreeable

807
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,700
the leader I'm going to give you.

808
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,520
In other words,

809
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,640
I don't want to seem judgmental,

810
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,940
but the actual words are,

811
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,100
the more evil the society,

812
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,120
the more evil the leadership.

813
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,860
But he tells you

814
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,340
what you people down there

815
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,460
have been told is evil

816
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,860
is actually good in my eyes,

817
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,260
and what you've been told is good

818
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,840
is actually evil in my eyes.

819
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,660
So,

820
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,780
what's being taught is backwards.

821
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,560
And when I came on the call

822
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,200
on Saturday,

823
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,400
I said,

824
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,960
if you don't know

825
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,780
what cannibals,

826
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,360
birthdays,

827
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,560
and dolls have in common,

828
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,700
you won't comprehend

829
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,520
what's going on

830
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,700
on this planet right now.

831
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,960
I came on like a steamroller

832
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,300
saying,

833
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,200
you know what cannibals,

834
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,700
birthdays,

835
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
and dolls have in common?

836
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,840
It's kind of shocking.

837
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,780
I think Greg was like,

838
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,400
what?

839
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:05,800
Cannibals,

840
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,220
birthdays,

841
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,660
and dolls?

842
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,860
What does that have to do

843
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,340
with anything,

844
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,700
you know?

845
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,520
And,

846
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,240
yeah,

847
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,900
for whoever wasn't on,

848
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,220
I'll repeat it

849
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,080
maybe quickly here.

850
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,480
Please do.

851
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,240
Don't do it quickly.

852
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,440
Okay.

853
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:20,960
Take your time.

854
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,640
Take my time with it?

855
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:22,960
All right.

856
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,660
If you read scripture,

857
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,840
there's a lot of,

858
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,900
just to preface,

859
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,540
a lot of talk about

860
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,520
don't pass your children

861
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,180
through the fire.

862
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,640
Don't sacrifice your children.

863
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:32,720
You know,

864
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,540
don't put your children

865
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:33,940
in the fire.

866
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,580
Don't kill them.

867
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,420
Don't slaughter them.

868
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:35,680
Don't,

869
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,380
you know,

870
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,140
for prosperity.

871
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,920
That's why people did that.

872
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,540
There were ancient religions

873
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,900
that were pretty macabre,

874
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,420
really macabre.

875
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,260
And back in those days

876
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,120
in the Mesopotamian region

877
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,780
from Babylon

878
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,840
all the way to the coast

879
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,040
of modern-day Israel,

880
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,100
people were told

881
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,600
to worship

882
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,740
this little statue

883
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,620
or this entity

884
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,460
called Baal,

885
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,080
or Baal,

886
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,520
however you want

887
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,260
to pronounce it.

888
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,180
It's written B-A-A-L

889
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,880
in the English translation.

890
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,640
And simply,

891
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,660
Baal or Baal

892
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,060
translated to English

893
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,960
just means

894
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,480
the Lord.

895
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,680
It's kind of scary

896
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,580
when you think about it.

897
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,560
And this was a statue.

898
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,380
They were usually

899
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,260
gods of nature.

900
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,100
You know,

901
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,840
Baal of thunder,

902
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,700
Baal of the ocean.

903
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,880
And they had different,

904
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,160
you know,

905
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,100
shapes and sizes.

906
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,160
But for example,

907
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,420
you know the garden gnomes

908
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,500
that people put

909
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:28,940
in their garden,

910
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,980
those little garden gnomes.

911
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,680
Travelocity uses it

912
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,360
in their commercial,

913
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:32,780
you know.

914
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,800
That's a Canaanite statue

915
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
of Baal in the garden.

916
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,540
They thought if they put

917
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,280
that little statue

918
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,020
in their farms

919
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,920
they'd have prosperity,

920
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,240
right?

921
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,640
That's why they're called

922
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,200
garden gnomes.

923
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,680
So those things

924
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,360
have survived

925
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,780
5,000 plus years.

926
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,200
But, you know,

927
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,680
if you call it Baal or Baal

928
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:47,960
they'll say,

929
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,940
well that's a bad thing.

930
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,580
It says right here

931
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,000
in Scripture.

932
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,640
But if you call it

933
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,240
a garden gnome

934
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,960
it's good, right?

935
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,680
So the priests

936
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,600
back in those days

937
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,340
in the Chaldean Hebrew language

938
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
that preserved

939
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,140
these kinds of

940
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,160
entities or idols,

941
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,520
a priest of Baal

942
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,240
was called a kahan

943
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,520
or kohon

944
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,800
or kohanim

945
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,760
however you want

946
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,320
to pronounce it,

947
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,520
you know,

948
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,480
like tomato or tomato.

949
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,400
Basically a kahan.

950
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,980
So the kahans of Baal,

951
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,900
the priests of Baal,

952
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,460
or the priests of the Lord,

953
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,520
does that sound familiar?

954
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,700
Yeah.

955
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,740
Yeah.

956
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,880
Still exists today.

957
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,820
They would tell the people

958
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,900
if you want prosperity

959
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,180
you would bring us a child

960
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,680
and they would bring a child

961
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,140
usually under the age of six

962
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,440
and they would put him on an altar

963
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,260
and they would slaughter the child

964
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,260
and everyone in the ceremony

965
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,060
would take a small piece of flesh

966
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,820
and a little bit of the blood

967
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,700
and eat it.

968
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,940
That's why kahan Baal-ism,

969
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,680
if you take out the H

970
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,140
you get cannibalism, right?

971
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,020
It's the same word.

972
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,720
That's what it means.

973
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,560
Cannibalism or kahan Baal-ism,

974
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,200
in other words,

975
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,620
the priest of the Lord

976
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,880
was equated with the eating of human flesh.

977
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,320
Wow!

978
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,880
Now you know where that word comes from.

979
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:05,670
Pretty wild.

980
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,990
And when I found this out

981
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,470
I was like,

982
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:08,990
whoa,

983
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,050
this planet is not doing,

984
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,150
now I know why this planet

985
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,130
is not doing so well.

986
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,990
And the parents now,

987
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,150
after this ceremony,

988
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,950
this was an agricultural society

989
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,770
so people were not afraid

990
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,850
of having many children,

991
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,550
you know what I mean?

992
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,590
They wanted big families.

993
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,550
So if you took a child

994
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,530
and left

995
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,870
and you went to one of these ceremonies

996
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,210
and you didn't tell the other children

997
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:32,990
where you were going

998
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,530
and you came back without the child,

999
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,910
the first thing all the other children

1000
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:37,890
are going to ask is,

1001
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:38,470
hey,

1002
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,530
where's our brother?

1003
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,230
Where's our sister?

1004
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,650
How come they didn't come back with you?

1005
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,650
Right?

1006
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,470
Well,

1007
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,930
the altar boys of the kahan Baals

1008
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,750
or the cannibals,

1009
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,010
they would make an effigy of a child.

1010
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:51,950
We call it a doll.

1011
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,390
And they'd give it to the parents

1012
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,650
and say,

1013
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,650
when you go back home

1014
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,010
and the children ask

1015
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,030
where's the brother or sister,

1016
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,090
you give them this little doll

1017
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,210
to play with

1018
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,290
and they'll forget about it.

1019
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,410
So now you know the history of dolls.

1020
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,070
That's why we have dolls.

1021
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:07,730
Oh no,

1022
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,530
it's spooky.

1023
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,250
Here I thought growing up

1024
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,070
as a little girl

1025
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,370
with my tiny tears,

1026
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:12,670
you know,

1027
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,170
it was like to prepare you

1028
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,390
for motherhood or something,

1029
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,830
you know,

1030
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,550
or get,

1031
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,090
you know,

1032
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:18,750
I mean,

1033
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,850
why do they get little boy director sets

1034
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,610
and tools,

1035
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,050
you know,

1036
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,670
little girls' dolls

1037
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,730
and baking,

1038
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:25,410
you know,

1039
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:25,970
fake baking toys.

1040
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:26,090
Well,

1041
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,270
they did get little dolls,

1042
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,010
G.I. Joes,

1043
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:28,470
finally,

1044
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:28,830
right?

1045
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,210
Didn't they make little dolls

1046
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,750
for boys also?

1047
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,690
G.I. Joes,

1048
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,170
they call them,

1049
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:34,530
don't they?

1050
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,010
Or Raggedy Ann

1051
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:36,770
and Raggedy Andy,

1052
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:37,130
right?

1053
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,160
Are you still there?

1054
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:44,470
Hello?

1055
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,310
I'm back.

1056
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:50,730
Okay,

1057
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,410
I'm back.

1058
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,290
I hope you can hear me.

1059
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:53,990
Is that you,

1060
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:54,390
Greek?

1061
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,690
I'm here.

1062
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:56,810
Okay,

1063
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,070
sorry,

1064
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,450
I lost my connection.

1065
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,590
My cable went down completely.

1066
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,150
oh,

1067
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:03,690
gosh,

1068
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,270
that was hair raising.

1069
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:06,290
Anyway.

1070
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,370
Okay.

1071
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:08,690
That's fine.

1072
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,030
That's a really long delay

1073
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,190
and I guess we've all prevailed.

1074
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,410
Yeah,

1075
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,810
well,

1076
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,590
we might have lost a lot of people,

1077
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:16,930
though,

1078
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,610
but we still have a lot on.

1079
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,910
So,

1080
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:19,190
good.

1081
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,970
I'm glad we're still recording.

1082
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,810
I don't know why,

1083
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,270
did you go,

1084
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,890
did you put yourself on mute?

1085
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,650
Because you were muted when I came on.

1086
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:28,470
No,

1087
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,150
I didn't.

1088
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,770
That was really weird.

1089
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,070
Because I was hoping someone would type in

1090
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:34,430
and say,

1091
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,350
I was hoping someone could still hear me

1092
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,210
as I was yelling in,

1093
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,390
going,

1094
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,290
I lost my connection.

1095
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:39,830
Anyway,

1096
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,190
okay,

1097
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,110
I'm glad we're back.

1098
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:41,950
Yeah,

1099
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,510
me too.

1100
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,510
And this is part of Proof Positive

1101
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:44,910
that,

1102
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,370
you know,

1103
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:46,750
there's

1104
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:48,390
entities,

1105
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:49,970
the spiritual world,

1106
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,730
they don't want this kind of stuff being spoken.

1107
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:53,890
Right,

1108
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,230
I know.

1109
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,090
And it's been going on for thousands of years,

1110
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,670
and the last thing,

1111
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:58,970
you know,

1112
00:47:58,990 --> 00:47:59,910
is to be exposed,

1113
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,250
right?

1114
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,690
Yeah.

1115
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,210
I'm glad we're back,

1116
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:04,550
though.

1117
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,130
Gosh.

1118
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:05,470
Good,

1119
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,970
we're back.

1120
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:06,550
How frustrating.

1121
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:07,810
Well,

1122
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,790
where were we?

1123
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,990
Well,

1124
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,550
you were,

1125
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:12,750
I'm sorry?

1126
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:13,910
Balls,

1127
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,230
I think?

1128
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,350
Yeah,

1129
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,670
you were talking about Ball

1130
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,310
and the different ways he,

1131
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:18,770
you know,

1132
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,550
is portrayed,

1133
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:19,950
like,

1134
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,150
with the garden gnome

1135
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,050
and so forth.

1136
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,030
Right,

1137
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,530
where the origin of dolls

1138
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,750
that little children play with

1139
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,370
came from.

1140
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:29,550
Right.

1141
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,130
So,

1142
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,330
that's where it came from,

1143
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,370
because people were killing their children

1144
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,990
in sacrifice to the gods

1145
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,770
so that they would have more prosperity

1146
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:40,930
or whatever,

1147
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:41,930
right?

1148
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,430
Or whatever is right,

1149
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,730
yeah,

1150
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,550
they didn't get it,

1151
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:44,890
right?

1152
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,950
And the dolls were made

1153
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,230
as an effigy of a child

1154
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,490
to appease the other children

1155
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,310
when they asked about their brothers and sisters

1156
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:53,350
that didn't come back.

1157
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:54,850
Right.

1158
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,010
So now,

1159
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,670
you know,

1160
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,470
how many times have you seen a mom

1161
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,690
or a family,

1162
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,110
you know,

1163
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,810
they go and get dolls for their children

1164
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,630
and you ask them,

1165
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,690
do you know what that represents?

1166
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,090
No.

1167
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,570
Do you want to know?

1168
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,010
No.

1169
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,230
Why do you give them the dolls?

1170
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,510
Because I was given one

1171
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,210
and my parents,

1172
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,590
parents,

1173
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,990
parents,

1174
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,710
and their parents were given one.

1175
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:14,470
Right.

1176
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,200
Yeah.

1177
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:18,480
So,

1178
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,680
this is going on

1179
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,140
and this has been going on

1180
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,900
for 5,000 plus years.

1181
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,740
Yeah,

1182
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,000
they do that every year

1183
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,260
at Bohemian Grove

1184
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,600
up north in California.

1185
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:27,960
Here,

1186
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,320
they,

1187
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,100
they put a child in effigy,

1188
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,740
they burn it to that big

1189
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,140
Moloch owl.

1190
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,660
That's another one,

1191
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,140
that's another aspect of it.

1192
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,480
Yeah,

1193
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,260
it's not,

1194
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,000
it's not quite,

1195
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,280
I'm speaking more on the ball aspect.

1196
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,040
Well,

1197
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,380
you know,

1198
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,940
but they do,

1199
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,940
they have the little,

1200
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,700
this little,

1201
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,820
creepy,

1202
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,300
crawly person,

1203
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:47,880
guy,

1204
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,780
that is the typical,

1205
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,900
what you would consider,

1206
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,580
ball,

1207
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,360
because he's,

1208
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,440
down in the corner,

1209
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,400
you know,

1210
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,280
watching it all going on,

1211
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,540
like,

1212
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,420
it's,

1213
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,260
it's weird.

1214
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah,

1215
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,640
they,

1216
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,440
they understand,

1217
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:00,880
you see,

1218
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,380
the,

1219
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,280
see,

1220
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,760
that's why these secret societies,

1221
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,200
they,

1222
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,520
they call each other's brothers

1223
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,560
or the brotherhood,

1224
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:07,920
you know,

1225
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,720
like the Freemasons

1226
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,380
and whatever,

1227
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,580
there's countless groups

1228
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,380
that call themselves

1229
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,720
part of the brotherhood.

1230
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah,

1231
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,240
religion too.

1232
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:16,260
Yeah,

1233
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,600
and the reason why they call themselves,

1234
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:17,880
see,

1235
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,760
if someone is your brother

1236
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,880
when you live under the,

1237
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,160
under the same covenant,

1238
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,000
you see,

1239
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,080
you have the same oath

1240
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,840
or allegiances,

1241
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,700
you know,

1242
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,000
that's why when I meet people,

1243
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,060
they find it very strange,

1244
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,320
I,

1245
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,920
I ask them,

1246
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,060
you know,

1247
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,380
what covenant do you live under?

1248
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,640
They look at me like,

1249
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,460
excuse me?

1250
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,540
I'm like,

1251
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,200
yeah,

1252
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,020
where do you get your law?

1253
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,320
I'm not talking about traffic law,

1254
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,820
I mean like,

1255
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,160
what you eat,

1256
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,880
what you wear,

1257
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,040
how do you keep time,

1258
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,060
what days you worship,

1259
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,600
how do you,

1260
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,200
how do you operate in commerce,

1261
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,640
how do you treat your wife,

1262
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,860
how do you enter into contracts,

1263
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,940
what set of rules

1264
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,000
do you live your life by?

1265
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,880
They look at me like,

1266
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,740
I don't know.

1267
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,060
Oh,

1268
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:54,780
okay,

1269
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,280
so how can you be my brother?

1270
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,640
You see,

1271
00:50:59,340 --> 00:50:59,780
I,

1272
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,180
I try,

1273
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,820
I try to live in the covenant

1274
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,640
of the scripture,

1275
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,080
you see,

1276
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,520
it's all about law,

1277
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,820
you get law from your deity

1278
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,200
and that's how people are wired.

1279
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,760
You cannot escape that.

1280
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,480
So,

1281
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,440
if you say,

1282
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:12,940
for example,

1283
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,180
when I don't have a deity,

1284
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,140
I don't believe in God,

1285
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,960
I don't believe in

1286
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,260
the spiritual world,

1287
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,540
you know,

1288
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,940
there's no proof of it or whatever,

1289
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:20,820
I'm scientific,

1290
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,520
alright,

1291
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,020
hold on,

1292
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,320
hold on,

1293
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,560
hold on,

1294
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,300
before you keep going,

1295
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,420
do you believe in the laws of the state?

1296
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,500
Absolutely,

1297
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,720
well the state is your God

1298
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,460
and there you go.

1299
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,400
That's true for a lot of people.

1300
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,360
Yeah,

1301
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:32,820
well you see,

1302
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,700
well it's because

1303
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,220
that's the way we are wired,

1304
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,340
you cannot escape it.

1305
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,900
If you rewire a cell phone,

1306
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,320
guess what,

1307
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,600
it's not going to work.

1308
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,740
The reason why it works

1309
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,440
is because of its wiring.

1310
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,520
The same with a computer,

1311
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,160
if I pull the motherboard

1312
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,960
out of your computer

1313
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,980
and start rewiring it,

1314
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,280
do you expect me to

1315
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,640
plug it back in

1316
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,140
and it work

1317
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,620
the same way it did before?

1318
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:53,920
Uh-uh.

1319
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:54,680
Yeah,

1320
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,520
so we're all wired

1321
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,440
that we get our law,

1322
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,380
in other words,

1323
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,980
our morality

1324
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,780
from our deity

1325
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,400
and that's why in Scripture

1326
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,200
it says that

1327
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,480
do not corrupt little children

1328
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,340
and it gives you a metaphor,

1329
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,520
those that corrupt the children,

1330
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,020
it would be better

1331
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,480
that you tie a millstone

1332
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,900
around your neck,

1333
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,980
which is a large stone,

1334
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,720
and dump into the river.

1335
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,960
The reason why

1336
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,440
is because

1337
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,380
when you have an infant

1338
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,180
in your house

1339
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,700
from when they're born

1340
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,600
up until let's say

1341
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,480
three, four, five,

1342
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,280
six years old,

1343
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,540
they have no concept

1344
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,780
of the divine world

1345
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,540
or of a creator

1346
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,460
and they view the parents

1347
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,160
as their God.

1348
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,800
What you say goes,

1349
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,400
they know of no other authority.

1350
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,600
So,

1351
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,140
now you wonder

1352
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,700
why children have so many problems,

1353
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:36,960
you know,

1354
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,360
they're taught,

1355
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,160
well, you've got these,

1356
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:39,860
you know,

1357
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,580
you've got to celebrate

1358
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,340
the Tooth Fairy,

1359
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,100
the Easter Bunny

1360
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
and the Santa Claus

1361
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,200
and when they're seven

1362
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,140
or eight or nine

1363
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,420
and the child asks

1364
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,200
where's Santa Claus

1365
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,280
and the parent turns around

1366
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,080
and says,

1367
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,360
what's wrong with you?

1368
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:51,940
Don't you know

1369
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,880
there's no such thing?

1370
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,560
And the child's like,

1371
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,380
oh, oh, oh,

1372
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,720
you know, major trauma,

1373
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,120
you know,

1374
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,380
it's like,

1375
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,460
my God just lied to me.

1376
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,980
So how are you supposed

1377
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,120
to have a normal life

1378
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,160
when your own deity

1379
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,000
lied to you?

1380
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,240
You know,

1381
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,140
you're being your parents

1382
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,300
because you know of no other

1383
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,100
at that point, right?

1384
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,580
Right.

1385
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,160
Well,

1386
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,100
nobody ever

1387
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,260
springs in

1388
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,460
a child like that,

1389
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:13,800
though.

1390
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:14,980
Well,

1391
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,320
I've seen,

1392
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,040
I've heard of,

1393
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,380
you know,

1394
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,820
parents telling children

1395
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,720
those things don't exist

1396
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,180
but it's like,

1397
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:20,620
mom, dad,

1398
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:20,880
you know,

1399
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,740
we celebrated that

1400
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,620
for all these years.

1401
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,220
What do you mean

1402
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,740
they don't exist?

1403
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,860
And then you grow out of it.

1404
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,260
That's sort of the excuse,

1405
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:27,800
I guess.

1406
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,860
We just grow out of it

1407
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,800
and then we all...

1408
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,200
Actually,

1409
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,680
you don't.

1410
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,300
You ever wonder

1411
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:32,960
why teenagers

1412
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,060
are so rebellious?

1413
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,000
Because this is a very

1414
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,780
deep-rooted subconscious problem.

1415
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,480
They know they've been

1416
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,520
lied to by the

1417
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,160
absolute,

1418
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,660
ultimate authority

1419
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,160
when they were

1420
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,440
in their formative years,

1421
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:43,700
right?

1422
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,540
Formative years

1423
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,100
were, you know,

1424
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,600
as an infant,

1425
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,700
so now how can you

1426
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,300
go out and trust,

1427
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:48,560
you know,

1428
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,640
people outside

1429
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,260
or in the spiritual realm

1430
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,660
or anything?

1431
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,900
And one way

1432
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,080
to fix any familial

1433
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,020
relationship

1434
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,640
with a,

1435
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,160
when you have

1436
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,340
a rebellious teenager,

1437
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,200
I've helped

1438
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,340
quite a few people

1439
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,720
with it,

1440
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,000
you know,

1441
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,280
they'd say,

1442
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:04,440
well,

1443
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:04,540
you know,

1444
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:04,860
I've got these

1445
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,880
rebellious teenagers,

1446
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:06,380
you know,

1447
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,240
or they'll wreak havoc

1448
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,100
when I leave them alone.

1449
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,260
I said,

1450
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,880
how old are they?

1451
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,040
You know,

1452
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,460
like 12,

1453
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:10,960
13,

1454
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,340
14.

1455
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:11,660
I said,

1456
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,360
oh,

1457
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:12,920
I know why,

1458
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,920
because you lied to them

1459
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,860
and you never apologized.

1460
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,240
They're like,

1461
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,540
what?

1462
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,100
I said,

1463
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,660
did you ever do

1464
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,080
Christmas,

1465
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,540
Easter,

1466
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,700
or anything like that,

1467
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,000
you know,

1468
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,700
Easter Bunny

1469
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,780
or Tooth Fairy

1470
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,840
or anything fictional?

1471
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,280
Did you raise them

1472
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:23,680
that way

1473
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,200
and then tell them

1474
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,000
it didn't exist?

1475
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,200
And when you told them

1476
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,880
it didn't exist,

1477
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,680
did you apologize

1478
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,320
for lying?

1479
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,000
Nope.

1480
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,600
I don't recall

1481
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,580
feeling that way

1482
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,540
about my parents

1483
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,100
or my mother.

1484
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,120
I never got mad

1485
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,900
at her for lying.

1486
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,660
You just sort of

1487
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,300
grew up

1488
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:38,900
and realized

1489
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,480
that's something

1490
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,480
you told little kids

1491
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:40,760
to,

1492
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,660
you know,

1493
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,200
make them

1494
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,700
believe in fairy tales

1495
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,220
and stupid stuff

1496
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,820
like that.

1497
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,860
But it wasn't like,

1498
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,280
you know,

1499
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,200
well,

1500
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,920
in my family,

1501
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,820
I didn't grow up

1502
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,400
rebellious.

1503
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:50,640
Well,

1504
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:50,940
I mean,

1505
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,600
I didn't,

1506
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,040
you know,

1507
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,040
do bad things.

1508
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,860
But it is very common

1509
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,520
in society.

1510
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:56,620
Okay.

1511
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,860
On a society level,

1512
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,280
you do see rebellious,

1513
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,440
and you do see problems

1514
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,260
with parents

1515
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,160
without what they call

1516
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,880
adolescence.

1517
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,340
And they wonder why.

1518
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,500
These are very

1519
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,640
deep-rooted problems.

1520
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,480
And also,

1521
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,340
you're being set up

1522
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,340
to believe in a fiction

1523
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:10,920
and then told

1524
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,500
that it's not.

1525
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:11,900
Maybe,

1526
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,540
if you're lucky,

1527
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,380
you'll grow out of it,

1528
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:13,620
right?

1529
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,480
That's why when people

1530
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,980
get older,

1531
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,340
they say,

1532
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:16,500
well,

1533
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,640
you just lost your whole retirement.

1534
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,400
Get over it.

1535
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,560
You know,

1536
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,440
life isn't fair,

1537
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,780
you know.

1538
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,280
You're going to be lied to.

1539
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:24,900
Right?

1540
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:25,900
Yeah.

1541
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,480
That's pretty much it.

1542
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,260
Yeah,

1543
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,120
you're going to be lied to.

1544
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,060
Life isn't fair.

1545
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,060
You're going to be lied to

1546
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,180
in this and that.

1547
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,500
Oh,

1548
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:32,900
I mean,

1549
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
you haven't gotten used to it.

1550
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,100
I mean,

1551
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:34,560
you know,

1552
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,220
you see what's going on?

1553
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,260
Uh-huh.

1554
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,120
In a society that follows,

1555
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,120
has some sort of covenant

1556
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,220
or some set of rules

1557
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,300
that are based on

1558
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,600
a benevolent

1559
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,360
deity,

1560
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,340
there's no lying.

1561
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,080
There's no fiction.

1562
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,020
You see?

1563
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,520
So,

1564
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,100
back to these cannibals,

1565
00:55:59,520 --> 00:55:59,920
kahanbals,

1566
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,020
or the priests of the Lord.

1567
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:02,980
You know,

1568
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:03,900
they give the doll

1569
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,920
to give to the children,

1570
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,720
and obviously,

1571
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,740
they don't get prosperity

1572
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,140
from doing this kind of stuff.

1573
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,020
Sometimes they did,

1574
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,440
actually,

1575
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,300
as a society,

1576
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,700
and they did acknowledge

1577
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,520
that it came from

1578
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,560
this particular deity,

1579
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,720
but what a macabre thing

1580
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,140
to do.

1581
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,240
You know?

1582
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,620
But when they didn't

1583
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,420
have prosperity,

1584
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,320
they went back

1585
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,160
with another child,

1586
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,300
and the kahanbals,

1587
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,340
or the priests of the Lord,

1588
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,300
would say,

1589
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:28,880
wait a second,

1590
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,140
you know,

1591
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,860
if we keep taking

1592
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,560
all their children,

1593
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,980
they're going to figure

1594
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,740
this out somehow,

1595
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,060
and they might purge us

1596
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:34,460
from here,

1597
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,240
and they might come

1598
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,480
and tell us to leave.

1599
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,120
We're not welcomed

1600
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,700
here anymore.

1601
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,080
So,

1602
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,840
instead of taking

1603
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,720
this other child,

1604
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,980
they told the parents

1605
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,820
to go back home

1606
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,640
and put the child

1607
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,500
in a high chair

1608
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,700
with a pointy hat

1609
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,300
like they wear,

1610
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,880
and to bake a loaf

1611
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,600
of sweet bread

1612
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,800
and put candles in it,

1613
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,940
and ask the child

1614
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,660
to make a wish

1615
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,380
of prosperity

1616
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,500
and blow out the candles,

1617
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,220
which represents

1618
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,100
blowing out the light,

1619
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:57,980
and then everyone

1620
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,420
eats a piece

1621
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,040
of sweet bread,

1622
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:00,880
which represents

1623
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,760
eating a piece

1624
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,320
of the body,

1625
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,320
and to show that

1626
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
that wish of prosperity

1627
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,740
works,

1628
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,560
everyone attending

1629
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,180
the ceremony

1630
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,160
has to bring a present.

1631
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,080
What does that sound

1632
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,580
like to you?

1633
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,240
Yeah,

1634
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,600
really,

1635
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,920
that's scary.

1636
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,800
Yeah,

1637
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,580
so people love

1638
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,120
doing birthdays,

1639
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,400
you know,

1640
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:17,860
so why do you,

1641
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,100
well,

1642
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,460
you know what that

1643
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,380
birthday cake represents?

1644
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,720
No,

1645
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,280
I don't care,

1646
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't want to know.

1647
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,600
I really don't want to know.

1648
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,840
I have a great time with it.

1649
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,280
Oh, really?

1650
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:25,720
Okay.

1651
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,560
It's a pagan ritual.

1652
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:29,960
Yeah,

1653
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,440
you're actually

1654
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,140
making enemies

1655
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,260
in the spiritual world.

1656
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,460
A pagan

1657
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:34,820
sacrificial ritual.

1658
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,220
Mm-hmm.

1659
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,420
Mm-hmm.

1660
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,500
Well,

1661
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,000
that's similar

1662
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,820
to the communion,

1663
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,040
which is a ritual.

1664
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:42,940
Right,

1665
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,860
that's a whole other

1666
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,600
story there.

1667
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,960
That's very similarly

1668
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,400
based.

1669
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:46,660
You know,

1670
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,340
it's interesting,

1671
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,460
during World War II,

1672
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,100
when they bombed

1673
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,080
the crap out of Europe,

1674
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,100
they hit a lot of

1675
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,480
cathedrals and churches

1676
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,020
in Europe,

1677
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,340
and there was a particular

1678
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,800
architect,

1679
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,560
I don't remember

1680
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,680
who it was,

1681
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,680
if anyone wants to

1682
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,180
reference it,

1683
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,940
you could just put a

1684
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,700
description of the

1685
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,620
architect who went to

1686
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,520
restore the bombed

1687
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,640
cathedrals in Germany

1688
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,220
and all parts of Europe.

1689
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,200
What he did was

1690
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,980
he went and surveyed

1691
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,400
the damage,

1692
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,560
and most of the

1693
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,400
big churches,

1694
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:11,980
he found,

1695
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,520
you know,

1696
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,700
where they have the

1697
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:13,980
altar,

1698
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,340
you know,

1699
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,020
where the priest did

1700
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,900
his ritual?

1701
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:16,800
Uh-huh.

1702
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,800
There was another

1703
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,900
altar underground,

1704
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,280
very similar to it,

1705
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,840
in a functioning

1706
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,400
chamber.

1707
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,390
What's a functioning

1708
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:25,870
chamber?

1709
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:27,350
In other words,

1710
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:28,190
it had doors that

1711
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:28,950
go in and out,

1712
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,730
and people could

1713
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:30,350
sit around and

1714
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:30,950
watch what was

1715
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,410
going on.

1716
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:31,870
Okay,

1717
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:32,650
so there's a whole

1718
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,610
other room down there.

1719
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,370
Yeah,

1720
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:34,470
yeah,

1721
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:35,690
just like the one

1722
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,070
above,

1723
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,410
yeah.

1724
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,750
And he started

1725
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,710
asking questions,

1726
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:39,290
you know,

1727
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:39,970
what's this for?

1728
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:40,350
And they're like,

1729
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,830
uh, uh, uh,

1730
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:42,390
you know,

1731
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,070
never got a straight

1732
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:43,410
answer.

1733
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,440
What was it for?

1734
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,420
I don't know,

1735
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:47,880
you can let your

1736
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,700
imagination run,

1737
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,220
I just thought I'd

1738
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,820
bring it up.

1739
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,880
That's interesting

1740
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,680
because the church

1741
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,180
here that,

1742
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,560
I was going to

1743
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,700
say that Mahoney,

1744
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,220
the Catholic,

1745
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,760
what is he,

1746
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,740
cardinal here in

1747
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,340
California,

1748
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,540
Los Angeles,

1749
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,380
built this cathedral,

1750
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,800
and underneath,

1751
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,560
the hole underneath

1752
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,560
is a,

1753
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,580
it's like a

1754
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,040
cemetery,

1755
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,540
it's where

1756
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,020
people get

1757
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,460
buried.

1758
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,180
Did you know

1759
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,400
that?

1760
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,480
And so maybe

1761
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,100
that's what it

1762
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,320
was.

1763
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,140
I'm not sure,

1764
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,080
I just think

1765
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,620
you can let your

1766
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,580
imagination run

1767
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,020
with it,

1768
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,080
because things

1769
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:28,800
are not as they

1770
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,040
seem.

1771
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,240
Now,

1772
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,960
you brought up

1773
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,520
the Moloch

1774
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,720
in Bohemian

1775
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,120
Grove,

1776
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:33,560
and in

1777
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,080
scripture it

1778
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,740
says do not

1779
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,900
pass your

1780
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,700
child or

1781
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,180
your children

1782
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,720
through the

1783
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,280
fires of

1784
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,720
Moloch.

1785
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,220
Now,

1786
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,240
for researching

1787
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:41,980
Moloch,

1788
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,520
they had

1789
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,680
various statues,

1790
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,320
but they were

1791
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,540
always very

1792
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:45,960
large,

1793
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,380
and they had

1794
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,200
an open

1795
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,820
hearth in

1796
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,360
their belly,

1797
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,880
and they were

1798
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,560
typically made

1799
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,220
of bronze.

1800
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,820
And the ones

1801
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,900
in that part

1802
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,500
of the world,

1803
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,120
at that time,

1804
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:57,720
they were usually

1805
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,340
in a seated

1806
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,040
position,

1807
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,360
and they

1808
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,600
were made

1809
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,020
of bronze,

1810
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,240
and they

1811
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:01,660
had a very

1812
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,440
large belly

1813
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,200
for a hearth,

1814
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:03,460
and they

1815
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,440
would build

1816
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,100
a fire in

1817
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:05,460
the belly,

1818
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,620
and they

1819
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,140
would stoke it

1820
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,480
until the

1821
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,040
whole statue

1822
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:09,700
became bright

1823
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,040
red,

1824
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:10,340
and they

1825
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:10,600
would tell

1826
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,100
the people

1827
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,560
to make

1828
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,500
a wish of

1829
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,060
prosperity

1830
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,620
and place

1831
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,220
the child

1832
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,180
in the lap

1833
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,580
of that

1834
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,080
red-hot

1835
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,460
bronze

1836
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:17,920
statue.

1837
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,600
So,

1838
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:20,260
today,

1839
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,260
you have a

1840
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:21,680
character,

1841
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,100
at certain

1842
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,520
times of the

1843
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:22,740
year,

1844
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:23,280
he's got a

1845
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,800
big belly,

1846
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,120
and he's

1847
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,640
bright red,

1848
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,440
and children

1849
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:25,940
are placed

1850
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,540
in his lap

1851
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:26,840
and told

1852
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,300
to make

1853
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,520
a wish

1854
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,260
of prosperity.

1855
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:29,800
Does that

1856
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,260
sound like

1857
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:30,640
anything

1858
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,200
you might

1859
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:31,460
have heard

1860
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:31,760
of before?

1861
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,060
Santa Claus,

1862
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,920
oh my gosh.

1863
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:34,940
I know.

1864
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:35,620
Isn't that

1865
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:35,800
one of the

1866
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,200
discussing

1867
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,800
or what?

1868
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,180
See what's

1869
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,640
going on?

1870
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:38,880
Now,

1871
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,260
here's the

1872
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:39,520
thing.

1873
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,000
The people

1874
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,460
that know

1875
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:41,160
about this,

1876
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:41,680
actually,

1877
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,200
the spiritual

1878
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,780
world knows

1879
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,200
about this

1880
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,460
more than

1881
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,020
the people.

1882
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:45,720
See,

1883
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,100
the people

1884
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,460
are doing

1885
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,280
things that

1886
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,760
are making

1887
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,340
enemies in

1888
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,800
the spiritual

1889
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,540
world.

1890
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,080
When you

1891
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,480
do this

1892
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:51,760
kind of

1893
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:51,980
stuff,

1894
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:52,960
because we

1895
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,500
are better

1896
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,160
than that,

1897
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,200
and we've

1898
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:55,580
been duped

1899
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,280
into believing

1900
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,980
these things,

1901
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,440
because it's

1902
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:57,820
based on

1903
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,140
belief,

1904
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:58,840
not knowledge.

1905
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,480
You can only

1906
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,080
believe in

1907
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:00,240
this.

1908
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,620
You cannot

1909
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,640
know this

1910
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,000
and do

1911
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,160
it,

1912
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,680
because once

1913
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,040
you know

1914
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,380
what it

1915
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,760
is,

1916
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:04,860
are you

1917
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,320
still going

1918
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:05,640
to do

1919
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:05,920
it?

1920
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,220
Yeah.

1921
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,560
You see?

1922
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:09,960
People

1923
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,220
say,

1924
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,000
well,

1925
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,460
that's my

1926
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:11,780
religion,

1927
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,560
I believe in

1928
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:12,660
it,

1929
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:12,900
I don't

1930
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,920
care about

1931
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,220
what you

1932
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,680
believe.

1933
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:15,900
Do you

1934
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,360
know it?

1935
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,160
Scripture

1936
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,760
says you

1937
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,260
shall know

1938
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:18,820
the truth.

1939
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:19,940
Here I

1940
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,240
thought it

1941
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,700
was always

1942
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,220
just based

1943
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,420
on drumming

1944
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,020
up commerce

1945
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,880
and funding

1946
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,540
and stuff.

1947
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,360
when you

1948
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:26,540
read

1949
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:26,980
scripture,

1950
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,320
a lot of

1951
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:28,680
people say,

1952
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:28,840
well,

1953
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,220
the Bible is

1954
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,560
a commercial

1955
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,040
document.

1956
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:30,260
No,

1957
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:30,720
it's not.

1958
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,100
There is

1959
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,740
commerce in

1960
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,220
the Bible.

1961
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,480
For example,

1962
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:33,840
when you

1963
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,140
read the

1964
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,460
Bible,

1965
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,160
commerce is

1966
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:35,840
one aspect

1967
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,420
of life

1968
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:36,760
on this

1969
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,120
planet.

1970
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,380
There are

1971
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,040
other aspects.

1972
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,720
For example,

1973
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:40,800
you have

1974
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,480
agriculture,

1975
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,420
you have

1976
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,080
stewardship,

1977
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,880
you have

1978
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,340
family,

1979
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:47,780
you have

1980
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,100
worship.

1981
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,560
In other words,

1982
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:49,920
how do you

1983
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,640
communicate with

1984
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,260
the other

1985
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:51,780
dimension,

1986
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:52,720
the spiritual

1987
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,220
world?

1988
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,000
There are

1989
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,260
forms of

1990
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,300
healing

1991
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:00,860
the body,

1992
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,200
there is

1993
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,340
a

1994
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:05,780
judicial

1995
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,340
ruling

1996
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,680
in

1997
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:07,980
scripture

1998
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,460
that's

1999
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,960
outside of

2000
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,360
commerce.

2001
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:10,800
It might

2002
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,120
involve

2003
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:11,660
commerce if

2004
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:11,960
it's a

2005
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,280
commercial

2006
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:12,620
dispute.

2007
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,440
The only

2008
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:14,960
thing that's

2009
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,380
in commerce

2010
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:15,880
in scripture

2011
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,140
is that

2012
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,980
when you

2013
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,540
do

2014
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,580
trade

2015
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,240
or sale,

2016
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,480
make sure that

2017
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,080
your measurements

2018
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,700
are accurate.

2019
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,420
Don't cheat

2020
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:24,780
anyone.

2021
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,440
Don't rig

2022
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:27,960
your scale

2023
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,360
so it's

2024
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:28,600
not.

2025
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,240
You must

2026
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,520
use

2027
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:30,920
substance

2028
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,480
money.

2029
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:33,580
If you

2030
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:33,840
don't have

2031
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,180
substance

2032
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:34,580
money,

2033
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:34,900
you can

2034
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,100
use

2035
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:35,460
credit.

2036
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,080
But you

2037
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,420
have to

2038
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:36,900
live up to

2039
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,520
your promise.

2040
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,140
In other

2041
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:38,400
words,

2042
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,020
if a

2043
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:41,680
corn farmer

2044
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:41,980
is supposed

2045
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,440
to barter

2046
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:42,680
it with

2047
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,120
a potato

2048
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,540
farmer,

2049
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,100
you can

2050
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,440
give him

2051
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:48,820
a note.

2052
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:49,640
But you

2053
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:49,880
can't

2054
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,260
come back

2055
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:50,480
and give

2056
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:50,860
him another

2057
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,180
note.

2058
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,980
That has

2059
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,140
to be

2060
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:55,580
some kind

2061
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:55,700
of

2062
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,120
substance.

2063
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:56,620
Instead

2064
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:56,740
of

2065
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,080
carrying

2066
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,700
a ton

2067
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:57,860
of

2068
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,420
potatoes,

2069
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,260
you can

2070
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,520
bring

2071
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,440
gold or

2072
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:00,740
silver.

2073
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,060
It's

2074
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:01,380
much more

2075
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:01,780
portable.

2076
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,180
Economy

2077
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,480
means

2078
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:09,960
management

2079
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,420
of the

2080
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:10,680
house.

2081
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,400
Ecos

2082
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,680
means

2083
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,860
house or

2084
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,280
habitation.

2085
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:18,880
Nomos

2086
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,140
means

2087
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,520
loss.

2088
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,140
Economy

2089
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,560
literally

2090
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:20,940
means

2091
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,440
management

2092
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:21,920
of the

2093
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,220
house.

2094
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:22,880
When people

2095
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,440
these days

2096
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,260
say the

2097
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,700
economy is

2098
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,140
not doing

2099
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,380
well,

2100
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,660
I say,

2101
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:27,400
what economy?

2102
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,460
We don't

2103
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:28,780
have an

2104
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,240
economy.

2105
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,320
What are

2106
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:30,620
you talking

2107
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:30,960
about?

2108
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,040
They look

2109
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,520
at me like

2110
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,780
I'm strange

2111
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,200
or something.

2112
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:34,700
Economy

2113
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,240
means

2114
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,840
management

2115
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,940
of commerce.

2116
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,160
There's

2117
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:37,700
no management

2118
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,120
of commerce.

2119
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:38,440
It's a

2120
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:38,820
free-for-all

2121
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,820
right now.

2122
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,960
Or it's

2123
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,320
management.

2124
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,400
Or it's

2125
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,920
being managed

2126
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,580
one-sided,

2127
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:43,880
right?

2128
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,120
So,

2129
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:48,760
there's

2130
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,020
your,

2131
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:49,940
on the

2132
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,340
occult

2133
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:50,720
side,

2134
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,020
what's

2135
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,740
going on

2136
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,640
is you

2137
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,000
have the

2138
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,620
supreme being

2139
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:54,880
of the

2140
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,160
universe

2141
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,600
telling you

2142
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:55,900
not to

2143
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,340
do things

2144
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:56,860
and you're

2145
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,720
doing things

2146
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,180
you're not

2147
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:58,600
supposed to

2148
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,200
do because

2149
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,720
you don't

2150
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,100
know you're

2151
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,520
doing them.

2152
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,200
Boy,

2153
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:01,680
does that sound

2154
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,220
confusing.

2155
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:03,360
Well,

2156
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,760
it's true

2157
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,040
though.

2158
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,980
We've been

2159
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,620
taught everything

2160
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,400
that's wrong

2161
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:07,780
that we've

2162
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,280
been taught

2163
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,220
or brainwashed

2164
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:09,700
to believe.

2165
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:11,720
But what

2166
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,580
happens is

2167
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,360
after a while

2168
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,860
those doing

2169
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:14,580
the brainwashing

2170
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,160
forget that

2171
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,340
they're

2172
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:15,860
brainwashing

2173
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,060
and they

2174
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,280
end up

2175
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:16,660
doing it

2176
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,120
themselves

2177
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:17,600
also.

2178
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:18,600
And they

2179
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,100
don't know

2180
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,080
what they're

2181
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,340
doing

2182
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,980
themselves.

2183
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,260
For example,

2184
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:22,600
you know,

2185
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,200
if Henry Ford

2186
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,640
started,

2187
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:23,940
you know,

2188
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,620
Ford Motor

2189
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,340
Corporation

2190
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,020
in his

2191
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:26,560
garage with

2192
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,000
a thousand

2193
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,500
bucks,

2194
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:28,840
right,

2195
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:29,660
if you

2196
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,140
take his

2197
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,080
great-grandson

2198
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,700
and today's

2199
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:32,920
money,

2200
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:33,280
give him

2201
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:33,600
a hundred

2202
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:33,960
grand,

2203
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:34,520
let's say,

2204
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,220
in a garage

2205
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:35,560
and tell him

2206
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,100
go start

2207
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,020
a motor

2208
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,420
company,

2209
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:37,760
you think

2210
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,220
he can do

2211
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:38,400
it?

2212
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,060
Probably not.

2213
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah,

2214
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:41,780
most likely

2215
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,140
not.

2216
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:43,480
So again,

2217
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,040
it's timing

2218
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,160
and people

2219
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,540
are picked

2220
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,100
to do certain

2221
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,520
things.

2222
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:47,460
You see,

2223
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,500
there's a

2224
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,000
very big

2225
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,720
scope here.

2226
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,320
So,

2227
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,100
you know,

2228
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,580
what's funny

2229
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,040
is,

2230
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,240
you know,

2231
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:56,740
I'll explain

2232
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,620
this to people

2233
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:57,900
and they'll

2234
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,040
say,

2235
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:58,320
wow,

2236
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,840
that's really

2237
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,280
horrible,

2238
01:04:59,280 --> 01:04:59,520
you know,

2239
01:04:59,580 --> 01:04:59,980
the birthday

2240
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:00,260
and the

2241
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:00,820
dolls and all

2242
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,040
that,

2243
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,040
and I get

2244
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:02,500
a call a

2245
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:02,820
week later,

2246
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:02,980
hey,

2247
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,240
you want to

2248
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:03,440
come to

2249
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:03,800
his birthday

2250
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,140
party?

2251
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:06,920
So they

2252
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,380
don't take

2253
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:07,940
it literally.

2254
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:09,860
Yeah,

2255
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,160
like,

2256
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:10,780
excuse me,

2257
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,420
are you

2258
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:11,800
taking a

2259
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,160
piss right

2260
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:12,480
now or

2261
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:12,740
something,

2262
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,080
so you

2263
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,440
want to

2264
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:13,680
call me

2265
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,120
back later

2266
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:14,420
maybe?

2267
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:14,800
I mean,

2268
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,120
you know,

2269
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,800
sorry to say

2270
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,180
it that way,

2271
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,080
but it's

2272
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:17,200
like,

2273
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:17,520
how can

2274
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:17,900
you ask

2275
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,300
me that?

2276
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,740
You know,

2277
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,520
it's kind

2278
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:20,980
of like,

2279
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,300
I ask

2280
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:22,660
people,

2281
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,240
it's the

2282
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,360
same thing,

2283
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,060
we don't

2284
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:25,360
have,

2285
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,760
we're not

2286
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,380
impeccable

2287
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,480
with what

2288
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,020
we say.

2289
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,440
And if

2290
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,680
you're not

2291
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,220
impeccable

2292
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:30,660
with what

2293
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,100
you say

2294
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:31,380
or with

2295
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:31,660
words,

2296
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,160
you can't

2297
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,900
be impeccable

2298
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,440
with how

2299
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,100
you act.

2300
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,080
Because you're

2301
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,640
only as good

2302
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:36,960
as your

2303
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,320
word.

2304
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:38,560
You know,

2305
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,460
if someone

2306
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,240
approaches me,

2307
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,860
my kids,

2308
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,320
my kids,

2309
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:41,780
my kids,

2310
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,160
I'm like,

2311
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,900
you have

2312
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,260
goats?

2313
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:43,920
Well,

2314
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,300
you know what

2315
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:44,720
I mean.

2316
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,040
I'm like,

2317
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:45,200
yeah,

2318
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:45,460
I know

2319
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:45,660
what you

2320
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:45,940
mean when

2321
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:46,080
you say

2322
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,340
kids,

2323
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:46,600
it's a

2324
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,080
baby goat.

2325
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:47,580
I thought no

2326
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,100
animals were

2327
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,700
allowed there.

2328
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:49,580
Well,

2329
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,320
you know,

2330
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,020
I mean

2331
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,420
children.

2332
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,380
So you

2333
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,400
mean children

2334
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,700
but you

2335
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,340
say goats.

2336
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:54,880
So your

2337
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,420
word isn't

2338
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:55,920
any good.

2339
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:56,760
So if all

2340
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,240
you've got is

2341
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:57,620
your word

2342
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:57,840
and your

2343
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,640
word isn't

2344
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,160
any good,

2345
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,180
I can't

2346
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:00,620
do business

2347
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:00,980
with you,

2348
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,320
I can't

2349
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:01,700
trust you,

2350
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:01,940
I can't

2351
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,320
have you as

2352
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:02,760
a friend.

2353
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,140
So what

2354
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:03,480
am I supposed

2355
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:03,940
to do with

2356
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,300
you now?

2357
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,320
I think it's

2358
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:07,820
just that we

2359
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,440
don't take our

2360
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,320
word as

2361
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,880
strongly as

2362
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,000
we should or

2363
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,720
we don't,

2364
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,080
you know,

2365
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:13,740
claim it as

2366
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,340
strongly or

2367
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,480
take it as

2368
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,140
literally as

2369
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:16,620
we should,

2370
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,340
maybe is the

2371
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,080
proper way to

2372
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,440
say it.

2373
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,580
Everything is,

2374
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:19,960
you know,

2375
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,460
like,

2376
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,420
oh,

2377
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,240
it's okay,

2378
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:22,940
it's not

2379
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,880
that important,

2380
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,720
it's only

2381
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,040
words when

2382
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,660
we should be

2383
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,200
listening to

2384
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:27,460
what we're

2385
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:27,860
saying and

2386
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,500
really listening

2387
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,980
and understanding

2388
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:31,980
exactly what

2389
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:32,420
we're saying

2390
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,520
because by

2391
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,280
saying it,

2392
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,000
by putting it

2393
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,580
out there,

2394
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,280
we're making

2395
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,100
it happen or

2396
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:38,700
we're causing,

2397
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:40,240
it's like,

2398
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:40,760
everything is

2399
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,360
like a ritual

2400
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,180
it seems like.

2401
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:42,920
Yes,

2402
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:43,620
and why do

2403
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,060
they say

2404
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:44,660
kids very

2405
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,160
specifically?

2406
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:45,540
Why don't

2407
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:45,980
they just say

2408
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,680
pigs or

2409
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,720
sheep or

2410
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,640
birds?

2411
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:48,960
Why do

2412
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,300
they pick

2413
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:49,820
kids?

2414
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,200
Because

2415
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:51,560
a kid,

2416
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,560
it's very

2417
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,120
specific,

2418
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,460
a kid is a

2419
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,500
sacrificial animal

2420
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,440
to the adversary

2421
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,260
or people

2422
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:57,680
call him

2423
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,140
Satan or

2424
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:58,580
the devil,

2425
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,180
It's the

2426
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,640
Azizel,

2427
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:00,940
right?

2428
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:01,820
So it's

2429
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,720
very interesting,

2430
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,200
you look at

2431
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:03,540
it, there's

2432
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,220
no coincidence.

2433
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:04,940
You see

2434
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,240
when people

2435
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:05,460
say,

2436
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:05,640
oh,

2437
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:05,880
that's a

2438
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,380
coincidence,

2439
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,260
well,

2440
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:07,580
the word

2441
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,720
coincidence actually

2442
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,240
means to

2443
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:10,660
coincide with,

2444
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,340
and for something

2445
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,260
to coincide with

2446
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:12,840
something else,

2447
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:13,340
there has to be

2448
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:13,740
a plan,

2449
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,000
right?

2450
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,260
So there is

2451
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:17,920
no coincidence,

2452
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:18,700
meaning the

2453
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,340
way that people

2454
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:19,820
use it,

2455
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,060
right?

2456
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:22,580
It's a

2457
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,320
coincidence that

2458
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:23,860
I came on

2459
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,320
the phone,

2460
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:25,960
on the show

2461
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,420
tonight,

2462
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,080
on the call

2463
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,440
tonight,

2464
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,620
because I

2465
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,140
knew that

2466
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:29,760
around 6

2467
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,280
o'clock I

2468
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:30,600
had to

2469
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,060
call in,

2470
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:31,920
so I knew

2471
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,780
that me dialing

2472
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,320
on this phone

2473
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,220
had to coincide

2474
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:34,920
with that time,

2475
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,460
so it was a

2476
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:35,820
coincidence,

2477
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,300
you see.

2478
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,320
You see how

2479
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:37,680
we're not

2480
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,320
using words

2481
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:38,840
properly?

2482
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,820
And even

2483
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,700
the most important

2484
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,740
contracts are

2485
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,480
only worth the

2486
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,120
paper that

2487
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:46,520
they're written

2488
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,620
on if no

2489
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:47,920
one's going

2490
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,320
to follow

2491
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:48,520
them,

2492
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:48,860
they're just

2493
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,260
words.

2494
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,820
You know,

2495
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,300
for example,

2496
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,780
when someone

2497
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,220
makes a

2498
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,200
declaration and

2499
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:53,760
signs it under

2500
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,580
the penalty of

2501
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:54,960
perjury,

2502
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,560
meaning that's

2503
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:55,900
done,

2504
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:56,400
right?

2505
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:56,960
This is a

2506
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,520
done deal.

2507
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,720
I can't give

2508
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,320
you any more

2509
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,600
than that on

2510
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:00,960
paper,

2511
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,280
right?

2512
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:01,740
Can you?

2513
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,060
No,

2514
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:02,660
it's about the

2515
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,640
ultimate promise

2516
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,540
when you sign

2517
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:05,880
under the

2518
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,380
penalty of

2519
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:06,760
perjury,

2520
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,020
right?

2521
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:09,420
Okay,

2522
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:09,720
well,

2523
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,200
if you don't

2524
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:10,700
have paper,

2525
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,080
what do you

2526
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:11,300
do?

2527
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,920
You say it

2528
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,580
three times.

2529
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:15,640
And,

2530
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:15,899
you know,

2531
01:08:15,939 --> 01:08:16,479
recently I was

2532
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,040
helping someone

2533
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,800
with a project

2534
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,760
and I said,

2535
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:20,399
I'm about done,

2536
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:20,760
and he said,

2537
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,380
are you done,

2538
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:21,660
done?

2539
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,160
Meaning like,

2540
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:23,399
you know,

2541
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:23,939
you're really

2542
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:24,359
finished,

2543
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:24,600
you know,

2544
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,120
versus just

2545
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:25,640
finishing a

2546
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,260
certain area

2547
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:26,700
of something.

2548
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:27,640
Yeah.

2549
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,060
And then

2550
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,660
when it was

2551
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:29,800
said,

2552
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:30,080
no.

2553
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:31,560
See,

2554
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,140
and then

2555
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:32,380
I said,

2556
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,040
when I'm done,

2557
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:33,700
he says,

2558
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,359
are you done,

2559
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:34,580
done?

2560
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:34,840
I said,

2561
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,060
yes,

2562
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:35,560
I'm done,

2563
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:35,960
done,

2564
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,420
done.

2565
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:37,620
It's done,

2566
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:38,319
right?

2567
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,140
So it's

2568
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,540
finished.

2569
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:40,479
So three

2570
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,080
times or

2571
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,500
twice,

2572
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:41,800
you know,

2573
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:42,420
twice means

2574
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:42,700
it's,

2575
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:42,979
you know,

2576
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,540
you have my

2577
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:43,740
point,

2578
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:44,040
you've heard

2579
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,580
that before.

2580
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,520
Sure.

2581
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:45,859
We can

2582
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,920
operate without

2583
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,460
paper,

2584
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,060
but can

2585
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:48,260
we?

2586
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,180
You see

2587
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,020
how people

2588
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:51,300
have been

2589
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:51,720
trained a

2590
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,300
certain way.

2591
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:54,600
Again,

2592
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:55,600
these societies,

2593
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,220
for example,

2594
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,200
that are in

2595
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,580
power,

2596
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:58,399
you know,

2597
01:08:58,439 --> 01:08:59,020
knowledge is

2598
01:08:59,020 --> 01:08:59,640
power and

2599
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,439
the people in

2600
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,100
power have

2601
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:01,479
a certain

2602
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,160
knowledge that

2603
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:03,880
the common

2604
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,220
folk don't

2605
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:05,700
know because

2606
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,319
it hasn't been

2607
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:06,920
shared or

2608
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,439
it's been

2609
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,140
lost,

2610
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:11,069
right?

2611
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,050
So what

2612
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:12,689
knowledge is?

2613
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,529
It's knowledge

2614
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:13,950
of the

2615
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,729
spiritual world.

2616
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,470
You notice how

2617
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:16,569
very little of

2618
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,109
the spiritual

2619
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:17,649
world is

2620
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:18,010
taught?

2621
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:19,410
They

2622
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,010
scooped it

2623
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:21,790
under religion

2624
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,830
and when I

2625
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,590
say spiritual,

2626
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,630
I think I've

2627
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,270
done this with

2628
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:25,750
you before,

2629
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,050
but I

2630
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:28,350
have a

2631
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,750
spiritual

2632
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:29,729
relationship

2633
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:30,370
with everyone

2634
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,170
on this call

2635
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:31,689
and,

2636
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:31,910
you know,

2637
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:32,290
when I say

2638
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:32,590
that to

2639
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:32,990
people,

2640
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:33,910
you know,

2641
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:34,290
oh,

2642
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:34,630
yeah,

2643
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,010
that makes me

2644
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:35,689
feel so good

2645
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:36,149
or whatever.

2646
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,250
Do you know

2647
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:37,710
why I said

2648
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:37,850
that?

2649
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:38,109
They're like,

2650
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,310
yeah,

2651
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:38,609
because we

2652
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:39,010
talk about

2653
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:39,890
spiritual things.

2654
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:40,270
No,

2655
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:40,870
that's not

2656
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:41,170
why.

2657
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:42,350
It's because

2658
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:42,770
I've never

2659
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,370
met you in

2660
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:43,790
the flesh.

2661
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:44,029
It's

2662
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:44,649
intangible.

2663
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:45,890
Spiritual

2664
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,970
simply means

2665
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:48,130
intangible.

2666
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:52,660
I don't

2667
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,340
see anyone

2668
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:53,920
or no one's

2669
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,280
present,

2670
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,720
but I'm

2671
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,100
actually

2672
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,640
imparting

2673
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,240
information.

2674
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:57,700
You know,

2675
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,420
you could be doing

2676
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,140
business with

2677
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,600
someone in

2678
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,180
China you've

2679
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:00,780
never met

2680
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,200
and you're

2681
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,600
conveying

2682
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,220
information

2683
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:02,740
back and

2684
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:02,960
forth,

2685
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,480
contracts,

2686
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,220
instructions,

2687
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:04,760
business.

2688
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,520
That's a

2689
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:05,900
spiritual

2690
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,540
relationship

2691
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,220
because you've

2692
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:07,640
never met

2693
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:07,940
them in

2694
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,440
the flesh.

2695
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,520
Once you

2696
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:09,860
meet them

2697
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,080
in the

2698
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,340
flesh,

2699
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:10,660
now you

2700
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:10,940
have a

2701
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,480
spiritual

2702
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:11,980
with the

2703
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,320
body.

2704
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,160
You shook

2705
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:13,620
their hand.

2706
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:13,840
You know

2707
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,120
what they

2708
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:14,680
look like.

2709
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,400
You can

2710
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:15,660
go have

2711
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,340
lunch together.

2712
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:16,760
Now you're

2713
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,000
on the

2714
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,540
next level,

2715
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:17,880
you see.

2716
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,100
So when

2717
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:20,560
you read in

2718
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,260
Scripture that

2719
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:21,700
this is

2720
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:22,540
spiritual,

2721
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,480
that's all

2722
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:23,940
it means.

2723
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:24,580
It's very

2724
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:24,980
simple.

2725
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:26,380
But you

2726
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:26,680
have, you

2727
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:26,780
know,

2728
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,200
the New

2729
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,240
Testament

2730
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,400
and all

2731
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:28,920
this other

2732
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,660
religious stuff.

2733
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:29,960
Oh,

2734
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:30,520
spiritual,

2735
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,000
it's got to

2736
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,600
be good.

2737
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,180
No,

2738
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:32,900
spiritual could

2739
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,300
be pretty

2740
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,700
bad.

2741
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:34,700
You can

2742
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:34,980
have a

2743
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,680
general in

2744
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,040
Washington,

2745
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:36,460
D.C.

2746
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
telling a

2747
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,220
colonel in

2748
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,180
Afghanistan to

2749
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:39,500
put his

2750
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,000
finger on

2751
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,420
the button

2752
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:40,880
right there

2753
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,220
and launch

2754
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:41,660
the missile.

2755
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,260
Right?

2756
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,220
That's

2757
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:43,580
spiritual.

2758
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:45,980
Never met

2759
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,360
the guy,

2760
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:46,700
but he's

2761
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,100
giving him

2762
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,600
instructions.

2763
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,680
So we've

2764
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,580
lost accuracy

2765
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,340
to the point

2766
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,000
where I'm

2767
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,660
just amazed

2768
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,360
anyone's here

2769
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:54,840
on the planet

2770
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,980
left and

2771
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,440
anything's

2772
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:56,880
functioning.

2773
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Every day I

2774
01:10:59,400 --> 01:10:59,900
wake up and

2775
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,440
I'm amazed.

2776
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,140
It's all

2777
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:01,600
still here.

2778
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:01,880
I'm like,

2779
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,180
okay,

2780
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,320
everybody's

2781
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:03,800
still here.

2782
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,280
Wow,

2783
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,160
it's amazing,

2784
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:05,400
we're

2785
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:05,820
functioning.

2786
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:07,920
You know?

2787
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,720
Yeah.

2788
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,580
Well,

2789
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,240
that must be

2790
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:10,740
for a reason.

2791
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:11,940
Yeah,

2792
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,700
and the reason is

2793
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,120
when you start

2794
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,600
reading and

2795
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,040
you find

2796
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,640
out that

2797
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,320
the

2798
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:16,760
scripture,

2799
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,480
the Bible,

2800
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,280
is basically

2801
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:18,880
an appointment

2802
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,280
book.

2803
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:20,980
It's an

2804
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:21,400
instruction

2805
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,280
manual for

2806
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,300
anything and

2807
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:23,820
everything you

2808
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,220
can do in

2809
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:24,600
your life.

2810
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:24,800
There's

2811
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,240
nothing you

2812
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:25,720
can do that

2813
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:25,980
you won't

2814
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,460
find in

2815
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:26,680
there.

2816
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,420
So,

2817
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,660
there's 615

2818
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,240
various

2819
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:30,700
codes,

2820
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:31,640
laws,

2821
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,860
legal stuff

2822
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,640
and statutes.

2823
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:34,540
And I know

2824
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:34,940
how a lot

2825
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:35,300
of people

2826
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,540
say,

2827
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:35,840
well,

2828
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,620
lawful isn't

2829
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,440
legal or

2830
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:37,980
all this

2831
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:38,520
other stuff.

2832
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,720
And I

2833
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:38,820
say,

2834
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,160
wait a

2835
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:39,260
minute,

2836
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,240
let's

2837
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:40,660
hold on

2838
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:40,900
here.

2839
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,640
If you

2840
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,240
want common

2841
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:43,680
law,

2842
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,600
everyone

2843
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,840
agrees that

2844
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,300
in order to

2845
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,440
have common law in law you have to have an injured party right where's the

2846
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,000
injured party right you can't injure a piece of paper can you you know so

2847
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,760
there's no injured party there's no case right right but in common law you've got

2848
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,980
this particular thing called treason and when someone commits treason it's a

2849
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:13,400
death defense death penalty right right okay you know if you go to court for in

2850
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:20,440
common law court for treason can you show me the injured party please where's

2851
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:29,490
the injured party in treason there isn't yeah it's a legal aspect there's

2852
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:34,730
legal and law are the same one but they're different one is legal actually

2853
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:39,150
has to do with agreement because if there is no injured party no one can

2854
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:44,230
testify but every people the authorities that be have to all be in agreement that

2855
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:50,270
this man or woman did something that would prevent us from being proper

2856
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:56,170
stewards in this nation and it would harm the population right like if you

2857
01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:00,930
were for example a spy and you were caught and you were giving information

2858
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,730
that would jeopardize the safety of your country and the people in your country

2859
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:09,730
could no longer be proper stewards you know take care of themselves be

2860
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:15,670
vulnerable to losing everything you see it operates on many levels so that's why

2861
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:18,770
in scripture there's a lot of stewardship how to take care of the land

2862
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:24,050
you know where's the injured party when you blaspheme you know blasphemy for

2863
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:33,420
example in scripture is a death offense right there's certain things that are

2864
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,720
death offenses whether you won't find an injured party so what I'm saying is

2865
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,160
there's a lot of a little bit of just because a little knowledge is good a

2866
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,900
lot doesn't mean it's better right you have to kind of slow down and work it

2867
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,560
through and really comprehend and understand what you're what you're

2868
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:56,900
learning you can't do far forward and discernment has to be there and we've

2869
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,120
all just pretty much taken for granted what we've been told and not looked it

2870
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:06,380
up for ourselves or or even gotten curious enough to look it up it was like

2871
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:15,800
it's not it's it's like nonchalant it's like no one made it that important yeah

2872
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,400
we didn't come to that conclusion ourselves to make it that important to

2873
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:26,740
look up every single word and understand exactly what it meant well during the

2874
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,960
for our formative years you see education has to be completed at least

2875
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,760
the bulk of it and then the discernment aspect during your formative years

2876
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,320
meaning like you know when it when are you not really considered a baby anymore

2877
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:47,300
it gets between like seven years old and 13 like at 13 years old they start to go

2878
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,840
through other changes like puberty and you get you know changes you're not

2879
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,340
interested in learning anymore interested in the opposite sex right yeah

2880
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,540
you have to get the ball changes yeah if you've got to get the bulk of the

2881
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:03,660
attention span and the learning done between 7 and 13 years old you've got a

2882
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:08,020
five-year window you know if you're sitting there you're 16 17 18 in high

2883
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:12,420
school and they're talking about something in class well you hear and

2884
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,300
want want want want wine you're wondering who you can ask out on a date

2885
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,580
for Saturday right it's too late yeah so you've got to get all your education done

2886
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:26,600
between 7 and 13 years old and pretty much figure out what you want to do in

2887
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,920
life by 13 this is how society operated for thousands of years up until recently

2888
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,380
see so the human let's see here the people's bodies haven't changed the way

2889
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,980
our brains are wired haven't changed but everything else has why I guess it's to

2890
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:44,740
take us down into another direction when I say us I mean the collective us on

2891
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,560
this planet now and everyone is so concerned you know about you know this

2892
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,180
country or that country but everything that's happening right now is on a

2893
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:59,940
planetary scale when I say right now I mean since 1998 till now in 1998 was

2894
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:05,520
when the last age ended we're in the final or in the seventh age actually the

2895
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:13,700
third age or the 7,000 biblical year it's the year 6,013 since Adam right so

2896
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,200
that means you know we've finished the 6,000 completely we're 13 years into the

2897
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:22,420
seventh millennium so there's a lot of specific things that are going to happen

2898
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:28,260
how do you arrive at that you know when you read scripture you know you get

2899
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,940
around chapter 5 and you start reading all the begats you know like Adam begat

2900
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:37,640
Seth and he lived this long and he begat went on and he begat and he begat I call

2901
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,380
it the begats goes for like two chapters and you're reading you're like why am I

2902
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:45,560
reading this you know why am I reading this who cares if this guy lived to 800

2903
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,740
or 600 you know so what you got to do is make a chart and follow that all the way

2904
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:55,320
down at least to them when the Messiah was born and you'll know then the Messiah

2905
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:02,200
was born exactly in the year 4,000 since Adam not since creation since Adam is

2906
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:08,700
where how we're measuring time okay right now by the way a little thing for

2907
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:14,640
you science buffs out there you know how we just talked about in the begats

2908
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,700
you know like Adam lived till 900 and something and this other guy lived till

2909
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,920
600 right and you read them and you're like this can't be right you know you

2910
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:28,400
notice after the flood the the life expectancy came down right well for your

2911
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,840
science buffs again you know how you watch you know oh even if you go to

2912
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,080
university or television you know whatever they pull out this big skull or

2913
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,520
you know and they say well this is Cro-Magnon man right and this is a

2914
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,540
regular human skull you know this is a big difference in size you know they're

2915
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,780
like you know these well we had homo sapien all this way they make up all

2916
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,420
these terms and you have to claim them as yeah yeah yeah well what they're

2917
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,260
actually showing you is someone who's lived many centuries because if you

2918
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:00,620
study osteopathy it tells you that the longer you live the more your bones grow

2919
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:10,580
right if you study what the study of osteopathy yeah actually sometimes the

2920
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:19,860
theopathy I'll say it in Greek sometimes it's a Greek word yeah it tells you in

2921
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,060
normal study you know like osteopathy 101 it tells you that the older you get

2922
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:28,320
the more your brown brow bone and your femur bones your thigh bone grow

2923
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:46,410
getting down cutting in and out my cutting out let's see say hello yes I'm

2924
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:52,610
losing you you're getting kicked you're cutting out your battery or something

2925
01:18:54,030 --> 01:19:07,680
are you there Angela I'm losing you I can hear you you're breaking up really

2926
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:20,520
bad I'm sorry I'm using my location again and say are you plugged in my cable

2927
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:35,580
so I don't my in the chest and I'm breaking up so if I hadn't talked okay

2928
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:43,120
are you but you can you can hear me right I like you know I my connection is

2929
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:51,460
I'll keep speaking hopefully you'll remedy it well what's interesting is

2930
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:56,960
things of are not as they appear as we've been saying and I guess when you

2931
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,980
when you wrote on the description about prophecy I mean no one's called in to

2932
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:07,580
ask questions we haven't allowed it yet but I mentioned earlier well actually

2933
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:14,360
there's three people with their hand up waiting to ask the question you think

2934
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,960
we should let questions go right now I'm fine with it it's up to you if you want

2935
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:25,040
to continue on and ask questions later or take questions later and now it's up

2936
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:31,240
to you oh I like to continue a few just a few more topics okay go right ahead

2937
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:37,780
and the mindset is very important and I'm not trying to convince someone of

2938
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:41,860
anything I'm just trying to show you another way of looking at what you think

2939
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,520
is the same thing and when you look at it this way you'll say hey I what I was

2940
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,400
the way I thought it was this thing doesn't resemble anything at all what

2941
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,940
I've been told or taught and when you start researching it on your own you'll

2942
01:20:54,940 --> 01:21:03,040
say oh okay now I'm in limbo you know I'm really lost now and my my intent is

2943
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,600
not to lose anyone but it's to maybe shed light or cause a higher sense of

2944
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,680
discernment you know you ask why but the again many people who say they have

2945
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,920
read the Bible actually have not with with the discernment that's required and

2946
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:25,720
when I spoke earlier on the the main character in Scripture is the Christ or

2947
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:31,960
you could say the Messiah the Savior that has been the focus of Christianity

2948
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,740
Christianity and actually in Judaism as well and what they've put in front of

2949
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:42,260
the world or who they've put in front of the world and both intent and imagery is

2950
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:47,520
incorrect scripturally now I'm not saying it's incorrect if you want to believe in

2951
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,280
it because you can believe in anything but what I'm saying is what I've

2952
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,960
discovered in Scripture and what is being put in front of the world is not

2953
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,210
the same thing at all not by a long shot so the who is the who is this Christ

2954
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:08,390
figure who is the Savior they call him Jesus or Yahshua or you know all these

2955
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:12,890
names and they've got images of him in churches and people wear crosses around

2956
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:18,190
their necks and all this other stuff and I haven't found any evidence of any of

2957
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:21,390
the descriptions in Scripture at all that resemble what's being taught to the

2958
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:26,530
people and that was actually one of the scariest parts of researching Scripture

2959
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:35,660
are you still there Angela yep I am here okay great so what for example when

2960
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:40,160
you go to a church the first image they show you let's say when you when you

2961
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,380
know they say they've just built this church and they open the doors you're

2962
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,160
our first customer come on in right you look down the aisle what do you see at

2963
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:54,960
the end typically see this this symbol looks like a large cross right and you

2964
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,980
see a guy nailed to it with long hair and he's wearing a diaper and he's kind

2965
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,720
of leaning the side it looks real beat up not too happening and that's supposed

2966
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:10,540
to be the way the Messiah or the Christ was executed or killed or that was

2967
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:17,320
supposed to look like him and so far the whole world has accepted that image well

2968
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:26,820
I read Scripture and for example his execution started reading it it's in

2969
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:33,640
the first four books of what they call the New Testament and each one has an

2970
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:39,240
account of it Matthew Mark Luke and John and it's usually towards the end of the

2971
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:46,740
book now if you read the account of how this execution happened in each of the

2972
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:50,300
books and you actually take notes on each one because they each give a little

2973
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,780
bit of information some have a little less information some have a little more

2974
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,420
if you take notes on that and you've also read what's called the Old Testament

2975
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:03,240
in the Law of Moses and all of the prophets and all the Psalms before that

2976
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,400
because what they call the Old Testament is actually the introduction to the New

2977
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:14,140
Testament and you've taken notes on that well you'll put you'll harmonize the

2978
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:19,260
whole scene and you'll and you'll you'll get information put together

2979
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:27,620
that'll say whoa where did they get this image what's this Roman what's this guy

2980
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:33,720
doing on this Roman cross well what's going on you know why why how did Mel

2981
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:39,900
Gibson screw up so bad you know that movie he did recently what is it called

2982
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:44,820
the Passion or something like that right right yeah it's like well wait a

2983
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:48,520
second you know they've made so many films and you always you know this man

2984
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,220
carrying this long cross you know and and they set it up and you see a big

2985
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:56,600
cross in the middle and there's a cross on his right and a cross on his left and

2986
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,600
you know and in Jerusalem they sell tickets to where there's three holes in

2987
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,800
the ground when the old city of Jerusalem you know this is where Jesus

2988
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,260
died you know this is where he was crucified and you read the scripture and

2989
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:14,900
you're like excuse me folks have you guys read the book have you read your

2990
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:21,120
own book at least once do you know what you're doing here no no this is we don't

2991
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,700
believe this is what we believe in you see this is our faith this is our

2992
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:30,940
religion oh I see I see okay well I'll leave you alone to it then you just go

2993
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:39,400
right ahead you know knock yourself out so what am I trying to say well I'll go

2994
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:48,210
through the story very quickly you have this fellow he is the Messiah he's the

2995
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:56,750
character of the Christ in Scripture and the leaders of Jerusalem or the leaders

2996
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:02,670
of Israel at that time are under Roman occupation and the things that he's

2997
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:07,110
saying and the way he's coming off as being an authority is indirectly

2998
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:14,770
challenging the authority and the powers that be so they want him gone so they

2999
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:19,690
can't figure out what to arrest him on but finally they do arrest him on the

3000
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:25,050
charges of blasphemy because scripture says not to blaspheme and the charges

3001
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:28,670
were brought upon him because he said you will see me sitting at the right

3002
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:35,070
hand of the father and the priest tears his robe and says we don't need any

3003
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:40,730
witnesses against him he just witnessed you know he just said it and what's

3004
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:44,750
very interesting a lot of Christians are misled because there's a false witness

3005
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:48,050
they're saying and he told the people not to pay taxes and a lot of people

3006
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:52,030
say well Christians don't have to pay taxes and like yeah that's what the false

3007
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,370
witness that was there said that he actually the Messiah didn't never said

3008
01:26:55,370 --> 01:27:02,010
that and at least document it and there is a scene where he actually walks into

3009
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:07,070
a room with Peter and says look at this tax collector here isn't it isn't it the

3010
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:10,850
law that tax collectors only collect taxes from foreigners and they don't tax

3011
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:16,590
their own people? Taxpayer didn't say anything and Peter said yeah it says

3012
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:20,590
well we don't want to be a stumbling block to this man so why don't you go

3013
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:24,430
catch a fish and you'll find a silver piece in its stomach and why don't you

3014
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:29,110
give it to him half a shekel for me you know half a piece of silver for me and

3015
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:34,230
half a piece of silver for you because that was the required minimum tax half a

3016
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:40,010
piece of silver for every man over 20 right so where does the Messiah say not

3017
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:44,050
to pay taxes when he's paying taxes himself you see so people don't know how

3018
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:48,170
to read I just wanted to interject that so people read that and there's someone

3019
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:52,870
witnessing against him saying that he told the people not to pay taxes he is

3020
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:56,850
one of the false witnesses that are spoken of saying the witness people were

3021
01:27:56,850 --> 01:28:05,460
paid to witness against him. Well to move forward you see because at the time

3022
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:11,820
Israel and the leaders were kind of like a puppet authority because they were

3023
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:17,160
under Roman rule Pontius Pilate was a governor over them really and you know

3024
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,340
they were allowed to rule on minor things but major stuff they had to get

3025
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:28,500
permission from the Roman government so so far we're in accord with a lot of the

3026
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:33,660
movies and stuff they teach in Sunday school right right okay well we're going

3027
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:38,460
to start this is where the diversion starts here well they bring them to

3028
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:44,060
Pilate and they say we want to put a death sentence on this guy capital

3029
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:49,540
punishment right let's say which is actually a Roman term also and Pilate's

3030
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:54,540
wife has dreams and visions not to to leave this man alone and you know

3031
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:00,320
there's things that go back and forth but ultimately Pilate says look I find

3032
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:06,500
no guilt in this man that is worth of death and I've told you this three times

3033
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:14,000
in other words I'm not going back on it I want nothing to do with the death of

3034
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,480
this man no I'm not going to oblige you I'm not going to put him to death and

3035
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:27,120
then if you keep reading Pilate says to the Pharisees you have a law you you

3036
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:35,040
Israelites use your law and the retort back from the Pharisees is well we can't

3037
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,220
run to Caesar's rule he says I'm making this one exception use your law but what

3038
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:44,460
law of Israel supposed to be using at the time but what was the law of the

3039
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:49,720
Israelites they get their law from Moses right so if you go to Deuteronomy 21

3040
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,740
which was one of the five books of the law of Moses you will see in Deuteronomy

3041
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:59,400
21 it says if a son acts a certain way and it's a death offense used to be

3042
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:04,440
nailed to a tree and taken down before sundown so the land does not become

3043
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:13,520
defiled and that's the law they used now the only involvement the Romans had

3044
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:21,020
in this execution was to close off the streets and provide police protection

3045
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:29,480
to keep the crowds back because it was showtime see the the this mosaic form of

3046
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,480
execution hadn't been done since the Romans were had conquered that part of

3047
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,340
the world so it was over a hundred years or maybe 150 years since they'd

3048
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:42,000
seen something like this so it's showtime it's a parade so the Romans

3049
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,320
closed off the streets just like today when you get a parade going right you go

3050
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,500
to the local city and you tell them what you want a parade for and they say okay

3051
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,620
we'll approve it and we'll give you the police protection to close off the

3052
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:59,910
streets and whatever have your day but here's the thing if you read in the law

3053
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:04,050
it says that all executions were to happen outside the city wall so it can't

3054
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:09,910
be at the Golgotha or Calvary that they say he was killed can't be

3055
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:18,520
because that's inside the city wall had it be outside the city wall well but the

3056
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,380
question is how specific can you get on this you can get very specific on it

3057
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:28,460
over and over and over in Scripture there's a metaphor using the almond tree

3058
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:36,420
a l m o n d the seven-branched lampstand was the arm was to be the likeness of an

3059
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:43,360
almond tree in Jeremiah chapter 1 he asked Jeremiah what do you see he says I

3060
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:48,260
see a branch of an almond tree the Creator says yes I shall do it this is

3061
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:53,300
do what you know I basically said do I didn't say that in the scripture in

3062
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,580
Genesis Jacob is hurting some sheep with a rod of an almond and branch and

3063
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:03,760
he peels the bark back to show its stripes and psalms that says through

3064
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,660
our stripes we were healed right so we start to see if we keep reading further

3065
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:18,520
on the Messiah is the center of the lampstand or they call the menorah which

3066
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:26,060
is an almond tree and it has seven branches well you see the Messiah was

3067
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:31,080
nailed to this tree in the Mount of Olives with two other thieves or two

3068
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:36,880
other offenders right so you've got three people nailed to a tree with their

3069
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:43,880
each having two arms up in the air and the center of the tree making it seven

3070
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,020
because you have two times three is six and the center is seven so that's what

3071
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:53,460
the menorah it's still used today they use nine branches or whatever and further

3072
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,880
Hanukkah or whatever but the menorah the lampstand is the likeness of an almond

3073
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:04,320
tree and the almond branch keeps coming up over and over and over so we know it

3074
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:12,120
was an almond tree based on the prophets and the Psalms and being nailed to a

3075
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,760
tree doesn't kill you because you have to be taken down by night so you have to

3076
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:22,340
be hasty the method of execution in the Bible because remember they're using

3077
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:29,760
their law Pontius Pilate said use your law the method of execution is not being

3078
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,440
nailed to a tree it's actually stoning and if you read in Luke when he left the

3079
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,820
Messiah or the Christ was leaving the temple he the people wanted to stone him

3080
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:48,920
and he turns around he says twice you've tried to stone me already why so when he

3081
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:53,100
was nailed to the tree the people were being held back and they were throwing

3082
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:57,080
stones at him until all this flesh was ripped off of his body which is in the

3083
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:02,940
Psalms as well and it's very important to understand that the Messiah the

3084
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,460
scripture says and that the Messiah will explain everything to us and he

3085
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:12,300
actually does and the Messiah says haven't you read Moses the Psalms and

3086
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:16,800
the prophets they tell you all about me he didn't say wait for this new religion

3087
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,800
coming around you know that they'll tell you about me no he says you have to go

3088
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:28,200
to Moses the prophets and the Psalms so the keys to all this information is in

3089
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:32,920
five books of Moses all the books of the prophets and reading the Psalms you'll

3090
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:38,320
find great detail on how he was executed and he was front and center he received

3091
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:43,540
all of the blows from the stoning the the other two offenders let's say one was on

3092
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:46,820
his left one was on his right they received partial blows on their sides

3093
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:52,360
that's why their legs had to be broken if you read it the centurion saw that the

3094
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:58,940
Christ was dead and he walked around to the other and saw he was still alive and

3095
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:03,840
he walked around to the other he didn't go from cross to cross so what I'm saying

3096
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:12,080
is what why is this important to know you know to some it probably isn't but to

3097
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:17,020
others if you actually research it and you find it to be true you will see

3098
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:22,200
what's going on that this image that's being put in front of us as being the

3099
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,960
Christ is not even close and you've got a lot of other groups I should say

3100
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:32,580
Jehovah Witness or whoever else I didn't want to get into you know they all have

3101
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:38,420
their own quote-unquote theories you know he was nailed to a stake you know or

3102
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:42,600
something and everyone's got their own idea but it's not from Scripture well

3103
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,900
what they you know the Greek word style Romano's or style girls they've

3104
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:53,480
translated to crucifixion and Messiah said carry your stake there was a stake

3105
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:59,480
involved it looked like a what would be a metaphorically a railroad tie because

3106
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,940
you they didn't tell you to just get up on this ladder lean on the tree so we

3107
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:07,020
could nail you to it it didn't work that way those executions were done they were

3108
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:13,660
very brutal they would they would beat the person to be executed very badly and

3109
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:19,980
nail him to a crossbar cross beam on the ground and they would have been nailed

3110
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:23,100
the cross beam to the tree and then nail your feet to the tree and that's how the

3111
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,980
execution was done I like to set up for the execution and then you were stoned

3112
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:34,480
in that position so this is a very different account on what is being

3113
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:42,540
taught and or celebrated and to me it's very clear by reading it in the

3114
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:49,760
scripture and anyone who can read it forensically and and has read the law

3115
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:56,300
and has read the dialogue between the Roman authorities and the the

3116
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:04,300
authorities of Israel at the time will see it as plain as day now we can get

3117
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:09,680
you know into the spiritual aspect of it you know a lot of things have been

3118
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,140
branched off you know people say well you have to be saved and I asked them

3119
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,960
what are you going to be saved from you know or I live under grace will you

3120
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,700
define grace they can't define these terms these are things that people have

3121
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:26,500
been told that are not scriptural whatsoever we have some people that

3122
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:33,580
would like to ask questions all right I'll take some okay the first one is SB3

3123

we're going to move on to Daniel Ray one go ahead Daniel Ray one Daniel Ray did

3137
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:18,400
you want to ask a question do you have a mute button on your phone maybe Daniel

3138
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:29,020
Ray one okay there we go okay I have three first of all why you catch colds

3139
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:33,560
in the wintertime that's an interesting scenario on foods but also could be a

3140
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:37,660
factor of sunshine where in the summertime we have a lot of vitamin D

3141
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:41,720
production which saves off a lot of illnesses in the wintertime we don't have

3142
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:51,040
much vitamin D could it be also a factor yes and no yes if you if we properly

3143
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,420
look at what you is called vitamin D but no because there's really no such thing

3144
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:03,920
as a vitamin okay what they've done is taken bodies non-living bodies dissected

3145
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,960
them in laboratories look at the chemicals that are involved and said

3146
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,920
let's call these things vitamins because every cell seems to have it and maybe

3147
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:19,260
you need it and maybe we can actually bottle these things and and sell them in

3148
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:24,520
other words measuring something changes that thing so what do if you look at all

3149
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:30,540
of these for example chemicals or vitamins I should say like vitamin C well

3150
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:35,380
vitamin C is ascorbic acid right well is it if you've ever worked with ascorbic

3151
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:40,140
acid you wouldn't want that in your body and what they do is for example take an

3152
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:44,060
orange apart you know and they kill it first right because you have to juice it

3153
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:48,440
and heat it and separate all the parts out of it right and they say well look

3154
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:53,700
this thing appears to be like ascorbic acid oh so it's in an orange let's call

3155
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:58,540
it a vitamin you know well you know then if you read a lot of these medical

3156
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:02,680
documents actually all of them they never tell you anything is they tell you it

3157
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:08,520
appears to be so when you when you guys figure it out why don't you write a

3158
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:14,480
document say hey we figured it out let me know you see when you go to science

3159
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:21,120
class and any level of education they talk about theories or things appear to

3160
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,500
be and I said well you have a conclusion you know for sure I'll buy that

3161
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,860
information but in the meantime I'll just I'll be a little bystander on the

3162
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:37,240
side okay nothing like having the real food food is it they don't they well

3163
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:43,380
here's here's an example of how that aspect of science currently works you

3164
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:48,180
know for example you know someone comes back from war and they say you know hey

3165
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:55,020
man I've got shell shock and they say well well well you know I've got nothing

3166
01:42:55,020 --> 01:43:01,140
for I can't help you if you got shell shock but if you have PTSD and if you can

3167
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:05,560
claim that I've got lots of things I could prescribe for PTSD but I've got

3168
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:11,840
nothing I could prescribe for shell shock you see yeah how you caption it

3169
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:17,960
see that's where they work is this see you know why you contract an illness you

3170
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:21,220
know I've called you contract an illness because when you go there you get

3171
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:24,840
inspected and he has all these books with legal bindings on them and it says

3172
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,720
which one of these diseases do you want to contract with well that's interesting

3173
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:34,460
way of putting it didn't it well is there any other way to put it I'm not being

3174
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:39,760
facetious I'm just saying oh I hear you I am yeah in that way that's interesting

3175
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:45,540
yeah so for example you know I've got a problem with fat I can't help you with

3176
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:50,860
fat but I if you say if you sign here and say that I've diagnosed you with a

3177
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:55,460
lipid disorder will it be this fat also now you claim that you claimed my

3178
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:59,480
creation you've claimed my description well now you can be my subject and my

3179
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:06,240
patient and I can legally prescribe it to you see yeah but for example you know

3180
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,660
if you're a garbage man I can't help you but if you're a sanitation engineer if

3181
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:16,040
you claim to be that my my description then I can help you that's how your

3182
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,480
subject here so yeah I'll claim that one yeah I'll be that I'll claim that

3183
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,820
description oh okay that now if you make this your description I could work with

3184
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:30,560
you right because now you take full liability for it yeah I'm showing you

3185
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:38,580
spiritual the spiritual cognitive side of it in other words being cognitive you

3186
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:43,780
know being aware of what's going on hope I didn't lose anyone with this but when

3187
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:50,480
you measure something that is living you will get different results and if you

3188
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:55,980
measure something when if you kill it and then dissect it and process it and

3189
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:59,740
fractionalize it it won't measure the state they actually the very process of

3190
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:05,580
trying to measure something actually changes that as well you know the

3191
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:09,780
vitamin vitamin part I never bought into and I just basically when people want to

3192
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,540
talk about it say well there's no such thing as a vitamin I don't know I've

3193
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:19,560
never seen a vitamin hanging off of the tree have you you know hardly on jumping

3194
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,940
subject something you brought the other night gave me a reminder of some of the

3195
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:29,560
hair the Greek heritage the story is it's when the children of Israel were led

3196
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:34,640
out of Egypt thousands hundreds of thousands of them a second contingent

3197
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:40,700
left the other way it didn't go across the they went to Greece they went to

3198
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:46,480
Greece right as a matter of fact everyone left Egypt for a short time and

3199
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:52,540
the modern Egyptian people actually the ancient Egyptian people are still

3200
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:58,320
occupying some of the Caucasus area parts of Russia and Armenia and most of

3201
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,400
the modern Egyptian people in Egypt today are actually of Canaanite descent

3202
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:10,100
Phoenicia yeah then they went from the Greece they went down into Spain and they

3203
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:14,680
traded with the Spanish and they fought with the Spanish and had difficulty

3204
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:20,020
finding the Spanish gave them Portugal and they continued to contract and trade

3205
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:22,940
with the Spanish and fought with the Spanish so they finally say well we got

3206
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:27,800
to move again so they took their boats and then exploring up north along the

3207
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:35,780
coast to the Green Isles and the gal the woman who is the the leader and his

3208
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,820
wife and his wife was named Skoda and so he took all these people the majority

3209
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:45,460
of them and went north to the Green Islands and that became the land of

3210
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:52,600
Skoda or Scotland so the Scots to a great extent of the house of Israel of course

3211
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:58,020
the Irish gave them suppose they gave them the bagpipe and the Irish claim

3212
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:04,580
they still haven't caught the joke okay however the bagpipe also traces back to

3213
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:09,020
the Egypt right and it's I believe it's once mentioned in scripture or something

3214
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:15,360
like that so you may have you may have very close relatives in Scotland perhaps

3215
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:22,540
I do that's the third item the third item you mentioned in the night was

3216
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:27,480
going to talk a little bit about some of the future predictions right well the

3217
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:33,900
more than predictions I can I can get to that pretty directly if you like to hear

3218
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:41,560
it yes they're there they're going to happen for sure and the actual detail is

3219
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:47,060
unfolds every day because the information in scripture is actually

3220
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:51,880
very it's like a time-release capsule to use with people you know if you watch

3221
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:56,620
television they've got these drugs now that are time-released right so you know

3222
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:02,580
they don't all dissolve at one time one of the promises made by Daniel will shut

3223
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:07,800
up this book until the time of the end and there's a patient that is required

3224
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:14,500
for example when people say I don't do that old obsolete law anymore I said

3225
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:20,920
what do you mean old and obsolete that Moses formally gave that in writing only

3226
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:27,140
four and a half days ago two people are thinking in secular time which is four

3227
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:30,580
and a half thousand years ago it was actually given only four days ago in

3228
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:37,040
the spiritual realm it's not a very long time at all no but essentially the crux

3229
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:42,620
of the matter is I was kind of hesitant to get into a lot of the prophetic

3230
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:49,840
aspects because most people are what I call idiocentric and that's a Greek word

3231
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:56,780
meaning self-centered in other words when people in America read the Bible they

3232
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:01,420
say all the Israelites oh they're American Oh Babylon that's American Oh

3233
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:05,580
Israel that's in America oh this beast is American Oh the Antichrist is the

3234
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:11,420
president right someone in Japan reading it will say Oh Israel is

3235
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:16,440
Japanese Israel is Japan the Antichrist is Japanese this is Babylon is Tokyo

3236
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:20,640
right someone in Russia saying you know well the Israelites are Russian and

3237
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:26,140
Moscow is Babylon and guess what they're all wrong no we know it's all Greek

3238
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:32,600
nope it's not Greek either that's a good point so I am hesitant because people

3239
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,340
want to debate and argue well the Israelites are not this and like I well

3240
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:43,460
whatever but essentially what you're going to see happening temporarily after

3241
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:51,560
1998 there are four seven-year periods plus one five-year period so if you add

3242
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:59,300
that all together you get a pretty good idea after 1998 when you will have the

3243
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:04,660
spiritual dimension I call it the fifth dimension enter into this fourth third

3244
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:09,920
plus one or fourth dimension fourth being time now the two do these dimensions will

3245
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:17,780
all meld together and the truth will be exposed but before that happens if you

3246
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:21,860
read in Scripture there's one more world empire or what a lot of people call the

3247
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:27,120
New World Order that will have to take place it will be in power for about seven

3248
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:34,580
years and it'll be extremely powerful the most powerful world order or kingdom

3249
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:40,780
this world has ever seen by a long shot in power and Dominion and this kingdom

3250
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:47,180
is being formed right now it's a political world power it's military it's

3251
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:54,700
judicial it's economic it'll be a world focus and this can be referred to as the

3252
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:59,740
fourth beast of Daniel or the beast in Revelation is being formed right now as

3253
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:06,760
we speak and it is actually going to be a nation a group of ten nations forming

3254
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:11,860
a very loose Confederacy like it's like the EU for example the Confederacy of

3255
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:19,380
Nations and it'll be in the Middle East the thing is one of those nations are

3256
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:26,700
missing right now doesn't exist it's in Psalms 83 if you read Psalms 83 David

3257
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:31,460
says these nine nations come against Israel destroy it well that has to be

3258
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:35,560
prophetic something in the future because all through history Israel never

3259
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:41,280
fought more than a two-front war and it lists all of the nations with great

3260
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:47,180
accuracy and there's actually a group of three that have to be formed but there's

3261
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:51,320
one that's actually missing completely and that's a Syria and at the end of the

3262
01:51:51,320 --> 01:52:00,160
psalm he says and a Syria will join them also so where is a Syria a Syria has

3263
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:10,020
not been a nation for over 2,300 years it's in northern Iraq there are about

3264
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:18,920
over a million of Syrians that live all throughout the world so when we look at

3265
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:24,620
the occurrences and why the Iraq war happened from a secular point of view

3266
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:28,940
you could say yes it was based on weapons of mass destruction which we know

3267
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:33,640
was a lie and or was based on oil greed and power yes but yeah that that's been

3268
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:37,800
going on for thousands of years but now you know the real reason the spiritual

3269
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:42,020
world is in charge this nation had to be formed and this country was used to

3270
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:48,060
form it and if you look a little bit deeper a beast power in Scripture is

3271
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:53,200
defined by a nation that's able to wage war militarily against another so

3272
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:58,860
America does qualify or the United States does qualify as one and the

3273
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:02,680
characteristics the characteristics of this beast or the characteristics of a

3274
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,480
beast in Scripture are always a predatory animal of some sort metaphorically and

3275
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:13,420
what all predators have in common is that the the destroyer eat their prey

3276
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:18,940
but they all do it differently there are different types of predators so this

3277
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:23,260
type of beast system has a characteristic that whenever it goes

3278
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:30,480
into a country most likely it divides it by two or splits it went into Colombia

3279
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:36,980
and formed Panama over 120 years ago went into Germany made East West Germany

3280
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:41,760
went into Korea split Korea went into Vietnam it split Vietnam what are the

3281
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:48,780
chances of it splitting Iraq into two countries like nine out of ten very

3282
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:56,620
very high chance and I've been saying this now for quite a few years and

3283
01:53:56,620 --> 01:54:02,180
recently I think in 09 an Assyrian Congress now when I say us Syrian it's

3284
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:07,160
us Syrian not Syrian an Assyrian Congress was formed in Los Angeles and

3285
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:12,440
they actually put together a small little Constitution and they said well

3286
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,100
we don't have a country yet we'd like to have one but we've got everything ready

3287
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,960
to go so you're going to see that forming and also you're going to see

3288
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,940
the country of Jordan it's going to be divided into three and the current regime

3289
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:32,340
the current king actually that's there now Abdullah I think it is they're going

3290
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:37,980
to be ousted and that's very specific in Psalms 83 as well it lists the Jordan

3291
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:43,240
as three separate countries and that is coming that is coming over the next seven

3292
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:49,760
to twelve years now what does that have to do with what's happening here well I

3293
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,480
just explained to you the purpose of the military involvement of this country or

3294
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:57,340
the people of this country over there from the spiritual world from that other

3295
01:54:57,340 --> 01:55:07,020
dimension but the rest of it is not basically it's not even remotely

3296
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:12,640
mentioned in Scripture or at least this country in any specific specific way

3297
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:16,660
other than when all the nations are mentioned there are many places in

3298
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:20,880
all the nations will do this or this will happen to all the nations such and

3299
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:27,680
such but what you will see happening here is this country and Europe will be

3300
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:36,230
playing second fiddle to this new world empire forming in the Middle East also a

3301
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:41,410
few years ago I was saying to people the middle class will start to dwindle and

3302
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:45,630
in fact be destroyed and you're going to see a lot of economic upheaval it'll

3303
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:52,630
probably start late 2008 early 2009 I've been saying that's enough since

3304
01:55:52,630 --> 01:56:00,410
2005 2004 actually that's pretty accurate yeah well where do you where do

3305
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:04,670
you get that from if you look at the time period in the book of Revelation it

3306
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:08,810
gives you in the earlier chapters and by the way I read Scripture without chapter

3307
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:12,910
and verse because those things are like speed bumps put in there there's a they

3308
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:18,110
were never put in they were never in this scriptures the chapter and verses

3309
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:22,890
recent edition and if you read the scripture without chapter and verse it

3310
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:28,070
has a natural effect on the mind where you should stop and go so I'm not very

3311
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:32,150
good at giving chapter and verse but in the book of Revelation the earlier

3312
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:37,410
chapters it says a day's wages will be X amount of wheat or X amount of barley

3313
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:45,970
but do not harm the oil in the wine Wow okay so who are wage workers this is

3314
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:49,490
going to be their wage so you figure out how much wheat is given there and wait

3315
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:53,190
and you go to the store and say see how much wheat costs and you're like wow a

3316
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:58,590
day's wage is going to be around 20 some odd bucks wow that's not very good but

3317
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:04,550
do not harm the oil and wine are the wealthy and who's doing this are the

3318
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:09,810
horsemen who have been let out already and why is oil and the wine represents

3319
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:13,310
the wealthy well because in order to produce oil and wine you need

3320
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:18,370
infrastructure and that was typically something the wealthy did wage workers

3321
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:23,130
and your middle class did not make oil and wine in order to make oil and wine

3322
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:27,710
for example wine you need vineyards and you need labor to crush the grapes and

3323
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:31,970
you need barrels and you're basically you have to have what's called what

3324
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:38,530
discretionary income today right yep and also oil making oil was a big operation

3325
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:43,470
takes a lot of olives to make a little bit of oil you need a lot of equipment

3326
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:48,330
and storage so that's if you have a biblical mindset you could read that and

3327
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:53,070
say well okay the working class will be pretty much decimated but the wealthy

3328
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:59,490
will not and you can go out and say that for you know you can say that for

3329
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:05,150
example if you preach group gloom and doom at any time during the history of

3330
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:10,270
this people on this planet you'll always be right but can you do it with specifics

3331
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:17,130
and timing no you can't do it unless you're actually following what's in the

3332
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:22,270
manual so you got to look at the timing in there there is a book of Revelation

3333
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:27,910
is four seven-year periods so then you know earlier I said there are four

3334
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:31,690
seven-year periods plus a five-year period where does that five-year period

3335
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:39,040
come from well it comes from Genesis because there are five days before man

3336
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:47,150
comes on the scene right man was made on the sixth day and this is our day in

3337
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:53,330
other words man system the number six six six is the number of a man in

3338
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:57,370
Demetria which is you know when you figure out the name numerically but it

3339
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:02,430
also is the system of man and two witnesses to the system of man it's

3340
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:09,970
basically you know you want your system go ahead go for it see if you like it so

3341
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:13,850
the six six six six basically means the system of man the system of man the

3342
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:21,800
system of man but it also is the number of someone's name now a lot of people

3343
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:25,300
run around and they say well this guy is the Antichrist and this guy is the

3344
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:30,540
Antichrist and that guy's the Antichrist I'm like no and there's a

3345
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:35,120
problem when you study script short scripture in the Bible or the Bible

3346
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:43,320
accurately I tell people be careful of what you say because one of two things

3347
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:50,480
will happen you'll either be laughed at by those who know it or you're going to

3348
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:58,930
be misleading those who don't know it so when people go around screaming about

3349
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:03,850
the Antichrist well is such-and-such or this guy the Antichrist mentioned in

3350
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:10,250
scripture well no doesn't fit well the Antichrist is an Antichrist he's an

3351
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:16,210
Antichrist so he is a he is a Christ or a character that comes out of man system

3352
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:21,250
not of the divine and if you look at scripture very carefully man's number is

3353
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:28,930
six and if you look at when the divine Christ was born his number is four he

3354
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:33,790
was born in the year 4,000 he said I am the Elohim or the mighty one of the

3355
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:37,470
Sabbath or in regular English didn't he say I'm the Lord of the Sabbath I made

3356
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:42,190
the Sabbath for man and not man for the Sabbath remember that yep well the

3357
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:45,430
Sabbath basically means week and how many weeks are there in a month or four

3358
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:50,670
right so here he goes number four again if you keep searching scriptural through

3359
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:55,550
it you'll see the Messiah in the fourth position he's got three on his left and

3360
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:59,510
three on his right that's the number seven number four is directly in the

3361
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:06,380
middle of the number seven so if the Messiah of the scripture divine was born

3362
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:12,120
in the year 4,000 if we want to figure out who the Antichrist is he'd have to

3363
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:20,520
be born in the year 6,000 right with scriptural logic well when was the year

3364
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:30,980
6,000 that was around the fall of 1998 that would make him 13 years old see

3365
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:36,180
yeah so it's not such-and-such and it's not you know the point is that how old

3366
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:39,880
is he how old is this guy you're calling the Antichrist oh he's 52 they're too

3367
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,900
old sorry bye wrong where'd you get that from well

3368
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:47,280
somebody I read something that somebody wrote and that he read something that

3369
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:56,560
somebody wrote yeah what's that yeah somebody channeled it yeah it's like

3370
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,980
reading the cliff notes on the cliff notes on the cliff notes and anyway by

3371
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:03,300
the way if anyone's taken English and you're supposed to read a book and you

3372
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:07,900
read the cliff notes you never get better than a B or a C you've got her

3373
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:13,200
you've got to go right to the source so but there's more detail in scripture

3374
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:18,860
apparently this fellow is of Assyrian descent it's very clear in Isaiah and

3375
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,660
other prophets they call him the Assyrian and we just spoke about a

3376
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:25,960
Syria being formed so he's one of the people that don't live there or live

3377
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:30,440
there and also it states very specifically he will have an injury and

3378
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:37,960
lose his use of his right eye and the use of one of his arms okay so now we're

3379
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:46,010
getting really specific do you see my point yeah so you've got all these

3380
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:50,790
priests and pastors and quote-unquote religious people saying well this is it

3381
02:02:50,790 --> 02:03:01,110
could be good well what are you basing it on you know faith yeah or based on this

3382
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:05,930
timetable that means that the 2012 year is not going to disappear either it's the

3383
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:11,670
Mayan calendar oh okay 2012 I've got two letters and a number for you or I got

3384
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:17,030
three words for the 2012 crowd you know what they are you know what that is

3385
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:28,140
y2k get it yeah what happened during y2k remember all the I mean a lot of guns

3386
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:33,340
canned food and generators were sold right I certainly did yeah but what

3387
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:41,400
happened nothing obvious yeah okay so 2012 equals y2k real simple I mean if I

3388
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:49,340
did fail they wouldn't tell us anyway well first of all there's no such thing

3389
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:53,540
as 2012 and the real reason the Mayan calendar ended is because it was a

3390
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:57,340
government funded the astronomers were were government funded and the

3391
02:03:57,340 --> 02:04:00,320
government ran out of money so that's home to wrap it up real quick

3392
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:10,600
don't think no change yeah have you ever heard of Occam's razor the simplest

3393
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:15,060
explanation is probably the most accurate and actually I did read

3394
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:18,740
something about this oh about 15 years ago because they were talking about 2012

3395
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:23,020
15 years ago and someone pointed out it says why don't you read about what they

3396
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,780
wrote about this in the 1800s on how they reckon that time system and you'll

3397
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:30,840
see that they just decided to end it for no reason at all

3398
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,740
they talked about galactic centers and all this other stuff and it just doesn't

3399
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:38,480
make any sense because the earth is always in the galactic center it's

3400
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:52,840
ridiculous so they just made it up you know what an opportunist is right yeah

3401
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,720
you ever go to a rock concert and they sell t-shirts outside for 20 bucks right

3402
02:04:56,720 --> 02:05:03,380
you know sure you know whenever you have a particular okay for example you know

3403
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:08,840
we go to the movie theater pay 20 bucks for popcorn you know it's called

3404
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:14,680
opportunism right but it's well-deserved I'm not telling anyone to not spend

3405
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:18,740
their money preparing or not telling anyone to tell anyone not to prepare

3406
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:26,560
this is commercial you know I mean it's you see you see commerce goes in luck

3407
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:33,020
with lack of knowledge and lack of information do you see my point you know

3408
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:38,160
there's a good film I suggest people go and get if you haven't seen it it's

3409
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:44,620
called idiocracy I don't know if anyone's seen it surprised yeah it blows

3410
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:48,020
away that people say we gotta see the matrix it's what's going on now matrix

3411
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:52,060
it's like you could show the matrix to a million people and even then you know

3412
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:56,220
like five will get it maybe but if you watch idiocracy in the first five

3413
02:05:56,220 --> 02:06:01,220
minutes you're like oh no this is what's going on right now it's so much better

3414
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:06,180
than the matrix you know in these other films that you know they kind of sneak

3415
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:10,020
in a little thing but they don't really tell it to you like it is you know being

3416
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:13,160
like in the matrix you're plugged into this thing it doesn't really translate

3417
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:16,500
very well but if you watch idiocracy you're like oh I'm living in it right

3418
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:29,260
now this is happening so yeah we tend to romanticize too much but what's again

3419
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:32,300
what's going to happen here is this country is going to be playing second

3420
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:39,840
fiddle to that world economic system that's going to be forming there where

3421
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:51,280
is there the Middle East Syria okay yeah so there's a lot more specifics I

3422
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:59,280
mean we can get like super specific on time and what to watch for example you

3423
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:03,760
know a lot of people I get our idiocentric the word idio is the Greek

3424
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:09,360
word meaning same or self right like that's where you get through the Freudian

3425
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:14,620
term id ego right from you know like the id and the ego and this other stuff

3426
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:18,940
that nonsense they talk about right but this is the Greek word idio meaning

3427
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:23,460
self the same self like the word idiot means someone who is just into their

3428
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:27,300
self-concern like for example a prerequisite to being greedy as you must

3429
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:32,020
be an idiot in other words if you're in just your own you're only concerned

3430
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:39,040
about yourself that leads to greed we're not using these words we like for

3431
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:46,860
example the word moron means infantile that's all it means it's a Greek word

3432
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:52,440
morose or moron meaning morose meaning infant it's all see with a bit the

3433
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,140
interesting thing about Scripture is that everyone has the same intelligence

3434
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:05,500
the way how we perceive and act in Scripture is discerned by discernment it

3435
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:09,220
says people have eyes yet they don't see and they have ears and they don't hear

3436
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:13,160
it doesn't say anywhere in Scripture that one man is more intelligent than

3437
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:17,960
another anywhere we all have the same intelligence it's that our perception

3438
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:26,270
varies in great degree from blind all the way to full open eyes and open ears

3439
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:30,830
and then you have wisdom which is discernment right that's why there is a

3440
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:34,370
saying that you know a fool learns from his own mistakes and a wise man learns

3441
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:38,490
from other people's mistakes well if that wise man didn't see the other

3442
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:41,450
people's mistakes how would he learn anything so it's based on discernment

3443
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:47,270
eyes and ears again right right so there's we all have the same intelligence

3444
02:08:48,030 --> 02:08:52,350
so that IQ quotient stuff intelligence quotient that's ridiculous why would

3445
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:56,310
you let someone tell you how intelligent you are when scripturally the

3446
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:02,190
instruction manual says we all have the same intelligence it's discernment right

3447
02:09:02,190 --> 02:09:09,070
that we don't have and that's the purpose of this call I want to somehow

3448
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:15,430
maybe try to convey or impart something that will increase someone's power of

3449
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:20,690
discernment well again how are these words being used and we know all of the

3450
02:09:20,690 --> 02:09:24,410
books have been manipulated so don't bother with these dictionaries go get

3451
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:28,970
yourself an etymology dictionary etymology tells you the root meaning of

3452
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:36,250
the word how are they going to mess with that you know yeah how are they

3453
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:39,670
going to mess you know you can change the meaning of the word of person or

3454
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:43,270
this or that but yeah go look up where that word came from you're going to start

3455
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:49,790
messing with that I don't think so that's a big liability so we need to you

3456
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:53,090
know we have all these dictionaries but they're really you know why does blacks

3457
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:59,630
law have to keep changing why you know get an etymology figure out what the

3458
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:05,310
word really meant I think I explained coincidence earlier it means to coincide

3459
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:14,150
you see so you know like a real easy one is kid kid is a goat children are the

3460
02:10:14,150 --> 02:10:22,620
offspring of men and women period yeah would you like to take another question

3461
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:28,560
yeah sure is that it for you Daniel Ray or did you want to ask anything else

3462
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:44,410
that's fine thank you okay SB3 go ahead SB3 you must have your mute button on

3463
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:51,600
or something I am muted you from this end they look like you were trying to say

3464
02:10:51,600 --> 02:11:14,780
something here I hear clicking say something SB3 SB3 1 2 3 did you want to

3465
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:26,990
ask a question do you have a mute button on your phone maybe looks like you're

3466
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:45,050
trying to talk I hear y'all sporadically say something yeah you're

3467
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:49,950
unmuted on this end so I don't know something wrong with your phone maybe

3468
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:59,000
looks like you're trying to talk from this from here say something talk say

3469
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:08,160
testing 1 2 3 okay don't then we lost it's not work well now they're there

3470
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:12,520
that's just and they're unmuted but I know they're having a problem with their

3471
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:20,720
phone and maybe their mic I don't know how they're on but all right we have a

3472
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:39,360
couple more questions Joanna go ahead Joanna oh wonderful okay thank you so

3473
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:44,940
much what an idiot you know we get more stupid people on here it's like they

3474
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:56,440
just can't stand it they can't stand it okay Charles Slackus yes go ahead yes I

3475
02:12:56,440 --> 02:13:04,080
was wondering how you spell that word of that dictionary oh etymology yeah yeah

3476
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:14,840
that's just a term that means root of words it would be e-t-y-m-o-l-o-g-y okay

3477
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:25,000
one more question what would be the proper Bible to study would it be the

3478
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,300
King James or the earlier version that's a great question and I was waiting

3479
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:34,460
for someone to ask that you want the short of it or the long of it

3480
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:44,220
both well the best source right you always want to go to the source that is

3481
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:49,760
preserved is the Hebrew and the Greek now I'm not suggesting the Israelites

3482
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:57,960
spoke Hebrew or they spoke Greek it's just the father decided to preserve it

3483
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:05,060
to our it all the way to our day in Hebrew and Greek almost unchanged now

3484
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:10,280
when you get yourself a King James version it's a version well not a

3485
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:15,220
translation it's not interpretation see an interpretation or translator or

3486
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:19,740
interpreter has to be precise when you're the Japanese Prime Minister you

3487
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:23,240
go to the UN you bring yourself an interpreter or translator whatever you

3488
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:28,540
say he better say it to the T now the someone given the version of the story

3489
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:39,760
may not be so so accurate but the wonderful thing about Scripture is that

3490
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:48,380
it has an effect on mind that if the reader has power of discernment the

3491
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:53,200
information that you're reading even out of the King James or an NIV or

3492
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:58,140
something that's been really kind of messed with you'll be able to correct it

3493
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:02,140
with your own power of discernment just like a digital information you know

3494
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:06,100
transferred over a computer line it's all zeros and ones but when the

3495
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:10,500
computer sometimes gets a corrupted signal it says I've got a syntax error

3496
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:15,580
here because this doesn't make any sense you got to figure out what the problem

3497
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:23,080
is so when you read in the King James for example my name is the Lord you've

3498
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:27,740
got to say I've heard of that word Lord before and I know that it's an English

3499
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:31,460
title of nobility and if I look it up there's about 400 of them in England

3500
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:36,680
which one is it can't be right this is a syntax error because Lord is not a name

3501
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:44,690
because these Lords in England got names like Lord Vicar Rothschild or Lord you

3502
02:15:44,690 --> 02:15:50,750
know Lord Michael Helmsley right right so and Lord cannot be a name it's

3503
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:57,530
actually a title of nobility syntax error okay defrag time go back to the

3504
02:15:57,530 --> 02:16:01,970
original language of preservation what do they got in there so then if you're

3505
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:06,490
reading in the Old Testament you're going to go into a Hebrew and if you

3506
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:11,010
don't read or comprehend it you get an interlinear where it's got the Hebrew and

3507
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:18,130
the English right under it and you will see that it doesn't say Lord at all and

3508
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:27,490
there's a lot of errors in the in the King James because in the old in the Old

3509
02:16:27,490 --> 02:16:32,969
Testament you'll see it'll say well it was the eighth day of the fifth month in

3510
02:16:32,969 --> 02:16:37,230
this year then you get to the New Testament they're talking about you

3511
02:16:37,230 --> 02:16:42,389
know Easter Sunday well wait a second there Sunday was only invented 500 years

3512
02:16:42,389 --> 02:16:49,049
ago it can't be accurate because they weren't reckoning Sundays 2,000 years

3513
02:16:49,049 --> 02:16:55,459
ago so you're going to need power of discernment see in the digital world they

3514
02:16:55,459 --> 02:17:01,120
call that sampling rate when you send a digital signal there's some little a

3515
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,799
board or another program that's always looking at the information coming in and

3516
02:17:05,799 --> 02:17:09,459
sampling it and saying okay this is good this is good oh this is corrupt right

3517
02:17:09,459 --> 02:17:14,120
here it's going to mess up your syntax and you get a little syntax error on

3518
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:19,219
your screen you know so if you've got the power of discernment and you're a

3519
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:25,700
word technologist you know what I mean you'll be able to pick them up I see I

3520
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:31,000
consider myself to be a word technician so unfortunately if you're not a word

3521
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,860
technician my best suggestion would be to get yourself an interlinear which has

3522
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:43,740
got the languages of preservation in the English right below it now every full

3523
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:49,740
unabridged Bible in the introduction will explain everything I just explained

3524
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:55,760
to you an unabridged version of most Bibles that I've seen are anywhere

3525
02:17:55,760 --> 02:18:02,219
between 7 to 40 pages long and they say well we just changed you know the name

3526
02:18:02,219 --> 02:18:07,040
to Lord because if we didn't nobody would buy this book you know like they

3527
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:12,000
say for publishing reasons and obviously you know it'll tell you the days

3528
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:18,070
mentioned here didn't exist but we did it for publishing reasons so they'll

3529
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:24,309
preface this stuff but unfortunately without the power of discernment and

3530
02:18:24,309 --> 02:18:30,610
knowledge of what existed and what didn't exist back then you're you're

3531
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:33,370
not going to do well unless you're talking to someone like me and I'm not

3532
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:38,370
really looking to tutor anyone or have a Bible study or anything like that but

3533
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:44,010
there's plenty information and help online there's a program called eSword

3534
02:18:44,809 --> 02:18:48,530
and it's King James Version but if you hold your mouse over each English word

3535
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:53,230
it'll give you the definition and the original word that was it was preserved

3536
02:18:53,230 --> 02:19:01,049
in now when I say Hebrew the the Israelites there I don't see much

3537
02:19:01,049 --> 02:19:07,930
evidence of them being Hebrews or speaking Hebrew they spoke Edenic the

3538
02:19:08,629 --> 02:19:12,790
people around them the Canaanites the Babylonians the Cushites everybody

3539
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:19,790
around them were Kate were spoke Hebrew and that's why when you're reading the

3540
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:24,770
off he says because you didn't drive the Canaanites out of your land they're

3541
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:35,959
going to be a stumbling block to you and your children Wow wow yeah so now

3542
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:39,840
you're stuck with you you're we're basically operating in the Canaanite

3543
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:46,260
system you might have heard that before right yeah and but the father says I'll

3544
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:49,920
give you what you did what you need and what you deserve and give you what you

3545
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:57,300
deserve based on how well how well you find out what I want you to do and do it

3546
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:02,440
I've been speaking to people lately about miracles and healings and they said

3547
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:10,180
I found all miracles and all healings require had one basic requirement and if

3548
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:13,700
you don't meet that basic requirement you ain't gonna get them and that basic

3549
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:20,540
requirement is you have to be an obedient servant and every miracle every

3550
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:28,080
healing what they all had in common was an obedient servant now when you're a

3551
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,940
servant some you know it's let's say you you're living with someone as a roommate

3552
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:38,180
and he tells you hey go do my laundry well thank your servant get up and do it

3553
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:42,820
yourself but if you're living with someone and you say I am your servant he

3554
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:47,420
tells you get up and do my laundry yes I will I may not do it perfectly but I'll

3555
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:51,820
try to I might get scolded here or there you know I threw the red sock in with

3556
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:57,340
the white shirts messed everything up but I try most people aren't even trying

3557
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:05,400
you know if you look at all the miracles that the Christ performed with a water

3558
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:12,360
and a wine those were obedient servants they ran out of wine and his mom his

3559
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:17,600
mother said Miriam she wasn't married Miriam she said yeah he'll he'll make it

3560
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:22,240
into wine and he said well you want me to show everybody who I am okay and she

3561
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:31,080
says do exactly as he tells you to and they did exactly what they told him what

3562
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:35,660
he told him to do and that water didn't turn into wine until the host put it

3563
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:43,820
right up to his mouth to read it very carefully so there's procedure involved

3564
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:53,400
in Scripture if you look at all the prophets there were obedient servants so

3565
02:21:53,400 --> 02:22:04,540
your King James Version is fine if you if you've got powers of discernment how

3566
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:12,540
about the Geneva Bible was that a better translation Bible than the King

3567
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:19,660
James no not much better very similar okay that's what I need but we're kind of

3568
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:25,240
stuck we're living in a Canaanite society if you know what I mean right

3569
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:32,940
and and yeah so it's a little more difficult like for example okay let's say

3570
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:37,620
you got a you let's say you know we're used to certain things that are easy to

3571
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:42,060
get like gasoline and batteries and things like that a real basic but if you

3572
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:45,200
went out and lived in the bush in a village and you needed some diesel

3573
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,040
batteries they'd laugh at you right right like where do you get those well

3574
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:54,460
you see that's about 500 miles from here you know getting your seaplane and take

3575
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:58,900
off and go get some batteries so these simple things that we take for granted

3576
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:04,700
like we open a book to get information we're in the wilderness if you're in the

3577
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:08,580
wilderness and you're out of batteries well you know by time you get those

3578
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:11,620
batteries ain't going to be in the wilderness anymore might as well stay put

3579
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:18,500
so in other words it's it's things that we consider to be easy tasks in our

3580
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:22,040
lives like we should be able to open a book or get a program and have

3581
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:26,460
information accurately conveyed to us we're not living in that time right now

3582
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:31,480
unfortunately there's a lot of work see in scripture the father says he wants us

3583
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:36,320
to be workman's in it a workman in the scripture he didn't mean like a

3584
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:39,600
government job where you see one guy digging and eight people standing around

3585
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:45,520
watching are you done yet he meant that you know everyone's got to work in it

3586
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:49,360
and get a piece and share like potluck what'd you get let me see what you

3587
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:59,480
learned so it's a constant it's it's but it is finite the message is itself is

3588
02:23:59,480 --> 02:24:05,460
finite because you can hold it in your hand from 400 to 900 pages depending on

3589
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:09,960
the size of the font but the information contained therein is not finite it's

3590
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:16,170
beyond you could study one verse out of the Bible for 50 years and just barely

3591
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:22,430
get it because it's so multi-dimensional and a good place to start would be

3592
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:32,630
reading Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 that's the first chapter that's been messed

3593
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:40,880
with heavily and if it takes you more than a month to get past that less than

3594
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:49,030
a month to get past that first verse you missed the point well thank you for the

3595
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:57,130
information you're welcome okay that looks like we don't have any more

3596
02:24:57,130 --> 02:25:05,070
questions so if you want to go ahead and get into something well it's intense for

3597
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:12,550
me because it's important to me and I can get into something that's very

3598
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:16,630
specific if people are watching the news something that'll affect them

3599
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:25,570
watching the let's say when when you do watch the news for example or get your

3600
02:25:25,570 --> 02:25:30,610
news online you will notice that in the past 10 years actually over 13 years now

3601
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:36,850
something in the Middle East has been in the news every day consistently yeah

3602
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:44,410
okay and that's for a reason now lately and I've been saying this since so 405

3603
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:50,750
you've been seeing a lot of this nation-state called Israel in the news

3604
02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:57,190
almost every day as well online or maybe not as much as just the Middle East as

3605
02:25:57,190 --> 02:26:03,410
as a whole in general but lately Israel has been focused because of the let's

3606
02:26:03,410 --> 02:26:09,710
say unrighteousness or unfavorable things or unfavorable way that they've

3607
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:16,010
been portrayed there's a lot of specifics in scripture on why they are

3608
02:26:16,010 --> 02:26:20,090
that way right now and how it is temporary and how it's all going to

3609
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:24,950
change very very specifically now if the scripture doesn't say well this will

3610
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:33,010
happen at 420 on May 15 2018 because there's no such thing as May or 2018 or

3611
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:38,810
420 p.m. in scripture time isn't reckoned that way at all so the way it's reckoned

3612
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:46,370
is by using landmarks and again one reason I don't speak on Israel and all

3613
02:26:46,370 --> 02:26:53,150
these other nations and peoples and basically the Bible at all in public

3614
02:26:53,150 --> 02:26:58,230
anymore is because everyone thinks it has to be the people here and it's not

3615
02:26:59,670 --> 02:27:06,910
but there are some very very specifics in scripture that will that do tell you

3616
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:14,170
with great specificity what to expect and the reason Israel is mentioned over

3617
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:17,450
and over from the Old Testament all the way to Jerusalem in the New Testament

3618
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:21,930
is for another as for a very specific reason also see people don't want to

3619
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:26,490
identify with that because they say well I'm not an Israelite I'm not Jewish you

3620
02:27:26,490 --> 02:27:30,890
know see there's nothing Jewish in the Bible there's no religion in the Bible

3621
02:27:30,890 --> 02:27:34,390
there's no Christian in the Bible there's no Muslim in the Bible the Bible

3622
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:42,600
deals with hereditary bloodlines period there's no issue the word Jewish was

3623
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:48,640
invented around 1500 it means these people do Jehovah's Wish Jehovah's Wish

3624
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:53,760
Jewish real short has nothing to do with anything in scripture they they do

3625
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:59,420
translate the word Jewish the word Judean which is one of the families one

3626
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:04,220
of the lines in Israel as Jewish it's not accurate you'll see it as a Judean

3627
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:13,760
but to get to the point if you read Isaiah chapter 1 verse 26 that's Isaiah

3628
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:19,720
chapter 1 verse 26 it's a chapter that gives you a ton of information in just a

3629
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:26,820
few words if you have scriptural discernment that's about a month's worth

3630
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:33,760
of study and I can distill it down like this in Isaiah chapter 1 verse 26 he

3631
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:41,040
says when I return you into the land which he did in 1948 I will restore to

3632
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:49,200
you your former judges your judges of old and then you will be known as

3633
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:53,940
faithful and righteous people there if a city but it can mean people as well

3634
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:59,520
because in order to have a city people so he says when I return you back into

3635
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:03,840
the land I will restore to you your former judges and then you will be known

3636
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:10,260
as those faithful faithful and righteous city so let's look at that real closely

3637
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:17,940
well after they left Egypt after machinations in the book of Joshua and

3638
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:24,240
all that they get into the land and they claim the land they the creator

3639
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:28,340
dispossesses the inhabitants allows them to win all the battles and they settle

3640
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:37,660
in the twelve tribes and they're ruled by judges as in the book of Judges now

3641
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:41,220
he said he would when he returns them back to the land he's going to return to

3642
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:46,640
them their former judges the judges of old he repeats it twice well right now

3643
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:51,220
modern-day Israel is being ruled by prime ministers a minister is a judge

3644
02:29:51,840 --> 02:30:02,920
they're ruled by head judges so it's a coincidence and and it says that and

3645
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:11,120
then you will be known as that righteous and faithful people or city so

3646
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,960
if it means what it says it says what it means are they going to be known as a

3647
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:19,000
righteous or faithful people during the reign of prime ministers or judges in

3648
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:25,840
modern time nope because you're going to have your reign of judges or ministers

3649
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:30,840
prime ministers and then you will be known as righteous so when they no

3650
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:35,720
longer have prime ministers they're going to be viewed as okay now they got their

3651
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:38,480
act together and they stopped pissing off the rest of the world and everyone

3652
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:47,670
around them well when is that going to happen well the book of Isaiah he tells

3653
02:30:47,670 --> 02:30:51,210
you I don't speak in secret I just tell you what's going to happen it happens

3654
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:58,070
and it happens again so there's a repeat cycle there in prophecy so if you look

3655
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:04,940
at the ancient judges of ancient Israel there were 16 of them if you count

3656
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:10,600
Joshua the one that battled to get them in there you'd be 17 BC after they

3657
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:15,440
settled in there were 16 well if you look at the book of judges in the

3658
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:21,520
scriptures you'll see one two three four judges well up to the fourth judge

3659
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:29,400
they're all men but the fourth judge in ancient Israel is Deborah a woman and

3660
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:36,440
the only judge of ancient Israel and after that there were 12 more and then

3661
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:41,020
there was a revolution or civil war whatever you want to view it as or a

3662
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:44,680
change of government and they put Saul and they put Saul in as a king their

3663
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:49,920
first king and then it was David and Solomon and so on and so forth if you

3664
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:55,080
look at modern-day Israel with their modern-day judges or prime ministers

3665
02:31:55,080 --> 02:32:01,940
you look at Ben-Gurion okay you got one two three four Oh fourth one gold in my

3666
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:12,030
air grandma Moses she's a woman also Oh coincidence it's repeating so how many

3667
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:17,430
prime ministers is Israel going to have in modern day if they had 16 judges in

3668
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:21,090
ancient times and it's repeating they're going to have 16 prime ministers

3669
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:30,050
right now Netanyahu is number 12 so you've got four more prime ministers

3670
02:32:30,050 --> 02:32:34,770
before Israel flips flip-flops into another style of government and they

3671
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:39,390
kind of flip-flop throughout throughout the entire world and they kind of leave

3672
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:47,050
what's called the Zionist movement in the way that it's been done for the past

3673
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:52,110
hundred some odd years you're not going to see them involved in as lawyers and

3674
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:56,570
bankers and you know controlling interests and things like that all over

3675
02:32:56,570 --> 02:33:04,580
the world they're going to start focusing on on that part of the world so

3676
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:11,060
it's very very accurate in terms of timing as a matter of fact this past

3677
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:16,220
election with Netanyahu if you looked at it from a world news perspective TV

3678
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:23,520
Livni a woman was was 90% in the polls against him and everyone's saying well

3679
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:26,440
it looks like your prophetic thing may not work I said no it's going to work

3680
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:30,760
you'll watch like last few days you know they'll put Netanyahu in she's going to lose

3681
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:35,960
because there's only going to be one woman prime minister well there you go

3682
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:40,840
well what are you psychic no I'm not psychic not at all let's read the manual

3683
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:47,360
tell them what you told me about us not being a nation how we can't have a

3684
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:52,420
nation how it's not possible that we have a nation oh yeah this country here

3685
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:56,500
it's very difficult to call it a nation you see in order to be a nation all the

3686
02:33:56,500 --> 02:34:02,240
people have to be related in some capacity see Italy is a nation Greece is

3687
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:07,580
a nation Spain is a nation Portugal is a nation China is a nation Russia is a

3688
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:12,540
nation but America it's very difficult to call it a nation the reason why is

3689
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:17,320
because if you go to Italy Spain Portugal or Russia or China 90% of the

3690
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:21,240
people are going to meet guess what our Italian Spanish or Chinese they're all

3691
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:27,380
related they could trace their roots back you know hundreds if not maybe a

3692
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:33,180
thousand or so years bloodline thing yeah but here I mean I've got you know

3693
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:36,320
neighbors German the guy across the street you know he's from Africa the guy

3694
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:40,940
over there is Chinese what kind of nation is this I don't know they tell

3695
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:46,260
you it's a melting pot it's so it's a frontier and if you read scripture

3696
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:50,760
everyone's going to be returned to their nations the only nations here it's right

3697
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:54,760
in front of our faces what are the Native Americans on reservations called

3698
02:34:54,760 --> 02:35:01,520
the Navajo what Indians no they're called Navajo Nation the Cherokee Nation right

3699
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:06,100
oh yeah the Iroquois Nation you notice the only nation or only time the

3700
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:09,980
legitimately use the word nation or outwardly is with the Native American

3701
02:35:09,980 --> 02:35:19,940
people right right yeah I'm part of the Cherokee Nation why because if you see

3702
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:27,160
where they put us all we're all related right so it has to do with bloodline

3703
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:34,600
what you believe in is not you if you say so what do we have here what do we

3704
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:39,340
have here what do we have here in the United States of America if it's not a

3705
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:46,040
nation what is it you told me the other day oh it's an outpost it's a gathering

3706
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:51,660
it's a frontier it's an outpost of all the other places see this is the last

3707
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:55,940
what we have here I don't remember what did I say other than an outpost I can't

3708
02:35:55,940 --> 02:36:00,080
see what we have here well what what what they're trying to do is make it a

3709
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:03,780
nation by all of us going under the same father figure that's what the word

3710
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:08,480
patriot means you all say you the word patriot actually means you all share the

3711
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:14,280
same father the Patras you have an allegiance to the same father and there's

3712
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:19,140
they made George Washington our father you see that's why they call it the

3713
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:24,800
founding fathers not my I know who my father is I know who my earthly father I

3714
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,500
know who my heavenly father is I don't know who these guys is a bunch of dead

3715
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:37,120
guys by the way dead people don't make laws only the living make laws right if

3716
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:41,180
you read the scripture he says I am the living one the Almighty I am living he

3717
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:46,520
says that many times right that's why today the the current living peak men

3718
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:49,660
and women in the legislature say well we make the laws that Constitution thing

3719
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:54,400
that's just a piece of paper they're actually correct but the here's the thing

3720
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:58,040
with powers of discernment what do they make they're passing bills what's a bill

3721
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:02,280
you go to the restaurant and you have a get a service deck that's called a bill

3722
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:04,940
right where you go to the cleaners they give you a bill when you pick up your

3723
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:10,500
laundry right so they're doing you see it's a bill do you want to pay this bill

3724
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:21,200
first time most of the time it's a bill we did not order well you kind of did

3725
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:24,860
because you're George why you you're you know you've founding fathers right you

3726
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:27,880
believe in the founding yeah okay well you're related here you go

3727
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:36,600
not all of us it's wild isn't it like look in the Constitution it says we the

3728
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:41,160
people of the United States blah blah blah blah blah and to establish justice

3729
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:47,240
I read that I was like what everybody left Europe to get away from justice and

3730
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:51,900
these guys are establishing it here this doesn't look too good yeah but explain

3731
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:59,860
what justice is justice is a statue of a woman carrying scales she's not blind

3732
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:06,220
but she's blindfolded and at her feet is a snake and under and under one of her

3733
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:12,120
feet she's got her foot stepping on a book and if you want a more accurate

3734
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:20,920
description of this go online or research DK D I K E it's not dyke it's

3735
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:26,240
DK of the pronunciation D I K E but it sounds like it's spelled like dyke and

3736
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:34,800
that is a Greek goddess and she was the basically kind of she interceded

3737
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:39,320
between Hermes and Zeus to make sure that everybody was observing Zeus's

3738
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:45,060
commands you see it's a goddess religion if you read scripture it talks a lot

3739
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:52,340
about this goddess religion see justice is a goddess religion justicia is the

3740
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:59,920
Latin aspect of it a lot of the Christian popes were named Justinian because they

3741
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:04,860
served justice there were pagans that served this Babylonian goddess or Greek

3742
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:10,340
goddess which actually originated in Babylon different form that's why you're

3743
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:15,620
brought to justice you see and you serve justice or you there's a miscarriage of

3744
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:23,800
justice when she has a miscarriage it's really bad Wow that's profound yeah this

3745
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:27,700
is a religion that's why if you read a lot of comments like when they talk about

3746
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:32,280
the Patriot movement these guys are bad they're they're radical or whatever it

3747
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:37,180
says they don't they tell people not to believe in government oh we have to

3748
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:43,320
believe Oh religion oh I see you've got to believe in it right it's very it's all

3749
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:50,440
religious but the thing is again my stance is the Creator puts all of these

3750
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:55,260
things in place basically everything you see in place right now around us is

3751
02:39:55,260 --> 02:40:01,890
there to accommodate us we don't want to steward the land the way he instructed

3752
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:06,130
us to because well most people say oh that's the old law that's done away with

3753
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:10,970
and you know those things we don't we don't believe in those things you know

3754
02:40:10,970 --> 02:40:15,850
he says every seventh year you were to let your fields go fallow don't plant

3755
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:19,230
and you will eat what comes up naturally and I've tried that before and I get

3756
02:40:19,230 --> 02:40:23,750
actually more food when we do that you get a bumper crop the year before

3757
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:28,890
actually the Israelites were dispossessed from the land because they didn't do that

3758
02:40:28,890 --> 02:40:34,510
and other things and because they sacrificed their children we went

3759
02:40:34,510 --> 02:40:42,630
through that already on the call what what modern ritual is so everything is

3760
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:46,650
the way it is because it's supposed to be this way because we're the people are

3761
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:50,630
making enemies in the spiritual world and the spiritual world controls the

3762
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:55,970
physical world in other words the unseen world controls the seen world even these

3763
02:40:55,970 --> 02:41:01,750
scientists you know they'll show you that you know you know look at this

3764
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:04,690
thing under a microscope Wow is that what it looks like you know let's go

3765
02:41:04,690 --> 02:41:09,810
even deeper and deeper and deeper but again I started the call I try to bring

3766
02:41:09,810 --> 02:41:16,430
up that man has been focused and man has been led to focus on the death side of

3767
02:41:16,430 --> 02:41:21,650
the natural world not the living side all of the technology all of the science

3768
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:25,950
all of your medicine all of your whatever you look at cross broad

3769
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:35,010
spectrum is focused on the death cycle not the life cycle you know look at

3770
02:41:35,010 --> 02:41:39,190
your automobiles you know an automobile consumes more air in four hours than you

3771
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:43,270
do in a week and it gives off toxic chemicals your cell phones fry your

3772
02:41:43,270 --> 02:41:46,650
brain I mean you want to keep going I mean have you ever seen a prescription

3773
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:50,310
drug that has not been taken off the market because it was dangerous which

3774
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:53,130
prescription drug do you see on the market today that you don't think is

3775
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:57,170
going to be taken off the market five years because it's dangerous all of them

3776
02:41:59,630 --> 02:42:07,460
what do you think is going on we're focusing on the death cycle yeah toxic

3777
02:42:07,460 --> 02:42:14,190
chemicals in the soil is fertilizer that the plants will love that oh you got

3778
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:17,430
bugs in the water because you know the water is you're moving it through

3779
02:42:17,430 --> 02:42:22,110
straight pipes the water likes to vortex and move in you know swirl around but

3780
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:26,930
no we'll force it through straight pipes and when the when the pathogens build up

3781
02:42:26,930 --> 02:42:31,310
we'll just put chlorine gas in there you know that'll make it better

3782
02:42:32,170 --> 02:42:39,070
yeah fluoride yeah but this whole thing see people lack the discernment so I

3783
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:45,970
mean imagine you know we're operating on a very low level I think that's part of

3784
02:42:45,970 --> 02:42:51,130
the being dumbed down right yeah but the way you're dumbed down is by your

3785
02:42:51,130 --> 02:42:54,810
discernment being taken away or you're you're being taught that if you do try

3786
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:59,350
to discern you're weird or you know again the reason why they put this guy

3787
02:42:59,350 --> 02:43:03,590
nailed to a cross up there is because you know if you do if you try to do

3788
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:08,330
what he tells you to do that's how are you going to end up right that's

3789
02:43:08,330 --> 02:43:14,430
psychological right but all of this again is meant to see there's a time

3790
02:43:14,430 --> 02:43:18,530
period man we've been here we're going on the seventh day seven days is not a

3791
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:24,690
long time but for us it's you know six thousand plus years now creation didn't

3792
02:43:24,690 --> 02:43:28,970
happen six thousand years ago that's ridiculous we're talking about there's a

3793
02:43:28,970 --> 02:43:35,290
new being on the block here his name is Adam I'm talking about not talking

3794
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:38,950
about when the earth was made and all the other stuff that's a way before that if

3795
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:43,510
you have the discernment to read scripture you'll see that for example

3796
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:48,910
when you read in Genesis chapter 1 you know you have creation and then the

3797
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:53,530
earth was you know redone and then you have the first day something was made he

3798
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:57,810
said it was good he said well he made something he said it was good the first

3799
02:43:57,810 --> 02:44:02,830
day then he makes another thing he says okay it was good and it was the second

3800
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:07,730
day and so on and so forth all the way to the sixth day well then you get to

3801
02:44:07,730 --> 02:44:12,270
chapter 2 and you know you see well well back again in chapter 1 man is made on

3802
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:15,990
the sixth day and the plants and things are made on the fifth and so on for but

3803
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:20,370
when you go to chapter 2 he's ready to make man and there are no plants yet you

3804
02:44:20,370 --> 02:44:23,750
know he says he has to bring water so the plants will grow you know there's no

3805
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:26,530
man yet you know I mean there's no plants yet even though he's ready to make

3806
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:32,090
man so what's going on it seems like things are out of order well if you

3807
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:37,430
look at the style that Genesis chapter 1 is written in that is an affidavit of

3808
02:44:37,430 --> 02:44:41,230
evidence to be entered into a court case in chapter 2 is where the creation

3809
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:48,470
really starts well chapter 1 is evidence to be entered into a court case what

3810
02:44:48,470 --> 02:44:54,110
where's the court case where's the trial yeah well book of Revelation the entire

3811
02:44:54,110 --> 02:45:05,980
book is basically a trial and it's unrebutted can't rebut it can anyone

3812
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:13,300
rebut that you created the earth prove it this whole existence is a battle over

3813
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:21,980
who's going to rule over this blue marble in space a man can do it legally I

3814
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:26,640
mean legally I mean scripturally legal legally if he gets everyone on the

3815
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:33,240
planet all men and women and children have to worship him as the creator has

3816
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:38,060
to be anonymous unanimous if you have one or two or three or four people that

3817
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:43,800
refuse to worship him as the creator he doesn't get the prize and that's why

3818
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:47,540
when you read in Scripture there are two witnesses against him that's why when you

3819
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:50,340
read in the book of Daniel Nebuchadnezzar it said he ruled the

3820
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:57,100
entire world when it says that it means it but these three guys said no we're not

3821
02:45:57,100 --> 02:46:01,360
going to bow down to your idol and we worship the Most High and he has the

3822
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:05,500
power of saving us from your furnace and if he decides not to save us that's

3823
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:10,800
fine too but we're not going to bow down so they throw these three guys in the

3824
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:18,000
furnace and they had to be saved because it wasn't time to give someone dominion

3825
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:24,080
over the earth and they came out and Nebuchadnezzar said wow okay who's this

3826
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:30,580
guy you said well you got it man he is the Most High I better watch myself so

3827
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:33,700
this time is coming again you're going to have a character coming on the scene

3828
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:39,060
that's going to usurp the consciousness this is a fight and a battle for your

3829
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:42,940
consciousness and the people on this planet have been set up like this for

3830
02:46:42,940 --> 02:46:49,900
the past 6,000 years for six days however you want to look at it six days

3831
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:55,880
not a very long time and one thing I want to say about time is you can you

3832
02:46:55,880 --> 02:47:02,500
know how the saying is it be here now yeah you're always here in the now but

3833
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:07,980
you can never observe the now you can only observe the past or the future and

3834
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:13,120
the only way you can observe the future is if someone has a vantage point from

3835
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:17,340
the future that convey information back to you and the only way you can observe

3836
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:22,600
the past is if you have a record of history the reason why you cannot observe

3837
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:26,480
the now is well let's do a simple experiment okay let's observe this

3838
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:29,960
second oh it's gone oh okay did anybody catch it no I can't see it oh we were in

3839
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:35,340
another second right now here it goes oh you see it's called entropy okay but

3840
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:39,040
let's look into the future I got this mason jar over here for capturing time

3841
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,340
you're ready you ready Angela I got it open we're going to capture this second

3842
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:45,660
coming you ready three two one I got it in the jar okay oh it's gone oh I didn't

3843
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:49,540
quite get it let's get the next one you see how you cannot observe the now

3844
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:56,830
you're always observing the past you see I miss this might sound a theory on some

3845
02:47:56,830 --> 02:48:01,970
people say well whatever you know but think about it on your own time so

3846
02:48:01,970 --> 02:48:08,390
here's the kicker man man's history is about the past but the creators history

3847
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:12,470
is about the future when the creator writes when the father writes history he

3848
02:48:12,470 --> 02:48:19,620
writes about the future because he has a different vantage point like for

3849
02:48:19,620 --> 02:48:23,880
example the Messiah said the first will be last and the last will be first he

3850
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:31,160
keeps saying that he gives parables about it and he said I am the alpha and the

3851
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:36,440
Omega or the olive from the top the first and the last well if you look in

3852
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:40,980
Genesis chapter 1 it says basically you know in the beginning God created the

3853
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:47,860
heavens and the earth no it doesn't I mean yes it does but they left out a

3854
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:52,460
very important part it actually says in the beginning all of him are the mighty

3855
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:56,320
ones I don't like to use the word God but let's say God in this case for ease

3856
02:48:57,340 --> 02:49:02,740
communication it says in the beginning God created the alpha and the Omega the

3857
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:07,900
first and the last right and then he created the heavens in the earth so

3858
02:49:07,900 --> 02:49:12,900
that's why in the book of John he says in the beginning there was the word and

3859
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:17,340
the word was with God and God was the word well so he's standing there in

3860
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:21,360
front of the Pharisees saying yeah this guy this convicted felon you guys just

3861
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:24,780
killed by the way yeah okay let me show you where he really is you see Genesis

3862
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:29,080
right here for Moses see him right here oh see the elephant on the Alpha Omega

3863
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:32,620
right there that's him that's that's how you guys that's how you guys just killed

3864
02:49:32,620 --> 02:49:40,520
could you imagine what they wanted to do to John when he showed him that I wonder

3865
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:54,000
he was on the lamb pretty serious stuff not religion so that's what Genesis

3866
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,400
chapter 1 also Genesis chapter 1 each letter that's in there actually

3867
02:49:57,400 --> 02:50:03,720
represents something and it goes on there 28 letters well book of Revelations

3868
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:13,800
got four seven-year periods what's four times seven 28 right right okay so if

3869
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:19,260
the first is last and last is first and the Creator says in the book of Isaiah I

3870
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:24,740
have declared the end from the beginning now everything in Scripture is a

3871
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:31,120
declaration which book almost wholesale or holy talks about the end book of

3872
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:34,980
Revelation so he tells you okay the last will be first the first it would be

3873
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:43,800
last so the book Revelation is the first book of the Bible but where's your proof

3874
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:50,000
like that I am the word right book of Revelation starts with the letter a

3875
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:54,900
apocalypses word apocalypse by the way that they're using in the context

3876
02:50:54,900 --> 02:51:02,040
they're using this means to reveal oh really yeah and if you read in the

3877
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:07,560
prophet he says well the Messiah gave us the law and everything well if you

3878
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:11,560
read the book of Revelation he says this was written by the father given to the

3879
02:51:11,560 --> 02:51:18,160
son whoa whoa if all scriptures written by the Messiah this one's written by

3880
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:21,920
the father to give to the son this is outside of the other one something

3881
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:27,500
different about this one and the reason the reason people don't understand the

3882
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:32,700
book of Revelation not even by a long shot is because the next verse says well

3883
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:37,060
it says written by the father to give to the son to give to his servants

3884
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:41,340
remember the analogy I gave before when you're living with someone as a roommate

3885
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:48,060
you're not a servant right so how are you someone's servant they tell you what

3886
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:53,940
to okay stand stand on one leg and put your hand on your head okay that's a

3887
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:57,220
servant the non-servant say no are you kidding man that's outdated stuff man

3888
02:51:57,220 --> 02:52:06,590
that law is done away with we talked about that's not for me man no okay no

3889
02:52:06,590 --> 02:52:11,710
wonder you don't understand prophecy or the book of Revelation or anything it's

3890
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:18,070
very simple obedient servant it's kind of like very simple instructions let's

3891
02:52:18,070 --> 02:52:25,470
go back to Genesis well where's Genesis Genesis second book of the Bible why we

3892
02:52:25,470 --> 02:52:30,870
said I'm the word well Genesis it's preserved first word is bed of sheep

3893
02:52:31,550 --> 02:52:36,810
that's the letter B second letter in the alphabet because by the way all the

3894
02:52:36,810 --> 02:52:42,630
alphabets go a B C D E and then they kind of fall apart you know well the

3895
02:52:42,630 --> 02:52:47,490
second word in the in the book of Genesis is but ah another B got two

3896
02:52:47,490 --> 02:52:55,810
witnesses this book in second position and then you go then you got to find out

3897
02:52:55,810 --> 02:53:00,290
which book is the third one fourth one go all the way to 49 books you got that

3898
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:04,910
kind of time on your hands you'll be real successful with it or someone can

3899
02:53:04,910 --> 02:53:13,330
tell you how to figure it out do you see where I'm coming from this is this takes

3900
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:17,470
so it's very technical and there's a lot of information involved and a lot of

3901
02:53:17,470 --> 02:53:22,870
again discernment there's no belief here I didn't you know do I did I say I

3902
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:26,470
believe in anything you know I believe this is no there's no belief there's a

3903
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:32,700
certain level of discernment that you need to follow through with you know I

3904
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:36,720
was once speaking with a rabbi and he says you know if I told the people the

3905
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:41,080
truth I'd have to get a real job I couldn't do this anymore people don't

3906
02:53:41,080 --> 02:53:45,400
want to hear this people just want to get away and come you know and just sit

3907
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:49,200
around and and you know they want to hear a couple of nice things and tell

3908
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:53,860
them you know whatever they are and go home they don't want to hear this I'm

3909
02:53:53,860 --> 02:53:56,700
like you know what you're right I better shut up people don't want to hear this

3910
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:03,860
but there will come a time in the next decade that there will people are going

3911
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:09,140
to want to hear it well people want to hear it now they're here listening I

3912
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:16,260
know I know what I'm saying is it'll be the talk of the town there'll be an

3913
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:19,800
event and they'll be we got to find somebody to explain what's going on

3914
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:22,360
because these priests and these pastors and these are these guys don't know

3915
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:27,200
what's going on they can't explain anything has anyone seen the Simpsons

3916
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:34,460
movie by the way the Simpsons they did a film where you know the Simpsons you

3917
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:38,500
know that that those cartoon characters right and there's a scene where they're

3918
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:44,980
they're in church and this the granddad gets possessed by a spirit he's rolling

3919
02:54:44,980 --> 02:54:49,060
around prophesying and no one knows what to do and Homer Simpson picks up the

3920
02:54:49,060 --> 02:54:52,680
Bible he's paging through and he's like this book doesn't have any answers you

3921
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:57,520
know he's paging through it really fast you know I thought that was very funny

3922
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:01,660
because that's what's happening everyone's looking in Scripture and

3923
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:04,640
they're like this book doesn't have any answers can't explain anything yeah

3924
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:10,400
that's a jigsaw puzzle you have to put it together and you need discernment

3925
02:55:17,340 --> 02:55:22,900
like it was written in code yeah but it's written in code and it was great

3926
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:26,720
it's hidden in plain sight but with with discernment like I spoke to the other

3927
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:31,780
fellow before like a computer you know when it's just receiving a digital

3928
02:55:31,780 --> 02:55:37,000
message how does it know it has a syntax error zero and ones I mean it's just

3929
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:41,440
zeros and ones you know syntax error what are you talking about you know so

3930
02:55:41,440 --> 02:55:46,700
we have a lot of errors in Scripture you know it's like my favorite one is I do a

3931
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:50,140
test on someone if they want to start learning because you see there's no

3932
02:55:50,140 --> 02:55:52,740
such thing as a good teacher only good students right

3933
02:55:53,320 --> 02:55:58,380
you can't teach anyone anything but if someone wants to learn they'll just

3934
02:55:58,380 --> 02:56:03,560
watch you and pick up you know if they want to learn something so every

3935
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:07,540
academic every professor anyone with a high college degree has failed this and

3936
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:12,120
I'm going to give it this is the way it's a quiz I pop on them I said there's a

3937
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:15,900
shed and it has a gable roof with a ridge on it you know it's like a shed

3938
02:56:15,900 --> 02:56:19,900
you know roof with you know the ridge on the top of both sides are equally sloped

3939
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:24,740
okay a rooster a rooster lands on the ridge and lays an egg what side of the

3940
02:56:24,740 --> 02:56:31,060
roof does the egg roll off of roosters don't legs you got it you got it you

3941
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:38,620
wouldn't that's great Angela you get a big gold star for that from my book every

3942
02:56:39,900 --> 02:56:44,920
academic I've ever spoken to engineers I'm talking about people that are like

3943
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:49,400
designing stuff in the world you don't think about bridges and you know you

3944
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:54,180
know high-level education I had one guy tell me well you really don't know you

3945
02:56:54,180 --> 02:56:59,360
know you should get a grant for that and research that project like where you

3946
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:02,860
talk you see roosters if you're addressing which side the egg rolls off

3947
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:11,700
of you missed you'd like to serve and they do yeah I have nothing to do with

3948
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:15,580
your intelligence matter of fact I found out what they call intelligent

3949
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:20,600
people are the easiest to fool you just make you write up something really

3950
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:25,720
technical and you use real fancy terms about simple things and you get them to

3951
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:31,460
claim those terms or claim those names and now they know that well because I

3952
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:41,980
kind of claimed this thing sounds really technical I know a lot yeah yeah they're

3953
02:57:41,980 --> 02:57:47,480
really people are bullies right yeah you know here's the thing it's easier to

3954
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:55,260
fool six billion people than to fool one I'll tell you why if you fool one

3955
02:57:55,260 --> 02:57:58,800
you've got five billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety

3956
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:01,760
eight thousand nine hundred ninety nine that'll say hey dude you've been fooled

3957
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:07,100
look at us we'll show you what's going on don't believe that all right they'll

3958
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:13,000
still square them away but if you fool the six billion or most of them over a

3959
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:16,660
long period of time if you get one or two that come out and kind of see what's

3960
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:19,660
going on you got all this majority that's going to come out and say we see

3961
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:23,280
those wackos right there let's put him in a room with some padding or something

3962
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:29,460
or drug him up so he shuts up or whatever you know he's crazy so you've

3963
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:35,780
got it you've got it always go after the the whole group and the only power that

3964
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:40,660
can do that is the spiritual world only the spiritual world can do that and all

3965
02:58:40,660 --> 02:58:46,900
men in power positions or leadership positions are actually being guided by

3966
02:58:46,900 --> 02:58:52,980
the spiritual world and if you read about the spiritual world there was great

3967
02:58:52,980 --> 02:58:59,640
violence there a long time ago 2,000 years ago and a third of these beings

3968
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:05,060
are rebelling against us or actually coming against us and rebelling against

3969
02:59:05,060 --> 02:59:15,140
the Creator not very good it's funny how you know how much demon position is

3970
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:19,480
there in the Old Testament you notice very little not any but when you go to

3971
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:27,260
New Testament there's a lot what's changed there's all these things are

3972
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:34,100
temporal and you've got to comprehend time and it might seem difficult but it's

3973
02:59:34,100 --> 02:59:39,020
happening anyway I mean time is going to pass anyway but our comprehension of it

3974
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:44,580
is lacking that's why in Scripture it doesn't give you specific measurements

3975
02:59:44,580 --> 02:59:48,820
of time it tells you when you see these things happening then this will happen

3976
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:55,870
and then this and then you be ready it uses landmarks just like you would use a

3977
02:59:55,870 --> 03:00:03,600
landmark when you're traveling on the road so basically the prophecy part that

3978
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:08,540
I would like to just settle in people's minds would be that this country is going

3979
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:12,260
to be and the Western world is going to be playing second fiddle within the next

3980
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:20,260
decade to 14 years to the Middle East number one I wouldn't be concerned about

3981
03:00:20,260 --> 03:00:25,040
a particular character like they call the Antichrist because he's 13 years

3982
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:30,320
old and there's nothing you can do about it anyway Jesus was 13 years old

3983
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:36,240
wasn't he when he started preaching in the temples and stuff yeah I was 12 mm-hmm

3984
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:40,420
yeah so this this this particular character people know who he people

3985
03:00:40,420 --> 03:00:44,420
don't necessarily know who he is but he's a pretty popular he's going to be very

3986
03:00:44,420 --> 03:00:53,080
well-spoken very charismatic extremely bright for his age he's going to mirror

3987
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:58,200
the Messiah in every way well in a lot of ways but not in every way I should

3988
03:00:58,200 --> 03:01:05,320
say because the the things that happen you see one thing that people don't

3989
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:09,900
realize just as it's normal for us to see airplanes and automobiles around if

3990
03:01:09,900 --> 03:01:15,140
you brought an ancient here it would be really strange for him if you went back

3991
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:18,260
into ancient times there were things going on then that would be very strange

3992
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:24,660
to you there was people were more conscious and observant of the

3993
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:30,000
supernatural events and what we would call supernatural things that just

3994
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:37,660
shouldn't happen for example if you read very carefully in the scripture with the

3995
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:43,260
prophets no one ever really questioned whether or not they were actually being

3996
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:49,340
had gotten dictation from an angel about what to write down you know in

3997
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:53,240
scripture well we've that became scripture later there was no doubt in

3998
03:01:53,240 --> 03:01:57,060
anyone's mind as a matter of fact there are many places where they would

3999
03:01:57,060 --> 03:02:02,360
approach like Ezekiel or Jeremiah or Isaiah people would say so what did he

4000
03:02:02,360 --> 03:02:09,800
say like how did they know because they were signs as a matter of fact there

4001
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:14,380
were people in other nations that knew the spiritual world of the other

4002
03:02:14,380 --> 03:02:18,220
dimension was interacting with someone in a very specific place it was very

4003
03:02:18,220 --> 03:02:23,140
obvious I mean how I mean it could have been a light through the sky could have

4004
03:02:23,140 --> 03:02:27,300
been I mean you know there was a lot of supernatural stuff going on but if you

4005
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:30,980
read it very carefully as if you're there almost like a screenplay you'll

4006
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:35,280
say like oh well these people acknowledge him as a as a prophet that he's got a

4007
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:39,700
message from the Creator and they want to know what it is well if there was any

4008
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:43,440
doubt why would they be asking him right and if you keep reading in

4009
03:02:43,440 --> 03:02:46,720
scripture you you know said why do you ask for signs and wonders where you're

4010
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:51,880
not going to get any now oh you mean we used to get those on a regular basis

4011
03:02:51,880 --> 03:02:54,320
mean those things you get on a regular basis we're not going to get those

4012
03:02:54,320 --> 03:03:00,980
anymore nope if you read that carefully Messiah says what sign will be the sign

4013
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:05,060
of your coming he says there'll be no signs and wonders for you guys just the

4014
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:09,000
sign of Jonah three days and three nights in the belly of the fish meaning death

4015
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:13,220
by the way when Jonah was swallowed by the fish it wasn't a whale it was he

4016
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:18,400
died in there and he was spit out on the third day and if you read it he looked

4017
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:26,600
like a dead man got up walked up had a job to do so what we find to be

4018
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:31,520
commonplace today would not be commonplace to them and vice versa

4019
03:03:34,810 --> 03:03:40,130
yeah I've never seen anyone pop out of a whale alive so yeah well it wasn't a

4020
03:03:40,130 --> 03:03:45,930
whale it was a fish you know he was swallowed by a dog a dog a DAG a DAG

4021
03:03:45,930 --> 03:03:52,310
sounds like a dog but DAG is a fish and a leviathan is is whale actually in

4022
03:03:52,310 --> 03:03:58,010
Hebrew you know a lot of for example you know people say well I speak English you

4023
03:03:58,010 --> 03:04:02,170
know it's like I don't want to learn Greek or Hebrew I'm not Greek or Hebrew

4024
03:04:02,170 --> 03:04:09,450
you know I want English oh really okay do you know there's really not much in

4025
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:12,890
the English language if you take Greek and Hebrew out and if you take Latin out

4026
03:04:12,890 --> 03:04:20,230
I don't know what you got left can you tell me you really take all the for

4027
03:04:20,230 --> 03:04:23,930
example I say well what's that animal in the desert with that hump on its back Oh

4028
03:04:23,930 --> 03:04:29,690
a camel oh no you're speaking Hebrew yeah okay you know very easy I mean you could

4029
03:04:29,690 --> 03:04:33,090
look up the origin of the majority of the words in English they're from Greek and

4030
03:04:33,090 --> 03:04:39,610
Hebrew and Latin which is Greek and Hebrew like in Latin the the earth is

4031
03:04:39,610 --> 03:04:45,170
heirs and in Hebrew it's had it you know I mean there's not much of a difference

4032
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:51,190
all languages come from Edenic's Edenic is the root word is the root of all

4033
03:04:51,190 --> 03:04:55,910
words and that's what Adam and Eve spoke and that's what most people spoke up

4034
03:04:55,910 --> 03:05:00,830
until 4,000 years ago actually in that particularly the Israelites I should say

4035
03:05:00,830 --> 03:05:04,310
not most people because there were divisions where languages change and you

4036
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:11,350
can see it's very specific in Genesis here's an example in Edenic's like the

4037
03:05:11,350 --> 03:05:18,110
word Kelev means all heart and that's also the word for dog in Hebrew because

4038
03:05:18,110 --> 03:05:23,710
if anyone's ever had a dog you know dogs are all heart you know also from Kelev

4039
03:05:23,710 --> 03:05:31,970
you get the word wolf the LV sound or Kali you get the K-O-L-L-I right so the

4040
03:05:31,970 --> 03:05:35,870
more people that use a language and they live apart from each other the more

4041
03:05:35,870 --> 03:05:40,230
corrupt or the more changes letters like letter R and letter M will put in much

4042
03:05:40,230 --> 03:05:47,510
much later so there actually is some study called Edenic's you could look it

4043
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:50,530
up online right now there are some people doing some really really good

4044
03:05:50,530 --> 03:05:54,550
work especially with the advent of supercomputers to analyze words and they

4045
03:05:54,550 --> 03:05:59,250
find that they all have the same root just like if you find out the truth of

4046
03:05:59,250 --> 03:06:03,550
DNA you'll find out we all have the same DNA actually and we all have the same

4047
03:06:03,550 --> 03:06:09,050
mother that's why when they find these old primates they tell the people you

4048
03:06:09,050 --> 03:06:15,350
evolved from they call her Eve you know we all came from her you know stuff

4049
03:06:15,350 --> 03:06:24,040
they're saying is just unbelievable again my purpose even though you said it

4050
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:29,200
was prophecy there's a lot more prophecy to go but it's not going to help anyone

4051
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:36,200
if you lack discernment so that's the main thing the sermon is the main thing

4052
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:39,220
and you could go back and read it there's there's prophecy in there for

4053
03:06:39,220 --> 03:06:43,840
example Isaiah he says in the end they will mark their skins and pierce their

4054
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:50,540
body okay well there's always been tattoos and body piercings but not like

4055
03:06:50,540 --> 03:06:56,920
now I have yet to run into anyone even I saw a grandma in her 60s get new

4056
03:06:56,920 --> 03:07:02,780
tattoos brand-new I was like whoa you know all over the place I mean it's

4057
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:07,360
insane and it's like oh yes I know that's fine of the time some of these

4058
03:07:07,360 --> 03:07:12,640
people are getting piercings over their body I mean and they're putting hooks in

4059
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:19,800
them and doing weird things again with the prophecy it doesn't say only women

4060
03:07:19,800 --> 03:07:26,200
or some people it says they they they is a majority usually right majority of the

4061
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:32,320
people right I've never seen it's unprecedented unprecedented the amount

4062
03:07:32,320 --> 03:07:36,460
of tattooing and body piercing going on today it's unprecedented yeah yeah

4063
03:07:36,460 --> 03:07:40,960
within the next within the next 10 years it'll be really hard to find someone

4064
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:47,020
who doesn't have it it's not a fad folks it's not a fad this is it this is how

4065
03:07:47,020 --> 03:07:53,360
it's going to be from now on at least for the next 25 years or so so when is

4066
03:07:53,360 --> 03:08:00,180
it and times actually going to be we're in it we're in the end is like the

4067
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:03,840
beginning and if you want to know what's going to happen read the book of

4068
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:10,520
Revelation it's very clear it's very difficult to understand unless you're

4069
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:17,580
trying to follow biblical law I mean it's conditional in other words if you

4070
03:08:17,580 --> 03:08:21,380
want to understand the words in this book you have to be kind of obedient he gives

4071
03:08:21,380 --> 03:08:27,930
it to his people and he says my people will do my will if you're not doing his

4072
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:35,840
will his people if you gain his people he ain't going to show it to you very

4073
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:44,060
simple you just got to try it's I mean there's other people I think you've had

4074
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:48,300
someone else on that tells people to do biblical law it's never been done away

4075
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:52,740
with it has it everyone in the New Testament did biblical law I mean

4076
03:08:52,740 --> 03:09:00,140
everyone I mean the Messiah and the the Apostles they followed the law even Paul

4077
03:09:00,140 --> 03:09:07,300
followed the law now I tell a caveat if you read anything about the Apostle Paul

4078
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:15,940
anything that he wrote Paul speaks on a PhD level you will be confused and you

4079
03:09:15,940 --> 03:09:26,170
will be distracted and he will be misinterpreting what he's saying stay

4080
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:33,030
away from reading Paul until you start reading the first five books of the law

4081
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:39,110
and read the books of what the Messiah said the Messiah said Pharisees will not

4082
03:09:39,110 --> 03:09:44,450
enter the kingdom okay you didn't go back and change that when he says it's

4083
03:09:44,450 --> 03:09:53,990
written in stone Paul says I'm a Pharisee okay Messiah says follow me and

4084
03:09:53,990 --> 03:10:03,870
be like me Paul says follow me okay keep all the different yeah you're gonna have

4085
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:07,290
some problems serious you see that's why when you go to quote-unquote Christian

4086
03:10:07,290 --> 03:10:14,430
churches they only talk about Paul because well there's many reasons I can

4087
03:10:14,430 --> 03:10:22,360
get into but if you read Paul if you read Paul you're going to be confused if you

4088
03:10:22,360 --> 03:10:29,020
if you believe that you are Jewish or Christian or any kind of religion and you

4089
03:10:29,020 --> 03:10:35,420
read Paul there's a prophecy that says the father says that because they don't

4090
03:10:35,420 --> 03:10:43,450
want to do my laws I'm going to bring them straight a strong delusion I want to

4091
03:10:43,450 --> 03:10:47,750
start considering some prophetic verses on on the perception and the

4092
03:10:47,750 --> 03:10:54,350
discernment capabilities of the people in the end times he says that in book of

4093
03:10:54,350 --> 03:11:00,710
Dennis is the lawless will not understand or comprehend is he talking

4094
03:11:00,710 --> 03:11:09,710
about traffic law or codes and statues or what yeah he's talking about biblical

4095
03:11:09,710 --> 03:11:18,350
law well I think there's most of us are pretty confused about it as it is well

4096
03:11:19,150 --> 03:11:25,210
it's very simple just read what he wants you to do I remember a lot of those

4097
03:11:25,210 --> 03:11:29,330
things there is no temple to do a temple sacrifice and those temple sacrifices are

4098
03:11:29,330 --> 03:11:35,930
not for you to do there for the priests to do and there is no temple but you see

4099
03:11:35,930 --> 03:11:41,790
the Messiah said I've made you kings and priests for gaining knowledge right when

4100
03:11:41,790 --> 03:11:45,370
you when you speak to kings and priests do you sit there and talk about religion

4101
03:11:45,370 --> 03:11:49,910
no they're kings and priests they're supposed to go out rule the people

4102
03:11:49,910 --> 03:11:54,510
they're supposed to make sure that the stewardship is handled properly they

4103
03:11:54,510 --> 03:12:01,290
need knowledge they don't need religious gobbledygook you know if you're going to

4104
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:08,210
start speaking and trying to impart knowledge to a king or a priest he

4105
03:12:08,210 --> 03:12:15,920
doesn't want to hear about Santa Claus of the Easter Bunny that man or it would

4106
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:20,220
be in a position of power he's got bigger fish to fry in his mind he's got

4107
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:26,040
stewardship issues there's there's there's people that rely on him he needs

4108
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:32,020
knowledge not religion as a matter of fact the book of Zechariah father says

4109
03:12:32,020 --> 03:12:41,840
why do you people always want religion I want people so a good place to start

4110
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:48,880
would be read the first five books in the Bible and just stick to it you know

4111
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:54,320
when he says for example don't wear mixed fibers on your body he tells you

4112
03:12:54,320 --> 03:12:58,280
don't mix the wool and the linen and this and that okay when I read that I

4113
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:04,720
was like what oh man I've got a 80% cotton poly you know it's 20% poly

4114
03:13:04,720 --> 03:13:09,740
shirt it's cotton upon no okay so don't wear mixed fibers all right that shirts

4115
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:15,300
got to go I'm going to try it you know he says if you eat an animal with four

4116
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:18,560
legs and two lives on the ground it should chew the cut and have a cloven

4117
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:23,360
hoof let's see a pig okay he's got a cloven hoof but he doesn't chew the cut

4118
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:30,280
okay no pig rabbit choose the cut but he's got a paw okay no rabbit okay a

4119
03:13:30,280 --> 03:13:34,460
dog he doesn't have a paw or to the car he's out won't eat that won't eat rat

4120
03:13:34,460 --> 03:13:39,520
won't eat a cat you see so you got discernment now any else okay it comes

4121
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:44,940
out of the water says it should have fish if it comes out of the river the

4122
03:13:44,940 --> 03:13:50,360
ocean or the lake it's got to have fins and scales all right let's see I like

4123
03:13:50,360 --> 03:13:55,660
catfish but okay it's got fins but no scales okay catfish is out why because

4124
03:13:55,660 --> 03:14:00,260
he said so it's good enough for me I'm going to try it I'm going to try to live

4125
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:05,280
the way he wants me to live and I'm gonna see what happens you get my point

4126
03:14:06,960 --> 03:14:15,540
yeah how's that work out for you works great it works great it works really

4127
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:21,340
well and also says you do this because you you will be to be set apart and the

4128
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:24,980
thing is don't expect everyone to do it because if everyone is set apart what's

4129
03:14:24,980 --> 03:14:31,100
set apart nothing like if I've got a you know if I'm an apple farmer and I just

4130
03:14:31,100 --> 03:14:35,760
harvested let's say you know a ton of apples well in those apples I'm going to

4131
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:39,940
set a few apart that you know would be great a or triple-a or whatever maybe a

4132
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:45,180
photographer needs a really good-looking apple or something you know then you got

4133
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:48,660
the grade B ones with the scratches we'll make applesauce out of those and

4134
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:53,640
you got the moderate ones that go to like you know school lunch then you got

4135
03:14:53,640 --> 03:14:56,620
the real pretty looking ones they're all bunched over there we'll sell those as

4136
03:14:56,620 --> 03:15:03,400
a you know yeah so but if everything is set apart then nothing is set apart

4137
03:15:03,400 --> 03:15:07,720
because you need in other words you don't have hot without cold right hey

4138
03:15:07,720 --> 03:15:14,760
you don't have black without white so he tells you you know well try to be set

4139
03:15:14,760 --> 03:15:20,060
apart and if you you know apart from the rest and if you want to be set apart the

4140
03:15:20,060 --> 03:15:26,960
way I'm telling you to do it I'm giving you I'm telling you how and you do it

4141
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:33,560
you know he tells you you know for example if you happen to eat an unclean

4142
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:38,060
animal to unclean but unworthily like a pig or whatever you you're unclean for

4143
03:15:38,060 --> 03:15:43,200
seven days you got to wait seven days before you try to do something that

4144
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:51,520
requires you to be in a different state a clean state for example get married

4145
03:15:53,060 --> 03:15:59,200
what's that you wouldn't want to get married the next day yeah well it's a

4146
03:15:59,200 --> 03:16:04,940
prayer if you want to actually pray you want your prayer to be very effective

4147
03:16:04,940 --> 03:16:08,540
where it's carried by an angel to the heavenly realm if you're going to

4148
03:16:08,540 --> 03:16:15,620
present yourself to a king you kind of you know make sure you're you know what

4149
03:16:15,620 --> 03:16:19,200
the king wants you to be you know in preparation but if you're going to

4150
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:23,700
present yourself to the supreme being of the universe and he tells you well

4151
03:16:23,700 --> 03:16:28,320
don't try to do anything set apart if you're not set apart yourself you got to

4152
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:33,040
wait until you know that's the time of period until you're until you're set

4153
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:36,500
apart again so I don't like to use the words clean and unclean because people

4154
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:41,820
think it has to do with getting dirt on you you know it's a ritual thing that's

4155
03:16:41,820 --> 03:16:46,840
why a lot of the occult again I say knowledge is power and the people in

4156
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:50,880
power have certain knowledge this procedure and of course anyone who

4157
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:56,040
studies the legal system they understand this procedure right in the spiritual

4158
03:16:56,040 --> 03:17:01,340
world there's procedure if you want to start delving into the spiritual world

4159
03:17:01,340 --> 03:17:04,800
there's a procedure you can't walk in there like a bullet you can't walk into

4160
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:10,960
a courtroom like a bull in a China shop there's certain procedure so the same

4161
03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:14,300
with the spiritual world you want to act like a bull in the China shop they'll put

4162
03:17:14,300 --> 03:17:17,740
a yoke on you and they tell you be a beast of burden in the spiritual world

4163
03:17:19,880 --> 03:17:24,420
he even says that he calls people he says a lot of people are going to be

4164
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:31,670
basically acting like beasts of burden so you have to be set apart by look these

4165
03:17:31,670 --> 03:17:35,310
are this is the procedure these are the rules for example when you read in any

4166
03:17:35,310 --> 03:17:43,110
Bible or Scripture he says these are my appointed times the 14th day the 13th

4167
03:17:43,110 --> 03:17:48,930
day the first month okay and you've got the first day of the seventh month the

4168
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:52,810
tenth day of the seventh month the 15th day of the seventh month those are the

4169
03:17:52,810 --> 03:17:58,830
biblical feasts right and he says these are my appointments that's what they

4170
03:17:58,830 --> 03:18:05,760
actually mean now if you don't know when he says the first month he's not talking

4171
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:12,080
about January when he says the seventh month right it's not July and I was kind

4172
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:18,000
of hinting that before September is 1770 we get a little closer now so when

4173
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:24,370
he says these are my appointed times with you and you're not trying to do

4174
03:18:24,370 --> 03:18:27,950
them even if you're trying to do them if you don't get them on the right time

4175
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:32,830
aren't you going to miss your appointment now how many times can you

4176
03:18:32,830 --> 03:18:35,950
miss your appointment with someone of authority when they don't want to see

4177
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:44,510
you anymore how important is it how we talk from children you if you make an

4178
03:18:44,510 --> 03:18:49,830
appointment you have to be there okay so everybody we have the majority of the

4179
03:18:49,830 --> 03:18:55,730
people on this planet missing their appointments with basically the

4180
03:18:55,730 --> 03:19:01,780
emissaries of the Supreme Being and the Supreme Being himself he's telling you

4181
03:19:01,780 --> 03:19:05,300
what I want you to do on these days and these are appointments I don't see

4182
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:15,130
too many people trying to do them where does it say that oh I don't see too many

4183
03:19:15,130 --> 03:19:19,930
people trying to do my son saying that no I mean what where does it say on the

4184
03:19:19,930 --> 03:19:24,590
14th day what what are the appointments we are supposed to be doing Oh where do

4185
03:19:24,590 --> 03:19:33,000
you tell you Leviticus Leviticus 23 the book of Leviticus chapter 23 the whole

4186
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:39,500
chapter that is all about the appointments I thought it Leviticus

4187
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:44,560
talked about what we shouldn't and should eat it's more than that it's also

4188
03:19:44,560 --> 03:19:49,880
what days you yeah well that's to prepare yourself what's more than just

4189
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:56,880
eating it's there's six over 600 ordinances and laws in there about a

4190
03:19:56,880 --> 03:20:02,420
third of them a third of them are for the priests and the priests families and

4191
03:20:03,060 --> 03:20:08,220
because there are no priests and temple right now you can be conscious of those

4192
03:20:08,220 --> 03:20:13,640
and put those aside and also the age of those things happening is over that age

4193
03:20:13,640 --> 03:20:22,760
ended around 50 or 60 AD we're in a different age now so you keep them with

4194
03:20:22,760 --> 03:20:30,480
your intent as best as possible on the ordinances with the priest like for

4195
03:20:30,480 --> 03:20:36,220
example in the book of Kings when Solomon was dedicating the building the

4196
03:20:36,220 --> 03:20:40,540
temple when it was built took seven years to build David didn't build it a

4197
03:20:40,540 --> 03:20:45,120
son built it in Jerusalem when he dedicated the temple and they and you

4198
03:20:45,120 --> 03:20:49,220
know basically this what's called the second of the presence showed up

4199
03:20:49,220 --> 03:20:55,400
everyone stepped out and Solomon said this will be your dwelling place forever

4200
03:20:58,130 --> 03:21:02,230
well that's how it's translated in English but in the actual language

4201
03:21:02,230 --> 03:21:09,170
preservation the word Olam is translated to forever it doesn't mean forever all

4202
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:15,490
on this for a set period of time meaning the onto the age or ages for

4203
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:19,970
example in the Greek text when you see forever it doesn't say forever it's the

4204
03:21:19,970 --> 03:21:25,770
actual Greek word is a onion which is where we get the word eon from which is

4205
03:21:25,770 --> 03:21:31,810
a thousand or multiples of a thousand years so when Solomon said this is your

4206
03:21:31,810 --> 03:21:41,530
dwelling place for ever or Olam or unto the age if you knew about astronomy you

4207
03:21:41,530 --> 03:21:44,990
know food let's say you and I were there I'd give you a real sharp elbow on the

4208
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:50,290
side and say Angela you'd say what I said you know what you just said I said

4209
03:21:50,290 --> 03:21:55,510
what you'd say what I said he just said that this temple won't be here around 50

4210
03:21:55,510 --> 03:22:00,170
to 100 AD he says why do you say that well that age is ending between 50 and 100

4211
03:22:00,170 --> 03:22:08,900
AD really Wow and now the Messiah comes here didn't he say verily I tell you

4212
03:22:08,900 --> 03:22:15,340
not one stone will be left upon another of this temple right here you remember

4213
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:22,030
that you're saying that around 33 AD was anybody really shocked about that I

4214
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:26,140
mean people that knew scripture I didn't see anybody kind of freak out over it

4215
03:22:26,140 --> 03:22:31,240
you know in the text they didn't accuse him of wanting to tear down the temple

4216
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:38,520
they actually made at one of the informal trial places or accusations

4217
03:22:38,520 --> 03:22:42,580
they said and he said he would rebuild it in three days because that's what he

4218
03:22:42,580 --> 03:22:45,620
said after this isn't I will rebuild it in three days which means two thousand

4219
03:22:45,620 --> 03:22:52,820
years right and that's what they said well but he said he would rebuild the

4220
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:56,020
temple in three days but no one complained about him saying it won't be

4221
03:22:56,020 --> 03:22:59,120
there because they're kind of new the age is going to end between 50 and 100

4222
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:03,600
AD I'm using modern you know communication terms here that we can

4223
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:11,620
communicate but the temple was actually destroyed around 66 or 70 AD which is

4224
03:23:11,620 --> 03:23:14,700
kind of like you know in the beginning of that era I just mentioned or kind of

4225
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:22,700
like in the middle it's great accuracy here you know you know when Moses yeah

4226
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:27,120
you see so right now this age ended in 1998 and it's the age of the water bear

4227
03:23:28,200 --> 03:23:32,780
when they asked the Messiah I said when we where do we do the Passach or the

4228
03:23:32,780 --> 03:23:36,440
Passover he says when you enter the city walls you will see a man bearing

4229
03:23:36,440 --> 03:23:43,360
bearing water and you will follow him to the upper rooms whoa right away a big

4230
03:23:43,360 --> 03:23:47,120
red light you come on and say wait a second I've been reading scripture all

4231
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:52,040
the way from Genesis down to here water bearing is a woman's job now it's a man's

4232
03:23:52,040 --> 03:23:56,080
job here something wrong with this picture because all through scripture

4233
03:23:56,080 --> 03:24:01,740
it was the women that went to the well and drew the water for the camels and

4234
03:24:01,740 --> 03:24:07,140
the sheep what does it mean then well it means that this the bear this the

4235
03:24:07,140 --> 03:24:12,060
pouring out of the spirit is spoken of meaning that the truth will be poured

4236
03:24:12,060 --> 03:24:19,400
out by a man which is odd because it's poured out by a woman traditionally and

4237
03:24:20,200 --> 03:24:24,700
when you read about scripture this particular female entity known as

4238
03:24:24,700 --> 03:24:28,660
mystery Babylon she's pouring out her spirit getting all of the nation's

4239
03:24:28,660 --> 03:24:32,220
drunk with it and all the people kind of falling into this Babylonian system

4240
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:38,760
I'm going to end it's going to end yeah the pouring out of the spirit and I was

4241
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:42,580
going to be coming there's a different spirits going to be poured out you see

4242
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:49,140
that's why she's holding a cup now I've said this once before people said you

4243
03:24:49,140 --> 03:24:54,860
just offended every woman on the call I'm like no I didn't this particular

4244
03:24:54,860 --> 03:25:01,380
being just happens to be a female gender like if someone you know burglarizes

4245
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:05,320
your house and they catch him and you pull the mask off and it's a woman and

4246
03:25:05,320 --> 03:25:09,460
you tell someone a woman burglarized my house you know is that like you just

4247
03:25:09,460 --> 03:25:13,220
insulted women no it just so happened that this particular burglar happened to

4248
03:25:13,220 --> 03:25:20,730
be a woman right right we have to use discernment again I'm the reason I keep

4249
03:25:20,730 --> 03:25:24,450
bringing that up it's not really a sore spot but whenever I bring that up that

4250
03:25:24,450 --> 03:25:28,590
this woman is pouring out the spirit almost every time except for speaking

4251
03:25:28,590 --> 03:25:31,630
with you I guess you're in this call people said you just insulted women you

4252
03:25:32,090 --> 03:25:35,790
know it's like wow people relax and listen to what's being said or written

4253
03:25:35,790 --> 03:25:41,770
or you know I didn't think that at all I don't think anybody did yeah good but I

4254
03:25:41,770 --> 03:25:45,150
just want to tell you where I'm coming from and I'm starting to maybe qualify

4255
03:25:45,150 --> 03:25:51,790
things based on past experiences but that's okay too I think changing yeah

4256
03:25:51,790 --> 03:25:55,970
we're gonna do this again okay we've been on for a while like you have a

4257
03:25:55,970 --> 03:26:03,350
sounds like you have a lot more information sure well yeah and again I'd

4258
03:26:03,350 --> 03:26:07,750
love to just give the information out but again without the discernment aspect of

4259
03:26:07,750 --> 03:26:13,230
it you know big deal you know well we've had our lesson in discernment now

4260
03:26:13,230 --> 03:26:22,090
we need to go study that a bit and then come back on yeah we'll communicate about

4261
03:26:22,090 --> 03:26:29,070
that and again in the reason that I feel good about speaking on this call is

4262
03:26:29,070 --> 03:26:34,450
because there's a lot of legal discussion here typically yeah I find it

4263
03:26:34,450 --> 03:26:38,690
fascinating what you have to say well thank you and a lot of the legal

4264
03:26:38,690 --> 03:26:42,970
discussion is based on power of discernment right the words right usage

4265
03:26:42,970 --> 03:26:48,950
of words and I'm just trying to show people that the powers that be on the

4266
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:56,810
earth right now are there for a reason they're accommodating the people because

4267
03:26:56,810 --> 03:27:03,510
the people are doing things that are making enemies in the spiritual world so

4268
03:27:03,510 --> 03:27:08,190
we need to reflect back to ourselves and see what we're doing kind of do you

4269
03:27:08,190 --> 03:27:12,610
know clean up our own act in our own homes in our own minds in our own selves

4270
03:27:12,610 --> 03:27:17,550
and we'll start to see things change around us in a positive light it's done

4271
03:27:17,550 --> 03:27:26,970
on an individual basis for one each one at a time so well thanks for having me

4272
03:27:36,410 --> 03:27:45,470
hello yeah no I'm here I'm sorry I had my mute button on we've been doing that

4273
03:27:45,470 --> 03:27:49,730
for about three hours and 38 minutes and I think we could probably go on for

4274
03:27:49,730 --> 03:27:54,570
another three hours but let's save it for another yeah we'll have to learn from

4275
03:27:54,570 --> 03:27:59,470
what we've been taught already and and and start to pay attention to what we're

4276
03:27:59,470 --> 03:28:07,070
reading and look into the like you said the etymology of the words right and the

4277
03:28:07,070 --> 03:28:12,350
thing is it's not what people are making a big do about what's called

4278
03:28:12,350 --> 03:28:16,370
government what's called law on the courts and all that but I just want to

4279
03:28:16,370 --> 03:28:21,930
say it's not just that it's every subject I have not seen a subject or

4280
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:26,470
topic or a body of knowledge that anyone can subscribe to on this planet right

4281
03:28:26,470 --> 03:28:33,170
now that is not just turned inside out upside down and I'm saying this in a

4282
03:28:33,170 --> 03:28:37,310
very truthful way not to be sarcastic I've not seen anything that hasn't been

4283
03:28:38,190 --> 03:28:46,470
affected in a way where I can't say it's uncorrupted every field everything is a

4284
03:28:46,470 --> 03:28:52,110
lie and in the other some yeah well I wouldn't say completely but enough of it

4285
03:28:52,110 --> 03:28:56,430
in there that I wouldn't take it on face value nothing that's why I say I'm

4286
03:28:56,430 --> 03:29:00,990
just visiting this planet you know right now taking notes if you once you

4287
03:29:00,990 --> 03:29:06,250
really find the truth of all things here you don't really want to be a part of it

4288
03:29:06,250 --> 03:29:11,190
you know I mean you're in it but you're not of it you're just passing through

4289
03:29:11,770 --> 03:29:17,250
until you know that it's all corrected and man's not going to correct it it's

4290
03:29:17,250 --> 03:29:20,510
going to take this other dimension mingling with this one with real

4291
03:29:20,510 --> 03:29:29,240
authority real truth real knowledge real you see real science and then it'll and

4292
03:29:29,240 --> 03:29:32,940
then it'll all come together with that said blessings to everyone and thank you

4293
03:29:32,940 --> 03:29:37,740
for having me Angela oh thank you for coming on we appreciate it immensely and
