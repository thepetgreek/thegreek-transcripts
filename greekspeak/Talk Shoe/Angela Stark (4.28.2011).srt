1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,730
Hi everybody, it's April 28th, it's Thursday evening and it's a beautiful day in California

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,830
except for all the chemtrails, but anyway, tonight our special guests are Ed Waller and

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,930
Lewis Hughes, and perhaps you know of them, they won their case.

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,710
Why don't you go ahead and tell us a little bit about it, Ed, and Lewis, for those of us

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,150
that aren't familiar with what's gone on in the past couple of years, three years, whatever.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,510
Fill us in.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,500
Well, it started on August 24th, 2004, with a raid by the FBI on me, Lewis, and three

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,180
or four other people all in the same day.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,140
They cleaned out basically all our computers, all our ability to do much of anything, and

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
I went and met with the FBI agent and said, you know, what the hell is your problem?

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,980
If you think I did something wrong, then I'll be happy to demonstrate it in court.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,440
Well, time went by.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,220
Well, wait a minute, in the meantime, I was in jail because I refused to let the Yehoos

14
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,700
in, they never would show me a delegation of authority to come onto the state, and

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,920
so we had a little standoff for 31 hours.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,240
When they started bringing up things that shoot through my house and three other neighbors'

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,680
houses at the same time, I decided it was time to do other things, and subsequently,

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,420
I spent the next little over ten months in jail.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
Yeah, and I talked to Lewis on the phone for about five hours during this standoff.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,440
That was kind of fun.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,580
Wow.

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, and I was communicating with people all over the place via the Internet, and after

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,360
the feds cut my phone line and my cell phone, they didn't realize I had a DSL Internet connection,

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:02,540
so I was still able to communicate with the rest of the world during the next day, so

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,680
it was interesting.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:03,980
Wow.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,780
I do not recommend anybody try it.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,280
No, that's not the way to go, but anyway, we danced around with the FBI agent for about,

29
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,560
I don't know, almost four years.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,660
Yeah.

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,580
I went to court, tried to get my property back.

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,860
That didn't happen.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,760
The FBI agent was still running around town saying they were going to indict us, and so

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,220
we finally went to D.C., the Article III court, after we completed an admin process and sued.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,920
We did a preemptive lawsuit to have the law declared, and we sued the FBI agent and the

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,740
Treasury agent that he had brought into the mix, and they didn't answer the lawsuit.

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:58,480
On June 12, 2008, the clerk docketed our default win in the U.S. District Court in Washington,

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,040
D.C.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,880
It settled all matters, and four days later, on June 16, we were arrested, me, my wife,

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
and Lewis went on the lam.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,400
I disappeared on them.

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,040
Excuse me.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,160
And so I spent the next 17 months, four days, and eight hours a guest of the feds in the

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,860
county jail until we went to trial in November of 2010.

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,680
County jails.

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,440
We got to see a number of them in our sojourn.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,740
Yeah.

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,180
And, you know, you're basically starved to death.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,940
You've got, you know, food that won't support life.

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,000
And so we've got all kinds of ongoing health problems that we're still trying to rectify

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,180
with respect to that.

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,080
Yeah.

53
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,620
I went down to 128 pounds, and I'm six foot three.

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,320
Wow.

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,160
So that'll tell you how bad the food was and how bad the treatment was and everything else,

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,340
but just to kind of fill in a little bit there.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:10,720
When we saw that the indictment had been handed down, there were some things I wanted

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,300
to try before I was taken into custody.

59
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,420
So I disappeared for four months.

60
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,940
And so they were not happy with me.

61
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,160
Let's put it that way.

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,620
They're still not happy with me.

63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:36,760
But before we ever made it to trial, I had been cross-country back again and back.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,000
At that point, I'd been from Seattle to North Carolina, back to Seattle, back to North Carolina,

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,820
and had seen more jails than I care to count.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:02,620
Ed was strictly in a couple of places, so he didn't get to travel as much as I did.

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,720
He didn't get to fly on FedAir, Conair, whatever you want to call it.

68
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:17,280
They actually call it JPAT, Justice Prisoner Air Transport System.

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,880
For those who want to know the technical name of Conair, that's it, JPAT.

70
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,000
Correct.

71
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:26,600
All right.

72
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,260
So you guys did, you were going, you know, they were doing diesel therapy on you and

73
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,620
taking you here and there, different jails, and really, they didn't like you very much,

74
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,320
and that's what they were showing you, how much they liked you.

75
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,760
Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,980
Every time we went into court, the marshals just hoo-hawed and laughed at us.

77
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:53,980
You know, we were just a bunch of lunatics, and my wife and I made the top three domestic

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
terrorists for the FBI in 2008.

79
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,480
Wow.

80
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:07,060
So we were on the FBI Department of Justice website as their top three domestic terrorist arrests.

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,740
Now, that's almost a trophy nowadays, if you get to be on their list, you know?

82
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,340
It's like, wow, you must really be a true patriot to get on their list.

83
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,120
Pretty much, you know, we are domestic terrorists.

84
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,660
So anyway, we went to trial with no attorneys.

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,240
We basically played our own counsel.

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Yeah, well, we did have standby counsel, if you want to call it that.

87
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:49,140
The guy who was assigned to me had never defended a criminal case in his life and had only been

88
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,740
in the federal court one previous time.

89
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,080
Now, how's that for experience?

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,060
And the guy that they assigned to Ed wasn't much better.

91
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,260
I mean, it was pathetic.

92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,540
No, I fired him, and he hates me.

93
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,820
And then I ran into another guy in jail who had paid him $100,000, and the attorney was

94
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,420
just lousy.

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,500
And as we saw in the Bernard Von Nothouse case, if you take on a public defender, even if

96
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,120
you have the best case in the world, you know, you're going down.

97
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,840
So I would strongly recommend anybody in that position, you know, do not use an attorney.

98
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,240
You're going to go down with the attorney.

99
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
Even if you screw it up yourself, at least you've got a chance.

100
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:32,780
Right.

101
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah.

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,140
So after about two weeks of jury selection and trial and about 13 hours of deliberation,

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,400
the jury came back with innocent on all charges for all three of us, my wife, Lewis, and myself.

104
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,440
Yeah, it was interesting.

105
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:58,380
We found out later that when the jury went out to deliberate about 1.30 on Thursday,

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,240
they took, well, immediately they selected a foreman, and Ed and I both had figured out

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,020
who that was going to be before they ever went to the jury room.

108
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,040
They took a first vote, and it was an even split, six and six.

109
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:29,520
And from then until a few minutes before 4.30 on Friday, it slowly worked its way down until

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,940
there was one holdout.

111
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,140
And just before 4.30, he says, nope, they're not guilty.

112
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,880
And we came back in.

113
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,659
Yeah.

114
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,340
Well, you know, right up there with the birth of my children, my wedding day, that was probably

115
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,120
the most amazing day of my life.

116
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,020
Yep.

117
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,260
That's so great.

118
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,580
Since then, we have done a number of things.

119
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,380
We filed Form 95 with the feds.

120
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:12,760
For those not familiar with the Form 95, it's the Administrative Claim Act, which is

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,360
the first step in suing the government.

122
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,040
Because the government had a number of problems when they arrested us.

123
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,040
First of all, we had a standing default in the D.C. court.

124
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Everyone knows that the same issues cannot be in the same court at the same time.

125
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,840
So the U.S. D.C. that handed down the indictment did not have jurisdiction over the case because

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,100
all the issues before the court were already in D.C. and had been for basically two and

127
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,640
a half months.

128
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,680
The North Carolina court, not the D.C. court.

129
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,100
North Carolina handed down the indictment, but the matter was already settled in the

130
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,820
D.C. court.

131
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,640
Yep.

132
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,060
So at the time of the arrest, there couldn't have been an arrest because the case couldn't

133
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,040
have been in the Western Carolina court.

134
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,480
So that's a problem.

135
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,380
Number two, let's see where I was going to go with number two.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,760
Since everything was settled and we had pretty much taken care of everything and had gotten

137
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,920
everything agreed to up front through our administrative process, etc., they just couldn't

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,720
do what they did.

139
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,940
Then on top of that, they denied Lewis and I bail so that we didn't defend ourselves.

140
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Oh, and they sent me over to F.C.I.

141
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,020
Butner for psychological evaluation because I wouldn't sign their stupid paperwork and

142
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,840
I wouldn't cooperate in court.

143
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,680
So therefore, that means you're insane.

144
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,880
Of course.

145
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,040
So I spent four months in what is actually a very nice facility.

146
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:58,960
If Ed and I could have been housed there, we wouldn't be in as bad a shape as we are

147
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,580
right now.

148
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,660
I didn't talk to my wife for basically 16 months, 16 and a half months.

149
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,180
Oh, my God.

150
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:07,880
Why?

151
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, she was ordered not to have any contact with me.

152
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,060
So I wasn't allowed to start talking to her until we started the trial because we were

153
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,700
co-counsel at that point, so they couldn't keep us from talking.

154
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,140
We had to defend ourselves from jail with basically pencil and paper.

155
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
We had no computers.

156
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,520
The law library was a joke.

157
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,200
If you could even get to it, it was very highly controlled and outdated.

158
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,820
So we defended with both hands tied behind our back.

159
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,100
Sure.

160
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,080
I've seen that before.

161
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,080
That's the way they do it.

162
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,020
Oh, yeah.

163
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,740
But you prevailed.

164
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,160
That's the wonderful thing about it.

165
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:57,520
Well, we had the creator on our side, and there were other things in play that we do

166
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,620
not know and do not understand to this day.

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,440
During jury selection and during the first two days of trial, which was a Thursday and

168
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,680
a Friday of the first week, Judge Voorhees was a total asshole toward us.

169
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,380
I mean, he was absolutely mean.

170
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,740
And we came in Monday morning, and we basically could do no wrong in his eyes.

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,720
We don't know what happened.

172
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,360
We have no clue.

173
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,180
We've never been able to get any word out of anybody on what may have happened.

174
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,640
We have some theories, but since we can't prove any of them, we're not even going to

175
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,500
bother mentioning them.

176
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,040
But pretty much every motion we made was granted.

177
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,360
Every motion the prosecution made was denied.

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,160
Our jury instructions were just extremely favorable.

179
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,960
And anybody will tell you that in the federal system, your instructions are either live

180
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,640
or die by them.

181
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,680
Right.

182
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,220
So somebody was pulling for us, evidently.

183
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,200
I'll say.

184
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,780
That's the only thing we can say for sure.

185
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,510
So what has that led you to up to this point?

186
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,190
I didn't hear that.

187
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,170
Say that again, Angela?

188
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,510
What has all of this led you to up to this point?

189
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,110
Well, at this point, what we are doing, of course, we're not being very quiet about this.

190
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:29,470
We have now written, and the draft is available on our website or is available on RBN and

191
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,990
numerous other places, a United States Supreme Court case, original jurisdiction.

192
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,310
In other words, we're filing directly in the Supreme Court.

193
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,150
We're not appealing.

194
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,390
We're not playing any of those games.

195
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,690
It's essentially declaratory judgment action, even though that is a statutory thing.

196
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,670
We're not going in statutorily, but we're asking for the Supreme Court to declare, declare

197
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,290
rights, declare the status of our republic.

198
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,090
Is this government going to protect private rights instead of allow people to be forced

199
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,850
to convert everything to public rights?

200
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:10,830
And it's our last ditch effort to see if we're going to be able to regain the form of

201
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,350
government that our founding fathers promised us in the form of a republic.

202
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,490
And if not, then the whole idea through the public awareness campaign is to show the

203
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,170
American people that we have been left with no choice but to abolish or amend per the

204
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,370
preamble to the Declaration of Independence.

205
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,580
So we're actually trying to get 50.

206
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,300
We're trying to get plaintiffs from each of the 50 states as so because we're not only

207
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,860
suing the United States, but we're suing the 50 de jure states as well as the 50, what

208
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,240
everybody calls corporate states.

209
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,960
We use the term body politic and body corporate because that's actually the proper terminology.

210
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,820
But there'll be all those parties named and we're going for things like having Supreme

211
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,000
Court order the states no longer can accept federal money, that property is once again,

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you know, untaxable, untakeable, untouchable, that...

213
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,520
In other words, you have a loyal title to your land.

214
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,220
Right.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,640
And all of your property because property, your rights are property.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Your political will is property.

217
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,040
The income tax is gone.

218
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,900
You know, basically re-hold up, re-hold Bruce Schaber and the six cases that followed the

219
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,100
16th Amendment where the Supreme Court said, you know, 16th Amendment gave Congress no

220
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,060
new taxing powers.

221
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
Basically, if you've got to be...

222
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Lawful money has to be reissued, public money basically, pursuant to the article in Section

223
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,840
10, etc.

224
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,840
So if you can think of a beef you've got with our current status, I think we've pretty well

225
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,500
addressed it in the body of the suit.

226
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,900
I think we have to.

227
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,670
Go ahead.

228
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,350
Who's she talking to?

229
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,930
Both of you guys.

230
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,470
Well, it sounded like you were going to continue saying something, but you stopped.

231
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,730
Well, I didn't have any questions to that point.

232
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,890
Well, we can ask.

233
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,050
Basically, we are dedicated, you know, pretty much full time to the prosecution of this

234
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,370
lawsuit.

235
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,190
We've got some pretty amazing researchers involved.

236
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,150
We are getting a lot of interest in it from some quarters who, you know, we have a Saturday

237
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,410
night program on RBN, Republic Broadcasting Network.

238
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,710
So a lot of people have been listening to us for quite a while there now.

239
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,210
And we had some doubters.

240
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,110
You know, people said, you know, this is worthless.

241
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,710
It's a waste of time.

242
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,050
And so what we've tried to do is set this up so that it's win-win.

243
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,950
If Supreme Court hears our case and sides with us, holds, you know, for the relief we're

244
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,650
seeking, we win.

245
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,290
If Supreme Court says we're not touching this with a 10-foot pole because it's too

246
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:19,130
disruptive, you know, we've sold out, you can't have your country back, then we win.

247
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,730
Because by asking, we believe by asking the right questions, framed the right way in

248
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:31,270
law without all the crazy theories that people have about, you know, commerce and

249
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,810
accepted for value and all this stuff that gets people in trouble.

250
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,170
And we know that because that's what we're prosecuted for.

251
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,890
Then at least when the Supreme Court says, no, we're not going to touch this, then we

252
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,310
know when we can hold our heads up high and say, OK, then we know what time it is.

253
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:46,610
OK.

254
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,610
And the American people are going to have a choice to make.

255
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,130
We are going fiscally bankrupt.

256
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,150
They're playing games about whether or not they can cut 30, 38 billion dollars from a

257
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,270
3.4 trillion dollar budget.

258
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,370
And so, you know, if the people don't step in, Lewis and I talked about the fact that,

259
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,050
you know, elections never make people free.

260
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,610
Nothing's changed since the last election cycle, even though everybody had great hope.

261
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,350
And so it's up to the people.

262
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,370
We are the progenitors.

263
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,150
We, you know, of the people, by the people, for the people.

264
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,130
Well, we need to do our job.

265
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,110
We need to step up and say enough.

266
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,330
This is what we want you to do.

267
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,250
And if you don't do it, we're kicking off the chains.

268
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:28,730
Yeah.

269
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,530
And so people can go to your Web site and join in or how?

270
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,990
Yeah, we actually just made.

271
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,130
Yeah, we just made some changes where you can now actually register to become a plaintiff

272
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,970
right on the Web site.

273
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,330
USAV.me.

274
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,010
It's not a .com or .org or .info.

275
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,730
It's a .me.

276
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,130
So it's USAV.me and that's USA versus me or USAV.me.

277
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,110
Got a couple of good plays, dumb words going there.

278
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,950
And you can read the lawsuit.

279
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,850
The text is downloadable as a PDF.

280
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,810
You can watch an hour long presentation I put together on, you know, the issues, why

281
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,290
we're going to Supreme Court, what we plan to accomplish with it.

282
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,470
We're asking for, like, say, plaintiffs to step up and play the role.

283
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,190
You're not going to have to actually litigate anything.

284
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,670
The lead plaintiffs will do all the heavy lifting for you.

285
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,490
But in order to sue the 50 states, we have to have standing, legal standing in those

286
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,730
50 states by having a plaintiff in those states.

287
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,050
So by all means, please visit our Web site.

288
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,990
Take a look at it.

289
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,670
I'm asking, you know, anybody, if you think we are totally all wet, fine.

290
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,810
You know, I respect your opinion and I hope you're doing something to change the status

291
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:58,110
quo and instead of just bitching about it because, you know, as Americans, we're really

292
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,350
good about bitching about things.

293
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,150
But Louis and I have paid, you know, kind of the almost, just sort of the ultimate

294
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,750
sacrifice for this country of ours.

295
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,090
Yeah, we basically lost everything we had.

296
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,530
Yeah, I lost, you know, a year and a half of my life.

297
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,730
I've lost all my possessions.

298
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,650
You know, my children are definitely, they have issues from this.

299
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,730
They're scarred.

300
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:30,170
I've lost three years of my life because I did two stints in federal prison relative

301
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,450
to this case before we ever went to trial.

302
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,410
And I've lost everything that I had in terms of property and everything else.

303
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,830
And, you know, it's a it's a severe price to pay.

304
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:51,370
But if somebody doesn't step up and save this country, where are we going to be?

305
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,510
You know, what are you going to do when when gasoline is fifty dollars a gallon

306
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:04,230
and we're like Zimbabwe where a piece of toilet paper is worth more than a million

307
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,870
dollar bill?

308
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,750
Yeah, pretty bad.

309
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,130
It's getting there.

310
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,350
We've got to learn to barter.

311
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,170
We don't have the money now.

312
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,890
You know, they are they think they have no bounds with what they can do to you at

313
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,430
airports and monitor you.

314
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,830
And we know none of this is actually the way it's supposed to be.

315
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,750
But if you study history, every democracy devolves into violence.

316
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,930
And in a democracy, the control function has to be ever escalating.

317
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,770
And right now, you know, the people are the polls are saying, look, 60, 70 percent of

318
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,190
people don't want their taxes raised.

319
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,950
But go ahead and tax it, raise it on the rich.

320
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,390
And people don't want Social Security, Medicare touched.

321
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,310
Well, of course, at this point, 50 plus percent of the country doesn't pay income

322
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,410
tax and is on the government dole.

323
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,550
So, folks, you know, lead, follow or please get the hell out of the way.

324
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,030
You want to take some questions?

325
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,330
Sure, whatever.

326
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,050
Sure, sure.

327
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,450
All right.

328
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,010
Anyone that wants to ask a question, press star eight.

329
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,790
That'll put you up in the queue.

330
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,330
I just wanted to you guys coauthored the book USA vs.

331
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,210
U.S., right?

332
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,290
Well, I did with two other gentlemen, U.S.

333
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,650
of A.V.

334
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,730
U.S. loss of legal memory of the American state.

335
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,130
And that that was with T.J.

336
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,910
Henderson and Kegley.

337
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,370
Kegley's disappeared.

338
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,330
I don't know where he is.

339
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,090
But basically, the book is still right on.

340
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,150
I mean, it talks about that the root of the problem is legal relations with the

341
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,850
United States.

342
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,370
And that's what we have to fix.

343
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,250
We have to be able to sever those ties with the United States or we can't move

344
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,010
forward. We can never go back.

345
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,210
It's interesting.

346
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,990
There are people in position of public responsibility who are starting to figure

347
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,550
this out.

348
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:11,070
Yesterday morning, I had a conversation with the sheriff of Grant County, Oregon,

349
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,670
Sheriff Palmer.

350
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,670
First off, I was surprised that I got right through to him.

351
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:25,850
Sheriff Palmer is engaged in an internal battle with some of his department over

352
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,850
not operating with the U.S.

353
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,970
Forest Service.

354
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,870
And his belief is the U.S.

355
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,890
Forest Service has absolutely no police authority within the state.

356
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,570
And their police activities should be terminated.

357
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,290
And his undersheriff and several other deputies are bucking him on that.

358
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,290
They want the federal funds.

359
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,270
They want all the toys that come with federal participation.

360
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,310
And he's saying, no, that is not how this country is.

361
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,110
Was founded and how it's supposed to operate.

362
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,570
And so I called him to tell him about the website and he seemed to be rather

363
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,130
interested.

364
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,730
And so I left him my phone number and asked him to get back with me if he had

365
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,350
any questions.

366
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,750
And he was very cordial, seemed very interested.

367
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,150
So we shall see.

368
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,290
Wow.

369
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:33,790
You know, our message for a long time has been we need you need to start calling

370
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,550
your representatives.

371
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,270
We need to let them know that we now know.

372
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:45,730
And so if you watch the presentation at USAV.me, of course, your listeners

373
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,190
are far more astute and versed on the subject.

374
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,930
But so many people don't understand that Social Security can only be

375
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,830
administered within the several within the D.C.

376
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,650
zone. It cannot be administered within the several states.

377
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,450
The law is written, says the administrator can only administer Social Security

378
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,230
within D.C.

379
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,890
and the territories.

380
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,030
You know, if you look at the Brandeis rules, rule six of Brandeis rules says

381
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,690
the Supreme Court shall not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the

382
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,950
instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.

383
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,630
So by simply accepting Social Security, you know, you you ashwander yourself is

384
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,710
what we call it from the Ashwander case so that you can't even go challenge it.

385
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,030
Now, the funny thing is, Supreme Court has said that unalienable rights are

386
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,090
unalienable.

387
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,930
You cannot sell, bargain, transfer or in any way through any commercial process

388
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,850
get rid of those rights.

389
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,590
Nor can your state.

390
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,450
Nor can the state get rid of its sovereign powers.

391
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,210
Right.

392
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,810
So what is it going to be?

393
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,450
Beg your pardon?

394
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,290
So you can't have it both ways.

395
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,290
What is it going to be?

396
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,370
Well, that's why we're going to Supreme Court to settle this once and for all

397
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,410
and have them say, see, that's the really interesting thing about this case.

398
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,370
We're not asking the Supreme Court to overturn a bunch of precedent.

399
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:15,670
We're not asking them to do anything but reinforce and restate what they've

400
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,210
already said time and time again for years and years.

401
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,210
Mm hmm.

402
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,770
It's going to be real because we have all the case law.

403
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,030
We have all the statutes.

404
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,810
We all know that Title 26 only taxes federal employees.

405
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:34,850
We know that 5 U.S.C. 552 AA 13 says that simply being eligible for for any

406
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,770
deferred retirement benefits of the United States government makes you

407
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,570
federal personnel.

408
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,730
We all know this.

409
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,590
It's in the law, black and white.

410
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,930
There's no secrets here.

411
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,330
So what are they going to do?

412
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,270
Say, well, whatever we said before, it doesn't matter anymore.

413
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,910
You know, we're not going to touch that.

414
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,100
Either way, like you said, though, we win.

415
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,020
Right.

416
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,640
Either way.

417
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,700
That's the way we're playing.

418
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,680
We're doing this like a chess match, figuring out where they're going to stay

419
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,040
ahead.

420
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,840
If you read the lawsuit, it's very clear that, you know, we don't want them to

421
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,280
seal this.

422
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,780
We want it to be out in the open, that if they don't meet their burden, I mean,

423
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,240
the first first and highest paramount duty of any court is to protect the

424
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,740
people from the excesses of the government.

425
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,480
We're putting in there the fact that all U.S.

426
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,100
district courts today are no longer and haven't been constitutional courts.

427
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,240
We can't go to any other court, even though the states and everybody are

428
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,120
suing in these lower courts, even though Article one, Article three, Section

429
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,080
two of the Constitution says anytime a state is a named party, the court of

430
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,580
original jurisdiction is United States Supreme Court.

431
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,960
You know, how could these lawyers, all bar card carrying lawyers, not know which

432
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,800
court to sue in?

433
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,680
Hmm.

434
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,820
Isn't that interesting?

435
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,580
Maybe they're not really suing states.

436
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,080
So, yeah, no one has done anything like this, put this to the feds, you know, to

437
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,380
the Supreme Court in this way.

438
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,240
And we know, I mean, we also want the Supreme Court to say that they do need to

439
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,060
overturn themselves because they overturned themselves before with respect to

440
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,740
federal judges paying income tax.

441
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:14,820
Mm hmm.

442
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,340
You know, you've got a built in conflict of interest when you go into a United

443
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,860
States district court on a tax matter and the judge pays income tax.

444
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,180
Yep.

445
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,900
That's a criminal conflict of interest and they never bother to recuse

446
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,360
themselves.

447
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,260
Mm hmm.

448
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,920
So there's a lot in that suit.

449
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,920
If people want to read it, I don't know if you had any questions, anybody

450
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,020
raise their hand for questions.

451
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,140
Yeah, we do have a couple of questions.

452
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,220
James Madison.

453
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,740
Let me see.

454
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,440
There you go.

455
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,280
Hi.

456
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,340
Did you have a question?

457
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,580
Yeah.

458
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,960
Can you hear me OK?

459
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,540
Yes, we can.

460
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,300
Good to hear you again, Angela.

461
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,920
How are you doing?

462
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,100
Thank you.

463
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,720
I'm fine.

464
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,640
Thank you.

465
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,900
My question is, I'm curious just to know if you gentlemen are aware of what Dr.

466
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,820
Livingston is doing.

467
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,360
I've seen your video.

468
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,660
I went to your website and was fairly impressed.

469
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,600
It doesn't seem to be as in-depth or as inclusive as what Dr.

470
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Dale Livingston is going on.

471
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,140
And we filed a shooting in Colorado against the federal government because

472
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,380
they're not supplying us with a Republican form of government as we are

473
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,580
guaranteed in the Constitution.

474
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:34,840
OK.

475
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,620
Who are the plaintiffs?

476
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,460
Who did he sue?

477
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,680
Well, we're taking it to the tribunal court.

478
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
He's actually suing the federal government, all agencies and judges and

479
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,480
all of them.

480
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,620
So it's a little difficult of a case.

481
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,340
OK.

482
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,780
But what court is it filed in?

483
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,740
It's in the 10th Tribunal Court.

484
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,440
What the heck is that?

485
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,440
Well, that's a malarkey that came out of a guy down in Arizona that several

486
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,280
people up here tried to help him.

487
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,940
I really wanted him to answer the question.

488
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,080
OK.

489
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I know what it is.

490
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,740
You know, it's a waste of time and resources if you want my honest opinion

491
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,890
because what are you going to do if you get a ruling out of that court?

492
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,110
Who's going to recognize it?

493
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,960
Well, as I understand it, it's eventually going to England and Wales courts

494
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,940
because it's above anything that was created here in the States and the

495
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,000
colonies even.

496
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,800
So, you know, it's a very in-depth...

497
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,380
Yeah, and Dr. Livingston wants to prove that the Constitution was a fraud

498
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,600
from the get-go, that we have to tear it up and start over.

499
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,340
And I won't disagree with his...

500
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,540
Throw the country in chaos.

501
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,960
Right, with his conclusions.

502
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,020
But guess what?

503
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
It's never going to happen.

504
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,980
Courts are not allowed to create chaos.

505
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,500
And that's about as close to chaos as I think you can get.

506
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,460
The second problem is, as you just said, it would have to go to the court of

507
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,880
Wales and England and make that no say within the United States.

508
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,860
Nope.

509
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,760
So...

510
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,260
We can't solve our problems here.

511
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,000
As the creators of this nation, how is somebody somewhere else going to

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,900
step in and solve the problem?

513
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,700
We haven't even done the right thing, and I'm sorry, suing to have the

514
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,760
Constitution declared null and void ab initio.

515
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,520
It's nuts.

516
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,500
It's nuts, yeah, exactly.

517
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,280
Oh, boy.

518
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,220
Okay, let me make a comment here on that.

519
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,900
For your information, it is recorded in the Congressional Record, 1835,

520
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,580
that the Constitution was never lawfully ratified.

521
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,420
There was a book published in 1804.

522
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,520
If you'll hold on a moment, I will get you the title for it,

523
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,500
because I've given away dozens of copies of it.

524
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,940
I've just got to remember where in the world I put that.

525
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,860
It's in the Congressional Record that the Constitution was never lawfully ratified.

526
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,560
So, what's the point?

527
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,420
Okay?

528
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,120
I mean, it's in the open record.

529
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
There's nothing to argue.

530
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,420
But do we have anything better to operate under for the last 200 years?

531
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,040
If so, I guess I missed it.

532
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,520
And you believe that it's operational now?

533
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,440
No, it's not.

534
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,480
That's the problem.

535
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
That is the problem.

536
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,900
That's what I'm saying.

537
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,340
Now, I'm saying that we want to go back to something that's failed.

538
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,940
No, it did not fail.

539
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,840
People failed it.

540
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,700
People failed it.

541
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,560
No.

542
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,360
Okay, we failed it, right.

543
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,940
People failed it.

544
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,440
It wasn't perfect when it came into origin.

545
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,240
It wasn't ever brought forward properly.

546
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,840
It's always been a nation of men rather than a nation of law.

547
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,300
And it's failed, but we don't need to look into getting it going right, though, huh?

548
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,800
Well, first of all, the first 90 years of this country went pretty well.

549
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,720
It wasn't until the Civil War.

550
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,820
It took a civil war to totally destroy what was left of the people's memory of the Constitution.

551
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,220
Now, that happened in the War of 1812, but that's okay.

552
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,380
Well, that one was a pretty bad little time as well.

553
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,280
Yeah, that war was to do away with the 13th Amendment.

554
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,560
Article 13 of the Constitution would be the correct way to say it.

555
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,920
The War of 1812 was to destroy the Freeman documents, as you know, which was the original writing.

556
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,040
My forefather, James Madison Bowe, was the Republican Declaration of the United American Colonies.

557
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,580
Which has been usurped into something, a contract we call now the Constitution.

558
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:37,000
Which was brought forward by William Hickey in 1846 and adopted by select members of the Confederate Congress in 1847 to be this nation's Constitution.

559
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,560
It's under glass in the National Archives today, displayed as something that our forefathers brought forward.

560
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:51,000
And nobody bothers to add the numbers up to determine it, since James Madison was the last person to survive.

561
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:57,400
Who was one of the 39 supposed signers on that document, and he died in 1836.

562
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:06,880
Nobody questions how can a document that was created 10 years after everyone who supposedly signed it was dead be anything but a forgery.

563
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:10,960
Okay.

564
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:22,010
Well, I mean, at that point, you get to call a Constitutional Convention, or the people get to come together to change their form of government.

565
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,010
And we believe that will probably be the ultimate end-all of this.

566
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,650
That's definitely going to have to be.

567
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:44,630
I don't really see any other way that we can really go forward and fix anything that we have right now.

568
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,130
Wouldn't you rather get large numbers of the American people on your side before you take that very drastic step?

569
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,630
Oh, sure. They're coming along.

570
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:02,950
You know, I believe that James Madison really had it together in his day.

571
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,610
And I'm hoping this one today, an ancestor will be able to do the same.

572
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,750
And I like to quote my forefather a lot.

573
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,210
And this one out of Federalist Number 14 is my favorite.

574
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:23,550
He says, Is it not the glory of the people of America that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations,

575
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,710
they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for customs, or for names,

576
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:35,630
to overrule the suggestion of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience?

577
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:45,930
Why do we believe in this nation today that these men who wrote this document and tried to bring this nation forward were something like gods,

578
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,770
and that there's no people in this country today that has the knowledge and wisdom and ability to go forward from where we are

579
00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:05,750
and create a form of government for this nation that can be successful using the information we've got off the last failed one that we can improve on and go forward?

580
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,010
I just don't understand it. Can you explain it?

581
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:15,870
Why are you making the assumption that everyone believes that they're deities and that nobody has the intelligence to go forward?

582
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,850
I don't know if anybody's actually said that.

583
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,970
Well, why is everybody stuck on the Constitution then?

584
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:34,010
Because if you try to do anything else directly, you're going to be waging war with people who have a lot of guns, a lot of jails, and a lot of other things that I don't think you're going to be successful going down that road.

585
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,170
That isn't currently going on?

586
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:52,230
Exactly. So why don't we use their own system against them, the one that they claim is in force and that we have the right to protections under, before we pull out the ultimate control alternate delete on the country?

587
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:00,730
Well, I must tell you I am very much approved of what you're trying to do, and I hope you're successful.

588
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,730
I have joined your site today, and we'll be keeping an eye on it, keeping track of it.

589
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:12,510
Hopefully I can help in some way, but like I said, I just think we need to go forward and take what we've learned.

590
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,210
The country needs something new. That's just what I believe.

591
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:33,150
The problem is, once you start tearing up what we have, there's not enough people in this country today that would get behind the fact and even know what the role of a government is.

592
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,550
Walk into a supermarket and ask the people standing in line, what's the function of government?

593
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:46,190
And if they don't say to protect rights, which they won't, then do you really want those people getting involved in trying to craft a new government?

594
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,110
I would answer to you, not no, but hell no. That would scare the hell out of me.

595
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:06,870
So at least if we try to show them that the Constitution is where we need to at least start out, and the Supreme Court says, screw you, we're not giving you that back, then we can have the conversation about where we go from there.

596
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,350
That's our view on it, and we may be wrong.

597
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:22,570
I appreciate that you feel that they're not going to tell you that, and if you feel that it's not a wasted effort to do that, I will support you in any way I can like I do anyone else.

598
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:26,170
I think as long as somebody's doing something that's better than what we've been doing, which is nothing.

599
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,410
So I support anyone and any effort they have, and I congratulate you on your idea. I think it's pretty sound.

600
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,230
So with that, I thank you for giving me your time, and I yield the floor.

601
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:47,850
I love a healthy debate, and you notice we did it civilly. Everyone kept their tongue, and that's really what we need more of.

602
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,630
That's the way we do it here.

603
00:39:50,630 --> 00:40:04,770
Yeah, James, if you're interested, the book that I'm referring to about the Constitution is called Secret Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

604
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:10,550
It was written by R. Yates, and it was published in 1804.

605
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,690
You can get a reprint of it from Omni Christian Book Club for $7.95.

606
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,490
I highly recommend it to you. I think you'll find it a very interesting reading.

607
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,810
Yeah, I don't remember exactly where I got it myself, but I downloaded it online somewhere.

608
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,690
I don't remember where, but you're right. It is a good reading.

609
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,970
Anyway, thank you for that.

610
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,630
You're welcome.

611
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,550
Thank you, James.

612
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,890
I'll be back in a minute.

613
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,790
Anybody else?

614
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,250
Yeah, we do. Hold on one second. I'm trying to unmute him.

615
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:56,530
Bassadar. There you go. Bassadar, B-A-S-S-A-D-A-R. Did you have a question?

616
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:04,550
Yeah, I wanted to ask the brothers if they were familiar with the Libra Code.

617
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:15,830
Very familiar with the Libra Code. Written by Abraham Lincoln's general, and it's still operational today.

618
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:28,510
Right. I think that it would be best if the brothers went about the situation in more of a forgiving manner.

619
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,190
Please explain. I'm not following quite yet.

620
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:44,890
Well, our Lord taught that we should be forgiving towards one another.

621
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,350
Okay.

622
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:54,030
And the key to rebuilding the problems that we face, especially the debts and the claims,

623
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,830
it's going back and forth, is forgiveness.

624
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:09,270
And the thing we're doing is really claiming property that doesn't belong to us as ours.

625
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:17,170
And we're making claims against an institution that has been set up for our protection.

626
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:26,130
So, the situation your brothers are in is a tough situation.

627
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:36,030
But I see that the best way to come out of the situation and have the federal government in your favor

628
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,890
is to render to them what's theirs.

629
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,950
And what would that be? Just so I'll follow. What should I render to them that's theirs?

630
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,830
Well, we could start with money.

631
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,850
Aren't they getting enough of that?

632
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:06,070
Well, they have to borrow it. It has to be borrowed into the economy or taxed from Peter to pay Paul.

633
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,710
But why is that the case now?

634
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,090
Because they're bankrupt. They have no money.

635
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,390
So when you cash your check, you get notes which are promises to pay money.

636
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,970
Right. We don't have a lawful monetary system. That's correct.

637
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,830
But we also have a system where we have gone into a socialist state.

638
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:34,810
And as we know, the government has taught people for ages that every democracy fails and turns violent

639
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,130
because you end up stealing from one group of people and giving to another.

640
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,330
Governments are instituted among to protect rights. That's it. That's the only legitimate function of a government.

641
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,230
If it starts taking money from one group of people and giving it to another,

642
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,550
you didn't have that power to give to the government when you loaned them your sovereignty to create a government.

643
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,430
You're not allowed to go out and steal from somebody. So how can a government do it?

644
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:07,670
And I don't know about you, but the government is only doing what it's authorized to do.

645
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,270
Is it? Is it authorized to steal from one group of people and give to another?

646
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,070
Is it authorized to take away your rights?

647
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,470
What is it stealing?

648
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:24,030
It's stealing my hard work, my children's future. It's stealing my rights.

649
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,010
It's stealing my property?

650
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,450
The concept of ownership is an illusion.

651
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:37,210
So your work doesn't belong to you. Your work belongs to who it's rendered to.

652
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,270
When did my work not become my own? When was it taken from me?

653
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:52,070
Because you did not create the talent for your work. The talent for your work was given to you as a blessing.

654
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,550
By whom?

655
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,730
The talent which you do your work with is a gift.

656
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,810
From whom? Who gave it to me?

657
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:01,230
Your creator.

658
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:08,210
Okay, and so if I don't preserve his blessings as my own, aren't I forsaking his gifts?

659
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,970
His blessings are not yours. His blessings belong to your brothers and sisters and your people.

660
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,710
Yeah, this sounds like a whole bunch of new age socialist mumbo-jumbo to be honest.

661
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,090
You know what, we're done with it because it's boring me.

662
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,310
We're going to move on. I'm sorry.

663
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,930
Bassadar, you find another talk show.

664
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:35,170
This is not your place to air your grievances. I'm sorry.

665
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,570
Okay, West Michigan, go ahead. Did you have a question?

666
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,150
I did. I had a couple of comments.

667
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,570
One comment I'll make real quick, I think you'll appreciate it.

668
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,330
Maybe you won't appreciate it. The battery on my cell phone died,

669
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:56,870
so fortunately I did not have the pleasure of listening to everything that the last gentleman said.

670
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,130
And having heard the last few words of it, I'm really, really pleased I didn't

671
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,610
because things like that raise my blood pressure.

672
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,150
On to the lawsuit that you mentioned.

673
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,710
You said earlier that, and one thing really, I'll say, threw me for a loop about it.

674
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,770
You said if you win the lawsuit, then they'll prove something.

675
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:25,690
But you said if they don't take the lawsuit, I think you said that's also a win?

676
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,290
Did I misread that? Or was I not paying close enough attention?

677
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,570
No, you heard that correctly.

678
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,630
First of all, keep in mind, we're not going up on appeal.

679
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,290
This is not a writ of certiorari.

680
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,390
This is not an original action.

681
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,810
So they can't say we're not going to hear it.

682
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,510
They cannot deny a cert or a writ.

683
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,130
So in essence, the case will be filed in the Supreme Court.

684
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,410
The defendants will be served.

685
00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:01,490
They can answer, they can do the 12B6s, although there's really not quite a 12B6 type motion under Supreme Court rules.

686
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,530
The federal rules of civil procedure are just guidelines.

687
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,270
They aren't necessarily hard and fast on the court.

688
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:18,510
So at that point, the Supreme Court can either grant the states or the feds motion to dismiss, which would mean they don't hear the case,

689
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,550
or the court on its own motion, of course, could dismiss the case.

690
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:34,630
Either one of those is a win for us, because as part of the public awareness and education campaign we're trying to mount, we're getting good support on,

691
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:46,270
the American people are going to see that all we're asking for in the case are rights back, rights to be upheld and protected by the states and the federal government,

692
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:52,430
the law to be upheld the way the Supreme Court has already ruled that it works.

693
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:00,890
And so at the end of the day, if the Supreme Court says we're not touching this case, we're not going to rule out, we're going to dismiss it, we're going to try to make it go away,

694
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:08,390
that is tantamount to holding a mirror up to them and them basically having to say it's over.

695
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:16,810
There is no law, there is no remedy, we are no longer a republic that protects rights, we are a fascist state.

696
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:28,270
So by getting that opened and aired once and for all in front of the psyche of the American people, then it comes down to where do we go from there?

697
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,230
We have a choice to make.

698
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:37,930
The Declaration of Independence says we have the right and the duty to abolish or amend our form of government when it becomes destructive of our rights.

699
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,300
So at least that will be settled once and for all in that the Supreme Court, which of course all the Supreme Court justices pay income tax,

700
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,960
all of them have a built in conflict of interest simply trying to hear this case and we point that out to them.

701
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,240
We're not naive about what we're going up against.

702
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:03,000
But the question we have to ask is if not now then when and if not us then who?

703
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:16,600
You might also let the people know that this is the first time since 1835 that a case has been brought to the Supreme Court in original jurisdiction.

704
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,770
Here's the thing with that though, when you go ahead and, I didn't know it was only the second time,

705
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,470
I thought there were more cases that have been brought there in original jurisdiction.

706
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:37,730
First of all, I've done some research on judicial disqualification and essentially if all the judges would be disqualified for the same reason,

707
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,570
in this case the income tax issue, then none of them are disqualified based on that issue.

708
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,930
We're not trying to disqualify them.

709
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,950
We are not trying to disqualify them.

710
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,590
We're basically saying look, we know who you are.

711
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,170
We know the disabilities that you're operating under.

712
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,810
Now what do you want to do about it?

713
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,770
Do you want to uphold the law?

714
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:03,430
Do you want to give the people a remedy which is what you owe them, which is what we're supposed to get?

715
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,090
If you don't, that's fine.

716
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,650
Just let us know.

717
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,550
Yeah, just let us know because then we know what we have to do.

718
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:22,160
And then we can start a whole new discussion about either constitutional conventions or a simple meeting of the people to get together to say,

719
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,620
control, alternate, delete.

720
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,900
We're going to reboot this puppy.

721
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:34,880
But keep in mind, there are some people who are on our side, Congress creators, there are judges.

722
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,720
These people have a pulse.

723
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:46,920
These people can see this government is headed for absolute bankruptcy and that if we don't do something, it's over in every way you can possibly imagine.

724
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,960
So I'm not writing them off completely yet.

725
00:50:53,450 --> 00:51:01,010
You said the sample copy of this lawsuit is at USAV as in Victor.me?

726
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:02,290
Yes, sir.

727
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,150
Okay.

728
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,430
Right across the top on the options are the lawsuit.

729
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,510
And if you scroll down through, you'll find another link to it.

730
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:12,770
Okay.

731
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:19,410
I just look at this, I've got way too much of a familiarity with the courts.

732
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:24,890
And I know that if they don't want to hear something, I know how they're capable of punting an issue.

733
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:35,070
And the first thing that comes to mind is a character out of California that sued because the word God was in the Pledge of Allegiance,

734
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:40,250
and he didn't think his daughter had to recite that because he was an atheist.

735
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,330
His mother, his ex-wife wasn't, but he was.

736
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,250
He didn't want his daughter having to recite the word God in class.

737
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,150
So it gets all the way up to the Supreme Court.

738
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,650
They looked at it, and they said, wait a minute.

739
00:51:54,270 --> 00:52:02,410
You don't have standing to bring this because you're not the girl's custodian, guardian, what have you.

740
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,850
So since you didn't have standing to bring this, we're not going to hear it.

741
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,050
And I thought to myself, why did you even take it?

742
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:15,190
Why did it get to the point where you even said you were going to take it

743
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,930
and then come up with a jurisdiction issue when you could have threw it out on the jurisdiction issue a lot earlier?

744
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,170
There's a big difference.

745
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:31,290
If they didn't grant the cert where they weren't going to hear it at all, then the lower court's ruling would stand.

746
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:38,170
By doing what they did, they overturned the entire case, the entire ruling, everything went away.

747
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,190
It's a huge difference.

748
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,390
Well, that's true.

749
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:48,590
Okay, and so like I say, if you want to talk about someone who knows these courts, in our criminal trial,

750
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:55,970
we put the evidence in front of the judge that he was not an Article III judge, that it wasn't an Article III court.

751
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:03,950
He perjured himself from the bench and said, I am an Article III judge, and this is an Article III court.

752
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:15,250
But he never would answer the question, have you taken the Article III oath of office prescribed in Ronstadt 73?

753
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,110
I asked him three times, and he never would answer me.

754
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,230
We caught him on a lot of stuff.

755
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,930
So you're preaching to the choir when you talk about not trusting these courts.

756
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:39,510
But the point is that until we the people go to the final authority on the rule of law in this country,

757
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:46,630
and right now under the Constitution and all the other games you want to play, it is the Supreme Court.

758
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,850
They are the ones charged with the responsibility for protecting the people.

759
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,950
They're the final say.

760
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,870
Okay, if you read the lawsuit, and I implore you to do so, we are coming in in law.

761
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,890
We're not playing – people are – you didn't say these particular words, and you didn't –

762
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,570
look, we're not playing any games here.

763
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:11,130
We're coming in in law. We're stating our jurisdiction as plainly as it can possibly be stated.

764
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:18,590
We're not playing any games with commerce and de jure versus de facto.

765
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:22,690
We're using the Supreme Court words, which are body politic and body corporate.

766
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,150
And by the way, folks, there is nothing wrong with the corporate.

767
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,550
There is always a body corporate and a body politic.

768
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,110
The people are the body politic.

769
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,110
The government functions through the body corporate.

770
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,670
That's how it builds roads.

771
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,630
That's how it signs contracts with vendors.

772
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:45,410
That's how it negotiates with foreign powers is through the corporate form.

773
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,630
That's not a problem.

774
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,090
Get over it, okay?

775
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:57,670
But when the body corporate claims jurisdiction over the body politic, now you have a problem.

776
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,390
Okay, so what we're trying to do is educate people on what the real problem is,

777
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:08,610
the way governments are really set up, and so we're going real law into this case,

778
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:13,610
no shenanigans, no games being played, and it's straight up.

779
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,090
Supreme Court, shit or get off the pot.

780
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:21,290
Pardon my French, but that's the way it is because we're done.

781
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:21,990
This is it.

782
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,410
Either you do the right thing here or it's over.

783
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,630
Yep.

784
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:37,810
Also, for your information, we have stated in the complaint that all legal terms are as defined

785
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:43,570
in Black's Fourth Dictionary and anything which is not defined in Black's Fourth

786
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:49,470
in the definition in Webster's original 18, what is it, 29, 28?

787
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:55,670
Actually, the legal dictionary reference is Beauvier's, 1854 or whatever it is.

788
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,650
Oh, did we change that?

789
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,830
Yep, that's back to Beauvier's original.

790
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,230
Okay.

791
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:03,670
That is what the Supreme Court said is the controlling definition of words.

792
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,470
Okay.

793
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:11,930
Anyway, we have told the court what we're using as the definition of the words in this filing

794
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:17,130
so there can be no confusion, no argument, no playing of games, period.

795
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,330
I'm looking at it now.

796
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,430
You've got it spelled out pretty good.

797
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,700
That's all we ask is people give it a fair shake, take the time to read it.

798
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,860
It reads pretty easily.

799
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,520
And, you know, if you like what you see, become a plaintiff.

800
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,360
Okay.

801
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,580
Join in.

802
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,740
Let the world know that you want to take a stand for the right reasons.

803
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,080
And, you know, we've talked about this.

804
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,680
We aren't a bunch of – all we want is equal protection.

805
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,380
We want equality under the law because that's what we've all been promised.

806
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,780
Under any form of law you can mention, either the Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, whatever,

807
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,280
John Locke and international law, I mean, it all follows.

808
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,780
And so this is it.

809
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,900
We want the whole country to get on board.

810
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,300
Even after we file, we're going to have, as the press, you know, as the word of this spreads,

811
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:23,520
you're going to be able to sign up as a plaintiff later, probably every 30 to 45 days.

812
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,220
We're going to do a motion to add plaintiffs.

813
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,300
We hope to get 10,000, 100,000, 500,000 plaintiffs on this thing.

814
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:32,560
Wow.

815
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,700
Whatever we can get, we're going in with it.

816
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,400
Now, you don't have any attorneys involved in this, right?

817
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,820
Not a single bar card to be found, high or low.

818
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,120
Okay.

819
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,100
Well, well, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

820
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,320
We do not have bar cards directly involved.

821
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:59,080
What we do have is we have some resources who are bar cards who have looked at this and gone, wow.

822
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,330
Yeah, but there's no bar cards involved in the litigation at all.

823
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,130
Exactly.

824
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:17,470
But we are utilizing all the resources that we can get our hands on to make sure this thing is right the moment it's filed.

825
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,250
Well, exactly.

826
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:30,610
Once it's filed, now you're saying for you want at least one person from each of the 50 states to go ahead and be involved in this.

827
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:36,090
Does that, let's say, in other words, you're not going to, if you only get 45, you're not going to file it.

828
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,930
You're going to wait until you get the other fives.

829
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,910
You've got one from each state, and then everybody's represented in it.

830
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:43,810
Right.

831
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,910
Every state will have standing.

832
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:50,890
See, some of the relief we're seeking, the federal government can't give us.

833
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:55,490
Okay, the states are denying their Milne duties to the people.

834
00:58:55,870 --> 00:59:00,530
And so we want relief against the state, and therefore we have to sue the states.

835
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:01,250
Yeah.

836
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:13,190
Now, if you don't know what a Milne duty is, there was a Supreme Court case from 1837 called New York v. Milne.

837
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:20,950
If you would like to read that case, it's on my website, freedomrequireswork.org.

838
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,570
Just go on the public access side.

839
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,070
On the next page, go to court cases.

840
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:33,010
And then there is a link to the Supreme Court posting of the case.

841
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:44,650
But there is also a teaching synopsis from one of the law universities on how Milne duties are taught to law students.

842
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:54,190
The teaching syllabus is actually shorter than reading the case, so you might want to read it first before you read the case.

843
00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:03,110
But if you didn't get that, it's www.freedomrequireswork.org.

844
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:05,530
It's a .org, I'm not commercial.

845
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:12,930
There's a number of other things up there that may be of interest to you.

846
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,670
There's a copy of Black's Fourth Law Dictionary.

847
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:26,450
There's a little booklet that's only 12 pages, which lists all of the major Supreme Court cases,

848
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:34,190
which state that you can be a state citizen without being a United States citizen.

849
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:38,890
You are an American national, but you are not a U.S. citizen.

850
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:49,510
There are a number of things up there, legal-wise, that hopefully people will find helpful in broadening their understanding.

851
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:57,270
I'm scanning this. You've done a very thorough, good job on this lawsuit.

852
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:07,830
We've got a whole lot of people involved, and some of them are quite high-powered.

853
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:19,870
I can't reveal certain things, but let's just say there's one bar card who has been in an extremely high place in our government

854
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:24,130
who has taken a look at it and went, yep, that looks pretty good.

855
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,570
Just a suggestion, I don't know if you've thought about this.

856
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,510
I would make sure, obviously, you get one person from each state,

857
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:38,550
but I would not keep loading this thing up with people, because otherwise you're going to get more confusion than you want.

858
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,070
You've got to get people you can work together with and not have a bunch of confusion.

859
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:53,110
Actually, that's not a problem, because basically everyone who becomes a plaintiff will be signing a power of attorney,

860
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:03,410
or put in other words, we will be the lead plaintiff in this, myself and basically one other gentleman.

861
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:11,090
We also are having people sign what we're calling the rules of engagement, which is you do not speak publicly about it.

862
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:16,870
You don't go to the press, because they're going to be looking for weak links.

863
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:23,610
We know that every potential plaintiff is a potential weak link for them to exploit.

864
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:30,330
You're also going to have to fill out a questionnaire about what felonies you have on your record,

865
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,450
what you currently have going on with the government.

866
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:39,210
We're vetting very carefully, because we know they're going to have to attack this other than legally.

867
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:47,170
They're going to have to attack this any way they can to make us look like a bunch of raving lunatics.

868
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:53,750
By the way, that is the way the government now speaks of us in reference to our criminal case.

869
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,710
I had a friend call me just this week. He went and picked up the last of his stuff from the FBI.

870
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,130
He said, well, I guess I should have pled not guilty, because he pled guilty.

871
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,110
Then he went to trial, and he said, oh, you would have been found guilty.

872
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:14,870
Those other guys, they were just buffoons. The jury felt sorry for them, and all that kind of stuff.

873
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:20,110
We know they're a bag of tricks. You all have seen them. If you've been in court, you know what kind of games they play.

874
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:30,530
We're trying to do this in a way that ensures the highest level of either win rate or at least control over this thing,

875
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:35,670
so it can be about the issues and not about whatever they try to make it about.

876
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:44,110
Was that it for you, Matt? I had to mute you out, because there was background noise. Do you have anything else?

877
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:49,950
No, I've all said that. I think you've done a really, really good job on this, and I wish you success.

878
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:56,270
Certainly, you've touched on really good substantive issues in here that most people can sink their teeth into.

879
01:03:56,270 --> 01:04:02,070
Most people understand what they are, and I think that's definitely a direction we need to go,

880
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:09,950
because somebody has to jar these people psychologically into doing the right thing.

881
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,930
I think things have just gotten to a point in this country to where it's beyond what anybody ever thought they would be.

882
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:22,910
Maybe not everybody. A lot of people knew this was coming, but now it's like, okay, let's try to turn this thing back before it's too late.

883
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:29,870
This is certainly a step in the right direction. Thank you for answering my questions.

884
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,030
Thank you, Matt.

885
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:39,510
Thank you for coming on. Always a good participant. Let's move on, though. We have several more.

886
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,730
Anna88Bell, go ahead. Did you have a question for our gentleman?

887
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,610
No, my questions have been answered. Thank you much. Appreciate it.

888
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,170
Okay. Thank you.

889
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,530
Hey, I like those deep ones.

890
01:04:54,150 --> 01:05:06,470
Yeah. All right. Arizona, did you have a question? Go ahead, Arizona. Maybe you have to unmute your phone.

891
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,150
I unmuted you on this end, but did you have a question?

892
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,130
Angela, it's Jon Stewart. How are you?

893
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,290
Hi. Hi, Jon. How are you?

894
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,510
Hello, Ed and Lewis. How are you guys?

895
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,990
Oh, we're doing pretty good. Thank you.

896
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:26,110
Yeah, I've read your documents. I'm quite impressed with them.

897
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:37,290
I have a caveat that – I've been doing this for a long time, too, and ran into my share of problems.

898
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:51,210
The issue seems to be not only the corruptness of the individuals that are in the government, but we have a major issue with our people in as much as –

899
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:57,650
I no longer believe that that many people really want this to be a republic.

900
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:09,930
I deal with a lot of different groups. As a matter of fact, I have to go speak to literally a seminar full of nothing but attorneys this weekend.

901
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:25,030
So the system seems to have created a scenario where the more corrupt it is, the more the people that are in charge can make money.

902
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:36,730
But then the other side of that, the slaves, the people walking around that like the crap that's going on, get to be taken care of better with doing less effort.

903
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:44,170
And the numbers are – it's just phenomenal. I mean –

904
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,570
Well, you said you read the lawsuit, right?

905
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:48,830
Yes.

906
01:06:49,430 --> 01:07:01,750
Okay. Then you know that the lawsuit itself is not about taking anything away from anybody, although we know that Social Security is illegal, etc., etc.

907
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:10,670
The issue is can they force those of us who don't want to participate into the slavery and peonage and force us to do that?

908
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:21,490
And that's really the crux of it is if somebody wants to get in bed with the government extra constitutionally –

909
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,910
I'm not going to call it unconstitutional, but it's outside the provisions of the Constitution.

910
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:37,330
If you want to go play with those benefits and you think that the government can provide you those benefits better than a private retirement program or whatever, that's fine.

911
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:44,030
By all means, have a ball. I think their track record shows they've been absolutely lousy at managing that particular thing.

912
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:47,970
But the point is if I don't want to participate, can you force me to?

913
01:07:47,970 --> 01:08:02,150
And oh, by the way, Mr. State, North Carolina, California, wherever you might be, I'm going to hold you to your duty to protect me from all invaders, foreign and domestic, and that includes the United States government.

914
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:04,310
Okay?

915
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:10,910
Part of what the states are supposed to do is protect us from the overreaches by the federal government, not try and profit by it.

916
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:18,310
Well, and I noticed that in your suit it's very repetitive about the FSA contract.

917
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:24,410
And I've been – I'm totally with you on that. I agree 100%.

918
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:39,770
What I see that the average person kind of just going through their life with the blinders on is they are repetitively asked what their Social Security number is.

919
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:46,310
And you see it on forms, applications, licenses, your Social Security number.

920
01:08:46,850 --> 01:09:01,529
That in and of itself is fraud because it's not physically possible in or outside of law, whether we're talking about the body politic or the body corporate, for an individual to have a number.

921
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,850
The number is owned by the agency. It's just like you don't have a bank account.

922
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:12,890
Well, actually, let me correct you. It is absolutely possible, but you better be a federal employee if you have that number.

923
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:21,870
Oh, but the number is still possessed by – it's just an acknowledgment of the contract. You are not in possession of that number.

924
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,170
Social Security is not a contract. Don't use that word, please.

925
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:32,390
Okay. Well, without delving into the intricacies, I don't know how else you would explain it to the average person.

926
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,750
It's a franchise agreement.

927
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,050
Okay. Absolutely it is.

928
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,229
That's what it is. It's a franchise agreement.

929
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:38,430
And that's what gets everybody.

930
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,990
And you're not allowed to participate in that franchise unless you are a federal employee.

931
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:51,170
And by doing so, you're actually committing a crime if you're not a federal employee and you go around saying you do have one number.

932
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:52,510
Absolutely.

933
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,210
Well, therein lies the problem.

934
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,430
Why is that a problem?

935
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,190
Because people don't get that.

936
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:08,670
It's no different than filling out the so-called tax forms, which are really nothing more than a return.

937
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:15,830
A federal employee is supposed to return part of what he's paid to whoever it is that truly pays him.

938
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:22,750
Now, the issue is that people look at that, and they believe it is their number.

939
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:32,390
Most people, at least my age and older, never really did volunteer, and the younger people.

940
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:39,570
I mean most people are getting their social security numbers while they're too young to be franchised into anything anyways.

941
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:41,850
Agreed.

942
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:46,850
But I mean all they have to do is flip over the card and look and see that it says property of the SSA.

943
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:58,270
But as maybe destructive as being naive about whose number it is, the real issue is what does it do to you?

944
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:03,110
What happens because you use that franchise agreement?

945
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:10,990
And of course the answer is you become subject to all kinds of federal taxes, all kinds of federal jurisdictions.

946
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:19,510
I mean Supreme Court up through 2006, which is the last time I've looked, has said Congress cannot legislate for the internal affairs of the people of the states.

947
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,930
Why is everybody all upset about Obamacare?

948
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:29,830
I mean they told you it was only for federal employees because who was going to be the enforcement arm on Obamacare?

949
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,470
The IRS.

950
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:46,310
And the point being that people constantly reiterate that franchise better than contract, but they reiterate the fact that they want to be involved in it somehow.

951
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,510
Fine. Let them.

952
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:02,070
Right.

953
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:10,530
And the government can only use money that they do not bring in from taxes to pay that office.

954
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,850
By the way, that's going to kill it right there.

955
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:22,330
Because if only those people who are going to someday collect it are the ones paying in, and they can't use tax money to distribute that money, the system's doomed.

956
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:48,200
Oh, yeah. I think that's where if you were to wake the average person up to the fact that most of this stems from that sort of, whether it be a tacit or purposeful agreement, if they had a way to walk out of it, they would.

957
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:56,980
You know, there was some guy earlier that was claiming this was all voluntary. You volunteer yourself into prison. You volunteer yourself into jail. You volunteer into that.

958
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:04,280
That's not true. Those of us that have been in my situation is not unlike what you guys experienced.

959
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,020
In some ways, yours was worse. In some ways, mine was much worse.

960
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:15,460
I didn't volunteer for any of it. They got me at the point of, you know, 12 guys with machine guns.

961
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,920
That's what we had. I had M-16s pointed at me.

962
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,040
I was a little more fortunate.

963
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:28,840
But let's talk about who the audience for this lawsuit is, okay? And I'm sorry, what was your name?

964
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,400
Jon Stewart.

965
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:37,300
Jon. Okay, Jon. Let's talk about the audience for this suit, because really what you're talking about is we have a product.

966
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,300
The product is called a Supreme Court lawsuit.

967
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,780
Now, who is our consumer, right? Who is our user? Who is our target audience?

968
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,520
And we, to be honest, it's not patriots.

969
01:13:51,600 --> 01:14:00,740
Most patriots are so invested in the stuff that they have learned, and you would not believe the emails I get from patriots.

970
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,540
Yeah, me too.

971
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:10,340
Our audience is not patriots. We can't teach them anything. They know everything. Just ask them. They'll tell you.

972
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:18,040
Our audience is not the 50 to 55 percent of the country who currently is on the government dole.

973
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,880
Because guess what? They've already figured out they can vote themselves largest from the public trough,

974
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,240
and they're going to keep voting themselves as much largest as they can possibly get.

975
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,320
So they're not going to be interested in this lawsuit. They're not interested in freedom.

976
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,100
Okay?

977
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:42,920
Our audience is that 30 percent or so of the country who became politically aware in the last election cycle.

978
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,240
Maybe they went to a Tea Party rally.

979
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,320
Maybe they read something outside the mainstream media,

980
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:54,900
or they're just flat out concerned and scared about the path the country is on.

981
01:14:54,900 --> 01:15:01,360
I can't tell you right now, because I'm sworn to secrecy,

982
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:10,460
some of the groups that we have been given permission to do email alerts to their lists.

983
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,840
One of them has 16 million members.

984
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,390
Wow.

985
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,530
Another one has 5.5 million members.

986
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,330
Okay?

987
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:26,190
We're talking to the NFIB, National Federation of Independent Businesses.

988
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,970
They are going to take a lawsuit.

989
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:34,790
Their legal people are going to analyze it and tell their membership what they think about it.

990
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:44,110
They were one of the ones who sued over Obamacare in the Florida federal courts.

991
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:45,450
Okay?

992
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:49,930
So there's a lot of potential support for this.

993
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:54,970
What we basically found, and Lewis heard this even more so than I did,

994
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,490
but people said, look, I need to read the suit.

995
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,690
So last week we released it out into the wild.

996
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:04,810
The response has been amazing.

997
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,950
It is very well written.

998
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:21,310
You bring up one thing in the suit and in the discussion that I think is very powerful.

999
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:27,430
In talking about the patriots, they are so lost, and it's probably the biggest confusing factor,

1000
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:32,030
and that is what a body politic is and what a body corporate is.

1001
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,790
And hearing you speak when you said that the body corporate is really not a bad thing,

1002
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:43,430
it has to be used, and the whole patriot phenomenon,

1003
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:50,590
it's almost insidious the way that one concept has pervaded into the patriot network

1004
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:52,650
to the point where people don't understand it.

1005
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:56,450
They don't understand the separation, what the two differences are.

1006
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:03,010
And I think this is going to help clear that up, but nothing more than –

1007
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:06,970
see, the patriot community scares me more than the government at this point.

1008
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:09,410
You've got these guys like Kenneth Turner.

1009
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,810
Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1010
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:15,190
Yes, yes, we're on the same page. We agree.

1011
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,650
These guys scare the shit out of me.

1012
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:22,630
I mean, all of a sudden they're going to do something stupid, and I've already seen them.

1013
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:27,890
His – Turner's mistress is trying to get me killed right now and has been for a while.

1014
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:35,350
And these people are just – they're going to do something stupid and violent

1015
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:43,510
and give the so-called body corporate the position where they're going to be able to move in and do stupid shit too.

1016
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:48,850
And people are going to side with the body corporate against its own body politic and the people.

1017
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,610
I think they're much more dangerous than the government.

1018
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,170
Well, I'll tell you what, it's neck and neck.

1019
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:59,990
I mean, I have a hard time deciding which side of the coin to come down on.

1020
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:06,030
But we have lost a number of plaintiffs because I expressed my opinion about Tim Turner.

1021
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,350
And these people thought that we're lunatics.

1022
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,670
We've been attacked by L.B. Bork.

1023
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:16,190
So I lost a plaintiff because he listened to L.B. Bork and his 14th Amendment crap.

1024
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:18,350
But I don't care.

1025
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,850
We are going to be attacked.

1026
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:25,630
We are going to be excoriated on every level that they can think of,

1027
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:29,490
whether it be the government or the patriot segment of society.

1028
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:34,510
All I can say is if you can think of a better way to put this,

1029
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:38,690
if you're doing what you think is going to be best for our country, then do it.

1030
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:48,310
But don't tell me that I can't do what I believe and try and get it organized to bring people in

1031
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:52,010
when we're running out of time, folks.

1032
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,770
Time is short for this country.

1033
01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:01,030
If we don't do something fast, the police state is going to be irreversible.

1034
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:07,350
We are going to be in the next World War because that's what they're setting up with these African countries

1035
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,030
and militant countries they're attacking.

1036
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,770
We are 1930s Germany right now.

1037
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,240
I didn't know better.

1038
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,800
I thought I was listening to me.

1039
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,200
Well, good.

1040
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,840
Then we're on the same page.

1041
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:26,640
I don't want to tie up any more time because I'm sure there's probably a line of people who want to talk to you guys.

1042
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,940
Just real quick.

1043
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:34,740
First of all, for those of the people that are listening, you guys have 100% of my endorsement.

1044
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,100
Send an email to ed at usav.me and make yourself a lawsuit.

1045
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:45,800
Send me your street address and a phone number and I'll put you on the list.

1046
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,040
You can always back out up until you sign the agreement.

1047
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:54,180
But show your support by signing up to the plaintiff.

1048
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:59,400
Well, and I don't really have much money because I myself live off donations.

1049
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,540
We're not asking for money.

1050
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,480
No, I know it is required.

1051
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,500
Well, but we're not asking for money from you.

1052
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,660
If those who sign up can make a $100 donation to help offset copying.

1053
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,180
Remember, we've got to serve every state in the union, two parties.

1054
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,980
We've got to serve the Attorney General and the Governor of each state.

1055
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,920
And so they are expensive.

1056
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,640
But you do not have to contribute to be a plaintiff.

1057
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,140
We want your mind and your body first and foremost.

1058
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,200
We want your participation.

1059
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:38,600
So don't let that be a reason not to join and be a part of this.

1060
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,160
You've definitely got that.

1061
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:45,740
I can tell you that in some cases you may not have to serve documents.

1062
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:50,700
In some of them you can actually serve CDs which can save a tremendous amount of money.

1063
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,240
I mean, that's going to be pursuant to the state rules of acceptance.

1064
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:56,560
Go read the Supreme Court rules initially.

1065
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,400
The lawsuit in paper form will be served on them with a summons.

1066
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:05,420
You know, standard legal procedure basically.

1067
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:10,120
But the point is that, yes, there's going to be a lot of work to be done.

1068
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:16,220
We're going to be bombarded with answers to the lawsuit from 50 states.

1069
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:20,420
And, of course, the United States, which is no small undertaking.

1070
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,540
But we're in this.

1071
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,320
And this is what has to be done.

1072
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,460
And if someone has a better idea, we're willing to listen.

1073
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,260
But in the meantime, get on board.

1074
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:38,080
Well, I am, and I'll let the people that know of me know how I feel about it.

1075
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,900
One final question, and then I'll let everybody else have their turn.

1076
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:50,240
The Treaty of Paris, do you guys have anything to do with that?

1077
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,500
What's your opinion on that?

1078
01:21:51,560 --> 01:22:00,780
I'd like to get your take on the whole Treaty of Paris between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and how that falls into the fold.

1079
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,080
Can I take that one?

1080
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,100
Yeah, yeah, I'll take that one.

1081
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,380
Have you ever seen the original documents?

1082
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:18,680
I've seen supposed pictures, but, you know, I trust pictures as much as I trust one of my actual eyes, you know.

1083
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:25,440
Okay, the reason I ask the question, how did the King of England sign the Treaty of Peace?

1084
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:31,430
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know.

1085
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,150
Don't quote his signature.

1086
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:36,690
Okay, I will tell you, he signed it.

1087
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:43,050
Prince George, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, King of England.

1088
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,920
If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know, I don't know what will.

1089
01:22:53,580 --> 01:23:01,000
Oh, I know where you're going on. Okay, I didn't know you got into that. Oh, I agree completely. I know and understand and believe.

1090
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,080
Okay, well, fill me in. What? What?

1091
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,440
Okay.

1092
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,440
For those of us that don't get it.

1093
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:08,660
Do you really want to know this?

1094
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,480
Yeah.

1095
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:22,060
Well, I'm going to lay a couple of other things out there that you don't know, because unless you had had personal contact with a small group of people in British Columbia, you couldn't possibly know this.

1096
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,280
But let me, let me, you just, I'll give you a thumbnail sketch and then I'll go into the other.

1097
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,860
Okay, the signature indicates that the King of England was subservient to the Vatican.

1098
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:47,980
As were 10 European nations at the time, all of the kings of France and Spain and Italy and Greece, they all signed their legal documents, King of blah, blah, blah.

1099
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,540
But above that, they put Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

1100
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,300
Now, I'm going to drop a bombshell on you.

1101
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:23,780
There is a band of Native Americans in British Columbia who have a treaty, which was signed in 1655, which gives them sovereign authority all over all of North America from the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico to the North Pole.

1102
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:45,380
In commemorating that treaty, Queen Victoria presented the chief of the tribe with a royal staff, which is, it looks to be about 18 carat gold.

1103
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:58,320
She also presented him with a gold medallion, which is about four inches in diameter, which has her likeness on it.

1104
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:07,300
But that treaty is also signed by the Pope, and the Pope issued a gold medallion, also about four inches in diameter.

1105
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:15,790
So, all of that predates everything else.

1106
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:28,210
Part of that treaty says that any point in time the Europeans become a problem, these Native Americans have the right to throw them out of the country.

1107
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:41,370
That treaty was reaffirmed in 1835, and was reaffirmed by both England and the Vatican in 2003.

1108
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,750
How's that for a bombshell?

1109
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,780
Is that that Turtle Island group?

1110
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,600
No, ma'am.

1111
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:58,100
No, ma'am. This is a group you have probably never heard of.

1112
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:12,100
The National Confederated Tribe spokesman is a gentleman, I will pronounce his name as best I can, because I can't quite master the native tongue.

1113
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,700
It's Max Juan.

1114
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:27,300
There have been things happen all over Canada and the United States that have taken a different path because he stepped in and invoked the treaty.

1115
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:36,000
It's quite interesting. I had the privilege of meeting the man five years ago.

1116
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,580
What kind of an effect does it have on the United States?

1117
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:47,140
Well, the effect is that we are operating at their pleasure.

1118
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:56,120
And if we ever become a big enough problem, they have the right to throw us out.

1119
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,880
Because their treaty predates anything and everything we've done.

1120
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,920
It's a chartered treaty, and it's perpetual.

1121
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:21,170
But I just thought I'd share that little tidbit with you as kind of an off-course diversion.

1122
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:28,010
Okay. Alrighty. So that doesn't have anything to do with what John was talking about, though.

1123
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:36,950
Well, in a way it does, because everything ultimately boils down to treaties.

1124
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:45,030
And we have ignored treaties that have been in place since before this country came into being.

1125
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:50,170
Are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Sherwood Rodriguez?

1126
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:52,230
It's a Portuguese spelling, I think.

1127
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,110
Yes, I am.

1128
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:58,070
Okay. You know that he went to the Supreme Court in 1982,

1129
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:04,270
and the Supreme Court declared that Skagit County and Whatcom County of Washington State

1130
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:12,150
are not in federal jurisdiction for those who avail themselves of the original charter of the Hudson Bay Company.

1131
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:21,800
Okay. I haven't seen it. Have you seen that case?

1132
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,240
Yes, I have.

1133
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:27,360
Okay. Where can I see it?

1134
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:33,440
Well, unless you can find a printed copy somewhere, you're not going to.

1135
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,220
I read Sherwood's copy.

1136
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,340
If you do a search on it in the Supreme Court, it doesn't even come up.

1137
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,600
They buried it a long time ago.

1138
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,800
Gosh, why doesn't he scan it in so we all can take a gander at it?

1139
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,760
Well, you've got to realize that Sherwood is 80-something years old now.

1140
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,020
Yeah, but he's had it an awfully long time, hasn't he?

1141
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,500
Oh, yeah.

1142
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,440
I've been hearing about it for at least six years, seven years.

1143
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:11,400
Yeah. Well, I had the pleasure of meeting him about 2002, 2003, somewhere back in there.

1144
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:14,440
And I got to read the case then.

1145
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,860
Geez. I wish you would have scanned it in.

1146
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:23,020
Well, back then I didn't have a scanner. Sorry.

1147
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,140
Oh, well.

1148
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:36,200
All this modern technology that we take for granted today existed 10 years ago.

1149
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,020
You know, I'm still running...

1150
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:40,760
Yeah, I do.

1151
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,860
Oh, never mind. I'm running ancient technology here.

1152
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,780
It's okay. I was using it.

1153
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,500
But anyway, was there anything else, John?

1154
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:55,900
Did you have anything else to ask or conclude?

1155
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,000
No, just really the whole take on the Treaty of Paris thing.

1156
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:07,120
I mean, we got a little off track on it, but I understand greatly what you're talking about.

1157
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,780
I'm sorry about that, but I just thought I would...

1158
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,080
You seem such a knowledgeable individual. I thought you would appreciate that little bit of information.

1159
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,660
Oh, yeah, I greatly do.

1160
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,700
See, I've been doing this a real long time, and I've got to meet quite a few interesting people.

1161
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:30,520
And the issue I have in dealing with the general people is they really don't get how everything is tied together.

1162
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,300
And yes, it's all tied through treaties.

1163
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:41,220
I mean, you get these nutbags like Turner and his groups talking about the corporation and talking about the Constitution,

1164
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:47,400
and they've never even heard of the Treaty of Paris and how it affects everything.

1165
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,860
Yeah, well, he needs to go to Independence Hall in Philadelphia and take a look at it.

1166
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,940
Well, I think he needs to go there.

1167
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,580
I think it's still there. I'm not sure. That's where it was when I saw it.

1168
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:06,800
For the gentlemen, so they know, John has a call every Sunday on talk show,

1169
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:14,840
and John covers the foreclosure fraud and the mortgage fraud, and so he's quite knowledgeable.

1170
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:22,460
John, would you get a hold of me? I've got some information you might find useful in that area.

1171
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,300
Sure, sure. How do I do that?

1172
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:33,460
You can just send me an email, John, and I'll forward it to him.

1173
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:44,840
Yeah, I've got some stuff that was just filed in the Washington State Supreme Court relative to foreclosure fraud that I think you might find useful.

1174
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:51,220
Boy, I appreciate that. I mean, I disperse a lot of information.

1175
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:57,980
We actually win quite a few cases, and like you guys, we're not in it for the money.

1176
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,600
We're just trying to save people. I mean, I literally have it broken.

1177
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,400
Exactly, exactly.

1178
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,180
The point where I hate money is it makes people do stupid shit every day.

1179
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,860
That's disgusting.

1180
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:17,400
Yeah, in fact, get an email to me, and I'll give you my private contact info,

1181
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,280
and I think we can have a couple of interesting conversations.

1182
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,500
Oh, I appreciate that greatly.

1183
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:28,180
Louis, if you want, I can just, well, well, go ahead. I'm sorry.

1184
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah, Angela, just when you get a minute, send me over his email, or send him my email, or both at the same time.

1185
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,040
Yeah, either one or all of them.

1186
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,300
I can send him your number, John. How's that?

1187
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,840
Yeah, that's great, too.

1188
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:41,800
Okay.

1189
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:42,240
Okay.

1190
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,060
And we'll touch base, and I really appreciate it.

1191
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:52,140
I'm taking up a lot of your time, and I know a lot of people are just hammering to talk to you guys, so I appreciate it.

1192
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,220
I'm on your guys' side.

1193
01:32:54,700 --> 01:33:01,520
I probably agree with everything you guys believe and teach, and I've got time.

1194
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,160
Well, there's something wrong with you, then.

1195
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:06,540
You better go take a couple aspirin and call us tomorrow.

1196
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:11,100
Oh, there's all kinds of things wrong with me, and I've got people who'll tell you what they are.

1197
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,580
All right, John.

1198
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,240
Hey, appreciate talking to you.

1199
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,760
Thanks for coming on, John.

1200
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,000
Anybody else have a question?

1201
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,120
Press star 8.

1202
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:27,980
Angela, can you ask the name of the Indians again?

1203
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,940
Oh, what's the name of the tribe?

1204
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,000
You didn't mention the name, actually.

1205
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,440
No, I didn't.

1206
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:42,060
I will have to spell it for you, because I can only give you an approximate English spelling,

1207
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:47,360
because they have a couple of sounds in their language which don't translate to English.

1208
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,660
Okay.

1209
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:49,900
Sound it out for us.

1210
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:50,960
Okay.

1211
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,600
It's W-I-L-P-S.

1212
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:54,580
Whoops.

1213
01:33:55,580 --> 01:34:00,080
And the middle name is Dachshund.

1214
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:03,800
It's as close as you can do in English.

1215
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:14,240
It's D-A-A-X with an underline, A-N, hyphen, Sachs, S-A-X, N.

1216
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
Welch, Dachshund, Sachsund.

1217
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,080
Uh-huh.

1218
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:26,080
There's a hyphen between Welch and Dachshund and a hyphen between Dachshund and Sachsund.

1219
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:36,930
And like I say, I can't quite form the Native American words exactly, but that's close.

1220
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:39,550
Let's see here.

1221
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:45,890
Kodiak123 is asking, are they on Vancouver Island?

1222
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:48,710
No, they're on the mainland.

1223
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:50,270
Okay.

1224
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:54,030
Anyone else?

1225
01:34:54,030 --> 01:35:03,250
Their reservation covers most of the southwestern quarter of British Columbia.

1226
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,120
A lot of what people think are crown land is actually their reservation.

1227
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,100
Well, I wasn't a party to all that, so.

1228
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,460
But anyway.

1229
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:22,760
Well, I'm not sure how I became party to it, but it happened, so, you know.

1230
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:29,840
It's been very interesting having a relation with them.

1231
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,340
Well, I hope it's been a good one.

1232
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,280
Well, I don't know yet, but I find it very interesting.

1233
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,780
We have a question from southeast Arizona.

1234
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:42,400
Go ahead.

1235
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,220
Well, good evening, Angela.

1236
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,460
It's the Greek, and good evening to your guests.

1237
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,640
Hi.

1238
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,360
How are you tonight?

1239
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:53,540
I'm doing quite well, and I'm quite inspired by the courage of these men,

1240
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,220
and I sympathize with their hardship.

1241
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,240
Oh, thank you.

1242
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:05,600
Yes, I frequent these calls, and very seldom am I motivated to call,

1243
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,800
and when I see acts of courage coming from men these days,

1244
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:13,640
I feel like I just have to say something about it, and that's why I said it.

1245
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,000
I wanted to add a few things based on my study,

1246
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,040
because when you've got something that you think might help someone,

1247
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:27,640
you should share it with them, whether they accept it or use it is up to them.

1248
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,320
Thus, it's not advice.

1249
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:38,040
What inspired me to call was how you folks earlier mentioned the involvement of what's called

1250
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,780
the Holy or Sacred Roman Empire.

1251
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:46,040
I've been researching this now for quite a few years, as well as been researching words

1252
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:51,460
and how words are a technology, and how people are word controlled,

1253
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,600
and also how that ties in with the power base there.

1254
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,160
One thing I wanted to share with you are two things, actually.

1255
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:05,340
One is a few words and meanings of words, and also the current state of the involvement

1256
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,840
of the Vatican, of course.

1257
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:11,760
Many people with a little bit of research can see it goes back almost into time immemorial,

1258
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:12,880
back to the Caesars.

1259
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:19,120
Basically, to sum it up, the governments of the world have the temporal power,

1260
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:22,160
and the Vatican maintains the spiritual power.

1261
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,200
In other words, the governments of the world look to the Vatican for their spiritual approval

1262
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,760
or blessing.

1263
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,400
Unfortunately, unawares to most people, but aware to some, it has nothing to do

1264
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,420
with anything biblical, other than there is a real spiritual world that masters

1265
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,960
and governs and controls this physical temporal world.

1266
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:47,240
Now, what's been going on at the Vatican over the past two centuries,

1267
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:52,080
and I want to tie that in with the Native Americans, is they've become increasingly

1268
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:58,120
fascinated and, for lack of a better word, overzealous and greedy with dealing

1269
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:02,880
with the spiritual world through the summoning of entities and evocation.

1270
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:11,920
I found documents in private libraries where, as the armies came across this country

1271
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,920
and met the Native people here, there was always a Jesuit following that was very interested

1272
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:22,360
in their knowledge and power of evocation and of medicine men and what spirits dwelt here,

1273
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:26,220
which was not normal for the regular people that came here, the white men,

1274
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,900
let's say, to conquer understood.

1275
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:35,820
And once they met these old men or medicine men, let's say, that retained this ancient wisdom

1276
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:41,720
or knowledge of this, they quickly retained or got as much of it as possible

1277
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,100
and then got rid of them, and they sat in that position.

1278
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:51,040
Now, of course, the common Western man today is very unfamiliar

1279
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:56,840
with the spiritual reality of things, and I am not a spiritualist or anything like that,

1280
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,080
but this is secular history that I'm speaking from.

1281
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,100
This is not my opinion. These are things that I've discovered.

1282
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,940
Now, fast forward, the current intelligence agencies of the world,

1283
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:13,040
as you, with very little research you can see, are based out of the same system,

1284
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:17,520
out of the Vatican, if you look at the international intelligence agencies,

1285
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,600
and we don't need to name them.

1286
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,380
And also, I have gotten some of this information from some people of the Diné,

1287
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,740
Dinali, which are called Navajo.

1288
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:33,160
If you actually investigate on what's going on in Arizona with them and the Jesuits today,

1289
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,920
anybody can research it. These might be considered medieval in thought,

1290
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:43,040
because, again, like I said, the modern man is not in touch with the spiritual reality.

1291
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:50,060
They think this is hocus-pocus, but they still play a very important role in that end.

1292
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:56,900
So I just wanted to share that with you, that you will come across indirectly with those powers,

1293
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:02,820
in one way or another, whether you're trying to do the right thing or the wrong thing.

1294
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:09,960
Secondly, through my research, I would like to just invite you to consider the meaning

1295
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:17,400
of two words that I've discovered, and it's very difficult to speak the truth about this to people

1296
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,040
because of the indoctrination over many centuries.

1297
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,420
The two words, one of them is justice, and the other word is democracy.

1298
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,740
And I'd like to just share with you the etymological roots of those words.

1299
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,200
For example, if you say chandelier, well, you know, that's a French word, it means ornament.

1300
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,400
That's the etymology of it.

1301
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:43,040
So justice, if you look at it, forensically, let's say, not even that deep,

1302
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,920
but if you look at the etymological and do some forensic study,

1303
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,820
you will see that justice is an ancient right.

1304
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,040
It is a religious order. It has nothing to do with law.

1305
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:59,580
It is a portion of secular, temporal, and spiritual power that merged

1306
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,920
to create what's called the court system.

1307
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,640
And it's represented frequently throughout the world.

1308
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:11,620
Wikipedia has an excellent page on it because it displays the statues of justice or justicia

1309
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,040
in about 30 different countries.

1310
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,060
The statue of a woman, she's not blind, but she's blindfolded,

1311
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,840
and she's carrying a sword and scales.

1312
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:23,100
And you can trace its roots back to Babylon,

1313
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,600
and it has to do with feudalism and other things like that.

1314
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,620
So when you look at the preamble and the Constitution,

1315
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:34,840
the forefathers did state that they came here to establish justice.

1316
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,980
Now, what people don't realize is that 90% of the people that left Europe

1317
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:44,280
came here to escape justice because it was destroying them.

1318
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:49,140
So that's just one thing I'd like for you to consider, and I will not continue.

1319
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:55,360
The second word I'd like for you to consider etymologically is the word democracy.

1320
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:03,780
And the etymological root of that word means, well, it's a Greek word.

1321
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:10,380
The suffix is krasis, or krasi, which is a governing body.

1322
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:15,400
And the first prefix part of that word, demo,

1323
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:21,380
the accurate translation of that is if you look up the planet Mars,

1324
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,440
and it has two moons.

1325
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,880
What are the two moons of Mars? Phobos and Deimos.

1326
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,100
Phobos means fear, and Deimos means terror.

1327
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:38,800
So democracy literally means terror state or terror rule.

1328
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,800
And if you've been watching the news in the past 10 years,

1329
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,620
you can see that it's coming to its fruition.

1330
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,760
Now, what you believe or what you think is not relevant to what I'm saying,

1331
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:57,400
I'm just telling you what I've discovered in the root use of words.

1332
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:02,500
And also if you look at the establishment of a democratic form of government

1333
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:07,540
here under public policy under FDR, if you look at the actual chronology of it,

1334
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,620
it was also the establishment and worldwide support of the Nazi state in Germany.

1335
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,360
Nazi state, I'm not talking about the German people, I'm talking about the Nazis.

1336
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,400
That all happened at the same time, and I think it was 1933.

1337
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,720
If you go do some research at Time Magazine, guess who was man of the year?

1338
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,580
Adolf Hitler.

1339
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:34,520
He had worldwide support.

1340
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:40,360
The only thing is he discovered that he doesn't have to be subjected to the bankers

1341
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,080
when he can print all of his own money based on the labor and resources of Germany.

1342
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:54,120
And then the banker said, uh-oh, he kind of backfired on us.

1343
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:57,980
But, you know, they had put certain things in place that allowed it to come down.

1344
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,120
But the German people lost the war, the Nazis didn't.

1345
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:10,240
Yes, and if you actually look at the financier who followed the money,

1346
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:16,140
Martin Bormann, which started out with a young Adolf Hitler had,

1347
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:21,220
well, his mistress was his niece.

1348
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:26,160
And it just so happened that she was suicided,

1349
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,160
and it happened to be done with Hitler's gun.

1350
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:34,160
So Hitler at the time knew a detective named Goebbels,

1351
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,880
and he says, can you take care of this for me?

1352
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:39,180
And he said he knew one of the people in the police named Martin Bormann.

1353
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:40,780
Yeah, we'll take care of it for you.

1354
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,180
And Hitler remembered these men as he rose in power.

1355
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,260
Now, Martin Bormann is a type of character that makes,

1356
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:50,540
well, he's kind of like Dick Cheney without all the warmth and charm.

1357
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,760
Okay, and these people have escaped.

1358
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:59,660
You know, I don't want to get into it, but this is what's going on today.

1359
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:03,220
And one example of this might be if you look at the recent bailouts

1360
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:09,560
and the lack of oversight and the lack of response to where the money went,

1361
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:16,200
you're looking at a group of people, meaning the banking interceders,

1362
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,720
the bankers that are interceding on the political scene.

1363
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:24,420
If you look at the bluntness and rejection of any answer whatsoever,

1364
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:27,960
you're looking at a bunch of people that are in desperate shape.

1365
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:33,180
They are desperate, as if someone is holding a gun to their head.

1366
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:38,380
Now, if you can piece things together with a little bit of the history I've given you,

1367
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:43,340
you can almost see that this international Nazi contingency is still in place.

1368
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:48,180
And Bormann was quoted as writing that whether we lose the war or not is irrelevant.

1369
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:54,100
We are here to create an elastic, political, extraterritorial state.

1370
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,900
So he knew the language of the New World Order.

1371
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,820
So I'm going to leave you with that, and please investigate justice

1372
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:06,920
because you will be coming across that term, and it can be used against you.

1373
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,400
And if you seek justice, please examine what you're seeking,

1374
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:15,120
because it's an old mystical rite that can be traced to Babylon and beyond,

1375
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,680
and it's been adopted here.

1376
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,220
And I'll leave you off with this.

1377
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:23,600
Avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1378
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:27,840
And with that said, thank you for having me, Angela, and blessings to both of these men.

1379
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:29,800
Well, thank you.

1380
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,520
Always interesting when he comes on, he has such great information.

1381
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,780
Keeps us captivated.

1382
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,280
Thanks. Let's see here.

1383
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,440
Zizek has a question for you guys.

1384
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,440
If I can unmute him.

1385
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,640
I'm clicking it, but oh, there we go.

1386
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:47,920
I'm here.

1387
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,240
There you go.

1388
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,240
There I am.

1389
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,680
He's got a question.

1390
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,320
Hi.

1391
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,220
I don't know if this is so much of a question, but I'm sorry.

1392
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:57,340
I can't buy so much of that stuff.

1393
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:02,320
And the reason why is because what we have is a tower of Babel here,

1394
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,960
and there is no government.

1395
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,640
I mean, every time we use a euphemism or some kind of a fictitious name

1396
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:16,400
to describe some kind of mindset that is behind things,

1397
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:22,000
we don't draw credence to an actual mind behind things.

1398
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:31,860
What we're dealing with here in this world right now is a cascading array of leftover language

1399
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,220
that people don't even understand.

1400
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:39,980
And it's not so much that the history of the language goes back to Greek or Latin

1401
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,160
and all that because people don't even understand Greek and Latin,

1402
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,160
and maybe even I don't believe even the courts do.

1403
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:49,560
And I'll tell you the reason why is because if they did,

1404
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,760
they wouldn't be in the positions they are.

1405
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,920
This is a world of greed in every capacity.

1406
01:47:55,020 --> 01:48:00,540
That whole line where he says, oh, the governments look to the Vatican for spiritual guidance,

1407
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:07,380
there is no government like a brain, like an individual, like some kind of entity

1408
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:11,400
that's actually saying, oh, what's the Vatican?

1409
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:13,120
The Vatican is the name of a city.

1410
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:18,680
And it's like one entity can't talk, a fictition can't talk to another fiction

1411
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,860
unless it's all fiction.

1412
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:23,220
If it's all fiction, then what are we talking about here?

1413
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,720
It's absurd to even say such things.

1414
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:29,880
It's like when they say, well, the statesman in Manhattan is not going to do this or that

1415
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,440
or is not going to do this or is going to do this.

1416
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:33,180
There is no chaste Manhattan.

1417
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,060
There are people behind this thing and all the corruption that's going on on this planet.

1418
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:43,880
And it's virtually turned into a cannibal planet in all these monetary and financial circles,

1419
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:46,460
and they're just out there to eat everything they can.

1420
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:49,960
And I'll tell you what, here's a really interesting fact that I figured out,

1421
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:55,680
is I got really into this law thing, and I found I got a rush out of actually figuring it out

1422
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:02,000
and actually figuring out how this thing works and actually solving some problems legally.

1423
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:05,040
And I said, you know what, it's really weird.

1424
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:05,940
This is an addiction.

1425
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,540
And I kind of contend these people in these legal systems and this government

1426
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:14,560
are all addicted to this thing, and it's not the addiction to anything.

1427
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,860
I mean, who would want to work behind these benches and listen to these whining people

1428
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:24,140
who are irresponsible to themselves, who would live in no honor day after day after day

1429
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:29,220
so they could get a retirement and sit on their fat asses and eat freaking bonbons

1430
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,400
or say, I'm going to go to Hawaii and sit there.

1431
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:36,500
I've had friends go on worldwide trips, and the only Americans you see on these worldwide trips out there

1432
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:42,160
are these fat, loathing pigs that travel the world outside of the ultra-rich,

1433
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:46,280
maybe like Donald Trump or something like that, who has his own limousine and stuff like that.

1434
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:50,520
But the general Americans and even judges, they might have a retirement,

1435
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,480
but they're not getting dynamically rich.

1436
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,500
Take a breath. Take a breath.

1437
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,200
You're going a million miles an hour here.

1438
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:02,020
What are you trying? What point are you trying?

1439
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,320
I think I understand what you're trying to do.

1440
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,000
The point is really this.

1441
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:11,820
It's like, to say these entities have a mind behind this is absolutely absurd

1442
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:12,620
because there are no minds.

1443
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,780
There's individuals, just like George Bush saying, oh, we're the compassionate nation.

1444
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:19,500
Who's he talking about? He doesn't know anything about compassion.

1445
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,900
He doesn't know the first thing about compassion or even what the word means.

1446
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:25,400
It's like, nation is compassion.

1447
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:29,560
I walk here in this living world with living people, and they're virtually dead.

1448
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,160
They're zombies.

1449
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,060
And I don't see any compassion in it because they would say, hey, you know what?

1450
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,060
Support the veterans.

1451
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,600
Meanwhile, they're talking about the veterans from one war,

1452
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:42,920
but meanwhile there's veterans from three wars back sitting on the street saying,

1453
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:43,760
help me out.

1454
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:47,340
And they overlook them, and they've got these nice big yellow ribbons on their bumpers and stuff.

1455
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:51,860
We've got an unconscious society, and I don't really see any hope of really waking it up.

1456
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:55,820
The only thing that's going to happen is each and every individual has to wake up themselves

1457
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,680
and take a little clue.

1458
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:00,160
Most people do have a little spirit.

1459
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,420
That's a living man.

1460
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,460
It's not an entity.

1461
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,760
You go into these courts, if you assert that living man,

1462
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:09,840
you're going to go into court one way or the other.

1463
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,540
You're in court every single day.

1464
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:14,860
When you go into these places, you're being the living man,

1465
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:16,680
and you listen to the way these people are talking.

1466
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,360
You can address the issue exactly like that,

1467
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:24,060
and you can win because I don't care what their laws are that they want to propose

1468
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:25,120
to push on people.

1469
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,680
You can try to grind people into, like, these little melons.

1470
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,040
I went to a water board meeting last night.

1471
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:35,960
There were only 440 people there trying to hold back an entity.

1472
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,060
I said, who are they addressing?

1473
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:43,900
The people on the board are all virtually kind of like volunteers who get a little stipend,

1474
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:47,600
and they're trying to, like, raise the water rates up in the local area,

1475
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,600
$4 per person per month, as if it's not a big thing.

1476
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:56,840
You've got 61,000 people putting $4 a piece in per month.

1477
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,120
Okay, all right.

1478
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,300
Where are we going with this, sweetie?

1479
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,100
Well, where we're going with it essentially is this.

1480
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:09,760
It's like people have got to stop talking about these entity names

1481
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,220
as if they have a consciousness.

1482
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:13,820
That's really what comes down.

1483
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,500
You're talking about the banks of this, the oil companies of this.

1484
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:20,280
Well, then how do we refer to them?

1485
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,320
There's Bernanke.

1486
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,040
He runs the Federal Reserve.

1487
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,580
Don't talk about the Federal Reserve.

1488
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,940
Turn to Bernie, man.

1489
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,520
The Bernie man.

1490
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:35,260
The Bernanke.

1491
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,880
Or talk about the Vatican.

1492
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:39,360
Why are we talking about the Pope?

1493
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,420
The Pope, he's an old man who can barely friggin' walk.

1494
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,880
It's a collection of a bunch of people.

1495
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,900
If they really wanted to help humanity,

1496
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,760
they cut loose with some of that Vatican gold.

1497
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,500
They're not interested in helping humanity.

1498
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:50,900
They're interested in herding the sheep.

1499
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:54,320
They're not interested in educating the population.

1500
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:59,260
I'll have to have you on a call all to yourself so that you can go into this.

1501
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:05,380
I'm sorry, but this language about giving these entities

1502
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:08,280
some kind of power over our lives,

1503
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:09,000
there is no.

1504
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,740
There's no brain to our government, even.

1505
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,220
Everybody's looking at a snake that has no head.

1506
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:13,840
You know what I mean?

1507
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:16,340
Anyway, my two cents in there.

1508
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,920
I'll catch up with you next time.

1509
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:19,740
Thank you very much, Angela.

1510
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,080
Thank you.

1511
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:22,900
That was interesting.

1512
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,380
Does anyone else have a question for our gentleman guest?

1513
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:29,060
Press star eight.

1514
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,640
I have to check here.

1515
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,580
Okay, New York City.

1516
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,440
Hold on one second.

1517
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,160
I'm trying.

1518
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,780
There we go.

1519
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,240
Go ahead, New York City.

1520
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:40,000
Did you have a question?

1521
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,040
Hey, New York City.

1522
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,220
Can you hear me?

1523
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,040
Yes, go ahead, Harold.

1524
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:49,440
Hi.

1525
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,340
How are you doing?

1526
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:51,960
Fine, thank you.

1527
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,420
Okay, interesting conversation.

1528
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:02,020
Going back to the caller before the machine gun had unloaded,

1529
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:08,880
I had agreed with most of what he had brought out,

1530
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,920
but there was a point that he brought out with regards to Adolf Hitler.

1531
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:23,800
Hitler, based on my research, and I've done perhaps close to 30 years of research,

1532
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:29,900
dealing in the matters of the Vatican, and he was a made man.

1533
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,860
He had a talent that they tapped into.

1534
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,740
He didn't write Mann Kampf.

1535
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:38,080
He was brought along, coached along.

1536
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:44,320
He was brought along by Jesuits, as he mentioned that their powers is.

1537
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:48,420
And with regards to when he mentioned Vatican or these corporate entities,

1538
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,660
I think most of us know it's the people behind them that makes it move.

1539
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:56,260
I hope most people do because, you know,

1540
01:54:56,260 --> 01:55:00,160
a corporation can't do nothing without its representative agents.

1541
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:01,400
So that's a given.

1542
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,360
That's a given.

1543
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:08,100
But, yes, I agree with the last caller, you know,

1544
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:12,120
we ought to recognize who's doing what.

1545
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,660
Yes, that's true.

1546
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:16,580
Even in my legal writing, you know,

1547
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:21,540
I don't say the corporate appellee states or this.

1548
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:25,720
No, no, it's counsel talking or whatever record they're referring to.

1549
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,580
No, I agree in that regard.

1550
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:35,620
But in the overall context of things, I think most of us on this call

1551
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:42,560
and the majority of people that visit your forum have an understanding that

1552
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,800
when we speak of corporate, we're talking about the people behind it

1553
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,680
that using the corporate shield to do their devilment.

1554
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:54,720
But words do play a key role because the spiritual entities,

1555
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,900
as someone alluded to earlier,

1556
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,980
that is their way of manipulating the human family.

1557
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:05,420
Because they don't have physical power over us,

1558
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,500
they do it through the mind.

1559
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,980
And how do they communicate it?

1560
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:08,720
Through words.

1561
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:16,000
So, yes, words do play a key role in how this whole system goes.

1562
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:18,580
And there is a lineage and a root.

1563
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,580
And whether people want to believe it or not,

1564
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:25,280
that which is unseen actually controls that which is seen.

1565
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,900
And with regards to our guests tonight,

1566
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,980
that is something that they have to be prepared for also

1567
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:36,360
because it's not what we see in the letter,

1568
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:41,600
the men that are sitting on the bench, the paperwork that's being exchanged,

1569
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,580
but what is the source behind it.

1570
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:52,900
And also with regards with those that bring in the element of the spiritual dynamic

1571
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,920
of where we're at in this day and time,

1572
01:56:55,220 --> 01:57:00,180
we have to take into account where we are in that history.

1573
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:04,200
And there are some things that we're not going to change.

1574
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:09,820
I mean, so far the majority of the prophecies have been fulfilled.

1575
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:12,040
On the dying.

1576
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,260
So why are we going to think that we can change that which has already been forecast?

1577
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:23,400
So, yes, there's some things within our circumference that we can, you know,

1578
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:26,280
have some control over because we have little control over anything

1579
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,660
and sometimes not even ourselves.

1580
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:36,580
So as one person said it, save yourself from this untoward generation

1581
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:41,680
because what we're dealing with is bigger than ourselves.

1582
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:49,300
And until the Redeemer comes again, we're not going to change a whole lot.

1583
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,780
We can change some, yes, but not a whole lot.

1584
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,020
And we have to. We have to look at reality.

1585
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:57,920
We have to look at reality.

1586
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:04,600
The brief that was written up, the appeal document, wonderful.

1587
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:09,420
And I wish it all the best.

1588
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:14,240
But I do realize some dynamics that is beyond us.

1589
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:20,660
And if it's not meant to be, we can't put a square into a circle.

1590
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:28,140
And right now the people that are in charge at this moment, you know,

1591
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,580
their time is limited.

1592
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:38,740
I just hope and pray that there is some room for this petition

1593
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:43,240
and perhaps some things can be changed.

1594
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:47,360
But overall, based on the way history has played out thus far,

1595
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:55,440
and I'm a student of history, the dynamics of history repeating itself,

1596
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,640
I heard somebody bring it up several times before,

1597
01:58:57,780 --> 01:59:03,020
how we're living in 1930s Germany right now.

1598
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,220
I've been saying that for years.

1599
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:06,520
You know, people used to laugh at me.

1600
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,720
Now people call on me and say, oh, you were right.

1601
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,220
I've been talking about this 10, 15 years ago.

1602
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:15,400
But now that things are being accelerated

1603
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:18,760
and the people that are behind it, they're not even hiding anymore.

1604
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:21,380
They put the stuff right in front of your face now.

1605
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:23,620
They even tell you what they're going to do.

1606
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:26,440
And people still don't see it.

1607
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,080
Okay, so what are you suggesting?

1608
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,580
Well, we're all talking about the problems.

1609
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:35,440
We all know the problem.

1610
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:36,100
We all know the system.

1611
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,620
What's your solution?

1612
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:43,580
Like I said before, dealing with things in your circumference

1613
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:46,740
and getting yourself connected to your creator,

1614
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:52,380
there's not a whole lot we're going to do to change the system.

1615
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,620
We can change, perhaps.

1616
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,180
Okay, then I'm sorry.

1617
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:56,740
You have nothing to contribute.

1618
01:59:57,080 --> 02:00:00,860
And I hate to be rude, but acceptance is not the human condition.

1619
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,380
It never has been.

1620
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,100
It's not what my creator taught me.

1621
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:10,360
What did your creator teach you, and who is your creator?

1622
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,580
That I am a god.

1623
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:13,680
I have the power of god.

1624
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,120
I can change my world.

1625
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:16,420
I have to change my world.

1626
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,740
My gift of freedom is a gift from my creator that if I forsake it,

1627
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:23,620
I am forsaking the gifts of my god.

1628
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:24,880
I can't do that.

1629
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,540
Okay, I have to respect that.

1630
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,240
We're not talking about the same creator.

1631
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,840
Okay, then there we go.

1632
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:32,420
And we have to agree to disagree.

1633
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:34,240
There you go.

1634
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,180
And I thank you very much for your time.

1635
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,100
Thank you.

1636
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:40,620
Okay.

1637
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,780
If anyone has a question, press star 8.

1638
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,760
However, we have gone.

1639
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:49,780
What?

1640
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:51,860
I wish I had been thinking a little quicker

1641
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:56,360
because I would have told them that if too many people had accepted that

1642
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,740
viewpoint, then slavery would still be on this continent.

1643
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,540
It would still be in the world.

1644
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:02,300
Yep.

1645
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:04,340
Not just this continent.

1646
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:08,960
It is still in places of this world who accepted the status quo.

1647
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:09,900
Yep.

1648
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,040
But I didn't think quick enough.

1649
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:13,760
Sorry about that.

1650
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:15,160
Okay.

1651
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:16,960
All right, West Michigan.

1652
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:17,840
Go ahead, Matt.

1653
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:18,940
Did you hang up?

1654
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,340
What?

1655
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,760
I'm sorry.

1656
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,360
I'm sorry.

1657
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:24,020
Hold on a second.

1658
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,300
Matt, hold on.

1659
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,880
Harold is still.

1660
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:27,840
Go ahead, Harold.

1661
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,560
No, I'm still here.

1662
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,200
And I heard what he said.

1663
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:36,880
But contrary to what many people believe, we're still enslaved.

1664
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:37,900
And I'll leave it at that.

1665
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:45,200
Yes, we are because we allow our minds to be controlled by the status quo,

1666
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:48,960
and we're not willing to fight for our gifts.

1667
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,800
But anyway, please watch what happens, and we'll all learn from it no matter

1668
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:55,100
what.

1669
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:58,040
Okay.

1670
02:01:58,260 --> 02:01:59,260
Go ahead, West Michigan.

1671
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:05,600
Actually, I think that Harold and your guest tonight are both on the same page

1672
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:11,280
because there are some things in prophecy that it said this was going to

1673
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,160
happen, that's going to happen, something else is going to happen.

1674
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,460
But guess what?

1675
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,700
It takes us to make it happen.

1676
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,080
So you're both right.

1677
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:24,260
If there's things that are going to be, we are in Germany 1933.

1678
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:25,500
That makes sense.

1679
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,760
But there were a whole bunch of people back then that knew something was

1680
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,820
wrong and tried to do something about it, and obviously it failed.

1681
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:37,160
Now, if there's a whole bunch of us, and hopefully history is a good teacher

1682
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:42,720
here, if there's a whole bunch of us, more of us, that know more things to do

1683
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:46,800
that will be successful or potentially successful and go out and do it, we

1684
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,240
might well be able to preclude some of these problems.

1685
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:54,800
Now, you alluded a little bit earlier to Sherwood Rodriguez, who has a Supreme

1686
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,800
Court decision back in 1982.

1687
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,000
Well, hey, if he was able to do that and take a couple of municipalities out

1688
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,820
of federal control, more power to him.

1689
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:07,080
But he had to be the one to actually go ahead and do it.

1690
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:12,320
Somebody has to be there to go ahead and cast the first ballot, throw the first

1691
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,320
stone, or fire the first gun.

1692
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:16,200
Somebody has to be there to do it.

1693
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,260
But that's how practicing is fulfilled.

1694
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:23,000
Everybody just decided, okay, I'm not going to do anything.

1695
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,440
I'm not going to do anything to change the system.

1696
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,220
All I'm going to do is when I get up in the morning, I'm going to worry about

1697
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:32,700
food, clothing, and shelter, and nothing else.

1698
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:35,400
If it means go along to get along, I'll do it.

1699
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:39,780
If it means I have to go do something illegal, I'll do it.

1700
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:42,260
But food, clothing, and shelter, period.

1701
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,980
I'm not going to get involved politically.

1702
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:46,040
I'm not going to try to change anything.

1703
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:49,800
I'm just going to let the thing roll off the edge, but I'll protect myself.

1704
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,720
I guarantee you, if a lot of people that I know that are in the so-called

1705
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:58,600
Patriot Movement or around these calls or what have you, if they took all,

1706
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:03,920
myself included, right now, if I had taken all the time, effort, and energy that

1707
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:08,720
I had over the last 20 years and decided, Matt, all you're going to worry about

1708
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:12,960
is your bank balance, I would be a millionaire today, no doubt.

1709
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:16,860
But I've got myself involved in a whole bunch of political activities,

1710
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,500
and because of that, I'm not.

1711
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:21,040
I'm not complaining about it.

1712
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,840
It's just the fact it's the way things are.

1713
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,460
So you're both on the right page.

1714
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:29,100
You're both in the same book.

1715
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,580
You're just both not on the same page tonight.

1716
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:36,400
But I just wanted to point that out because I've listened to Harold over the

1717
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,760
last few months, back over the last few years,

1718
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,120
and he's on the same page the rest of us are.

1719
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:44,860
So I just wanted to point that out.

1720
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,200
Well, we're all on the same page.

1721
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:50,340
We just got a little bit different point of view, that's all.

1722
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:56,220
And I want to let it be known, because most of you all know this already,

1723
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:00,240
I don't take a pacifist stand and just take it.

1724
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:05,120
No, I've been fighting on behalf of others for the last 25 years,

1725
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,700
often with no pay.

1726
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:10,180
So, no, don't get that twisted and take that out of context.

1727
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:15,900
I'm just talking about the overall scheme of things regarding prophecy.

1728
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:17,580
That cannot be changed.

1729
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:27,620
No, but if we don't try, then we are not worthy of our gifts.

1730
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:33,520
I mean, if we don't try, then are we human?

1731
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:38,820
Are we any better than the sheep and the cattle being herded?

1732
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:47,010
I mean, my problem is that, and Louis, you know, we've both been through this.

1733
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:48,030
We've been through the ringer.

1734
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:49,750
We've seen how corrupt the system is.

1735
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:54,230
We've seen very good people, and I worked with Bernard Von Nodhaus.

1736
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:57,630
He, you know, what happened to him was a travesty.

1737
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:00,390
Is he a perfect character?

1738
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:01,890
No, he's got his flaws.

1739
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:05,050
Okay, but because he wasn't able to defend himself,

1740
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:07,730
he potentially is going to prison for a long, long time.

1741
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:11,350
Well, probably a death sentence because he's already 68 years old.

1742
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:12,910
Okay?

1743
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:17,610
You know, why aren't the people rising up in support of him?

1744
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:24,570
Why do we allow our fellow brothers in this freedom movement

1745
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,930
to be taken down one by one?

1746
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:29,970
Why do we accept it?

1747
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:31,430
Why do we sit by idly?

1748
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:34,610
I agree with you 100%,

1749
02:06:34,610 --> 02:06:38,750
and I'm one of those people that has been in the mix since 87,

1750
02:06:39,110 --> 02:06:41,990
doing just that, helping out those that can't help themselves.

1751
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:46,330
Well, when I ran my own company, which I did for a number of years,

1752
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:49,090
we had a motto in the company.

1753
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:51,130
That was, if you do it once, you do it well.

1754
02:06:51,610 --> 02:06:53,610
If you do it twice, you automate it.

1755
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:59,210
And what I see is that so many people are fighting the same fight,

1756
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:02,990
going into their local courts and getting their butts handed to them,

1757
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:05,750
getting their, you know, kicked where they don't want to be kicked,

1758
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:12,250
that we can't win the overall war individually in the local courts.

1759
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:15,390
They just divide and conquer us and they wear us out.

1760
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:16,290
True.

1761
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:21,350
The only thing I knew to do, and Lewis and I talked about this a lot,

1762
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:27,150
is to take the final push to the place where it belongs,

1763
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:29,010
which is the Supreme Court.

1764
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:31,250
I don't think anybody disagrees with that.

1765
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:34,570
Whether or not they're going to give us what we want,

1766
02:07:34,690 --> 02:07:36,890
well, that's not within our control.

1767
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:42,870
What is within our control is to put the best effort forward

1768
02:07:42,870 --> 02:07:49,690
to make the right arguments and expose the system for what it is,

1769
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:54,630
and if then we lose, that is a win.

1770
02:07:54,790 --> 02:07:55,990
That's instructional.

1771
02:07:57,390 --> 02:07:59,630
Because we've done what we're supposed to do,

1772
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:01,710
and we've given it all we can,

1773
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:04,830
and I can accept the results no matter what they are,

1774
02:08:04,930 --> 02:08:11,990
because then I know that anyone else following behind us is not going to succeed,

1775
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:15,950
that there is no chance, there is no remedy,

1776
02:08:16,170 --> 02:08:17,850
which the patriots like to talk about.

1777
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:21,250
So let's go do this one thing,

1778
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:25,270
and then if you want to go down the road of getting rid of the Constitution

1779
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:30,170
a la Dr. Livingston, fine, we can have that discussion.

1780
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:33,170
Everything is on the table at that point,

1781
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:37,230
but I don't buy that you have to pull over this.

1782
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:38,970
You need more exposure.

1783
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:43,030
We're going to get it, but you can't do that until the suit is written.

1784
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:46,690
We talked to people beforehand, and they said,

1785
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:48,950
great, let us know when you get it done so we can see something.

1786
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:53,090
Well, we just published it last week, and it is going around like crazy.

1787
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:57,490
Now people have something they can sink their teeth into.

1788
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:01,990
Now we can have a discussion about what it really is instead of somebody's pipe dream.

1789
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:08,870
So we can all jump on board and make it go viral, because that's what we do.

1790
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:12,030
When something is righteous, we do it.

1791
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:14,790
You guessed it. That's what it's going to take. That's what we want.

1792
02:09:15,870 --> 02:09:21,140
I know. Me too. Me too.

1793
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,020
I mean, there's a lot of tasks out there,

1794
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:29,200
but what we have to do is direct it in such a way that it can accomplish what we want.

1795
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:36,120
Not that we're looking for a field general or anything like that,

1796
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:39,360
but if we don't hang together,

1797
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:41,900
we're all going to hang separately in some famous last words.

1798
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:45,080
That's true.

1799
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:49,480
All right, so direct everyone again to your website,

1800
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:52,540
where I highly recommend you read the lawsuit.

1801
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,420
It's posted there, right?

1802
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:02,560
Yes, it's posted there at usav.me.

1803
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:10,290
Okay. I also have a link to it on the poster there,

1804
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:13,090
and I'll have it also on the guest speaker's pages.

1805
02:10:13,470 --> 02:10:16,670
I have links to all your stuff, your radio broadcast,

1806
02:10:16,670 --> 02:10:21,830
your websites, and the limited...

1807
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:22,930
I have four documents.

1808
02:10:23,190 --> 02:10:25,810
Thank you, by the way, Lewis, but I already had that one.

1809
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:27,330
Okay.

1810
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:31,170
I have like four documents from the case,

1811
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:34,330
but if there's anything else you'd like to send over,

1812
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:40,840
I'll get it up there so people can look at it from the Waller case,

1813
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:43,840
from the other, you know, the original,

1814
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:47,340
the thing you were found not guilty of.

1815
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:52,160
I don't really have anything to say from that.

1816
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:57,000
What we do with that case later on

1817
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,320
will be separate and apart from our Supreme Court case.

1818
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:01,540
Okay.

1819
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:07,020
First thing is I want to make this country a place where my son can grow up

1820
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:12,220
and enjoy what my grandfather enjoyed.

1821
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:15,860
Yeah, what our forefathers died for.

1822
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,540
Our ancestors, you know.

1823
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,400
And it wasn't $254 a month in Social Security.

1824
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:26,220
No.

1825
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:30,260
All right, is there anything else?

1826
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:31,520
Well, wait, wait, wait.

1827
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:33,480
Let's see if there's any more questions.

1828
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,400
Anybody else?

1829
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:38,820
Press star eight if you have any questions.

1830
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,400
No? Okay, good.

1831
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,860
We can close it down.

1832
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:46,140
It's been two hours and 11 minutes of interesting conversation.

1833
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:48,640
I really appreciate you guys coming on,

1834
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:53,080
and I hope you come on again and update us on how it goes,

1835
02:11:53,240 --> 02:12:00,320
and maybe we can watch the country come back to the way it's supposed to be.

1836
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:03,900
Well, it's either going to be dead or it's going to be torn apart.

1837
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:05,680
I hope not.

1838
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,120
Well, nobody's going to be able to sit on the sidelines with us.

1839
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:14,000
You know, the people who think that they are entitled to other people's property

1840
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,840
and, oh, by the way, folks, if you haven't seen Atlas Shrugged,

1841
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:20,820
go see the movie, support it, read the book,

1842
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:26,900
because it's the movie that the powers that be don't want you to experience

1843
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,920
because it talks about the moochers in society.

1844
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:37,420
So go take a look at that and understand that that's where we're coming from.

1845
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:42,160
Either you're going to be totally for us if you are able to care for yourself,

1846
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:47,780
or the people are going to be totally against us if you're a moocher on society.

1847
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:55,860
And so that's the whole idea with this is we have to decide what kind of country we are.

1848
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:02,420
The one that was successful was the one that allowed people to care for themselves.

1849
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:05,400
There was far less poverty in this country before Social Security.

1850
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:12,200
There was a whole lot more freedom before the bankruptcy in 1933.

1851
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,320
And so it's time.

1852
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:23,420
The North Carolina Constitution says that a return to the foundations of law,

1853
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:28,500
the Constitution, are necessary for the preservation of liberty.

1854
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:31,840
We are going to have to go back to the founding documents.

1855
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,500
Were they perfect? No.

1856
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,700
Were there some issues? Probably.

1857
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:38,800
But it's a darn good place to start.

1858
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,800
And if I was living under the Constitution today, I'd be a happy camper.

1859
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:44,960
Yeah, be a better place.

1860
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,020
Much better place.

1861
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:48,720
We've got one more question.

1862
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:50,100
Do you want to stick around for one more?

1863
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:51,540
Sure, go for it.

1864
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:54,280
Okay, Ray Shaw II, go ahead.

1865
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:59,140
I just wanted him to repeat what he said that movie was.

1866
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:03,300
Atlas shrugged.

1867
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:07,720
Like the big guy Atlas that had the world on his shoulders, he shrugged.

1868
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:10,740
If you haven't read the book, it was Ayn Rand's opus.

1869
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:13,120
It took her 12 years to write.

1870
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:19,460
If you don't know who Ayn Rand was, I highly recommend you go read her biography.

1871
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:30,060
What she went through as a Russian prisoner and everything before she ever came to this country, it's quite astounding.

1872
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:37,860
And once you read the book, you'll find that phrases, it took her from 1940 to 1952 to write the book.

1873
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:41,140
And it's about the collapse of society.

1874
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:53,200
And you will find that phrases and words and quotes from the book are being uttered today in the public without their even being conscious of it

1875
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:59,200
because what she wrote about 60 years ago is now coming to pass in this country.

1876
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:03,380
So another 1984, huh?

1877
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:07,600
Well, it's more detailed than 1984.

1878
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:12,540
1984 was about concepts that could happen at the governmental level.

1879
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:25,540
Ayn Rand is about the details, about the psyches of men, about what happens to good nations.

1880
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,520
Good nations that go bad.

1881
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:32,880
So I'm trying to get the word out.

1882
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:34,880
My wife and my family, we just went and saw it.

1883
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,980
Even my 10-year-old little girl got it.

1884
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:45,660
It's the first part of three, so you're only going to see part one of the movie, the whole thing.

1885
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:50,820
They're being very true to the book because you really couldn't have fixed.

1886
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,200
Of course, it's a 1,400-page book, so obviously they had to shorten it down.

1887
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:04,320
But if you haven't read the book, the Library of Congress admits that behind the Bible,

1888
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:11,000
it is the book that most people say has influenced them most in their life, behind the Bible.

1889
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:17,480
It's number two in the Library of Congress for the most influential writings of all time.

1890
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,520
That ought to put it in perspective for you.

1891
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:26,220
Okay, we have one more.

1892
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,100
Was that it for you, Rayshaw?

1893
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:30,080
Yes.

1894
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:32,100
Okay, thank you so much.

1895
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:37,420
Okay, go ahead, Oyak.

1896
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:39,900
Can you hear me?

1897
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:40,840
Yeah.

1898
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:42,500
Okay.

1899
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:46,180
I thought it would be interesting to toss this into the mix.

1900
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:49,320
You sound like you're underwater.

1901
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:50,100
Wait a minute.

1902
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:52,100
Change phones.

1903
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:56,700
I don't have anything but this microphone, Angela.

1904
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:57,840
This is all I have.

1905
02:16:59,160 --> 02:16:59,540
All right.

1906
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,240
Well, we'll try to listen real hard.

1907
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:01,780
Go ahead.

1908
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,340
Is it any better now?

1909
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:06,600
No, you still sound underwater.

1910
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:07,660
Just talk loud.

1911
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:17,219
There's a book by the name of Vatican Assassin, Wounded in the House of My Friends by Eric John Feltz.

1912
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:21,340
I don't know if any of you have ever read it, but it's quite interesting.

1913
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:31,420
On page 225 of that book, there are a few paragraphs I'd like to read to you.

1914
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:38,379
Like Cromwell, it was Washington who wept on his mother's neck after he heard her last words.

1915
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:45,520
You will see me no more, but you, George, fulfill the highest destinies which heaven has assigned you.

1916
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:50,680
Go, my son, and may heaven and your mother's blessing be with you always.

1917
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,860
Having released all his slaves, it was Washington who brought each colony into statehood.

1918
02:17:57,540 --> 02:18:04,360
For in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, they were declared to be free, independent, and sovereign.

1919
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:07,059
I assume he's referring to the slaves at that point.

1920
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:08,340
I don't know for sure.

1921
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:14,809
It was Washington.

1922
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:18,790
What?

1923
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:25,110
Are you still there?

1924
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:27,910
Something went haywire in my computer.

1925
02:18:28,129 --> 02:18:31,170
I've got to stop some stuff here. Hang on a minute.

1926
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:40,790
Well, I think we got the gist of what you're talking about.

1927
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:42,030
Just call it good.

1928
02:18:43,430 --> 02:18:43,770
What?

1929
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:46,570
He said just call it good.

1930
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:49,770
Okay. Thank you.

1931
02:18:51,969 --> 02:18:53,010
Anyone else?

1932
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:59,030
Okay. If no one else has any questions, we're going to close it down.

1933
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:01,670
It's been a good 2 hours and 18 minutes.

1934
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:07,450
And for those of you that came on late, it's recorded, so you can go back and listen.

1935
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:08,570
It was a really good call.

1936
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:10,410
Again, thank you, gentlemen.

1937
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:18,049
I appreciate your time and all your energy and sacrifice that you're sticking your neck out for, you know,

1938
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:23,290
something that's righteous and good and the good of the country and the future.

1939
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:26,969
And I appreciate what you've done, and we love you.

1940
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:31,190
And we're going to make your efforts worthwhile.

1941
02:19:31,389 --> 02:19:31,930
My pleasure.

1942
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:36,110
And will you come on again and update us as things progress?

1943
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:37,690
Be happy to.

1944
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:39,850
Okay, great. Thank you so much.

1945
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:40,590
It's what we do now.

1946
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,910
That's wonderful.

1947
02:19:44,110 --> 02:19:48,730
And we're also going to listen to you on Saturdays on Republic Broadcasting and catch your show.

1948
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:50,510
Thanks so much.

1949
02:19:50,610 --> 02:19:51,350
All right, everybody.

1950
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:52,230
It's been a good one.

1951
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:52,890
I love you.

1952
02:19:53,710 --> 02:19:59,310
I'll see you on Sunday with Jon Stewart and then on Monday with Dave.

1953
02:19:59,550 --> 02:20:02,450
And that's a wrap.

1954
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:05,330
Thanks, Angela.

1955
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:06,250
Everyone, be blessed.

1956
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:06,890
Thanks, Harold.
