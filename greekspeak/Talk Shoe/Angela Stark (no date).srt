1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,430
They make X's and A's and all kinds of things.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,230
Southeast Arizona, did you want to chime in?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,310
Yeah, hey Angela, it's the Greek. How are you, sweetie?

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,970
Hi, I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,610
I'm doing fine, thank you. I chimed in...

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,330
What's new with you?

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,170
Oh, everything, everything.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,410
I'd like to discuss one aspect,

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,070
to discuss what this fellow brought up with the Cloudbusters.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,570
I let the cat out of the bag.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,350
Recently, we ended the drought in Texas

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,910
and have been supplying cotton farmers around Arizona

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,070
helping them fill up their irrigation ditches

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,770
using the ethereal rain engineering technology.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,650
No, I don't know about it. Tell us about it.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,970
Well, the reason I chimed in is

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,810
I appreciate the fellow talking about the Organite

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,730
and these other things.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,530
It has positive and negatives.

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,950
It doesn't really work for ethereal rain engineering.

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,710
It does mitigate some of the local magnetic fields and the EMF

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,090
and works a little bit on the chemtrails, like you said.

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,270
But the concept of it is, even biblically,

24
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,910
we were given everything on the earth to manage it

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,510
and completely use it.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,710
But the thing is, the science that's taught

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,310
is so backwards.

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,810
Even on the highest level for the past 1,000 or 2,000 years,

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,550
everything is just completely backwards.

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,750
They teach that clouds and weather patterns

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,110
are formed by humidity and evaporation, and they're not.

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,690
When you look at a cloud, that is actually the cosmic ether.

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,350
It's basically neither matter nor energy.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,230
It's a very primordial form of, let's call it energy,

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,410
that the earth is swimming in because space is not a vacuum.

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,730
And where the earth makes contact with the fluid of the ether in space,

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,330
it causes a swirling, just like if you were to pass a ball through water.

38
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,790
The water swirls around it.

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,190
And the moisture is attracted to the ether.

40
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,090
So when you look at cloud patterns and jet streams and things like that,

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,470
that is the ether flow, and it happens to attract moisture-forming clouds.

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,890
It also attracts other things, radioactivity, small particles,

43
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,450
different forms of energy.

44
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,250
So if you're trying to do weather engineering like they do

45
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,130
with cloud seeding with silver and iodine and things like that,

46
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,230
you're looking at the effect.

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,090
The clouds are not the cause of the weather.

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,490
They are simply the effect.

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,050
So everything is about dealing with the symptom, not the cause.

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,050
But once you understand the ether,

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,190
it's very, very easy to manipulate.

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,350
And it's so simple.

53
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,070
If you look at the work of Dr. Reich, he was heavily persecuted.

54
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,510
He used cloud busters that were water-powered.

55
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,050
And I'll just spill the beans.

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
A lot of people say you should keep this a secret.

57
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,190
But all that technology, the work that he did,

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,630
was a wonderful stepping stone.

59
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,090
Personally, I don't agree with the organite stuff,

60
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,010
which is the polyester resin with the metal shavings.

61
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,650
And you can go online.

62
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,950
It's like a big hit.

63
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,290
The problem is when you accumulate this orgo and energy,

64
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,730
too much of it is not conducive to health.

65
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,550
It has to be grounded.

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,790
And all of these organite devices and these polyester resin

67
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,930
with metal shavings in them, there's no grounding to them.

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,370
Sometimes there is some reference to grounding them.

69
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,210
But that's not what the ether is really about.

70
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,850
If you read the work of Wilhelm Reich,

71
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,290
he talks about it's interesting how all societies through history

72
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,810
have suppressed the reason for the orgasm.

73
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,670
The orgasm is not just the excretion of bodily fluids.

74
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,310
It's the discharge of the sepharic buildup of energy.

75
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,890
And once you understand the orgasm,

76
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,810
you understand the weather, you understand the ether.

77
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,850
And that's kind of like a roundabout.

78
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:10,950
Really?

79
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,030
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,589
When you say orgasm, it's like everyone's like eight years old.

81
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,690
Oh, orgasm.

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,810
It's a very specific biological function.

83
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,970
And all living creatures, even plants, have them.

84
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,230
And it's the release of the energy.

85
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,910
And once you understand the accumulation and the release of the orgone,

86
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,930
there you go.

87
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,490
But just to fast forward, just to affect the ether,

88
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,910
you don't have to make water-grounded codbusters,

89
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,010
which are all these pipes that are water-grounded,

90
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,430
or the organite with the polyester resins.

91
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,850
And I'm knocking the organite because I went through that phase.

92
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,990
Okay?

93
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,410
It's very popular right now.

94
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,190
The easiest way to capture the ether is understanding the way it flows.

95
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,530
Everything that's taught,

96
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,890
they teach you that everything goes from a high potential to a low potential.

97
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,850
Right?

98
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,970
So if you have a bucket of water, it's a high potential of water.

99
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,550
If you put a hole in that bucket,

100
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,410
and next to another bucket that's got low potential, no water,

101
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,910
the high will go to the low.

102
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,390
Same with electricity.

103
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,810
If you have a dead battery next to a fully charged battery,

104
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,430
the fully charged battery will always go to the discharged battery

105
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,090
and charge it.

106
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,530
Everything that they teach and everything that we are taught to observe

107
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,190
is high to low, high to low.

108
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,650
You know, your gas tank's full, it goes to low.

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:30,890
Right?

110
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,970
And then you've got to fill it up again.

111
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,990
Well, the ether is the opposite.

112
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,030
It goes from low to high potential.

113
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,750
So in other words, if you mastered the ether,

114
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,870
you would put a low battery next to a fully charged battery,

115
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,310
and whatever is in the low battery will give up to charge the higher battery even more.

116
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,250
And these lessons of the ether are given in the Bible as well,

117
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,130
but no one reads it, so they wouldn't see it.

118
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,150
Like in the Bible, it says, for example,

119
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,490
those who have little, that little will be taken away till they have nothing,

120
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,690
and those who have much, much will be given till they are full.

121
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,210
That's a lesson on the ether.

122
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,710
So basically, what you do is you take a cardboard tube,

123
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,930
like you can experiment with the little cardboard tubes you get out of a paper roll

124
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,550
when it's spent, right?

125
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,370
A longer one would be better, okay?

126
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,210
Like a paper towel?

127
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,550
Yeah, like a paper towel roll, right?

128
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,570
And get yourself some, go to a window tint shop,

129
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,610
and you know that silver film they use for window tint?

130
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,330
You know, when it's bright, it looks like a mirror,

131
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,310
and you know, it's like a two-way mirror deal?

132
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,470
Yeah.

133
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,410
Okay, and just put that on the back,

134
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,090
and then put a little red light on the back of it.

135
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,130
So if you look down the tube, you'll see right through it

136
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,110
because it's dark in the tube, and there's light on the other side, right?

137
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,130
But when you go through the tube,

138
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,010
the ether goes through the mirror because it looks clear,

139
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,390
and then it wants to reverse, and it sees a mirror,

140
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,190
and temporarily gets bounced off.

141
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,510
It still goes through it because you can't shield it.

142
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,070
So now you create a low concentration of ether in that tube,

143
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,130
and all this happens in millionths of a second.

144
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,410
It's like a pulsing.

145
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,170
So the ether goes through the tube,

146
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,150
and it doesn't reverse back because it's a mirror on the back side.

147
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,150
So that's why you want a longer tube to keep it really dark in there, right?

148
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,330
So what you do with this is you have the red light back on the back of it

149
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,650
because any form of light stimulates the ether.

150
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,710
That's why, for example, fog is lifted

151
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,170
when the sun comes up in California, typically.

152
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,410
People say it's the heat of the sun.

153
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,090
It's not. It's stimulation of the ether.

154
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,850
So what's interesting, to make a long story short here,

155
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,890
is you make a little device.

156
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,410
I have some that are quite elaborate,

157
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,870
and in other words, you spend several days

158
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,110
building ones that are more durable and more technical.

159
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,170
There's a lot of tough guys, like ex-Marines, gangster types,

160
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,570
real tough guys, right?

161
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,530
And you go out in the parking lot, and you say,

162
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,190
hey, you see it's a totally blue sky,

163
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,050
and you're going to make a cloud, and they all laugh.

164
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,530
And boom, you take the thing out,

165
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,830
and within five to 15 minutes, these clouds start to form.

166
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,670
And these tough guys are like little girls.

167
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,030
They want to crawl under their cars.

168
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,810
They're so scared.

169
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,150
Really?

170
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,450
Yeah, it's very interesting.

171
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,550
You got to have the right conditions.

172
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,830
You have to have at least 15 grams of moisture

173
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,190
per cubic meter of air.

174
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,270
What that means in English is you have to have

175
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,850
about 40% to 50% humidity to do that.

176
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,830
Well, that's not abnormal here in California.

177
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,429
Yeah, exactly.

178
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,090
But out in the desert, it's down to five or eight.

179
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,690
You have to sort of attract warmer moisture air,

180
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,830
and also warm air holds more moisture.

181
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,290
So is this what you did in Texas?

182
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,210
Well, let's say there's no more drought in Texas, right?

183
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,470
It was officially eliminated the end of February.

184
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,330
So these things can be, you know,

185
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,790
people talk about the chemtrails.

186
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,790
There's a lot of concern about the chemtrails.

187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,190
Well, obviously, there should be, OK?

188
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,970
Yeah, everybody here has got a persistent cough

189
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,730
they can't shake.

190
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,350
And I've heard other people talk about it, too.

191
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,270
And it's not that detrimental.

192
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,510
I mean, it doesn't, you know, stop you from working

193
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,530
or doing anything, but it's like a cough

194
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,790
that's persistent in almost everybody.

195
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,890
Well, what they're doing is actually a mix

196
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,710
of very low-level technology, which is basically

197
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,390
a plane shooting some stuff out the ass end, right?

198
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,370
But it's also coupled with some really,

199
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,390
really high technology that people are,

200
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,330
shouldn't be discussed, by the way,

201
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,850
because it's basically a PSYOP.

202
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,230
Spider web technology?

203
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,310
Yeah, kind of.

204
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,070
The technology, well, involved with that, again,

205
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,350
they're not familiar with the ether.

206
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,250
They're doing it also to spend money, right?

207
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,790
You know, like the $1,000 toilet seats

208
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,350
and the $800 hammer, right?

209
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,770
Well, I think ultimately they're doing it

210
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,570
to, you know, cull the population.

211
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,910
Well, it's a PSYOP, like, for example,

212
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,910
if you go look at children's coloring books, right?

213
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,090
They have, like, the Columbus story

214
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,210
with the Nina, Tina, and Santa Marina, right?

215
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,430
You got to color it in.

216
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,610
And they got chemtrails with Xs in the background

217
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,050
of these ships from the 1400s, right?

218
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,710
Have you seen those coloring books?

219
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,990
No, I haven't seen that.

220
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,430
Chemtrails in children's books.

221
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,510
They're putting them in children's books now, right?

222
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,750
So when the time is right, it'll serve a purpose.

223
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,110
But you've got to do the food.

224
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,990
You got to eat their food, drink their water,

225
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,970
and breathe their air.

226
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,350
It's a tripartite thing,

227
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,110
so you can never blame it on just the chemtrails.

228
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,390
So if you shop at an ordinary...

229
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,910
Yeah, yeah, it's a three-part.

230
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,170
It's always a three-part mixture.

231
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,510
So you got to learn about cleaning up your water, right?

232
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,470
The best way to clean up your water,

233
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,170
if you have charcoal filters, even a Brita pitcher,

234
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,830
go get some zeolite, go to an aquarium shop, okay?

235
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,950
You know, down the aisle where they sell supplies

236
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,850
for maintaining your aquarium and stuff.

237
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,250
And you'll see zeolite,

238
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,790
or they'll call it like an anti-ammonia granular thing, right?

239
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,110
And you get a handful of zeolite.

240
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,510
You buy it.

241
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,910
It's like five bucks for like half a pound.

242
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,530
It's really cheap.

243
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,930
Or low-grade...

244
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,510
I mean, there's kitty litter that's made of zeolite,

245
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,410
but it's really low-grade.

246
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,330
It's too much clay.

247
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,510
Well, this particular zeolite is aquarium-grade

248
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,170
or fish-grade or pet-grade.

249
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,850
It's a type of clay that absorbs radioactivity.

250
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,630
It absorbs fluoride out of the water,

251
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,330
barium, lead, mercury, naturally, okay?

252
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,250
So even if you have like a baloney Brita pitcher,

253
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,670
it's made of acrylic or whatever.

254
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,510
You flush it out with baking soda really well.

255
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,190
You know where that filter drops in?

256
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,530
Just put a couple of handfuls of zeolite in there,

257
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,810
and that'll take out most of the stuff

258
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,170
that causes damage to the brain and the nervous system

259
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,610
and what they're hoping...

260
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,490
If you look at all the water tests,

261
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,690
they never show you uranium, strontium, radium in the water.

262
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,510
They never even test.

263
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,450
They lie.

264
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,130
They put zero.

265
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,690
They never talk about arsenic.

266
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,830
So learn about water purification.

267
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,570
All you need is a handful of zeolite in your water filter, right?

268
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,990
Well, truth here is...

269
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,710
Truth one is saying that it does not remove fluoride.

270
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,550
Brita does not remove fluoride, but...

271
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,110
Do the research on it.

272
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,930
Go do the research on it.

273
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,930
Yeah, well, I have an aqua rain machine myself.

274
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,130
The Brita itself may not remove it.

275
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,410
However, the clay that the gentleman talked is removing it.

276
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,530
Yeah, the zeolite will remove it.

277
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,070
The zeolite is a very specific type of structure.

278
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,730
It's actually an alumina silicate.

279
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,690
Not aluminum, but alumina silicate.

280
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,230
Each little particle has millions of little honeycomb cells in there,

281
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,310
and it also acts as an ion exchange for heavy metals, radioactivity,

282
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,170
which radioactivity is basically heavy metals,

283
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,610
and your fluorides.

284
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,270
It doesn't do all the halides, fluorine, chlorine, and all that,

285
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,350
but it does the fluoride pretty well.

286
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,830
It'll cut it more than 80%, 90%.

287
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,310
The reason why I say Brita is because whenever you see a water filter,

288
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,510
it's like people freak out.

289
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,310
I need a plumber.

290
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,770
You look at these complex.

291
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,030
What if I'm renting an apartment?

292
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,870
What if I live in an RV or whatever?

293
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,050
So you just go to your local store and get a pitcher filter.

294
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,250
You see them at Goodwill for $5, you know,

295
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,910
and just clean it out really well because it's an acrylic plastic.

296
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,250
It gives off nasty stuff.

297
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,030
Oh, it gives off what?

298
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,970
You got cut off.

299
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,390
It's acrylic, so it's got like cryosilane,

300
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,390
you know, the stuff that's in Krazy Glue, you know.

301
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,190
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,850
So what you want to do, these plastics are pretty nasty.

303
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,130
PVC is the worst.

304
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,150
PVC will always give off phthalates, which are estrogen mimicers,

305
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,610
but your acrylic, what you can do for,

306
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,970
this is, again, not the best way to go,

307
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:27,570
but it is a good way, you know, for under $30 or $40,

308
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,690
you can have a kick-ass water filter.

309
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,270
I mean, that really gets the really bad stuff out of the water.

310
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,590
So you basically get the Brita thing and get a box of baking soda,

311
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,430
put half the box of baking soda in it and just clean it out

312
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,170
without the filter, hot water overnight,

313
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,250
and do that for a couple of days.

314
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,690
Now, if you want even better filtration with the Brita,

315
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,690
water, see, those regular filters, carbon filters or what have you,

316
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,890
are not as efficient above 40, 45 degrees.

317
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,670
So if you get your water down, in other words,

318
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,290
if you want to put water in a Brita pitcher,

319
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,310
just put water in a regular pitcher overnight in the fridge.

320
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,090
So when you run it through the Brita, the water is near 39 or 40,

321
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,790
and that makes the filter like 99% efficient for getting out the stuff.

322
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,630
You know, if you filter, see, water at 39 degrees is the anomaly point.

323
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,710
That's where it's densest.

324
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,530
If you lower the temperature from 39, it expands, you know, again,

325
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,610
and, you know, that's why ice expands, right?

326
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,610
So water is its densest, and it's also its healthiest state at 39.

327
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,990
Like your blood, your body is 98.6.

328
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,170
If I raise your temperature or lower it, you don't feel good.

329
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,390
So water feels best at 39.

330
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,510
That's what's called its anomaly point.

331
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,450
So if you want to work with water at 39 degrees,

332
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,250
and coincidentally, most of the fridges are set at 39 degrees.

333
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,890
There's a reason for that, you know,

334
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,690
because everything is basically made of water.

335
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,510
So if you really want a real kick-ass water filter,

336
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,910
and I've done tests on this,

337
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,350
and you still have the minerals in the water.

338
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,950
The thing is, talking about systems, you know,

339
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,550
you just want simple as the best.

340
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,550
And the reason why the simple is the best

341
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,210
and the cheapest is the best sometimes

342
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,450
is because there's no commitment.

343
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,250
If you want to get something else,

344
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,830
it's not like you've invested a lot into it, right?

345
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,990
Yeah, right.

346
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,510
And it's very simple.

347
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,790
Yeah, just spread a filter,

348
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,010
clean it out with baking soda, hot water for a few days.

349
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,850
We keep repeating it to draw those things out

350
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,550
that are in the plastic.

351
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,890
Put it all together.

352
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,290
Whenever you pour water through the Brita,

353
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,050
make sure it's chilled water, pre-chilled, okay?

354
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,610
At 39, you could look up 39 degrees as the densest,

355
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,670
I call it the anomaly point

356
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,230
because any liquid, as you cool it, it contracts, all right?

357
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,610
As you lower the temperature, it contracts,

358
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,250
but water will contract to 39.

359
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,870
If you keep lowering the temperature, it starts expanding.

360
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,770
It's the only element that does that.

361
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,530
So there you go.

362
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,570
I mean, just get a handful of zeolite, you know?

363
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,650
I mean, you go to the aquarium shop and,

364
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,869
hey man, I need some zeolite.

365
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,930
Okay, here it is, you know,

366
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,770
a little package,

367
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,430
and just to make sure you have enough in the Brita.

368
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,250
Actually, you want to rinse the zeolite

369
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,770
because it is a type of clay also.

370
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,170
So you want to rinse it in a bowl so it runs quickly.

371
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,990
Yeah, it would be cloudy, wouldn't it?

372
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,630
It would be really cloudy.

373
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,069
You got to rinse it for a couple of gallons of water, you know?

374
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,390
Or just put it in like a stocking, you know,

375
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,590
like a cheesecloth in a bowl.

376
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,890
But is it a coarse texture?

377
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,130
Is it just a fine powder or what?

378
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,350
It's coarse.

379
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,510
It's like, I'd say, half inch minus, right?

380
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,650
Or typically, the reason I'm suggesting the aquarium one

381
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,590
is because it is coarse.

382
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,710
You're not worried about it clogging the filter.

383
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,110
Pool companies sell it.

384
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,270
It's coarser than sand but finer than kitty litter, right?

385
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,090
It would be like a 10 mesh minus.

386
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,090
But the stuff you get for the aquariums

387
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,590
will do the job for your little Brita thing

388
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,150
because the water,

389
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,590
when you do your pitcher filter deal, right,

390
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,390
you know, the water doesn't rush through right away.

391
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,270
It kind of hangs out.

392
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,550
You have a lot of dwell time, right?

393
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,190
You ever notice if you ever use one of those pitchers?

394
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,270
Yeah, you know what?

395
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,730
I'm getting a question from the group wants to know,

396
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,830
is there a website where we can get the info

397
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,990
for these tubes with the silver film?

398
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,930
No, you got it right here.

399
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,350
If you want to do some just general research on zeolites,

400
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,770
the benefits of zeolites,

401
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,030
look at some scientific papers, you know,

402
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,950
because most of this stuff, you know,

403
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,950
is dedicated to the third grade level reading

404
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,770
that you have in this country

405
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,390
for the people doing pool maintenance

406
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,950
and aquarium, you know, stuff.

407
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,710
But if you, there's a couple of websites

408
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,170
that are scientific papers that talk about

409
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,030
they're using zeolites for mitigation

410
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,190
of radioactive water, arsenic, heavy metals.

411
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,890
Weren't you making water?

412
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,390
Drinking water, I mean.

414
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,930
We synthesize spring water

415
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,870
using Victor Schauberger technology.

416
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,470
As far as I know, we're the only people on the planet.

417
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,670
Actually, there's one other outfit in Germany

418
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,310
that has replicated Victor Schauberger's implosion equipment.

419
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,270
We synthesize spring water.

420
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,370
And it's not something that you would drink all the time.

421
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,610
It's kind of like you would drink it like a good bottle of wine

422
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,310
because it actually costs as much as a good bottle of wine.

423
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,410
And you get high when you drink it.

424
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,910
I mean, it's great.

425
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,250
You know, have you ever had water from a mountain spring

426
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,550
at the source?

427
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,770
No, I don't think I ever have.

428
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,490
Yeah, it's really, to give you an idea

429
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,030
how important it is to Europeans,

430
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,470
I spoke to a fellow that's moved to Arizona from Germany

431
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,750
and he had the water.

432
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,950
So he reminded him of the Edelwasser

433
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,370
that he had 30 years ago in Germany.

434
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,430
When people go on vacation to the country,

435
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,770
they go to the spa, you know.

436
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,030
And these men would go up to the top of the mountain

437
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,530
and come down with black bottles

438
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,410
because you don't want to expose it to any light.

439
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,170
And they were paying 50 Deutschmarks per bottle,

440
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,670
which is about 250 bucks in today's money.

441
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,750
His family did, and his family was working class

442
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,030
because they knew the importance of real spring water.

443
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,410
And it was very difficult to go up there

444
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,050
because you had to be like a billy goat, you know.

445
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,590
You have to get the water before it touches the ground

446
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,550
when it comes out of the rock, let's say.

447
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,830
And a lot of people say it has healing properties

448
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,010
and things like that.

449
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,910
I just, I enjoy it because you get high from it.

450
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,710
I mean, you know, you get this lightheadedness

451
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,730
but exceptional clarity, a lot of energy.

452
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,670
You have to go to the bathroom often

453
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,730
if you're not used to it, you know, number one.

454
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,510
Wasn't Patrick Flanagan doing a lot of work with that?

455
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,130
Vortexing water?

456
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,770
Yes, he was doing a lot of work using

457
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,350
like directed energy pyramid stuff.

458
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,090
But not what, if you look up Victor Schauberger,

459
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:19,230
V-I-C-T-O-R-S-C-H-A-U-B-E-R-G-E-R.

460
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,310
That's a mouthful.

461
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,410
Victor Schauberger.

462
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,090
Yeah, yeah.

463
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,310
His work, he has what's called the repulsator.

464
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,450
Okay, the water goes into an egg-shaped vessel

465
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,450
and it's lined with gold and we use gold, silver

466
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,770
and it has a granite egg-shaped impeller.

467
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,530
And once the vessel is about three quarters full,

468
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,330
we pull a vacuum on it, about two inches of vacuum

469
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,050
and we inject some CO2.

470
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,450
And we still maintain about one inch of vacuum

471
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,390
so the CO2 never goes into the water.

472
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,410
And then the water is vortexed.

473
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,650
It goes up to a very high speed, very gradually

474
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,190
then it's reversed and it's all done at 39 degrees.

475
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,970
And what's interesting when it goes through

476
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,050
an implosion process, you'll see the vacuum

477
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,030
increase on its own and the temperature

478
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,250
increase and then decrease, increase and then decrease

479
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,390
as the water pulsates.

480
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,110
And then after about a half hour of that implosion process

481
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,610
it's decanted in a dark amber bottle

482
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,750
which is put in a foil bag.

483
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,270
So it gets absolutely no light and it's labeled

484
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,770
and it has to be kept at 39.

485
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,490
Can you spell Schauberger again, Stelios?

486
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,330
Sure, S-C-H-A-U-B-E-R-G-E-R.

487
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,710
Even if you don't spell it right, it's pretty popular.

488
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,010
There's been a big revival in his work

489
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,090
and a lot of people talking about vortexing

490
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,070
but no one's really doing it, unfortunately.

491
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,210
I found most of the people that get information

492
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,110
off the internet are more like armchair.

493
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,350
You know, they know a lot about it

494
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,590
but there's actually, they don't really do much with it.

495
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,390
There's so many websites, I'll tell you

496
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,570
they're doing all this stuff.

497
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,090
It doesn't really matter.

498
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,270
Water has to be in the dark, it has to be at 39

499
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,070
and it has to have a vacuum with the presence of CO2.

500
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,010
It has to be an egg-shaped vessel.

501
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,950
No one's really doing that, unfortunately.

502
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,410
There was a book about two years ago

503
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,150
called Secrets of the Soil.

504
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,970
It deals with topics and that is among them.

505
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,930
And Victor Schauberger's Peter Tompkins and Christopher Berg.

506
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,490
And it gives a lot of what seemed to be

507
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,130
magical techniques for use in agriculture.

508
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,870
Correct, yeah.

509
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,350
Never put iron, never use iron tools.

510
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,770
We also make copper tools for gardens.

511
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,430
When you put iron in the ground, it discharges

512
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,270
the electric current in the ground,

513
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,330
the biological current.

514
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,770
It also leaves iron trace elements like the rust.

515
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,770
And the soil relies on capillaries

516
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,590
and these capillaries dry out with the iron.

517
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,930
But if you use copper, it doesn't ground out

518
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,310
the earth's choleric current as iron does.

519
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,110
And the micro bits of metal that are left in there

520
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,110
transmute to magnesium and other elements.

521
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,930
Another guy to read is Louis Kervran.

522
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,290
K-E-R-V-R-A-N.

523
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,970
He showed that you never need to take potassium, right?

524
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,190
You know how they say eat bananas because it has potassium?

525
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,750
If you take potassium supplements or take potassium,

526
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,210
it just comes out in your urine.

527
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,230
Your body produces potassium from sodium.

528
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,390
Transmutation in the body.

529
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,930
All biological creatures have the ability

530
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,010
to transmute elements.

531
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,510
The elements are not empirical or ephemeral.

532
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,790
They're just states of matter.

533
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,710
So when you look at all the elements that exist

534
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,370
that they're showing,

535
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,870
they're only showing I think 90 elements,

536
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,070
but they're really 140.

537
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,870
Those are different states of matter.

538
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,090
There's no such thing as like the element gold,

539
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,530
or silver, or copper, or carbon, or whatever.

540
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,590
Those are just different states of the same thing

541
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,070
and it ties back into the ether

542
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,350
like we started the conversation with.

543
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,090
You can transmute materials.

544
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,770
The body does it.

545
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,110
Louis Kervran's excellent example was

546
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,190
he took chickens and fed them a diet devoid of calcium.

547
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,210
And they still produced very robust eggs.

548
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,430
So where was the, you know,

549
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,710
the eggshell is 90% calcium, if not better.

550
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,870
Where is the calcium coming from?

551
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,590
And they had no bone loss, right?

552
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,810
And he also did a wonderful experiment

553
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,690
and I met one of the folks that were part of the experiment

554
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,130
back in the late 50s, early 60s in the Moroccan desert

555
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,550
with the French military.

556
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,010
He made sure that no one had potassium in their diet

557
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,010
and fed them sodium pills.

558
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,250
You know, they took the sodium

559
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,410
while they were working in the desert

560
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,230
and their potassium levels increased.

561
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,590
And the sodium level was normal.

562
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,730
How did that happen?

563
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,310
Well, because the body produces it.

564
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,580
Your body produces potassium.

565
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,800
Right now my son is producing too much.

566
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,180
Lower the sodium.

567
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,840
The sodium would probably be key.

568
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,100
Do a distilled water for about a week or two.

569
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,660
You know, a distilled water is not good for you

570
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,060
but it could have therapeutic effects for a short time.

571
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,920
It could be for medication.

572
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,100
Well, the reason we're saying,

573
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,760
that's kind of complex.

574
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Who's saying it?

575
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
You know, it's interesting.

576
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,520
You go to the doctor and they check for blood pressure.

577
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,020
They put a cuff on your arm and they inflate the cuff

578
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,880
and it cuts off the circulation to a certain degree

579
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,660
and then the blood builds up this artificial pressure

580
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,880
which doesn't exist and then blasts forward

581
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,040
and then they measure that, right?

582
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,340
That's how the blood pressure works, right?

583
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,960
It's completely artificial

584
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,240
because the blood is not pumped through the body.

585
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,000
The heart does not pump the blood.

586
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,440
It's the most ridiculous thing and no one's noticed it.

587
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,120
I mean, there's a guy named Frank Chester.

588
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,300
Unfortunately, he's an artist and not a doctor.

589
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,360
Otherwise, they would have killed him a long time ago.

590
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,000
He proved 15 ways from here to what they call Sunday

591
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,340
that the heart doesn't pump the blood.

592
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
It's physically impossible.

593
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,200
The bottom of the heart is 330 seconds of an inch thick

594
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,380
which is like the thickness of a plastic card

595
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,200
and you need 60 pounds of pressure to move the blood 4 feet, 60 psi.

596
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,020
So if you've got 2,000 miles of blood vessels in your body,

597
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,440
you need a 1,200 horsepower pump to move it

598
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,080
not even one-tenth of that distance.

599
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
It's impossible.

600
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,380
Well, then how does it do it?

601
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,180
How does the blood move through the body?

602
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,400
That's a big secret, Angela.

603
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,040
Do you want me to reveal it on a minor talk-shoot call?

604
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,160
Excuse me, this is no minor call.

605
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,660
Yes, tell us.

606
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,280
All right.

607
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,160
I'll just cut to the chase.

608
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,820
The blood moves through the body through the capillaries.

609
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,700
You've got over 2,400 miles of capillaries in your body.

610
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,260
The capillaries are what moves them through what's called peristalsis.

611
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,880
Peristalsis is that inchworm effect when you swallow, right?

612
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Like astronauts before they send them out into low gravities,

613
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,960
you know, up in the space station or whatever,

614
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,200
they hang them upside down and they feed them

615
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,260
so they can practice swallowing upside down using peristalsis, right?

616
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,860
It's like an inchworm effect.

617
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,440
Okay?

618
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,520
So in order to put the peristalsis in your throat,

619
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,460
it's simulated by nerves and muscles.

620
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,480
There are no nerves and muscles in the capillaries, right?

621
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,300
I mean, when was the last time you cut a capillary and screamed, right?

622
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,400
So they just, what, contract and expand and contract and expand?

623
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:45,860
Yes.

624
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,500
They contract and expand due to the exchange of gases,

625
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,800
typically oxygen and carbon dioxide,

626
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,300
because it's a permeable membrane, the capillary.

627
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,460
Okay?

628
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
And it's a very easy experiment.

629
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,380
You could take a laden jar, a jar that has two ends on it,

630
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,540
and stretch a porous silicone tube.

631
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,120
Okay, but wait a minute, wait a minute.

632
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,560
When the heart stops pumping or when the heart stops beating,

633
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,820
Yeah, that's the effect.

634
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,900
That's not the cause.

635
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,240
When your heart stops, well, if you have a heart problem,

636
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,520
that is not the cause.

637
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,000
So wait a minute.

638
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,540
So you're saying your heart is beating

639
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,600
because your capillaries are constricting and expanding.

640
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,140
Yeah, well, that's what's moving the blood.

641
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,840
The purpose of the heart is to slow the blood down

642
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,140
so it enters the lungs.

643
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,980
Oh, so it's like a regulator.

644
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,220
It's a regulator.

645
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,340
The bottom of the heart twists, okay, when it beats.

646
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay, first of all, they're telling you

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,100
it lays on a 45-degree angle in your chest,

648
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
and you take an x-ray, right?

649
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,160
But it doesn't.

650
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,940
It's actually, that's two-dimensional thinking again.

651
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,780
The heart lays in a spatial dimension.

652
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,340
You can measure it like a cube.

653
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
In other words, the same width, same height, and same depth

654
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,120
lays on an angle in your chest, okay?

655
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,960
It actually doesn't lay at a 45-degree angle.

656
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,280
It lays at a 36-degree angle

657
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,500
because the diagonal through a cube is not 45, it's 36 degrees.

658
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,480
Okay, and it's that specific angle.

659
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,440
As the blood goes into the heart,

660
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,660
the bottom of the heart, the whole heart seems to contract,

661
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,000
but it seems to contract because it's twisting.

662
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,220
Just like, you know, when you twist a towel,

663
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,660
it seems to get shorter, okay?

664
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,260
And when the blood goes into the heart,

665
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,920
only 70% comes out, 30% still remains.

666
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,780
So you're always mixing new and old in there, right?

667
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,080
And you see, when the doctors take out a heart,

668
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,160
they take the left, I believe it's the left ventricle,

669
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,760
they cut it off and throw it on the floor

670
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
because it's like paper-thin,

671
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,720
and they only look at the right side,

672
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,020
which is a one-inch-thick muscle.

673
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,240
This is your medical schools now.

674
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,540
This is what people pay $50,000 or whatever a year

675
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,280
to get this ridiculous training.

676
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,920
I think it's okay to knock doctors once in a while.

677
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,800
Oh, you have my permission to go right ahead.

678
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
It's just bizarre what they teach.

679
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,060
I mean, you know, so this is, you know,

680
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,840
okay, what's the problem, then, with the heart?

681
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,820
Well, if you go back and look at when fluorine,

682
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,060
bromine, and chlorine were introduced,

683
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,040
or fluoride, into food, into the environment,

684
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,260
and you did a graph...

685
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,240
When was that, by the way? Do you know?

686
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,100
Was it right after the war?

687
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,600
That was after the 50s, where they started it.

688
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,820
It really came in full force in the 70s.

689
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,080
And if you look at how much...

690
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,360
Like, brominated products are flour, right?

691
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,060
It's like, you know, if you go to, let's say,

692
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,640
a health food store and get some flour that's not brominated,

693
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,200
you're like, wow, what does that mean, you know?

694
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,220
Because all the flour products are brominated.

695
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,940
It's like a bleach.

696
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,620
The flour looks pure white, right?

697
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,880
Yeah, what does it mean?

698
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,900
Okay, well, this is what bromine is.

699
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,020
Bromine, chlorine, chloride,

700
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,140
let's say fluoride, fluorine, and iodine, okay,

701
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,280
like iodized salt.

702
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,600
Those elements are in what's called

703
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,440
the halogen or halide groups, okay, on the periodic table.

704
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,560
So iodine, fluoride, chlorine, and fluoride.

705
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,280
Basically, you can look at the halogen or halide groups

706
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,980
on the periodic table.

707
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,380
All those elements, they create a calcification

708
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,080
of soft tissue in the body.

709
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,240
And there's a lot of study on that.

710
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,680
So when they introduced, you know, the brominated flour,

711
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,000
the iodized salt, the fluoride in the water,

712
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,260
it starts building up plaque on the arteries.

713
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,260
I remember you telling me that we shouldn't take calcium

714
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,000
because calcium helps solidify cement.

715
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,580
No, well, calcium, you can't really use calcium.

716
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,900
I mean, you can, but the best place to get calcium,

717
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,400
believe it or not, is vegetable.

718
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,280
It's the most biologically compatible.

719
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,740
And if you need a shot of calcium,

720
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,300
obviously dairy products, okay, or a calcium supplement.

721
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,540
But the issue is the halide group elements

722
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,660
that I just mentioned, okay, the brominated flour,

723
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,240
the iodized salt, the chlorine in the water,

724
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,820
even from taking a shower, and the fluoride in toothpaste

725
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,380
and the fluorides in the water,

726
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,620
those elements basically create calcification.

727
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,680
I shouldn't say calcification,

728
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,520
but it creates a hardening of the soft tissue.

729
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,920
It also damages the pineal gland in the brain.

730
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,160
It damages and it shrinks the brain.

731
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,120
Any soft vital organ tissue,

732
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,300
and that's what causes most of what's called heart disease

733
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,620
from the research that I've done.

734
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,980
And I'll debate any heart specialist or any doctor

735
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,040
or any scientist on this in any capacity.

736
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,060
And there are many papers written on this,

737
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,980
and I've presented a few of them showing how this is the effect.

738
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,040
You know what they say?

739
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,340
Well, that's only for mammals.

740
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,280
That's not for humans.

741
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,200
That's what their answer is.

742
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,460
But humans are mammals.

743
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,260
You see what I mean?

744
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,580
It's like they play the word game.

745
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,560
It's like I can't look at that because if I look at that,

746
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,100
I'll have to put on an orange reflective vest

747
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,360
and a plastic broom, right, for a living.

748
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,760
People are asking how they can get in touch with you

749
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,540
if they wanted to.

750
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,219
Do you want to give out an e-mail or anything?

751
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,179
I haven't set myself up for being public.

752
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
I mean, yeah, I chime in to a talk show

753
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,699
or whatever once in a while or a radio show or something.

754
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,219
Yeah, I'm glad you came on.

755
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,620
I haven't heard from you in a while.

756
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,920
I met you when you were in California.

757
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,460
Sorry about that.

758
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,199
Yeah, I frequent there.

759
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah, one of these days I'll get to meet you in person.

760
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,199
But, yeah, that's basically this group,

761
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,239
and thanks a lot.

762
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,400
I chimed in because, you know,

763
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,800
my favorite part of it is talk about the ether and the weather.

764
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
And the chemtrails.

765
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,139
Well, no, I love it when you come on.

766
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,520
Well, thanks.

767
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,520
Yeah, the chemtrails, you know, you've got to just find out why.

768
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,120
It's a sci-op.

769
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,020
You know, someone from the inside is going to come out

770
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,220
and really give the information.

771
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,060
I believe there's plenty of information already out there,

772
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,720
but I gave you my take on it.

773
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,760
It's a three-part thing.

774
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
If you breathe their air, drink their water,

775
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,700
and eat their food, you're up Schitt's Creek.

776
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,760
Okay, so what about them, though?

777
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,440
The powers that be that are doing this?

778
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,180
Are they immune?

779
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,720
Are they lizards or what?

780
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,140
David Icke says they're reptilians.

781
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,440
Yeah, they exist, but they're not lizards.

782
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,840
No, they're not lizards.

783
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,960
But, yeah, are there lizards that stand upright

784
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,140
and can talk and kick your ass or whatever?

785
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,000
Sure, of course, but not here that you could see, right?

786
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,360
When was the last time you went down Ventura Boulevard

787
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,220
and saw one, you know?

788
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,980
Well, you never know.

789
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,520
Yeah, you never know.

790
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,340
I don't buy the David Icke stuff.

791
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,740
It's more the bloodlines than probably looking lizard-like, right?

792
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,300
Yeah, the bloodlines are the bloodlines.

793
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,960
If I talk about the bloodlines, okay, what about your bloodline?

794
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,940
You know, figure it out.

795
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,340
That's more important than someone else's, right?

796
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah.

797
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,220
I don't know.

798
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,720
It's all about bloodlines.

799
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,860
It always has been and it always will be.

800
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,840
Well, yeah, I mean the banking cartel family

801
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,920
is pretty much considerate and important.

802
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,900
The queen thinks it's important.

803
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,120
It's called pedigree, right?

804
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,640
Yeah.

805
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,480
Yeah, I mean, you know, but that's not, you know,

806
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,880
what does that have to do with chemtrails?

807
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,380
I don't know.

808
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,220
Well, what I'm asking is, well, I usually say this to people,

809
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,280
is we don't drink what they drink, we don't eat the food they eat,

810
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,200
and we don't breathe the air that they breathe, and we don't

811
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,500
because they have their own farms and their own ranches

812
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,580
and their own wells and their own airspace.

813
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,700
Well, look, if you could put two and two together, Angela,

814
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,040
let me just do a quick recap.

815
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,760
If the weather can be controlled with a stupid little cardboard tube

816
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,700
with some reflective thing and a red LED,

817
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,960
and your body transmutes sodium into potassium,

818
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,560
and the heart doesn't pump the blood,

819
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,740
could we actually have the power to transmute all those toxins

820
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,100
before we put them in our body simply with our thoughts?

821
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,080
I hope so.

822
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,340
I hope you're going to say yes.

823
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,440
Absolutely.

824
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,180
Are you confident?

825
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
Do you have the faith of a mustard seed, right?

826
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,700
Right.

827
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,860
Which means it'll take much once you learn it.

828
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,520
And what about eat anything, eat any poisonous thing

829
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
and it will not harm you?

830
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,180
Well, here's the thing.

831
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,220
The thing is, if you walk around every moment thinking about that,

832
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,320
it's going to make you crazy.

833
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,900
What you do is you learn how to transmute, okay,

834
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,880
just like riding a bike.

835
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,840
You know, it's tough in the beginning, but then once you learn,

836
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,820
you never forget, you just jump on a bike and go, right?

837
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,620
Right.

838
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,820
So you just do it all the time.

839
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,620
And just the thing is, you know, the way we'll finish off with this,

840
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,660
do you have interest in anything here in the way it is,

841
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,260
or do you have an objective reality that you're just visiting this place?

842
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,680
Personally, I think we are the artificial intelligence we strive to create,

843
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,820
and I believe this is one big giant computer simulation that we live in.

844
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,160
So don't ask me.

845
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,140
It's all artificial, and in order to be artificial,

846
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,680
the word means you need an artificer, which is an artist.

847
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,460
Someone made it.

848
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,620
Divine intervention.

849
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,360
Also known as divine intervention.

850
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,420
Yeah, but you see, divine, we've got it wrong, too,

851
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,100
because, see, man's kingdom is up and down, vertical.

852
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,480
You've got the king sitting up high and the street sweeper at the bottom, right?

853
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,220
But the divine kingdom is a lateral kingdom.

854
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,660
You're either on the left of the throne, on the right of the throne.

855
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,760
You ever notice how Eve came out of Adam's side, right?

856
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,740
Everything is lateral.

857
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,040
You're in or you're out.

858
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
Man's system is vertical.

859
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,220
You know, when someone says, you know, you ask a 5-year-old child,

860
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,420
where's God, and they point up to the sky, you know?

861
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,920
They don't point next to you.

862
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,640
You see, so everything is backwards.

863
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,360
I mean, absolutely, and here's the most ridiculous thing.

864
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,620
But they also say as above, so below, right?

865
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,200
Yes, as above, so below, right.

866
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,860
Now, is that vertical or is it lateral?

867
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,180
I guess it depends where you're standing and how you're standing.

868
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,360
I mean, if you're sideways.

869
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, when you look above, here's the other big lie.

870
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,080
This is the big lie, okay?

871
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,240
You know, we always talk about the legal stuff and the banking,

872
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,060
but maybe taking a break is a good thing.

873
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,160
You know when they show you a model of the solar system?

874
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,060
They show you this thermonuclear sun in the middle,

875
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,480
all the planets in neat revolving orbits going around it, right?

876
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,400
Yeah, we already know.

877
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,340
It's like it's in a wake.

878
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,420
The sun is like a meteor, right?

879
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:57,740
Exactly.

880
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,340
And we're all, the planets are following in a wake behind it, right?

881
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,320
Yeah, exactly.

882
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,400
Right.

883
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,940
It's not thermonuclear at all.

884
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,660
It's a rock.

885
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,500
Nassim Harriman.

886
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,480
Do you know who Nassim Harriman is?

887
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,060
Someone once sent me a video back.

888
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,600
He doesn't quite have it all together.

889
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,960
He still thinks the sun is thermonuclear, I think.

890
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,780
Is that true? I'm not sure.

891
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
I don't think so.

892
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,880
I think he's more brilliant than Einstein, I swear.

893
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,440
Einstein wasn't happy.

894
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,700
Absolutely.

895
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,760
I went and saw him in person in Santa Monica.

896
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,860
He was an amazing guy.

897
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,640
No, he's a good guy.

898
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
Einstein was like Lee Harvey Oswald.

899
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,160
You know, Lee Harvey Oswald had 20 witnesses

900
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,940
saying he was in front of the soda machine

901
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,320
when the shots rang out, right?

902
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,580
Oh, I don't know.

903
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,240
I wasn't alive at the time, so.

904
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,600
Right.

905
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,620
It's all propaganda.

906
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,580
Einstein was just put in front of everyone

907
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,160
like everybody else is put in front of everyone.

908
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,700
Yeah, so we're trailing behind.

909
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,120
So if the sun speeds up,

910
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,620
well, you see the surface of the sun is like a comet.

911
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,600
So when you look at a sunspot,

912
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,960
that's like the eye of the hurricane.

913
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,860
The surface of the sun is black, right?

914
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,720
And it's not hot.

915
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,280
Yeah, I think he believes it's electromagnetic or something.

916
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,820
Yeah, it's inductive.

917
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,820
But here's the thing.

918
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,520
When the sun speeds up, it gets brighter.

919
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,300
If it slows down, it gets dimmer, right?

920
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,860
Now, due to vortex shedding,

921
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,920
you know, like something in something else's wake

922
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,500
spins faster when the wake speed increases, right?

923
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,340
So when the sun speeds up in the next 20 years

924
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,140
and it gets brighter,

925
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,880
the Earth is going to go from a 24-hour day scenario,

926
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,880
you know, 12-hour day, 12-hour night, basically,

927
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,020
to a 16-hour day scenario,

928
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,640
8-hour day, 8-hour night.

929
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,440
And it's going to get really hot for a few months.

930
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,840
Yeah, but will we really, will we,

931
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,080
I mean, it's so gradual a change.

932
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,240
Will we even notice it in our lifetime?

933
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,860
Oh, yeah, it's coming.

934
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,060
It's just around the corner.

935
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,600
And the powers that be try to hint, global warming.

936
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,240
They're not telling you which globe, right?

937
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,740
Well, I think that,

938
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,240
I think the sunspots and the,

939
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,180
the, what do they call it?

940
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,120
The GMEs?

941
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,180
Yeah, solar mass ejections.

942
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,060
They always come back.

943
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,120
You notice that they never show a photograph or a video of anyone?

944
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,640
I think those are what's controlling the weather here

945
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,540
and why we're having such odd weather.

946
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,560
No.

947
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:19,960
No?

948
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,360
Yes and no.

949
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,740
Yes and no.

950
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,360
Both.

951
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,920
You have a vertical,

952
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,840
as we're trailing behind the sun,

953
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,380
it looks like we're like,

954
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,980
imagine a teardrop laying on its side.

955
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,260
The sun is on the front end

956
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,400
and the planets are all up until about the center of that teardrop

957
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,020
and the back half of it is all empty right now, right?

958
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,640
There's also a vertical vortex that goes through, right?

959
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,680
If you put your hand through water, right, to spiral it,

960
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,740
you'll notice there a vortex is going 90 degrees to the main,

961
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,260
you know, one, okay?

962
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,660
That's where the other objects come in from.

963
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,550
I'll leave it at that.

964
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,750
I know.

965
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,390
I'm trying to follow you there.

966
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,550
Say that again or explain it again.

967
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,530
The rest of the planets, aren't they the same?

968
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,810
Just look at basic vortex shedding, okay?

969
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,310
If you, let's say, run a basketball through water,

970
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,770
you get a wake behind it, right?

971
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:16,990
Right.

972
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,290
But if you look very carefully, right below that wake,

973
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,830
there's another wake going vertically 90 degrees to it,

974
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:24,990
not horizontal.

975
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,890
Lots of little ones, right?

976
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,010
Those are the positions of the planets,

977
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,850
and they also go up very far.

978
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,890
And that is like a vacuum,

979
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,650
so if you need to visit a solar system,

980
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,590
you want to ride one of those vertical wakes.

981
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,350
Okay.

982
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,030
Yeah, so interstellar,

983
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,870
I don't know if you want to get interstellar travel,

984
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,350
but basically everything they're telling us is a lie.

985
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,210
Absolutely everything.

986
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,170
Oh, I already know that.

987
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,270
I think we all know that.

988
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,410
And here's the thing,

989
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,470
the most degrading thing you can do to a man or a woman,

990
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,690
and their offspring, okay?

991
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,410
The most degrading thing you can do to anyone is grade them.

992
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,130
Think about it.

993
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:09,330
What do you mean?

994
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,390
Say that again, I'm sorry.

995
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,710
The most degrading thing you can do to anyone is grade them.

996
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,090
Right.

997
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,510
What do they do in school from kindergarten all the way up?

998
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:20,910
Oh, sure.

999
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,730
Well, yeah, and degrees,

1000
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,450
isn't that all a Freemasonic thing?

1001
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,450
No, well, I got no problem with the Freemasons.

1002
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,650
I would join them in a heartbeat

1003
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,310
if they weren't doing what they were doing

1004
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,670
because they have keys to a lot of ancient knowledge.

1005
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,550
But the problem is they don't know how to read these things, right,

1006
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,130
because they went to these school systems.

1007
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,810
But they're just a side note.

1008
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,760
How do you account for your unusual perspective?

1009
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:50,490
I'm sorry?

1010
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,070
How did you slip past the brainwashing of academia?

1011
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,590
Oh, well, they started moving me up through school,

1012
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,270
and they finally kicked me out at a very young age,

1013
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,670
and then they wanted me to go to these universities for free,

1014
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,410
and I went there, and the professors told me,

1015
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,510
what are you doing here?

1016
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,490
You could teach this class.

1017
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,110
Get out of here.

1018
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:09,770
So I did.

1019
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,630
I was always on the outside.

1020
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,850
I asked questions since I was very young.

1021
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,090
But in order to be objective, you can't take interest.

1022
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,990
For example, people call me up and say,

1023
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,610
oh, this basketball game is on.

1024
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,830
And I'm like, all right, let me turn it on.

1025
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,070
And I watch these guys in uniform chasing the ball back and forth,

1026
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,570
back and forth.

1027
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,310
I said, listen, guys,

1028
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,930
I said, no, this doesn't make any sense to me at all whatsoever.

1029
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,940
Because objectively, if I had to take notes and send them back home,

1030
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
let's say, to another planet, let's say,

1031
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,020
I can't say I'm into this team or that team.

1032
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,940
I've just got to explain what these people are taking interest in, right?

1033
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,920
So you just have to have objectivity.

1034
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,600
You can watch your clothes there.

1035
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,440
Say that again?

1036
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:58,900
What?

1037
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,320
Well, the movement in a basketball game is not a great deal dissimilar

1038
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,960
from the movement of different colored clothes in a dryer.

1039
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,560
Right.

1040
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,480
Actually, watching the dryer spin is a little more interesting than television,

1041
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,860
which I don't have anymore.

1042
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,820
The vortex is more evident there in the dryer.

1043
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:19,900
Yeah.

1044
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,280
Everything is moving in a spiral, like a 364 degrees in a circle, right?

1045
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,440
Because you can never draw a perfect circle.

1046
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,720
You know, triangles, they tell you that should add up to 180 degrees.

1047
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,580
If you add up all the internal angles, it's physically impossible.

1048
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,420
Go out with a tape measure and lay out a triangle,

1049
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,040
the internal angles will always add up more than 180 degrees

1050
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,840
because you can't draw a straight line.

1051
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
Everything wants to curve and spiral.

1052
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,220
So once you get away from this linear thinking that they're giving you,

1053
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,600
this two-dimensional thinking,

1054
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,960
they have to wrap up everything in two-dimensional sense,

1055
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,980
and there is no such thing.

1056
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,400
They keep it two-dimensional because you can't interact with it.

1057
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,000
It's just yes, sir, no, sir.

1058
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,330
But the universe is one of scale, not of dimension.

1059
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,910
In other words, if they're telling you planets are orbiting around the sun,

1060
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,850
have you ever walked down the street or in nature seen anything orbiting around anything?

1061
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:18,350
Never.

1062
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,570
The universe is one of scale, not of dimension.

1063
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,750
Dimension is an illusion.

1064
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,010
The whole thing is part of a big computer program,

1065
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,270
and we're being controlled by the moon.

1066
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:37,810
Well, in essence, Angela, we are nothing more than God's thought emanation.

1067
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,520
We're in someone's thoughts, and it's kind of hard to even conceive that concept,

1068
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,920
and I'm not saying that as a fact.

1069
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,900
This is maybe trying to be poetic.

1070
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,820
I like it.

1071
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,780
At some point.

1072
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,900
Well, listen, look, this whole existence is more a lesson for all the other,

1073
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,660
let's say, races, okay?

1074
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,100
Because if you read the Bible, it's very clear.

1075
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,280
It says the heavens, which are three heavens.

1076
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,440
You have the sky, right, and then you have outer space,

1077
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,680
and the third heaven is a realm that's not tangible to us.

1078
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,020
The book of Isaiah says the heavens are inhabited.

1079
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,580
It doesn't say there's just bacteria out there.

1080
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,300
It's inhabited.

1081
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,820
In order to be inhabited, you're in stewardship role, you're in creation role,

1082
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,520
you're in, you know, we're being watched.

1083
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,560
The earth is universe central right now.

1084
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,200
Interesting.

1085
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,220
And you've got time.

1086
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,840
Time ended in 1998.

1087
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,240
Everyone's like, oh, the end's coming.

1088
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:41,960
What are you talking about?

1089
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,640
It already ended, man.

1090
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,340
You're in the credits version of the movie.

1091
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,320
The movie ended in 1998 in the fall.

1092
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,600
You're in the credits right now.

1093
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,340
What's great about the credits is if you want to shoot a two-hour film,

1094
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,740
you don't get two hours of film, you get two hours and ten minutes

1095
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,200
because you've got to roll the credits, right?

1096
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,040
And what's interesting about the credits is let's say you have a character

1097
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,300
in the first few minutes in the first scene of the movie,

1098
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,200
you don't see him again for the rest of the film.

1099
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,500
He shows up one more time, doesn't he, in the credits.

1100
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:19,140
So what you're going to see for the next, you've got about 20 some odd years left

1101
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,560
in terms of the way things are.

1102
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,200
You're going to see all these very unusual new ways of doing things

1103
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,500
which are nothing more than things that are of ancient time.

1104
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,500
Very, very interesting.

1105
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,880
So you've got to know the history, but the real history,

1106
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,500
not that, you know, Christopher Columbus discovered America.

1107
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,320
How could that be?

1108
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,540
There are already people here, right?

1109
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,390
So, you know, you've got Adam, right, who's the new kid on the block, right?

1110
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:46,790
Yeah.

1111
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,310
So, you know, what's the deal here?

1112
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,230
Well, learn how to keep time.

1113
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,670
I think we spoke about it a while back, you know?

1114
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:58,870
Yeah.

1115
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,650
Learn your equinoxes, your months or your moons,

1116
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,410
and your day starts at noon, period.

1117
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,270
How hard is that?

1118
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,610
If you learned it in school, you know, it would be natural.

1119
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,530
Even the Naval Observatory, who is the timekeeper

1120
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,910
on their Julian calendar date section of their website, says,

1121
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,970
the day starts at noon for scientific and astronomical purposes,

1122
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,310
but for the people and civil reasons, it's midnight.

1123
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,610
What did they just say?

1124
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,850
For those of us that, you know, want to pursue the truth,

1125
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,530
the day starts at noon, but for the cattle, it's at midnight.

1126
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,790
Keep us in the dark.

1127
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,510
Yeah, midnight is an illusion.

1128
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,930
You know, you have the day starts at noon, period.

1129
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,290
Noon is when the shadow is dead on north.

1130
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,090
You get no shadow to the east, no shadow to the west,

1131
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,010
and it lasts for, you want to measure it down to a thousandth of a second,

1132
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:50,930
you can do that.

1133
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,670
And this is how it's been done forever, I mean, up until the 1700s.

1134
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,050
You know, they used to do in common law courts a trial in the morning

1135
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,570
and they hang you the next day if you were found guilty.

1136
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,950
Right?

1137
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,810
Well, they did the trial in the morning, and when did they hang them?

1138
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,830
At high noon.

1139
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,950
So, it's all over.

1140
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,190
I mean, it's just that, you know, in Genesis,

1141
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,730
it says there was evening, there was morning, the first day.

1142
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,570
Evening is noon.

1143
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,550
Evening starts at noon. Morning ends at noon.

1144
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,650
How many times do people catch themselves, they say,

1145
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,230
you know, good morning, you know, it's like 12.05,

1146
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,870
and say, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, good afternoon, you know.

1147
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,690
Well, I think the point is to take advantage of sunlight, right,

1148
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,930
and get the most you can out of the daylight hours.

1149
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,350
I mean, you know.

1150
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,930
That happens naturally because you always have 12 hours in the day,

1151
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:49,030
no matter what, because you have the sky divided into 10 sections,

1152
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,070
then you've got your first hour before the sun rises,

1153
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,050
and you've got your last hour after the sun is setting, right,

1154
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,810
after it's below, the disk of the sun is below the horizon.

1155
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:03,230
In religious circles, they say, oh, yeah, you know, sundown, you know,

1156
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,910
sundown, that's an hour, man.

1157
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,230
There's no precision in that.

1158
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,350
It's all in the Bible.

1159
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,410
It's all in all the books, in the Koran, it's in the Bhagavad Gita,

1160
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,350
the Mahabharata, Rig Veda.

1161
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,850
Day starts at noon, period.

1162
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,430
It's in your old scientific literature.

1163
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,650
So why do we go to school and take everything that we are taught

1164
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,550
or told as gospel?

1165
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,070
Why?

1166
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,830
Are we such inferior creatures that we don't have the inspiration

1167
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,150
to double-check what we're being taught?

1168
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,710
We're just so gullible.

1169
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,250
It's like, why?

1170
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,970
Okay, you ever see a chihuahua?

1171
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,290
You know, put a chihuahua in a natural environment,

1172
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,090
how long do you think it's going to last, right?

1173
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,250
It becomes very dependent, and when you run into chihuahuas,

1174
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,030
they've got a big attitude problem, right?

1175
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,400
So, I mean, this is what I say.

1176
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,280
I say there used to be people, men and women.

1177
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,680
Now you have these creatures called human beings,

1178
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,380
which are a subspecies of people bred by bad food and bad education.

1179
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,440
Yeah, instead of evolving, I think they've devolved the population

1180
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,220
down to inferior status, really, because...

1181
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1182
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
And it's all...

1183
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,280
No one put a gun to your parents' head to send you to school

1184
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,080
or eat whatever, or, you know, not you, but anybody.

1185
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,140
It's a slow cultural thing because people don't want divine law.

1186
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,460
And it's a small group of people that have led the group away.

1187
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,320
That's why you have shepherding, right?

1188
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,560
You know, if you have an evil shepherd, the flock goes to its demise.

1189
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,320
If you have a good shepherd, the flock prospers, doesn't it?

1190
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,480
So you've had a pretty evil shepherd on this earth.

1191
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,860
That's why I say this whole thing, I mean, no hard feelings,

1192
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,960
but this is as much of a lesson for the spirit of man and woman

1193
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,500
as it is for the other ethereal beings out there.

1194
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,660
So, you know, that's why I keep saying this is universe central

1195
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,100
in terms of the attention that we're getting.

1196
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,940
And it's going to get really, really harsh.

1197
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,300
I mean, if anyone...

1198
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,840
I mean, there's no hope at all in what people know.

1199
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,020
In other words, you know,

1200
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,420
oh, we've got to make the environment better.

1201
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,680
We're talking about the environment.

1202
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,140
The environment is your water, your river.

1203
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,280
We're hypocrites.

1204
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,960
If you see a society talking about the environment,

1205
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,160
you go down to their rivers,

1206
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,920
and if their rivers are running like a sewer or they're dried up,

1207
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,920
hypocrites.

1208
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,340
The river is your environment, period, your water.

1209
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,820
You know, everything is just backwards.

1210
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,280
It's just completely...

1211
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,060
There's no hope in any system right now on the planet,

1212
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,140
whether it's alternative.

1213
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,420
Yeah, solar and wind.

1214
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,180
Yeah, my foot.

1215
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,360
You know, that's ridiculous.

1216
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,260
You know, that's so ridiculous.

1217
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,900
I mean, in the New Age movement,

1218
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,040
all the religions, I mean,

1219
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,460
there's no hope in any of that.

1220
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,220
You're going to have to wait until the veil is lifted,

1221
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,220
and I'm sure that's a common terminology.

1222
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,840
Just have hope in yourself.

1223
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,300
Look to yourself.

1224
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,860
Don't look to anybody else to do anything for you.

1225
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,140
Well, here's the thing about hope in yourself.

1226
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,740
You just got to be flexible to the point where

1227
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,780
relieve yourself of arrogance, rebelliousness, and stubbornness,

1228
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,980
because if you read the scriptures,

1229
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,340
it says people are so stubborn,

1230
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,740
you have to kill them twice, right?

1231
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,820
That's why there's the second death.

1232
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,280
So anyway, I don't want to get into that,

1233
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,820
but the thing is we're just too stubborn,

1234
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,740
and we're too...

1235
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,360
as a group, unwilling to change,

1236
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,040
and it's got our mindset, you know, too much.

1237
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,600
And everything that people are calling good is actually,

1238
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,120
if you read it with some comprehension,

1239
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,120
you'll look at it, and you're like,

1240
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,200
ooh, this is pretty benevolent, you know?

1241
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,820
And there's no hope in what people see being put out there,

1242
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,320
whether it's mainstream or not.

1243
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,680
In it, there's no hope in it.

1244
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,240
In other words, you can't rely on it,

1245
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,000
because it's all going to fall apart at the seams.

1246
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,180
It already is, you know?

1247
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,240
And you got to understand also the Elohim,

1248
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,720
the Creator God, and His crew, okay?

1249
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,960
Because I consider myself part of the ground crew, okay?

1250
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,740
Because if I could get off this rock, I would.

1251
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,100
That's cute.

1252
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,280
Right?

1253
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,660
That's what Nassim Harriman says.

1254
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,200
We need to get off this planet.

1255
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,660
Yeah, you need to get off it if you can.

1256
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,020
That's my first suggestion.

1257
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,280
They're very, very efficient.

1258
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,260
You know, when I used to run construction sites,

1259
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,380
I told people, if you're not efficient with something,

1260
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,020
God's going to take it away from you.

1261
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:19,720
Okay?

1262
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,340
So they're very efficient.

1263
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,560
So if these beings showed up now,

1264
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,960
people would be so afraid.

1265
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,320
They would board themselves up into their houses,

1266
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,240
and they would starve to death better than opening the door.

1267
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,100
That's how scary it would be if they showed up right now.

1268
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,480
So what do they do?

1269
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,260
They set up, he allows things to go to pot,

1270
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,240
and this Antichrist figure comes in,

1271
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,700
this one-world government, one-world ruler.

1272
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,520
He creates a very highly regimented society,

1273
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,640
reduces the world's population down by, you know, 75%, 80%,

1274
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,100
especially when you look at the natural disasters

1275
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,440
and the two asteroid hits we're going to get near the Mediterranean Sea.

1276
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,340
And then you've got this situation.

1277
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,900
Okay, so then the Antichrist declares himself as God.

1278
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,640
So what happens?

1279
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,620
God comes in, kicks him in the ass,

1280
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,820
throws him in the lake of fire, boom.

1281
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,960
Now you've got a society already set up, okay,

1282
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,900
in a highly regimented order, and you start all over.

1283
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,340
These are beings of very high efficiency.

1284
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,980
You know, it's not the –

1285
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,160
if you look at all the religions,

1286
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,920
what the religious figures are portraying in these things, man,

1287
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,700
I mean, it's like, you know, please, you know,

1288
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,980
tooth fairy department, save me.

1289
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,760
You know, if you read the scripture, the crisis,

1290
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,020
I didn't come for any of you all.

1291
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,760
I came here to do a particular job.

1292
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,240
They only had 12 people around them.

1293
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,400
Even out of those 12, one of them couldn't handle it.

1294
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,980
He had to go to the other side.

1295
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,300
So, you know, it's kind of ridiculous.

1296
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,980
I mean, I find the people on this planet to be pretty ridiculous.

1297
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,580
I mean, I'm sorry.

1298
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,560
Except here.

1299
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,660
Except here in our nice, neat, little, tidy group.

1300
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,400
Yeah, yeah, but I mean, in general,

1301
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,720
the reason why I say that is because it's like, you know,

1302
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,780
you can't tell anybody anything really

1303
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,620
unless they're ready to hear it even then.

1304
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,520
It's not even a matter of –

1305
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,860
the reason why it's important for my opinion,

1306
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,000
people to wake up,

1307
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,280
it's not so we could sit here and take windy walks

1308
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,360
and talk about these things.

1309
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,720
It's because I want to know what part of the equation

1310
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,000
they could bring to the table, you see.

1311
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,080
Because if someone's not awake,

1312
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,910
what are they going to bring, you see?

1313
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,790
So the reason why you want people to wake up,

1314
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,970
because everyone's got this exceptional talent

1315
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,090
that they each, you know, bring something in,

1316
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,910
and then that's how you develop and go to the next level,

1317
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,850
like in a video game, in a way.

1318
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,070
Dr. Joe McCord.

1319
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,210
That was weird.

1320
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,090
Dr. Joe McCord, huh?

1321
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,370
Well, that's very interesting.

1322
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,350
You always have so much interesting stuff to say.

1323
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:05,810
Okay.

1324
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,930
It's been a while since you've been on.

1325
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,990
I'm glad you came on.

1326
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,010
Well, thanks.

1327
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,330
Yeah, again, I heard this stuff about the ether.

1328
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,150
Chemtrails, yeah.

1329
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,590
Yeah, chemtrails, you've got worse problems than chemtrails.

1330
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,950
You've got worse problems,

1331
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,730
which I'm not even going to get into, much worse.

1332
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,770
But yeah, yeah, but that's also in the scripture.

1333
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,470
Look up, you'll see signs in the sky.

1334
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:30,210
Don't be afraid.

1335
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,730
Yeah, I guess that's just another thing.

1336
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,670
You've got worse, much worse things than chemtrails.

1337
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,050
I mean, and what's amazing to me is

1338
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,930
it's right in front of everyone, and people don't see it,

1339
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,590
and it's just like, wow, you know.

1340
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,790
All you've got to do is put two and two together.

1341
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,970
What's worse than chemtrails?

1342
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:53,310
Nuclear war?

1343
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,170
Oh, you're already in nuclear war.

1344
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,230
You already have a bunch of nukes being used on this country,

1345
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,310
and broad daylight, three of them,

1346
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,610
ten years ago, and no one said anything.

1347
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:06,610
Well, what are we going to say?

1348
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,280
Yeah.

1349
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,520
What is anyone going to say against,

1350
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,520
you're talking about, you know, the powers that be.

1351
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,720
We need to go directly to the powers that be.

1352
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,780
We need to freeze their assets,

1353
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,820
string the suckers up,

1354
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,940
and eliminate all their bloodline families.

1355
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,200
I'm sorry, but that's the only way.

1356
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,760
Well, here's the thing.

1357
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,200
Marco Polo, there's a book of travels of Marco Polo,

1358
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,800
conquests of Marco Polo, whatever.

1359
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,720
Okay.

1360
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,500
So, you know, there's dinosaurs,

1361
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,000
and I think it's in chapter 14,

1362
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,000
you know, what they call dinosaurs,

1363
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,760
these giant lizards, you know,

1364
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,480
that were pulling the emperor's chariot,

1365
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,060
and these villagers went up to the mountains

1366
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,260
to get away from this snake

1367
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,960
that was like 50 feet long and 6 feet in diameter, right?

1368
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,080
Okay.

1369
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,740
So, they found out that if you look at all the counties

1370
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,960
throughout Europe, especially in Austria,

1371
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,680
the county records going back five, six hundred years,

1372
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,760
there were these giant lizards.

1373
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,060
They call them dragons, okay?

1374
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,880
They would come in and eat people

1375
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,620
because people were expanding and encroaching on their turf.

1376
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,180
Just like today, if there was a grizzly bear in downtown L.A.

1377
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,340
that ate a mother and a child,

1378
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,320
everybody with a rifle would be there in 15 minutes

1379
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,840
and it wouldn't happen again for a very long time, right?

1380
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,220
So, but not everyone's got that kind of firepower.

1381
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,160
So, what you do, well,

1382
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,600
people that didn't have the ability

1383
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,860
to fight these creatures off,

1384
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,760
they found out what their feeding habits were,

1385
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,060
and they just cut them off from their food supply.

1386
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,630
Yeah, well, that's what they're doing to us, I think.

1387
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,530
You know, they've got us all brainwashed.

1388
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,090
What are the powers that they feed on?

1389
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,670
What are the powers that they feed on?

1390
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:47,930
Well, they feed on your signature, right?

1391
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,030
Okay.

1392
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,530
They feed on, you use credit, you know, the whole thing.

1393
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,110
Forget about 10 to 1,

1394
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:55,830
it's more like 980 to 1 now with the signatures.

1395
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,950
So, like I said, just fend for yourself.

1396
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,730
Don't rely on them for anything.

1397
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:04,250
Don't use anything that they've provided as a convenience

1398
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,790
or a benefit or privilege, right?

1399
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,590
So, what's old is new.

1400
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,590
How did people live thousands of years ago?

1401
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,130
Well, you know, I believe the car,

1402
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,190
the automobile is a wonderful invention

1403
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,590
because if you had a horse,

1404
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:18,410
whether you use the horse or not,

1405
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,730
you still have to feed him, water him,

1406
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,850
and groom him every day.

1407
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,910
If you have a car and you don't use it,

1408
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:23,610
it just sits there.

1409
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,490
It's cheaper than a horse, right?

1410
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,490
So, I mean, there's certain things, you know,

1411
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,650
just, you know.

1412
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,160
Somebody else wants to chime in here.

1413
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,680
Hey, Jay Horses, what did you want to say?

1414
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,800
Well, he brought up a good point about not signing anything.

1415
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,440
And, boy, when you're in court,

1416
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,780
they try so hard to get you to sign all kinds of stuff.

1417
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,300
And they try to extract your birth date out of you.

1418
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,160
But as I told you last week, there, Angela,

1419
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,360
I was going into court,

1420
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,220
and you wanted me to call you and tell you about it.

1421
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,560
So, that's kind of what I'm going to do.

1422
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,940
Oh, okay, good.

1423
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,220
I'm going to sign out.

1424
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,160
Thank you, Angela.

1425
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,540
Okay, but stay on, Gregg,

1426
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,640
in case, you know, you want to pipe in again.

1427
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,060
Okay, thanks.

1428
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,740
Thank you.

1429
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,880
All right, hey, Jay.

1430
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,020
Very interesting stuff he had, the other guy there.

1431
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:34,520
But, anyways, I had kind of an incident,

1432
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,300
actually, a week ago.
