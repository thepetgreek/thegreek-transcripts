1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Hey Day, I'm out.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,540
Talk Sheen.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,320
Recorded live.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,940
Hello everybody, it's January 16th, 2011, 8 o'clock p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,640
Welcome to the Divine Mind Group community call.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,940
We have a special guest speaker called The Greek.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,380
If you could give a little bio about yourself a little bit or what you're going to talk about,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,280
we'd be more than happy to hear it.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,180
And anybody else on the call, if you're not muted, please dial star six to mute yourself,

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,220
and it's obviously star six to unmute yourself when the guest speaker is ready to take questions.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,760
So out of respect, please do that.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,940
The floor is yours.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,320
Thank you.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,820
In terms of bio, I have pretty much the same biology as everybody else, no pun intended.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm just visiting this planet, taking notes is the perspective that I have on it,

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,020
and it's been quite a journey, quite a visit to this wonderful earth that we're on.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,640
Started this journey about eight years ago, and still on it.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,080
And finding out stuff every day, and I'm finding out things are not exactly how we're

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,040
either perceiving them or told about them or even see them in many cases.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,580
So I started sharing this with people and getting mixed results,

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,200
but I kind of stayed on the path and kind of kept everything to myself for a while,

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,840
and occasionally I'll speak out and occasionally I won't.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,160
And when I say kind of stayed on the path, at some points you have to focus

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,800
and go narrow and deep into a subject instead of being wide and broad.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:58,580
But without that wide and broad view, you don't get bearings of what you're good at to focus on.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,300
It's like we all have natural talents and natural things that we're drawn to.

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:10,200
So we've got to focus most of our energy on what we've been given in the talent department,

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,180
but also we can't be limited and we have to look around and look at other things,

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,300
because that's what I found, the generalities and general statements and general ideas

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,720
generally get us in trouble.

31
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,370
So with that said, I do have the floor, but I'd like to maybe run it the other way around.

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,670
I've done some public speaking, and whenever I've done public speaking,

33
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,630
I look at my audience, I look at their eyes, and I'm wondering if they're actually listening to me

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,110
or they're thinking, when is he going to shut up so I can get the microphone?

35
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,090
So with that said, are there any questions at this point?

36
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,110
Yes, I have a question.

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,330
Okay.

38
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,430
I'm James Gibbs's brother.

39
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,070
Okay.

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,470
And my question to you is, he said I could ask you in regards to bankruptcy.

41
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,460
All right.

43
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm not an expert in economics or anything like that.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,470
I don't know.

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,750
Is he on right now?

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,800
I think he might have you confused with someone else.

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:48,220
Yeah, I really think the call tonight is not really Frank or Brian Collins

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,660
or even Michael Joseph and David Merrill.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,760
Now, it's possible that MJ and David will be on next weekend, but not necessarily.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
It may be the week after.

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,200
Now, we've had Frank O. Collins and Brian Collins on.

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,360
But tonight, Greek is really going to kind of go into etymological terms,

53
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,459
where many things come from.

54
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:28,080
It's not necessarily an economic background, but more of, wow.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,420
It might be scriptural-oriented type terms and things that we've roped into

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,740
and believed into.

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,400
And the etymological roots might give us great insight into what has happened

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,160
in the political and the religious perspective paradigm that has helped bring us

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,640
into this roped-in economic predicament that we have found ourselves in.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,740
I think that might be more the order of this particular call tonight.

61
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,020
Is that fair enough for you, young man?

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,780
When I was speaking with my brother today, he was saying that we are all slaves

64
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,420
to the pope and money has no value.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,380
He was probably telling you that.

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,820
I'd like to address that, Gary.

67
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,840
If you just hold onto that question for maybe 20 minutes or so,

68
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,660
I might be coming around that even sooner.

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,340
I just also want to mention, I do have some notes on my computer.

70
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,320
My computer is not working well, but I can go off of memory.

71
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,220
But if the fellow that's asking the question, if you just sit back,

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,260
maybe, like they say, enjoy the ride.

73
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,700
See, maybe I'll answer your question from a different angle

74
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,480
or a different point of view, and maybe I'll give you a way to look at it

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,660
that you'll be able to answer it yourself.

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,720
Okay. How long is this call usually? Is it about an hour?

77
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,180
No, we can run up to about three hours just about without even popping a whip,

78
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
if you know what I mean.

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Okay. And you're also available on Skype, I do believe, if I'm not misunderstood.

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,320
I don't know about the Skype business,

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,400
but we'll figure out how in the hell to get to your program.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,480
You got a handle on that?

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,760
You bet. Thank you.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Thanks.

85
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,820
Well, thanks. Thanks for clearing it up for me, Gary.

86
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,940
Go ahead, brother. You got the floor.

87
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,700
Throw the rope on him. What are we going to get?

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,660
What are we going to get for him? Run him on through and bring him on by.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,720
Go ahead, Brother Groot.

90
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,620
You guys ever heard of dihydrogen monoxide?

91
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,900
This is a rhetorical question. It's a chemical compound.

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,200
And when you start thinking about dihydrogen monoxide,

93
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,740
you could look up what dihydrogen monoxide is.

94
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,220
It sounds pretty intimidating. You got the word monoxide in there.

95
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
We know monoxide's not good.

96
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,980
And dihydrogen monoxide sounds pretty volatile.

97
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,680
A lot of people scratching their heads saying,

98
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,660
what the hell are you talking about? What's this dihydrogen monoxide?

99
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,480
People say, what do you do?

100
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
I say, well, I work a lot with dihydrogen monoxide.

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
And they're like, never heard of it.

102
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,040
Well, dihydrogen is two hydrogens and monoxide is one oxygen.

103
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,940
So it's H2O.

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,480
So it sounds very intimidating when you call water dihydrogen monoxide.

105
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,460
And I'm going to get to the computer because, you know,

106
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,680
most people, when you give them a bit of information,

107
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,340
they run to the Internet, which is actually a wonderful thing.

108
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,560
I mean, you've got millions and millions of books and files

109
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
and things like that on the Internet.

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
That is much easier to access in the library.

111
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:03,180
So if you put in dihydrogen monoxide in the Internet search

112
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,840
and you go to one of the most popular references on the Internet,

113
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,560
it's Wikipedia.

114
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,540
Now, when you click on it, Wikipedia there,

115
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,900
it's going to say the dihydrogen monoxide hoax is a deception

116
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,920
that involves the use of an unfamiliar name for water.

117
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,620
Okay, then by listing some negative effects of this chemical,

118
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,039
attempts to convince people that it should be carefully regulated,

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,740
labeled as hazardous or banned.

120
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,020
This hoax was designed to illustrate how the lack of scientific literacy

121
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,700
and exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.

122
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,960
And I could have not written that better myself.

123
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,100
When I found that recently, I was just jumping up and down

124
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,960
and saying, finally, a simple way to explain what's going on.

125
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,380
So you say, well, what's going on?

126
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,860
Okay, I'll give you a simple example.

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,920
You ever notice when someone comes back from war,

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,700
they get shell shock and they can't sleep at night.

129
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,660
They just can't take the trauma and the battlefield experiences.

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,320
They just can't reckon with it once they get out of that environment

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,700
and go live back at home.

132
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,860
So it's been called shell shock.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,380
And I remember growing up and meeting World War II vets

134
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,580
and Korean War vets and Vietnam vets.

135
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,820
See, a lot of them would go to the doctor to get some treatment.

136
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,860
But today, if you come back from war and you've got shell shock,

137
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,960
you go to the doctor and he'll tell you, I've got nothing for shell shock,

138
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,240
but I can treat you for PTSD, which is post-traumatic stress disorder.

139
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,780
What's the difference?

140
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
It's the label.

141
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,280
Okay, and if you start looking at how things are being labeled

142
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,640
and what they really are, you might get a much clearer picture

143
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,620
on what's going on in your world and the world around you

144
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,980
and in your thought perception area.

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Because that's the thing that can be cleaned up.

146
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,640
A lot of people talk about being brainwashed.

147
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,420
Well, how about just washing your brain?

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,780
Think about the term brainwash.

149
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,660
It's very negative, but just washing your brain sounds a little different.

150
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,300
Same word.

151
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,390
So what are we being...

152
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,570
What's shown as being real scary?

153
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,650
And I like to use Wikipedia because it's simple to read.

154
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,590
It's not the be-all, end-all reference

155
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,050
because there's a lot of funny business going on there.

156
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,030
But once we learn how to read, we kind of see things a little clearer.

157
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,830
I've been hearing a lot of things about viruses lately.

158
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,530
So what I do is I go to...

159
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,690
Okay, you know, you see they're telling everybody everything.

160
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,950
These viruses are really scary, you know,

161
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,490
and you've got to be protected against them.

162
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,190
So I just go to Wikipedia and hit virus, okay?

163
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,730
So, you know, you're just visiting this planet,

164
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,970
so you want to make things easy for yourself.

165
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,590
So you just look at what everybody else is looking at,

166
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,330
and you want to look at information that's easy to get to.

167
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,110
So, okay, virus, you know, you go to etymology,

168
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,270
you know, they give you the whole thing,

169
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,530
history, origins, microbiology, classification.

170
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,370
Scroll down. Okay, etymology.

171
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,130
Wow, one of my favorite subjects.

172
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,190
Okay, the word is virus.

173
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,630
It's from the Latin word virus referring to a poison

174
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,950
or other noxious substances.

175
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,130
You know, first used in English, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

176
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,950
Okay, history.

177
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,310
Here comes this guy, Louis Pasteur.

178
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,970
Okay, we know a little bit about him, so let's go down.

179
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,930
All right, origins.

180
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,390
Viruses are found wherever there is life

181
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,270
and have probably existed since living cells first evolved.

182
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,190
Operative word, probably.

183
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,470
Okay, so these guys don't know either.

184
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,530
Okay, so viruses, okay, then you have the regressive hypothesis.

185
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,650
Viruses may have been once small cells

186
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,830
called whatever parasitical large cells.

187
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,110
Okay, wait a second.

188
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,690
The operative word viruses may have once been,

189
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,410
so they don't know anything about that either.

190
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,690
They're just, you know, still searching.

191
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,170
Then you got the cellular origin.

192
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,090
Some viruses may have evolved from tiny bits of DNA.

193
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,210
Okay, so there's that word may again.

194
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,570
So they don't know.

195
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,710
Okay, then we go to the coevolution hypothesis.

196
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,990
This is also called the virus first hypothesis

197
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,070
and proposes the viruses may have evolved.

198
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,930
Okay, so they still don't know what they are.

199
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,990
You go to life properties and microbiology.

200
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,230
It says opinions differ whether viruses are a form of life

201
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,690
or organic structures that interact with living organisms.

202
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,730
Okay, so they're just telling me they don't know

203
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,370
and maybe this might be that.

204
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,390
All right, so we keep going down this long, complex article

205
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,830
and you'll start seeing that they really don't know.

206
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,790
They'll just show you certain observations.

207
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,530
But what they do know, we scroll back up to etymology

208
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,170
and they got the operative word here is.

209
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,410
This is the word is from Latin referring to poison.

210
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,190
Okay, so the only thing they know about viruses

211
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,730
is that it's a poison.

212
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,570
All right, so if it's a poison, well,

213
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,570
then we're in the virus category.

214
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,830
We put that aside for now.

215
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,230
Now, what do poisons do to a living body?

216
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,610
Because I have a living body.

217
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,850
And what category would that be?

218
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,210
Well, maybe that's toxicology, right?

219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,970
So we look up toxicology and let's go back to Wikipedia.

220
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,510
And, you know, because that's common

221
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,550
and it's written on a modern day 8th grade level

222
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,710
or 100 years ago a 3rd grade level.

223
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,610
And we go to toxicology from the Greek word meaning toxicos

224
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,730
or poisonous.

225
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,290
Okay, so I guess if they know viruses are poisons

226
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,710
and toxicology is poison,

227
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,990
well, I know I'm at the right place here.

228
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,390
So we go to history.

229
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,630
Okay, and you start reading about, you know,

230
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,710
when they've been working with poison

231
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,630
and they know a poison.

232
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,910
But, you know, so I'm wondering, you know,

233
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,150
they got chemical toxology

234
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,030
and they got toxicity of metabolites.

235
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,870
Wow, okay, well,

236
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,330
these are things that are organic and, you know,

237
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,410
metabolic in nature, let's say, right?

238
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,370
So let's start reading that, see what it says.

239
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,130
I'll skip around and you'll see how

240
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,230
what's being disclosed to us

241
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,250
and we're not picking it up.

242
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,530
So many substances regarded as poisons

243
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,970
are toxic only indirectly.

244
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,230
Okay, indirectly, that means that,

245
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,070
all right, it's not direct.

246
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,050
So maybe I've got a way of getting it out of my body.

247
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,690
But okay, let's go back to the text.

248
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,890
An example is wood alcohol, and you go on,

249
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,430
formaldehyde, formic acid,

250
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,610
okay, things in the liver.

251
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,950
Okay, they're talking about, okay, as for drugs,

252
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,490
many small molecules are made toxic in the liver.

253
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,310
Okay, they're not telling you maybe,

254
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,810
they're telling you they are in the liver.

255
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,710
A good example being acetamiphen,

256
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,770
especially in the presence of chronic alcohol use, okay.

257
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,410
Genetic variability of certain liver enzymes

258
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,990
make the toxicity of many compounds differ

259
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,050
between one individual and the next

260
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,590
because demands placed on one,

261
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,950
here it is at liver again,

262
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,570
one liver enzyme can induce activity in another.

263
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,450
Many molecules become toxic

264
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,050
only in combination with others.

265
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,690
A family of activities that many toxicologists engage

266
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,230
includes identifying which liver enzymes,

267
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,170
here's that liver again,

268
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,630
convert a molecule into poison.

269
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,230
What are the toxic products of the conversion

270
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,490
and under what conditions and what, okay,

271
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,670
so you could keep reading.

272
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,990
So what they do know about toxicity

273
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,770
has a lot to do with the liver

274
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,470
and when poisons get into the liver,

275
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,270
certain poisons,

276
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,210
the liver has enzymes in it

277
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,450
that will change those poisons

278
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,250
into different poisons that will harm you,

279
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,230
but they do know that

280
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,450
and they keep using that liver

281
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,290
over and over and over again.

282
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,350
So now that we know that viruses,

283
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,590
they know that viruses are poison

284
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,150
but they don't know a lot about much of it,

285
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,150
they just propose or maybe.

286
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,570
I'd rather go on what they know

287
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,810
than what there may be.

288
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,650
So if it's a poison,

289
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,050
it has to do with your liver.

290
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,010
So if you've got viruses,

291
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,210
what do you know about cleaning out your liver?

292
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,170
Do you see how simple this is?

293
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,990
If I just came out and say detox your liver,

294
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,870
would you have gotten it

295
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,550
unless I took you through this long road?

296
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,270
But it was actually,

297
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,670
it wasn't a long road at all.

298
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,150
There are people that pay 100,000 bucks

299
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,870
to get a degree in this stuff.

300
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,020
So that's just one point.

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,120
Now I'm not saying what,

302
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,640
this is the be all end all,

303
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm not a doctor

304
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,860
and I haven't gone into their labs

305
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,660
and researched it,

306
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
but this is what they're putting out

307
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,540
on a very basic reference.

308
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,200
That's correct.

309
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,800
If you detox the liver,

310
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,859
then you make the body live longer.

311
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,079
So what you're saying makes absolutely perfect sense.

312
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
Deep hammer down, go ahead.

313
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,400
Well, you see what I'm saying?

314
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,480
I just basically,

315
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,260
all this was,

316
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,619
I was just reading from Wikipedia

317
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,900
and they're telling you

318
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,460
viruses are poison

319
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,480
and then poisons develop in the liver

320
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,380
and the liver actually

321
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,000
turns some things into poison.

322
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,960
You can take something benign.

323
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,700
So what's going on?

324
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,560
Why is everything so scary?

325
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,780
Why are we being,

326
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,240
you see,

327
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,260
if you look, okay,

328
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,020
from a political point of view,

329
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,880
let's look at what's going on right now.

330
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,700
It's real simple,

331
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,180
real simple.

332
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,580
You can deduce everything

333
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,680
and the thing is,

334
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,980
I do want to get to,

335
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,560
to show also the various layers

336
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,140
of what's going on

337
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,000
and I guess I'm starting at the bottom,

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
but sometimes it's,

339
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,300
that's the best place to start.

340
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
If you look at what's called

341
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,820
the democratization of the world right now,

342
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,220
okay, and you know,

343
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,800
some people think it's a good thing,

344
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,360
some people think it's a bad thing.

345
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,120
Well,

346
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,920
why does everyone have a different opinion on it?

347
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,900
What does that word actually mean?

348
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,090
Okay, so

349
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,210
let's go and look at the suffix.

350
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,050
It's a Greek word.

351
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,350
The suffix craci,

352
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,750
C-R-A-C-Y

353
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,950
in an etymological dictionary

354
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,590
is simply,

355
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,330
means state

356
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,390
for a government

357
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,510
or a form of rule.

358
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,050
But the demos part,

359
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,050
now,

360
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,350
a lot of these dictionaries,

361
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:57,590
you know,

362
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,710
when you do a lot of studying

363
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,610
and law and stuff,

364
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,570
don't they tell you,

365
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:02,990
well,

366
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,070
you got to get an old one

367
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,130
because they've changed

368
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,710
the most recent ones.

369
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,450
Yes, they have.

370
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,290
But they cannot completely hide it,

371
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,570
the use of words,

372
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,210
because we're actually using them.

373
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,870
So,

374
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,350
how do we find an old term

375
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,610
or definition for the word

376
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,210
D-E-M-O?

377
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,550
Now, another thing I want to mention

378
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,450
is

379
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,470
words are phonetic,

380
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,730
so the spelling changes.

381
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,510
Like, for example,

382
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,310
shop in this country is spelled

383
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,770
S-H-O-P,

384
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,610
but in England,

385
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,630
it's S-H-O-P-P-E.

386
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,430
And the same with theater,

387
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,410
it's different over there,

388
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,590
but if you,

389
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,870
it's not really how you spell it,

390
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,590
it's how it sounds.

391
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,890
So you can look at it...

392
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,810
Robert Fox.

393
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,470
What's that?

394
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,610
Robert Fox was a guy

395
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,650
I met in Texas in the 90s,

396
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,910
hell of a fine guy.

397
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,550
And, man,

398
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,410
he was deaf on buying

399
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,130
old dictionaries,

400
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,450
like

401
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,630
the three-volume Bouvier,

402
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,630
was it 1906 certified,

403
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,660
1868 or 28 Webster's,

404
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,490
going back to Black's Law 1,

405
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,870
I mean, things like that.

406
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,450
Yeah.

407
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,770
And I don't know,

408
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,330
but I got a sniff out there

409
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,910
and I kind of think I smell

410
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,150
that guy in the background,

411
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,690
but

412
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,150
you keep going

413
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,630
because you do it real good.

414
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,050
I just kind of want to acknowledge

415
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,530
because I really appreciate

416
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,370
what you're doing.

417
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,830
So if they're hiding something,

418
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:29,750
you see,

419
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,610
I think conspiracy theories

420
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,870
are overrated.

421
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,950
I think everyone's getting caught up,

422
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,570
like a dog chasing their tail,

423
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,730
wondering what are they hiding here?

424
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,450
What's the Vatican hiding?

425
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,450
Who are they hiding here?

426
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,570
What information is being hidden there?

427
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,030
I don't think they're hiding anything.

428
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,610
If we learn how to discern,

429
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,690
we will find...

430
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,610
Well, I shouldn't say

431
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,550
they're not hiding anything.

432
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,610
They are hiding some stuff

433
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,850
and maybe later on in the call

434
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,750
I might explain what it is,

435
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,590
at least from what I have perceived.

436
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,770
But

437
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,990
if we want to look at,

438
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,030
go back to the

439
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,430
democracy

440
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,390
or what the word means,

441
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,790
it's obviously a Greek word.

442
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,970
Well, if it's not obvious, it is.

443
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,390
And you could look up the suffix,

444
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,690
crossy meaning government or state.

445
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,210
And the word demos is usually

446
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,990
translated or

447
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,150
in dictionaries as

448
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,110
of the people

449
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,890
or masses.

450
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,230
Right?

451
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,470
But, you know, that's a nice way to sell it.

452
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,250
But the root word, demos,

453
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,870
you can find it.

454
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,770
It's either spelled D-E-M-O-S

455
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,490
or D-I-E-M-O-S.

456
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,590
Well,

457
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,150
the most common usage of the word that

458
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,590
I would consider to be most accurate

459
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,330
would be the two moons of Mars.

460
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,090
So, if anybody wants to just research that on their own,

461
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,710
I'm not going to get into it right now,

462
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,110
what that word actually means.

463
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,110
What are the two moons of Mars?

464
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,390
Just look them up.

465
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,730
You got Phobos, which means fear.

466
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,930
And what does demos mean?

467
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,370
D-E-M-O-S

468
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,570
or D-E-I

469
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,790
or D-I-E-M-O-S.

470
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,690
You can look that up on your own time.

471
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,030
And that's your head,

472
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,210
the meaning of that.

473
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,710
And your tail is your crossy, which means state.

474
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,510
You see?

475
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,870
So, once you figure out what that word really means,

476
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,970
look at the two moons of Mars,

477
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,510
what the definitions of those moons are,

478
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,510
Phobos and Deimos.

479
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,210
Go ahead and put crossy on the tail end of Deimos,

480
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,610
and that'll just paint you a clear picture

481
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,510
on what's going on.

482
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,170
It washes away all these conspiracy theories.

483
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,510
It kind of reminds me of Beau Gratz.

484
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,750
It's called head-up rectus, in a sense.

485
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,710
Could be.

486
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,390
Let me just throw this in.

487
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,690
Okay, I'll just say it.

488
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,010
The moons of Mars are Phobos and Deimos,

489
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,770
meaning fear and terror.

490
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,830
Yep.

491
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,890
Does that make any sense to anybody?

492
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,370
Yeah, and Mars would be called the hill of war, wouldn't it?

493
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:18,630
Yeah.

494
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,930
So, you see what's being put in front of us

495
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,670
essentially can be called the whole truth

496
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,810
and nothing but the truth.

497
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,170
It's just that we can't see it.

498
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,070
So, you know, one thing that got me started

499
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,670
on this journey of what I call critical thinking,

500
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,250
it might be my own brand of it,

501
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,170
but I do share,

502
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,330
if you start going on a road of critical thinking,

503
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,090
you're going to find there's a lot of other people

504
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,310
you can jam with on it,

505
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,070
you know, just like musicians jam, you know?

506
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:49,850
Oh, yeah.

507
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,790
And everyone's going to bring a piece,

508
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,670
a new piece to it,

509
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,010
and you're going to end up making music,

510
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,990
which is really neat.

511
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,250
Yeah, we got to kind of go to the woodshed,

512
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,390
do a little wood chopping.

513
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,950
Yeah, and it's not only people,

514
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,470
but you'll see that entire societies and cultures

515
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,210
have been given a piece of it, right?

516
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,230
Right.

517
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,290
And what got me going after the truth

518
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,630
or the use of words and communication and language

519
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,990
as a technology

520
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,570
was when I found,

521
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,770
someone once told me that man doesn't make law,

522
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,070
he makes codes and statutes.

523
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,450
So I said, where do you get law?

524
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,530
He said, you go to the Bible for that.

525
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,310
And I said, the Bible?

526
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:29,890
What are you kidding?

527
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,050
That's written by Shakespeare.

528
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,830
You know, so I was like, well, wait a second.

529
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,130
You know, how do you knock it

530
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,850
if you don't know anything about it, right?

531
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,050
So I went and got one

532
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,490
and started reading just the law parts of it.

533
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,370
And I was like, wow.

534
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,890
And as you start reading the law parts of it,

535
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,730
you're like wondering,

536
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,490
how come I wasn't told any of this?

537
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,970
And then you might start running across words

538
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,010
like Lord and God and playing.

539
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,730
Wait a second.

540
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,270
I was watching TV the other day

541
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,390
and there was a Lord right there in England making a speech.

542
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,270
They can't be, what's going on with this L-O-R-D stuff?

543
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,030
Then you look a little deeper

544
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,170
and you look a little deeper.

545
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,890
Now, before I picked up the Bible,

546
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,190
I was looking at books like the Bhagavad Gita

547
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,690
and the Mahabharata.

548
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,250
And those are the books of the Hindu culture.

549
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,890
People that call themselves the Hindu religion.

550
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,810
And by the way, that word's not in that book.

551
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,670
And when I started studying it,

552
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,750
I was looking at it and saying,

553
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,630
wait a second.

554
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,150
They're not really doing what I read.

555
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,150
They're not really.

556
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,590
I mean, they're saying they're not eating meat.

557
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,910
And here, well, yeah,

558
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,250
it shows you the ups and downs of not eating meat.

559
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:47,910
Okay, whatever.

560
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,530
They want to do things a certain way.

561
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,070
That's fine.

562
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,490
I just thought it was very odd.

563
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,130
They weren't following it.

564
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,790
Then I read a book called the Koran.

565
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,590
And I knew some Muslim people

566
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,010
and I go up to them and I say,

567
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,870
hey, you're Muslim, right?

568
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,210
How come you're doing that?

569
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,630
I mean, I'm going to read you some verses.

570
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,230
What book does this,

571
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,670
what book do these verses come out of?

572
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,750
And they're like, hell if I know.

573
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,750
I said, it's your own book.

574
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,470
You never read it?

575
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,300
And the same thing with Christians or Jews.

576
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,520
I said, you know, why are you guys,

577
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,180
I've read your book, right?

578
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,760
Theoretically,

579
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,740
they're supposed to use the Bible, theoretically.

580
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,860
And I asked them,

581
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,840
how come you guys are doing this thing to your,

582
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,980
you know, I don't see any amendments or addendums.

583
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,260
What's going on?

584
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,240
So for a period of about two years,

585
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,700
I thought I was losing my mind.

586
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,220
And I was like, oh, wait a second.

587
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,320
I got to catch up to the program.

588
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,700
Nothing is as it seems.

589
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
No one's following any rules.

590
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,860
At all.

591
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,500
No, they just kind of make them up as they go.

592
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
And they make them up as they go.

593
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,420
And here's the wonderful part about it.

594
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,040
You ready?

595
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,340
When you read their own books,

596
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
when I say they,

597
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,260
meaning the religions of the world,

598
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,120
and what they're using as the base

599
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,080
for their religion,

600
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,760
just like the base for money should be gold and silver,

601
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,300
they've completely debased

602
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,620
what they're doing.

603
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,780
It's like having money that's not backed by anything.

604
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,800
Does that sound familiar?

605
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,860
Oh, yeah.

606
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,060
So it's completely debased,

607
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,880
and they're operating on some kind of weird

608
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,460
spiritual credit system.

609
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,100
And I started looking at it a little closer

610
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
and finding out the meanings of words,

611
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,840
and it got, you know,

612
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I found out that

613
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,780
every level's got it,

614
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,540
the lie changes on every level.

615
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,020
So when you think you've got one aspect of it

616
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,760
and that's the truth,

617
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,020
and you look at it a little closer,

618
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,040
you put it down, come back,

619
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,840
look at it a little closer,

620
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,180
you're like,

621
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,220
wait a second,

622
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,400
this can't be right either.

623
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
And you just keep going,

624
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,860
peeling that onion away.

625
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,640
And so I found out that

626
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,700
pretty much everything is debased.

627
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,000
You know,

628
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,080
I spoke to a nurse recently,

629
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,800
and I said,

630
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,380
well, you know,

631
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,640
how is it working there?

632
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,340
She goes, basically,

633
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:14,980
you come in,

634
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,040
and, you know,

635
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,780
you go to a doctor,

636
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,480
and it's basically,

637
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,480
we got hair treatment,

638
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,180
penis enlargement,

639
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,740
antibiotics,

640
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,980
and painkillers.

641
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,140
Okay, we do that really, really well.

642
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,730
Do you get my point?

643
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,850
So, I'm thinking, wow.

644
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,650
I do.

645
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,350
We need to check out the computer

646
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,910
and see what your symptoms are

647
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,810
so we can know what we can tell you.

648
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,830
Yeah.

649
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,770
So it's really some,

650
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,170
I'm seeing this everywhere.

651
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:52,570
You know,

652
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,370
I'm starting to see this

653
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,930
on every level.

654
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,130
I started seeing,

655
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,550
you know,

656
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,210
in the,

657
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,370
in what they call,

658
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,570
I call the Holy Writs of the world.

659
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,530
That's a simple way to communicate

660
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,210
to the everyday guy on the street

661
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,570
and say,

662
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,270
I'm reading about Holy Writ.

663
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,310
Now, everybody on,

664
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:12,610
you know,

665
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,250
when you say that,

666
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,550
they go,

667
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,850
well, you're reading about the Bible?

668
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,650
I say, well, no,

669
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,270
there's a lot of Holy Writs that the world has,

670
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:18,850
and guess what?

671
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,730
They're all in agreement,

672
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,330
but you guys aren't.

673
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,240
They're all in agreement.

674
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,380
You know,

675
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
if you start looking at what

676
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,420
is written in the Bhagavad Gita

677
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,600
and the Mahabharata,

678
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,020
which is the Hindu text,

679
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,820
it's called the Hindu text,

680
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,140
it is in complete agreement

681
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,200
with what's called the Bible.

682
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,380
And if you read the Koran,

683
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,040
it is in complete agreement

684
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,420
with what you call the Bible.

685
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,080
Yes, it is.

686
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,600
And if you start reading, let's say,

687
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,120
the Egyptian Book of the Dead,

688
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,080
or the Book of Osiris,

689
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,120
it is in agreement.

690
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes, it is.

691
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,020
They're all talking about

692
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,060
this third-dimensional physical existence,

693
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,300
and it's information about

694
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,400
things that we do not see.

695
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
It's information about

696
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,460
things that are

697
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,160
the way things should be

698
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,820
and the way things can be.

699
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,020
Period.

700
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,160
Yes.

701
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,080
And they all say the same thing.

702
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,320
Now,

703
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,820
when I first started finding out

704
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,500
about all this,

705
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,860
how no one follows the book,

706
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,700
I would go out

707
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,520
and start telling people.

708
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,060
You know?

709
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes.

710
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,240
And using their own book

711
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,860
as a reference.

712
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,900
I'm saying their own book,

713
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,560
you know,

714
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,560
it's not their own book,

715
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,000
but what they subscribe to

716
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,940
as the base.

717
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,040
You know,

718
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,120
what's backing up

719
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,600
your quote-unquote belief?

720
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,560
And by the way,

721
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,280
look up the word believe,

722
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,040
it's the word belie,

723
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,180
which is

724
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,920
it's a lie.

725
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,880
That's why I say,

726
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,660
well, you know,

727
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,480
I believe, I say,

728
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,040
listen, brother,

729
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,560
I don't care about what you believe.

730
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,720
Tell me what you know.

731
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,500
I want to know what you know,

732
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,560
not what you believe.

733
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,780
Yes, it's kind of like Hindu.

734
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,580
Hindu is a British term,

735
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,360
but yet it really meant

736
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,540
in you is to do,

737
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
but that was not

738
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,820
what the Hindus

739
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,200
really called

740
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,460
or knew about themselves.

741
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,360
Entirely different.

742
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,460
I agree with you 100%.

743
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,160
Well,

744
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:14,740
yeah,

745
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,040
go look at how many times

746
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,900
the word Christians

747
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,420
actually,

748
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,340
even in your King,

749
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,240
in King James,

750
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:19,800
they've really,

751
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,200
I might get into that

752
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,020
a little bit later

753
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,340
or actually maybe

754
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
sooner than later,

755
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,600
but if you look

756
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,560
at the original text,

757
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:26,780
though,

758
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,540
the word Christian

759
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,340
is used twice

760
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,920
and it's not

761
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,100
in very good light,

762
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,160
if you know what I mean.

763
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,740
One,

764
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,420
in one way,

765
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,260
it's not very good

766
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,840
and the other way,

767
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,680
it's very ambiguous

768
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,140
and you keep going

769
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,900
and the word Muslim

770
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,240
used,

771
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,520
I mean,

772
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,240
if you want to just

773
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,280
research that on your own,

774
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,220
anybody could plug in

775
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,740
these terms

776
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,680
and if you have a question

777
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,180
about any of the holy writs

778
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,400
of the world,

779
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,240
you know,

780
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,300
there's some pretty good

781
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,860
search engines out there

782
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,200
that I was not familiar with

783
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,860
when I was doing

784
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,740
this longhand.

785
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,000
So,

786
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,880
if you've got a question

787
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,700
like, for example,

788
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,960
you know,

789
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,000
why don't Hindus

790
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,180
eat meat or something

791
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,660
or why do Muslims

792
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,540
hate the Jews,

793
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,100
for example,

794
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,440
and put that question

795
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,900
in a simple query

796
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,440
and you'll get

797
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
a lot of perspective

798
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,220
on it.

799
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,100
But you're going

800
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,720
to have to read

801
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,380
it very much

802
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,280
the same way

803
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,360
that I gave

804
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,060
an example

805
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,020
earlier about

806
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,160
describing the virus

807
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,860
as a poison

808
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,460
in the liver.

809
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,470
Now,

810
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,250
that's just one way

811
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,930
to look at it.

812
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,770
I'd like for someone

813
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,590
else to look at it

814
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,250
another way,

815
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,390
but don't come

816
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,230
showing me something

817
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,370
you saw on television

818
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,210
or something written

819
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,090
in an advertisement.

820
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,010
Yeah,

821
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,490
because it's all been

822
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,270
a public mindset

823
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,290
reformatting

824
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,990
much as Bernays,

825
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:41,830
the nephew

826
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,470
of Freud did,

827
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,570
and then they

828
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,390
picked it up

829
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,110
and they've

830
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,910
massaged it,

831
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,850
shall we say,

832
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,690
and now we've

833
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,370
come up with

834
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:51,950
all of these

835
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,030
modern terms

836
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,690
and Michael

837
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,710
Tessarian has

838
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,830
exposed a heck

839
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,750
of a lot of things.

840
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,150
But you're doing

841
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,390
a real good job

842
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,050
kind of getting

843
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,710
in that deal.

844
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,390
Go ahead and

845
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,210
pull the slats

846
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,830
out of it,

847
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,210
Greek.

848
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,610
I mean,

849
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,910
just put the

850
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,690
hammer on.

851
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,190
I mean,

852
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,350
we might as well

853
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,310
just blow their drawers

854
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,050
off while you've

855
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,890
got the opportunity.

856
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,410
so here I've

857
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,130
been running down,

858
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,670
again,

859
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,490
knocking my head

860
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,390
against all

861
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,130
people that

862
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,390
have,

863
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,110
they believe in

864
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,370
something,

865
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,890
so I don't

866
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,410
believe in

867
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,150
what you do,

868
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:20,990
and I'm like,

869
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,150
well,

870
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,650
what do you

871
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,350
believe in?

872
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,030
And they'll

873
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,510
give me a

874
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,030
particular

875
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,750
flavor or

876
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,190
brand or

877
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:26,570
religion,

878
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:27,490
and I'll

879
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,150
pull out their

880
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,870
reference and

881
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,270
they'll say,

882
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,570
okay,

883
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:29,790
well,

884
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,390
this is not

885
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,030
to challenge

886
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,230
them,

887
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,970
maybe hopefully

888
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,630
to enlighten

889
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,230
a brother or

890
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,610
a sister,

891
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:34,950
right?

892
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,790
So I've

893
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,010
gotten,

894
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,770
it's strange,

895
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,270
this is the

896
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,890
response you

897
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,050
get,

898
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,950
and I actually

899
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,690
printed it out.

900
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,050
It says,

901
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,330
looks like you

902
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:43,790
answered it

903
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,190
yourself.

904
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:44,610
However,

905
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,410
my personal

906
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,550
opinion is

907
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,130
that I really

908
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,710
don't believe

909
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,290
what it says

910
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:49,810
anyway.

911
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,650
Do you see

912
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,250
where, so

913
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,730
have we lost

914
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,370
our minds?

915
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,250
Oh yeah,

916
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,030
because they really

917
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,630
don't believe

918
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,090
what the hell

919
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,510
they're reading

920
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:00,950
anyway.

921
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,110
Yeah,

922
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,770
and I think

923
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,210
they might,

924
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,670
you know,

925
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,350
be losing

926
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,290
the ability

927
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:05,850
to,

928
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,230
the cognitive

929
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,070
ability or

930
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,070
reading comprehension,

931
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,790
and also the

932
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,610
different layers

933
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:11,989
and the

934
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,610
translations.

935
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,530
So one

936
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,090
thing that I

937
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,989
found speaking

938
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,949
to people and

939
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,969
looking at what's

940
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:18,630
going on in

941
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,630
the world is

942
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,790
it's real,

943
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,250
real,

944
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,070
real basic.

945
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:23,730
You know,

946
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,350
I started,

947
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,050
you know,

948
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,510
all of us

949
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,010
pretty much

950
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,350
got,

951
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,690
noticed that

952
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,929
computers became

953
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:30,850
commonplace within

954
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,590
the last ten

955
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:31,969
years.

956
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,250
Very common.

957
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,610
So if you

958
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,250
start looking

959
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:35,590
at your

960
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,110
computer,

961
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,790
okay,

962
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,409
you know,

963
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,010
it's got some

964
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,630
real basic

965
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,090
stuff,

966
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,370
and you

967
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:40,929
could actually

968
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,909
download how

969
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,409
a computer

970
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,110
works on a

971
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,650
small YouTube

972
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,150
video,

973
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,830
and it'll

974
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,270
show you.

975
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,190
And I'm

976
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,750
looking at it

977
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:46,949
and I'm

978
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:47,210
like,

979
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:47,429
wow,

980
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,190
that's exactly

981
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,670
how our

982
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,389
mind works.

983
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,469
That computer

984
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,610
is a mirror

985
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,590
image because

986
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,330
we assembled

987
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,530
it.

988
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,250
That's some

989
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,550
real,

990
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,230
real basic

991
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,830
stuff.

992
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,350
a hologram.

993
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,230
Well,

994
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,150
it's got some

995
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,690
hardware,

996
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,530
okay,

997
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,030
we've got

998
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,410
hardware,

999
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:04,750
it's

1000
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,170
fleshy,

1001
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:06,330
okay,

1002
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,550
you know,

1003
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,570
we like making

1004
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,510
machines now

1005
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,210
because we don't

1006
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:11,690
care about

1007
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,270
quality.

1008
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,470
You see,

1009
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,050
years ago,

1010
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,690
there were human

1011
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,190
computers.

1012
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,870
You'd go and

1013
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,470
talk to them.

1014
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,190
Their names

1015
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,570
were like

1016
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,630
Socrates and

1017
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,130
Plato,

1018
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,970
and you've

1019
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,210
got,

1020
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,890
in your

1021
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,570
holy writs,

1022
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,070
you've got

1023
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,590
your human

1024
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,450
computers there.

1025
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,330
You go

1026
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:27,830
forward,

1027
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,950
you've got,

1028
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:29,530
you see,

1029
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,390
and also the

1030
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,990
ancients,

1031
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,110
you know,

1032
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:32,990
they didn't

1033
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,390
use,

1034
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,710
they knew about

1035
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,510
factories to

1036
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,250
mass produce

1037
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,750
little trinkets

1038
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,330
like they do

1039
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,550
in the world

1040
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:39,790
today,

1041
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,630
mass production,

1042
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,490
but they found

1043
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,790
out that

1044
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,350
machines made

1045
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:44,890
of metal

1046
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,490
using

1047
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,230
electricity

1048
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,970
did not

1049
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,830
produce a

1050
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,350
high enough

1051
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,370
quality product

1052
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:52,730
than a

1053
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,350
machine made

1054
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:53,970
of flesh and

1055
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,410
blood and

1056
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:54,810
fat and

1057
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,350
water than

1058
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,990
breathed.

1059
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,610
Do you get my

1060
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,870
point?

1061
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,830
Oh yes,

1062
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,390
I do.

1063
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,330
A machine

1064
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,170
that is

1065
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,970
made of

1066
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,050
flesh and

1067
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,030
blood will

1068
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,770
always produce

1069
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,130
a higher

1070
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,130
quality item.

1071
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,150
So they

1072
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,430
said,

1073
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:06,690
okay,

1074
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,170
let's put

1075
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,190
these machines

1076
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,990
making machines

1077
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,350
away and

1078
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:10,550
we'll have

1079
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,150
just people

1080
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,750
making what

1081
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,030
we need.

1082
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,170
And it

1083
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,530
was always

1084
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:12,950
of higher

1085
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,270
quality.

1086
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,530
You know,

1087
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,050
no one would

1088
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,350
buy a

1089
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,110
Faberge egg

1090
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,570
if it was

1091
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,150
stamped out

1092
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,510
of a

1093
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,310
press,

1094
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:19,590
right?

1095
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,430
Right,

1096
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,230
it didn't have

1097
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,790
that quality

1098
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,210
to it,

1099
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,630
it didn't

1100
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,110
have that

1101
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,370
personal touch.

1102
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,550
That's right.

1103
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,850
So today,

1104
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,590
years ago,

1105
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,170
people had

1106
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,550
nannies,

1107
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,030
today they

1108
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,370
put their

1109
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,810
children in

1110
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:29,990
front of

1111
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,450
the TV.

1112
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,590
Okay,

1113
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,770
it doesn't

1114
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,110
matter how

1115
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,670
much money

1116
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,070
you've got

1117
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,430
these days,

1118
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:37,850
that seems

1119
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,170
the way

1120
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:38,530
that things

1121
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:38,810
go.

1122
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,390
Okay,

1123
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,350
so I

1124
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:40,870
started looking

1125
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,250
at this

1126
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:41,950
computer and

1127
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,330
I went out

1128
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:42,590
and got

1129
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:42,790
one,

1130
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,190
I plugged

1131
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,590
it in,

1132
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,410
and plugged

1133
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,130
everything up

1134
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,430
and it

1135
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:46,790
prompted

1136
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,050
me,

1137
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,290
hey,

1138
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:47,890
lights are

1139
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,170
on,

1140
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,850
but nobody's

1141
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,050
home,

1142
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,350
I need

1143
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:50,930
an operating

1144
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,510
system.

1145
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,310
So there I

1146
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:53,730
got this

1147
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,070
disk,

1148
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,350
you know,

1149
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,910
give a plug

1150
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,370
to Mr.

1151
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:55,930
Bill Gates,

1152
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,370
it was a

1153
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,350
Microsoft disk,

1154
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,610
right?

1155
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,630
Yeah,

1156
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,150
sir.

1157
00:36:59,450 --> 00:36:59,910
Put it in

1158
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,470
and started

1159
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,370
downloading this

1160
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,250
operating system.

1161
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:02,630
If you've

1162
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,250
ever downloaded

1163
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,790
an operating

1164
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,210
system,

1165
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,630
it's not

1166
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,470
lickety-split.

1167
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,210
It takes

1168
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:07,490
a little

1169
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:07,910
while.

1170
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,810
And then

1171
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,090
it hit

1172
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,250
me.

1173
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,910
Oh,

1174
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,710
man,

1175
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,390
we get our

1176
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,390
operating system

1177
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:13,910
from our

1178
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,210
deity.

1179
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:15,730
Yes.

1180
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,170
We get our

1181
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,130
law from our

1182
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,410
deity.

1183
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:18,830
I'm not

1184
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,450
talking about

1185
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,210
traffic law,

1186
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:20,650
I'm talking

1187
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,510
about how

1188
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,150
you reason,

1189
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:23,950
what you

1190
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,290
eat,

1191
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,790
what you

1192
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,210
wear,

1193
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,210
how you

1194
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,070
keep time,

1195
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:27,970
how you

1196
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,570
do commerce,

1197
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:28,950
how you

1198
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,350
raise a

1199
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:29,730
family,

1200
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:31,830
everything

1201
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,530
comes from

1202
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,110
your deity.

1203
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,430
Absolutely.

1204
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,950
In this

1205
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,430
symbol,

1206
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,390
I shall

1207
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,030
conquer.

1208
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,530
One side

1209
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,670
is theocratic

1210
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,330
military,

1211
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,090
I mean,

1212
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,710
correction,

1213
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,650
monarchical

1214
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,230
military.

1215
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,270
The other

1216
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,070
side is

1217
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,770
theocratic

1218
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,370
religious.

1219
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,490
And so

1220
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,030
when they do

1221
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,650
the crossing

1222
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,290
of the hands

1223
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:50,930
of the Pharaoh,

1224
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,210
what they're

1225
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,090
doing is

1226
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,450
that they're

1227
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,050
giving you

1228
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,870
a Sir

1229
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,730
Bill Gates,

1230
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,130
a knight of

1231
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,670
the queen,

1232
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,090
and therefore

1233
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,090
that operating

1234
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,450
system is

1235
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,410
a system that

1236
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,570
is dictated by

1237
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,550
the queen of

1238
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,130
rule.

1239
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,870
Is that a

1240
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,210
copy?

1241
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,210
You can look

1242
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,930
at it that way

1243
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,430
if you so

1244
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,890
choose to

1245
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,650
download that

1246
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,550
operating system,

1247
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,090
but you've got

1248
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,490
to look at

1249
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:13,850
them all,

1250
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,070
right?

1251
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,130
Absolutely.

1252
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:15,930
You've got to

1253
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,610
understand where

1254
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,010
they're coming

1255
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,470
from.

1256
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,270
Right.

1257
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,970
So you get

1258
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,590
your law from

1259
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:19,990
your deity,

1260
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,590
and here comes

1261
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:20,970
somebody who

1262
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,070
says,

1263
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,230
well,

1264
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,730
I don't have a

1265
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:21,950
deity.

1266
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:23,770
Okay,

1267
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,210
you don't have a

1268
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,430
deity.

1269
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:25,870
All right,

1270
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,450
that's fine.

1271
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:26,770
Then do you

1272
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,210
believe in the

1273
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:27,670
laws of the

1274
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,910
state?

1275
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:28,950
Yes,

1276
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,370
I do.

1277
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:29,550
Well,

1278
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,050
the state is

1279
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,430
your god,

1280
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:30,770
and April

1281
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,230
1st is

1282
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,730
your holiday.

1283
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:32,750
Thank you

1284
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,190
very much.

1285
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,570
Next.

1286
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,900
You see,

1287
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,380
and I'm not

1288
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,180
saying don't

1289
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,780
believe in the

1290
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,360
laws of the

1291
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,820
state,

1292
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,740
because you

1293
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,200
can't really

1294
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,740
believe in

1295
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,040
anything.

1296
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,460
You have

1297
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,840
to know

1298
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,080
them,

1299
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,580
remember.

1300
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,920
So what

1301
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,540
happens is

1302
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,200
if you read

1303
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,720
your holy

1304
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,060
writ,

1305
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,200
all of them

1306
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,660
pretty much

1307
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:50,920
say,

1308
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,220
if you

1309
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,700
don't want

1310
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,120
what's in

1311
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,440
here,

1312
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,160
we're going

1313
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,620
to appoint

1314
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,040
men,

1315
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,680
and you're

1316
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:56,780
going to

1317
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:56,980
try

1318
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,360
man's

1319
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,480
law,

1320
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:57,700
and see

1321
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:57,960
how you

1322
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,560
like that.

1323
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,560
So when

1324
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,060
you hear

1325
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,080
about conspiracy

1326
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,860
theories,

1327
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,060
or man's

1328
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,520
government

1329
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,120
isn't,

1330
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,460
you know,

1331
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:09,940
what it

1332
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,380
should be,

1333
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,680
or they're

1334
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:10,960
cool,

1335
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,420
they shouldn't

1336
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:11,760
be there,

1337
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,220
they're not

1338
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,640
legitimate,

1339
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,400
this runs

1340
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,240
the full

1341
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,660
gamut.

1342
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,920
Wait a

1343
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,140
second,

1344
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,680
they're

1345
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,440
accommodating

1346
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,680
you.

1347
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,840
We,

1348
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,360
as a

1349
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,000
society,

1350
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,320
worldwide,

1351
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,460
have

1352
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,120
abandoned

1353
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,940
acknowledgment.

1354
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,620
Forget

1355
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,520
about following

1356
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,920
any form

1357
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,500
of rules

1358
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,100
that come

1359
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,520
from a

1360
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:31,860
spiritual

1361
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,420
nature.

1362
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,320
We've

1363
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,780
completely

1364
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,640
abandoned it.

1365
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,060
Total

1366
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,660
apathy.

1367
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,720
The opposite

1368
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,280
of love

1369
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,660
is not

1370
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:37,980
hate.

1371
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,500
It takes

1372
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:38,940
a lot

1373
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,400
of energy

1374
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,820
to hate

1375
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,160
someone.

1376
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,400
The opposite

1377
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,900
of love

1378
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,640
is apathy.

1379
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,560
We're

1380
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,100
living in a

1381
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,620
world where

1382
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,200
the majority

1383
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,800
of the people

1384
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,880
are apathetic

1385
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,400
to their

1386
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,660
own scriptural

1387
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,360
references.

1388
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,360
I'm not

1389
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,000
talking about

1390
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,400
religion,

1391
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:52,820
I'm not

1392
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,380
talking about

1393
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,880
going down

1394
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,180
to the

1395
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,520
temple,

1396
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,020
or the

1397
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,780
mosque,

1398
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,100
or the

1399
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,400
synagogue,

1400
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:56,940
or the

1401
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,300
church.

1402
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,100
Because

1403
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,620
I've

1404
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,480
never

1405
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,260
gone to

1406
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,280
mosque.

1407
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,500
I've

1408
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,080
I've

1409
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,320
never

1410
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,840
gone to

1411
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,040
the

1412
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,520
mosque.

1413
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,300
I've

1414
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,400
never

1415
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,500
gone to

1416
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:29,600
mosque.

1417
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:29,700
I've

1418
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:29,800
never

1419
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:29,900
gone to

1420
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,000
the

1421
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,100
synagogue.

1422
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,120
And

1423
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,400
I've

1424
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,460
never

1425
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:52,580
like

1426
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:52,760
I've

1427
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,140
never

1428
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,240
gonna

1429
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,540
do

1430
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,540
it

1431
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,280
like

1432
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,380
that.

1433
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,600
I've

1434
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,720
never

1435
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:57,860
gonna

1436
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,660
teach

1437
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,180
femininity

1438
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,320
to

1439
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,420
a

1440
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,520
girl,

1441
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,620
because

1442
00:40:59,620 --> 00:40:59,720
she's

1443
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,440
and Yeehawks start seeing in this country they have a sacred document, okay?

1444
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,420
Now, if George Washington is your deity, that's fine,

1445
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,680
because if you go to the Capitol Rotunda and look up,

1446
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,920
guess who's looking right back down at you sitting in a heavenly throne?

1447
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,280
G.W., himself.

1448
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,140
And if you don't believe me, go look it up.

1449
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,160
You go into the Capitol building and it's a big round open area Rotunda

1450
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,140
and you look up, there's a big painted dome.

1451
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,180
And you got George Washington sitting in the throne with angels around him

1452
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,400
and he's looking down at you.

1453
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,220
Yeah, see, we can't even qualify as a nation in this country

1454
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,780
because a nation is matriarchal and it means they're all related.

1455
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,200
But now that we've got a damn father figure,

1456
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,440
it's mama's baby but daddy's maybe.

1457
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,720
So now that we got daddy's maybe,

1458
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,900
we don't know who in the hell is part of this country

1459
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,120
and so they call us a mouse and pot.

1460
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,840
Right, now here you go.

1461
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,720
We don't know anything anymore.

1462
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,520
It's probably, you know, two years ago we spit shine jump boots

1463
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,100
and we used what they call Lincoln boot polish.

1464
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,560
And now you might as well call it shinola

1465
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,240
because people today don't know shit from shinola

1466
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,560
and I'm just going to say it plain out for you.

1467
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,380
Now you take it and run with it from there.

1468
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,060
Well, here you go.

1469
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,320
If you read the document, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1470
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,740
and to establish justice.

1471
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,740
Now hold on a second.

1472
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,760
You got to go through this with a fine tooth comb.

1473
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,220
You know, I mean, you're on this planet for what,

1474
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,760
60, 70, 80 years?

1475
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,100
People say, I don't have time.

1476
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,020
Well, you're born naked and you die naked.

1477
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,100
What do you got in between?

1478
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,400
Time.

1479
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,760
Don't ever let anybody tell you, especially you little ones,

1480
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,120
you ain't got time for something.

1481
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,340
That's all you've got in this particular incarnation.

1482
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,020
Now, look at this thing called justice.

1483
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,080
Just go look it up.

1484
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm not going to get into what it is,

1485
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,780
but you will find it's a woman with scales

1486
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,700
and it goes back to the Greeks.

1487
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,220
They called her dike, D-I-K-E.

1488
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
It spells like the word dyke.

1489
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,280
Right? And if you could look at all,

1490
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,320
you know, how you're brought to justice.

1491
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,620
You have to serve justice.

1492
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:18,700
Oh, yeah.

1493
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,360
Now there's also a miscarriage of justice.

1494
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,300
See, things, I mean, they're building everything up

1495
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,440
and that's why you go to court.

1496
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,200
They're praying.

1497
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,860
If you ever read a private lawsuit,

1498
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,580
the attorneys are praying to the court.

1499
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,620
They're praying.

1500
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,120
Now, but hold on a second.

1501
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,080
If you keep reading the document down there,

1502
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,140
keep getting in there, flip a couple of pages,

1503
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,040
and it says the operation of this document

1504
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,960
is the law of nations.

1505
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,140
Now, when you go to the, let's say, for example,

1506
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,380
they say we use the Constitution and the Bible.

1507
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,180
Doesn't the ever living say?

1508
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,100
What it, well, let's say, let's say this

1509
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,680
without getting specific right now.

1510
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,940
That don't do what the nations or the law of the nations.

1511
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,660
Who are the law of the nations?

1512
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,380
They usually translated the nations as Gentile.

1513
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,580
It's the word goyim.

1514
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,000
Or the Gentiles, another way, might be pagan.

1515
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,540
In other words, the creator was frowning down on it.

1516
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,600
Now, I'm not frowning down on anything that's written

1517
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,960
in that particular document.

1518
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,320
Because it's simply accommodating the people's perspective.

1519
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,730
But we need to understand and comprehend.

1520
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,070
Actually comprehend, that word understand

1521
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,770
is a totally different subject.

1522
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:40,750
But what's going on is we're not examining things closely.

1523
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,770
You said earlier about the mother.

1524
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,330
Okay, what do you know about DNA?

1525
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,630
You can go through pages and hundreds of pages of DNA.

1526
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,090
And I regret ever doing that.

1527
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,850
And all you will find is all they really know for sure about DNA

1528
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,010
is that we all have the same mother.

1529
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,070
Okay, so mama seems to know something

1530
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,730
that daddy doesn't know on earth.

1531
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,390
So, you know, there's a family.

1532
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,530
Mother, father and a son.

1533
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,110
Son was growing up around 22 years old.

1534
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,890
And the parents, you know, mama and papa said,

1535
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,190
hey, you know, he's 22.

1536
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,850
We've never seen him date a girl before.

1537
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,070
I think it's about time he did.

1538
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,050
You know, go out and meet someone to get married.

1539
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,710
So father goes to the boy and says,

1540
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,310
hey, actually young man in this case,

1541
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,770
I want you to go out and meet yourself a nice girl.

1542
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,870
Bring her here because it would be nice for you to get married.

1543
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,590
And he says, okay, I'll do that, papa.

1544
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,830
So he sends him out. He comes back a week later.

1545
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,590
Brings in this nice looking girl.

1546
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,810
Sits her down on the couch in the living room.

1547
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,930
And, you know, daddy comes in.

1548
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,830
He says, oh, no, son, you can't marry her.

1549
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,170
He says, why not, daddy?

1550
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,510
And he says, well, you see,

1551
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,870
you can't marry her because she's your sister,

1552
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,210
but your mama don't know it.

1553
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,350
So don't tell your mama.

1554
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,910
Okay, so sends her off a week later.

1555
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,730
Comes in, another girl comes in.

1556
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,850
He sits down on the couch.

1557
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,750
Father comes running down.

1558
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,230
He says, daddy, I brought another girl I'd like for you to meet her.

1559
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,150
And he says, oh, no, son, you can't marry her either.

1560
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,410
He says, why not?

1561
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,090
He says, you see, she's your sister,

1562
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,970
but your mama don't know it.

1563
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,130
So, you know, he sends that girl off again.

1564
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,190
And then the other girl off.

1565
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,150
And, you know, a few days go by and mother asks him,

1566
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,850
she says, what happened to those two nice girls you brought home?

1567
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,470
And he says, oh, mom, you know, I really can't tell you.

1568
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,330
You know, daddy told me not to tell you.

1569
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,970
And he says, well, what did he tell you not to tell me?

1570
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,290
And he says, well, he says I can't marry them

1571
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,070
because they're my sisters and you don't know it.

1572
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,750
And she said, oh, you go ahead and marry either one of them

1573
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,310
that you might like the most,

1574
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,350
because he ain't your daddy and he don't know it.

1575
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,840
So, things are not as they appear to be.

1576
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,870
Yeah, that's true.

1577
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:13,950
At all.

1578
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,390
Anyway, that was kind of maybe a long joke with a short punchline.

1579
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,590
But moving forward,

1580
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,330
your law comes from your deity.

1581
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,630
And what I mean by your law, it's a reference point.

1582
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,530
You know, who would go hire a carpenter who said,

1583
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,730
I cut this board twice and it's still too short?

1584
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,640
You need some kind of reference

1585
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,880
and you need to know what you're doing with that reference.

1586
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,520
People say, well, I don't believe in that.

1587
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,100
And, well, I'll do whatever I want.

1588
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,560
I say, okay, I'm building a house

1589
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,340
and I need a countertop exactly 62 inches long.

1590
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,640
You could call up someone on the telephone

1591
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,660
and relay that information across the country

1592
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,560
and they'll send you the countertop at 62 inches long.

1593
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,900
Based on you having the same reference.

1594
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,740
That your tape measures are all the same.

1595
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,060
And what I found out is that all of these holy writs

1596
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,180
that were from the deities of the world

1597
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,220
all say the same thing.

1598
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,980
So, when you start looking at the spiritual definition of these things,

1599
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,620
there's a lot of confusion.

1600
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,440
A lot of confusion.

1601
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,180
I ask people,

1602
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,460
what is the body, what is the soul, what is the spirit?

1603
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,840
And I still haven't gotten a straight answer.

1604
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,020
I ask someone, they say, okay, well, all right, hold on a second there.

1605
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,620
You're telling me I have to be saved.

1606
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,540
Can you tell me what I have to be saved from?

1607
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,960
And if it's more than two or three words, you probably don't know.

1608
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,020
Okay, well, you need to live under grace.

1609
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,900
Okay, can you please just define grace?

1610
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,240
Oh, okay, you don't know either.

1611
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,620
They just can't define it.

1612
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,380
So, if you start looking at the way these original texts were translated,

1613
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,500
you're going to find out that there's a lot of confusion

1614
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,660
even in the way they were translated.

1615
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,380
And that's where I believe things were done on purpose.

1616
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,900
Because if you have fleshy bodies here that know

1617
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,900
there's more to what we've been told,

1618
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,540
all you need to do is switch around a couple of concepts

1619
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,100
the most basic ones, they'll take it as being,

1620
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,660
well, that's the way it is, and they'll never figure it out.

1621
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,840
And it's really, really, really simple.

1622
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,420
And I've looked at all the texts, well, the three that I mentioned were four,

1623
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,640
and they all share the same thing when you go to the original languages.

1624
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,040
Now, when I say original languages, I mean the languages of preservation,

1625
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,480
the way they're preserved today.

1626
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,300
Before they were translated to English and all the other languages.

1627
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,400
And the one that I've looked at and spent the most time on

1628
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,500
is what people normally call the Bible or the Scriptures.

1629
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,550
And I focused on that for a very simple reason.

1630
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,610
It was the only one that I found that had the most detail.

1631
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:24,510
When I say detail, people, places, and things.

1632
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,050
And it also had the most law.

1633
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,730
It was just pretty simple.

1634
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,720
So that's why when you, for example, look at what Hollywood does,

1635
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,140
they make movies about the Bible.

1636
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,300
They make movies about, you don't see, well, you know,

1637
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,620
supposedly it's a religious offense to make a movie about the Koran

1638
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,240
because there are not supposed to be any images.

1639
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,420
Okay, fine.

1640
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,400
It just so happens that we're getting all these images of the Bible.

1641
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,680
We're getting stories. Everybody's involved in it.

1642
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Hollywood, print media, I mean, it's about the Bible,

1643
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,600
but they're not really, how accurate is it?

1644
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,820
Well, you could read the text yourself.

1645
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,280
And that's why I emailed you, Gary, and I said,

1646
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,720
hey, how about we do a thing with the Strongs?

1647
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,560
But we might do that, maybe not.

1648
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,060
But if we start reading these texts and we see what we're being told about them,

1649
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,040
it just ain't so.

1650
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,560
Well, see, that's, I agree with you.

1651
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,480
It's kind of like if you took Lothar Shalmapoose Cardinal,

1652
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,280
elected Pope 600, called Muhammad,

1653
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,200
and you went to his original teachings,

1654
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,600
even prophesied in the Talmud of Emanuel, spelled with a J,

1655
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,640
you would see that what he taught and done was entirely different

1656
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,260
than what we know of as the Quran today.

1657
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,640
Translated, basically, what, 60, 68 years after his death.

1658
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,780
They always spin, twist, and turn everything

1659
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,080
because we're dealing with a business model.

1660
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,600
And we can go back to Luke 2, even in their King James,

1661
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,860
and Tiberius taxed the whole world.

1662
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,640
These yo-yos don't know.

1663
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,360
They've been under tax and tribute,

1664
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,980
and they want to go back and act civilly, Roman civil law.

1665
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,060
They don't even understand the root of where in the hell they come from.

1666
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,800
And so what I really wanted you to do was to get in here

1667
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,720
and kind of blow their underwear off, you know?

1668
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,260
Well, it's about time, but here's a simple thing.

1669
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,200
You know, people talk about jurisdiction.

1670
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,460
You know, jurisdiction.

1671
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,720
Okay, jurisdiction.

1672
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,060
Okay, and how it's gained.

1673
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,820
It's gained in your mind.

1674
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,220
Yes, it is.

1675
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,340
It's gained in your mind, and here's the funny thing.

1676
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,940
I was speaking to someone the other day,

1677
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,220
and they're saying, well, you know,

1678
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,200
well, you got to tell the people why they don't get it.

1679
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,860
You know, and basically the conversation started out,

1680
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,220
and I was like, okay, the people that don't get it

1681
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,580
are the ones saying Happy New Year two weeks ago.

1682
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,820
Yeah, they don't know when the time of the year is.

1683
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,920
They were saying Merry Christmas a little bit before that.

1684
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,700
You go on a lot of talk show calls, turn on your TV, newspaper,

1685
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,120
go out your door, look how quiet it is on those days.

1686
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,380
Say, I don't know what these people are using as a basis for it.

1687
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,020
It's some kind of credit system they're running on

1688
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,520
that I do not understand.

1689
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,160
I do not stand under it.

1690
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,040
I'm familiar with it, and in order to communicate with them,

1691
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,400
for the past few years, I've raised some eyebrows.

1692
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,580
When someone says, hey, are you going to meet me on Friday?

1693
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,000
I said, well, yeah, I'll meet you on the day you call Friday.

1694
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,580
But see, it rolls.

1695
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,400
It's set by the sun, it's set by the moon,

1696
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,780
and it's by the wobble of the planetoid aspect called the Earth.

1697
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,240
Yes, I'm going to get into maybe a little bit of that aspect,

1698
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,660
but the thing is, you know, I had a call,

1699
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,560
and I'm on this call on a day you call Sunday, I tell people.

1700
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,240
Okay, it's not Sunday.

1701
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,340
No, it ain't.

1702
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,260
There ain't no Monday, there ain't no Tuesday.

1703
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,580
Now, here's a good example.

1704
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,000
The timekeepers, the priests of time,

1705
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,760
because you see, back in, through all your scriptural references,

1706
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,840
when I say scripture, I'm talking about all of them,

1707
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,000
your priest was managing your time.

1708
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,200
So if somebody says they're managing time,

1709
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,460
they're a priest by default.

1710
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,500
If you read your scriptures,

1711
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,460
and you had a physical ailment and you couldn't figure it out,

1712
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,120
you went to the priest.

1713
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,180
So if you go to someone today that, for a physical ailment,

1714
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,960
by default, they're your priest.

1715
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,300
You got the white robes.

1716
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,760
Now, that's why I talk about something called image training.

1717
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,900
You're controlled by images, like flashcards.

1718
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,940
Whenever you see a doctor on TV, he better be wearing a white robe.

1719
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,880
They always dress him up that way.

1720
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,980
Now, okay, so now you're going to go and look at all your scriptures,

1721
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,040
all of them, throughout all the cultures.

1722
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,820
And if you got a problem with law,

1723
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,600
or you don't know, you can't really, it's a real gray area,

1724
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,500
you go to your priest.

1725
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,020
So if you go to someone for law today, by default, they're your priest.

1726
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,900
Now, this doesn't sound pretty,

1727
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,880
because people are going to start saying,

1728
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,180
well, wait a second, they're just this, they're not a priest.

1729
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,700
Like, okay, so then what's a priest then today?

1730
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,300
What's he teaching?

1731
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,880
Well, the real priest is really their courthouse,

1732
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,020
because that's where their law is rendered.

1733
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,800
The yo-hoo, uh, yay-hoo, uh, called a cleric,

1734
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,140
a, uh, minister, a, uh, uh, shit, a preacher,

1735
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,700
is down there teaching them the bullcrap

1736
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,940
that they want to hear to tickle their damn ears.

1737
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,140
Well, hold on a second.

1738
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,120
These people don't understand that no more.

1739
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,640
They don't know what in hell they're doing.

1740
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,620
And then if they need a healer up there, a putae,

1741
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,280
they don't understand that this cat don't believe in that.

1742
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,460
He doesn't believe in healing, or curing.

1743
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,480
He believes in symptomology,

1744
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,060
because there's more damn money in treating symptoms

1745
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,600
than there is creating a cure.

1746
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,660
He don't know nothing about the bomb of Gilead.

1747
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,660
Right. Now, hold on, hold it right there, hold it right there.

1748
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,240
When you read about the temple,

1749
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,180
the function of the temple,

1750
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,780
now, I'll tell you about the one in the Bible,

1751
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,900
the one out there in Jerusalem.

1752
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,580
Yeah, that's big talk.

1753
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,920
What I found out about that,

1754
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,420
it served one function.

1755
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,280
It had two functions and three functions.

1756
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,340
And there was a fourth, but it was minor.

1757
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,060
Oh, yeah, but that...

1758
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,840
The functions were, it was the court,

1759
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,140
it was the place where you went to record a document,

1760
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,220
and it was a university.

1761
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,580
Yes, it was.

1762
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,620
And alongside that center,

1763
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,440
okay, were small little rooms that if you wanted to pray,

1764
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,140
you would go and pray in private by yourself,

1765
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,820
or your wife, or your husband,

1766
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,000
or one other, or two other,

1767
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,500
in private.

1768
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,340
They had all these little rooms going around, hundreds of them.

1769
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,960
Now, today, if you take the courthouse,

1770
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,900
the records at the university,

1771
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,180
and put them in one building,

1772
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,700
you've got a temple.

1773
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,380
Now, most major cities,

1774
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,360
and even smaller cities,

1775
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,800
have those features, but they're divided.

1776
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,240
So, if the body is the temple,

1777
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,840
and we're living in a place where the temple is divided,

1778
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,800
do you see how this confusion comes in?

1779
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,820
Oh, yes, because they're divided in their mind,

1780
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,920
they cannot prevail.

1781
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,320
Yes. Now, Christ said that the kingdom of heaven is within you.

1782
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,400
Now, that word endos,

1783
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,760
endos, E-N-T-O-S, is phonetically within you.

1784
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,920
Technically, in Greek, that's not what it means,

1785
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,180
within you, within your body.

1786
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,660
He really, technically, the way it was preserved meant amongst you,

1787
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,380
meaning it's fractional.

1788
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,960
It's in pieces.

1789
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,020
In other words, the things to come.

1790
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,600
The temple that was there at the time had lost its usefulness

1791
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,340
because the people's hearts were not made of flesh,

1792
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,360
they were made of stone.

1793
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,360
And the irony there is this.

1794
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,280
How many people today know

1795
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,460
that halide group elements on the...

1796
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,600
These are chemicals, periodic table of elements.

1797
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,320
Halide groups would be fluoride,

1798
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,100
bromine that's used in your flour,

1799
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,180
and chlorine that's used in your water, all those groups.

1800
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,560
Go look at your halide groups.

1801
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,640
Those things calcify the blood and harden the arteries.

1802
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,060
Now, isn't calcium a stone?

1803
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,120
Our hearts are being turned to stone as we speak.

1804
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,060
Yeah, and your pineal gland...

1805
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,140
And your gland...

1806
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,780
...that's the angel at pineal.

1807
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,920
It's calcified.

1808
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,760
Now they do not have the doorway, the gateway to the Creator,

1809
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,940
which is in their own brain.

1810
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,060
And they don't understand that.

1811
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,760
And if I may be single, they have to open that aspect

1812
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,120
because rods, cones, and water, vitreous humor,

1813
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,960
is in that one pineal gland,

1814
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,180
not the blamed-ass two eyes that they got in front of their head,

1815
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,720
in front of their ears,

1816
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,640
because they don't understand what's really in their head.

1817
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,860
They have 22 letters.

1818
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,760
So putting chlorine in water ain't got nothing to do with bugs

1819
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,880
because the bugs come back, and so does the bromine.

1820
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,620
You kill certain bugs,

1821
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,280
and you give rise to others that are more dangerous.

1822
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,880
Yeah, because it's the way they think.

1823
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,680
Right, and the fluoride ain't got nothing to do

1824
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,660
with making your teeth stronger.

1825
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,400
No, it doesn't.

1826
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,240
Even though Deep Smith County...

1827
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,680
Go ahead.

1828
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,580
Okay, so what I'm trying to make a quick reference is,

1829
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,160
is these biblical references, just for simple terminology,

1830
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,620
are trying to give you a hint.

1831
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,380
And when you go through the Bible,

1832
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,840
you'll see the same thing is being repeated over and over

1833
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,600
if you pick a topic.

1834
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,040
And you will see what is meant by a heart of stone.

1835
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,680
You see, and you start saying,

1836
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,460
how are our hearts being turned to stone?

1837
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,020
And I just wanted to give that example

1838
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,960
because if you're reading a holy writ, no matter what it is,

1839
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,040
if it doesn't have a practical use in your life,

1840
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,340
it means nothing.

1841
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,900
Absolutely. It's got to be a living thing.

1842
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,300
It's got to be living.

1843
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,000
A language, if no one is speaking a language,

1844
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,820
that language is considered dead.

1845
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,160
Yes.

1846
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,240
I can't take and heal until I step inside of them,

1847
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,340
see what's wrong with them,

1848
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,660
and initiate an electromagnetic flux

1849
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,180
that will cause a change in their physical body

1850
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,880
and they'll understand it with their comprehension.

1851
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,580
My wife had run across a book I was reading one time

1852
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,260
and Steve would give it to me

1853
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,820
and it said how to screw any woman out there, whatever it is.

1854
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,380
And boy, she was upset as hell.

1855
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,740
I mean, she said,

1856
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,100
what are you doing?

1857
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,740
What are you reading this for?

1858
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,020
I said, I screw them all.

1859
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,900
She said, what?

1860
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,140
I said, I screw them all.

1861
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,900
She said, what do you mean by that?

1862
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,380
I said, how in the hell do you think I heal?

1863
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,800
If I do not implant the thought of healing in their mind,

1864
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:39,420
how in the Sam hell do you expect me to cause them to be healed?

1865
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,100
I fuck them all.

1866
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,440
I just don't do it according to the laws of the king.

1867
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,720
Well, the restrictional aspect...

1868
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,540
She understood what I was saying

1869
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,460
and so I've been screwing them all, as the fellow said, ever since then

1870
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,380
because that's how I heal.

1871
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,360
And I teach them to do that.

1872
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,560
I mean...

1873
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,360
Well, look at your water for a second.

1874
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:00,940
...yourself.

1875
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,660
Do not limit yourself

1876
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,520
or what the hell your preacher, your minister, your judge,

1877
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,340
your whatever in the hell come up with.

1878
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,360
They don't know shit from Shia LaBeouf.

1879
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,440
One of them, you get it on your feet,

1880
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,700
get it on the carpet,

1881
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,120
your wife will whip your ass and run you down the road.

1882
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,700
One of them, you can polish your boots and they'll look damn fine.

1883
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,060
Now, I realize that's not the normal way of looking at it,

1884
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,160
but since you want to get in this game,

1885
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,280
I'll bust the door open for you

1886
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,900
because I'm just an ass-kicker from the get-go.

1887
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:30,520
Go ahead.

1888
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,740
Hey, well, when you look at water,

1889
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,840
water's got a spiral in nature.

1890
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,500
In German, your spinal column is called the spiral column.

1891
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,120
In German.

1892
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,040
It's not the spinal column, it's a spiral column

1893
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:50,200
because everything in nature follows that mode of geometry.

1894
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,160
Why is everyone so impressed with a bunch of acid

1895
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,940
in a spiral form in the nucleus of a cell?

1896
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,840
They call it DNA.

1897
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,900
Ooh, this DNA.

1898
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,400
All these things are going to happen, I'm going to change your DNA.

1899
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,900
Ain't no evidence of that.

1900
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,600
It's just acid, you know.

1901
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,780
Why do you think they say you've descended from monkeys?

1902
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,420
Because, see, you descend, you're lower than the monkey.

1903
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,600
Do you get the language that's being used here?

1904
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,120
Yes, I do.

1905
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,820
You keep going, brother, I just...

1906
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,880
You have similar DNA to a monkey,

1907
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,040
which is now dinonucleic acid,

1908
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,980
whatever fancy name they're putting on that.

1909
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,740
There's a fellow named Lipton that does a lot of work on that

1910
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,880
and he got in some trouble.

1911
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,280
I don't know if he's doing all right,

1912
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,640
but he has actually mentioned they've taken DNA out of cells

1913
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,840
and the cells are just fine.

1914
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,720
Yeah, Bruce Lipton, that's who you're talking about.

1915
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:44,660
Yeah, okay.

1916
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,220
So, I mean, what's the big deal about that?

1917
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,740
Now, they're missing the part of water.

1918
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,080
You know, water is not H2O.

1919
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,240
And you tell that to people

1920
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,820
and they run around screaming in their head,

1921
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,840
well, take some water with electrolysis,

1922
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,420
you know, they use that for breaking up water into hydrogen and oxygen.

1923
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,900
And go ahead, try to reduce all that water into hydrogen and oxygen.

1924
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,640
You can't.

1925
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,920
It never, no one has ever succeeded doing that.

1926
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,820
It ends up turning into deuterium and tritium

1927
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,780
and other compounds of water

1928
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,760
that are very effective in absorbing radiation.

1929
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,800
That's why they use it in their nuke plants.

1930
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,380
So, now if you take the, let's go the other way.

1931
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,920
Let's take some hydrogen gas and some oxygen gas,

1932
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,300
put it together, bam, you get a lot of energy being released

1933
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,980
and you get some water vapor.

1934
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,220
When it condenses down, that's water.

1935
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:36,060
Okay, well, do me a favor and drop that on a concrete sidewalk

1936
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,360
and come back in two hours and tell me what you see.

1937
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,080
You see a hole in the concrete.

1938
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,340
So, water is not H2O.

1939
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,780
It appears to be H2O.

1940
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,460
So, how do we keep the water healthy?

1941
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,700
Well, if you don't want to study that, I tell people,

1942
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,160
if you don't want to study what water really is

1943
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,460
and you don't want to get on the technical aspects

1944
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,200
or the engineering aspects, go get yourself a chicken.

1945
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,960
Go grow a garden.

1946
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,940
Go stand by a natural river or a natural stream or a brook and observe it.

1947
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,680
And what you will see, if you have the ability to see,

1948
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,740
you will see things that cannot be described.

1949
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,120
And this information is not being held by the high priests

1950
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,240
in your academic centers,

1951
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,740
because if you go to your academic center right now,

1952
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,940
if you don't worship at the altar that they built,

1953
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,680
you're given the boot, if you get what I mean.

1954
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,860
All of these academic centers build an altar and you bow down to it.

1955
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,720
If you don't bow down to it, you're not welcomed.

1956
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,820
What you will find when you look at nature is that fish don't swim.

1957
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,820
Fish are swum.

1958
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,940
Birds don't fly. Birds are flown.

1959
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,580
In other words, these natural living creatures

1960
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,300
are made a certain way that when they react,

1961
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,660
they change their environment around them.

1962
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,560
They move around them to a frictionless state

1963
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,780
and they simply move into a vacuum.

1964
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,300
If anyone wants to do some research on the way one can think along these lines,

1965
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,940
do you ever see some, for example, in the news,

1966
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,880
you know, the Chinese or the Europeans just built this 300 mile an hour

1967
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,540
monorail maglev train.

1968
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,060
Wow, that's so fast. It's so wonderful.

1969
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,840
Okay, if you think that's so fresh and hot,

1970
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,420
go research this guy named Beach and it's spelled just like the sandy beach.

1971
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,240
And he was one of the founders of Scientific American.

1972
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,360
And back in 1864, he built a tunnel underground in New York

1973
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,540
and he built a train that was designed to go 700 miles per hour.

1974
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,960
And this is in 1864.

1975
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,260
And they did succeed with the design.

1976
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,900
I don't know if they ever got it up to 700 miles per hour.

1977
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,320
But what they did was they made a round tunnel

1978
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,640
and a round train car with a one inch gap.

1979
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,500
And the way they powered the train or moved the train through the tunnel

1980
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,600
was using a steam turbine to create a vacuum on one end of it

1981
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,800
to suck the train forward.

1982
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,400
And why did he do that?

1983
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,260
Because he knew that air enters a vacuum at 700 miles per hour.

1984
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,900
So when you have a fish or a bird,

1985
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,680
they're actually creating a vacuum around their bodies

1986
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:36,090
in the medium that they're in and the inverse square rule does not apply to them.

1987
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:39,110
Inverse square rule basically with airplanes is that

1988
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,130
if you want to double your speed, you need four times the energy.

1989
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,620
So how about making an airplane or a boat that creates a vortex

1990
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,700
with a little bit of suction in front of it so you have no resistance,

1991
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,240
so you're actually being sucked forward.

1992
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,860
And this technology exists today, but people don't know about it.

1993
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,490
So the water acts the same way.

1994
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,590
It's healthiest in certain conditions.

1995
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:14,950
Water at 39 degrees or 4 degrees Celsius is at its most dense state.

1996
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:17,850
If you lower the temperature, it starts to expand.

1997
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,029
If you raise the temperature, it starts to expand.

1998
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,670
That's where it's healthiest state.

1999
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,210
Now if you start vortexing the water

2000
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:32,330
and you start doing it in the proper fashion

2001
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:36,689
as it's done in nature with the absence of light and the absence of air,

2002
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,529
and you get your velocities and you have your geometries being,

2003
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:42,210
for example, an egg-shaped vessel,

2004
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:47,890
when that vortex in that temperature of 39 degrees or 4 degrees Celsius,

2005
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:52,290
which by the way, coincidentally 39 degrees is what most refrigerators are set at,

2006
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,029
if you get a high enough velocity at that temperature,

2007
01:08:56,189 --> 01:08:59,930
you'll notice that oxygen becomes aggressive at high temperatures

2008
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,550
and hydrogen is passive.

2009
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:06,630
But at low temperatures such as 39 or 4 degrees Celsius,

2010
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:10,290
oxygen is passive and hydrogen becomes aggressive.

2011
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:14,750
So now if you've got some chlorine in the water or fluoride or anything like that

2012
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,310
and you've got your vortex kicking,

2013
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:22,250
the hydrogen becomes aggressive, bonds with your chlorine and you get HCl,

2014
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,710
which is hydrochloric acid in a small amount instead of chlorine.

2015
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,689
And you can buffer that water and now you've got a way to get rid of toxins

2016
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:33,910
and poisons in water without using other chemicals

2017
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:37,870
or large amounts of filtration equipment you have to throw away.

2018
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,609
So if you want to do something to your water

2019
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:43,950
or you want a very simple way to filter water,

2020
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:47,850
is you can go get yourself two Brita pitchers,

2021
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,870
there's no plumbing involved, those pourable pitchers,

2022
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,069
and go ahead and pour your tap water into one pitcher,

2023
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,930
put it in the fridge till it gets to 39.

2024
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,990
And when it gets to 39, you get yourself,

2025
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,910
you pour it out of that first pitcher into the second pitcher,

2026
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,150
so now you're filtering it at 39 degrees.

2027
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:07,090
And then you store your water in an egg-shaped vessel.

2028
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:13,590
And the easiest way to get an egg-shaped vessel would be a flower vase,

2029
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:18,010
one that has a flat bottom on the outside but it comes to a point on the inside.

2030
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:21,670
Go ahead and store your water in there and when you put your water in there,

2031
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:25,550
do me a favor, get yourself either a copper rod or a wooden spoon

2032
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,930
and go ahead and spin it up to the right, let it vortex to the right

2033
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,850
and then go ahead and spin it up to the left, both directions.

2034
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,990
And if you want to do stuff with a tuning fork or put some stuff in there

2035
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,170
or minerals or whatever, you do it then.

2036
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:46,930
And what you've done is you've restored water's natural body.

2037
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:52,090
You see, what happens is man ignores the way things move in nature,

2038
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,450
so he says, hmm, let's just pump the water through a straight pipe.

2039
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,430
The water wants to meander.

2040
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:01,230
See, that's why rivers meander left and right.

2041
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,010
When the water hits the right turn bend, it folds over to the left

2042
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:07,210
and you get a longitudinal vortex,

2043
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,630
which is a fancy way of saying a tornado laying down on its side.

2044
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,390
And that's how a natural river processes the elements,

2045
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,790
just like I mentioned earlier.

2046
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,490
When you start straightening out your rivers,

2047
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,010
you start getting a standing wave, the temperature goes up,

2048
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,610
the oxygen becomes aggressive,

2049
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:28,970
it starts eating away whatever the material of your pipes are made of or your canals.

2050
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,410
And it also grows pathogens.

2051
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:38,070
Now, you know you're doing water, let's say for example spring water,

2052
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,030
from a natural spring, if you were to freeze it,

2053
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:46,710
look at it under a microscope, it would seem very amorphous in shape.

2054
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,530
It would just look like a frozen amoeba.

2055
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:53,390
But if you take water that is oxygenated, for example,

2056
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:57,630
and ready for breeding pathogens and you freeze it,

2057
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:01,710
you'll get these beautiful crystal snowflakes.

2058
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:07,650
So do the research on your own and figure out what's really going on

2059
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,390
as opposed to what we've been told.

2060
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:16,450
Because the alternatives that are put out in front of us

2061
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:20,310
are not really alternatives, they're part of sometimes the main agenda.

2062
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,710
And the main agenda actually is the alternative to the natural,

2063
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:26,790
because we don't want to observe the natural seemingly,

2064
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,830
or it's been hidden for so long we forget.

2065
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:36,710
Wood is another wonderful substance for using as a pipe.

2066
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,770
The National Hydrological Society has done research

2067
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,970
with wooden stave pipes versus plastic and metal,

2068
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:48,330
and they found that the degree of pathogens and the resistance of the water

2069
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,070
was always less in the wooden pipes.

2070
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:53,610
That's why sometimes you'll read in major cities there's a water main break

2071
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,330
and they'll pull out a wooden pipe that's 150 years old

2072
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,090
and everyone's laughing saying,

2073
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,770
�Oh, look at those people that were so dumb making wooden pipes.

2074
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:06,080
Were they really? Water has to breathe.�

2075
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,660
So if you study Victor Schauberger,

2076
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,460
you might get some really good insight in water.

2077
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,900
You see that everybody's got a piece of the puzzle.

2078
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,680
The kingdom is here, but it's in pieces.

2079
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,900
The kingdom actually, the world will be redone,

2080
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,900
but most people are not ready to hear how things are going to happen

2081
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,940
and when they're going to happen.

2082
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:32,080
Because when you read things, for example, in a holy writ,

2083
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,120
you will see that you're entering into a trust agreement

2084
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,920
and it's a private trust agreement.

2085
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,380
That's why, for example, if you know a Native American,

2086
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,540
he will say things to a certain point.

2087
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,920
If you know, for example, someone who's a Denali,

2088
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,620
people refer to them as Navajo here.

2089
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,480
And I'll ask a man who is of the Denali,

2090
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,700
�Dinele� means people.

2091
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,840
He'll say, �Tell me what you know and we'll get to a certain point.�

2092
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,020
And he says, �I can't tell you about this

2093
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,660
because I haven't gotten permission from my elders.�

2094
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:13,420
Wow! So this secret, this ancient knowledge is in a private trust.

2095
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,400
Do you see where I'm going with this?

2096
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,660
We've heard a lot about these trusts all the time.

2097
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,660
Oh, yeah.

2098
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:28,580
Information from the spiritual world is usually held in trust as well.

2099
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,280
Look at your prophets and your prophetesses.

2100
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:39,230
And what usually happens when a prophet or a prophetess

2101
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:41,530
goes out and speaks to people, they want to kill them, right?

2102
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,010
So when you're speaking to a group of people

2103
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:46,190
and they like what you're saying, you better stop and say,

2104
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,010
�Wait a second, I better check myself. Maybe I'm not saying it right.�

2105
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,610
Anybody ever stop and think about that?

2106
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:56,110
It's called ear-tickling. People want ear-tickling.

2107
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:09,470
I could hear someone in the background.

2108
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,170
So if you're speaking about spiritual matters

2109
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,470
and people are reaching to pull out a gun and shoot you

2110
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,890
or run you over with their car, you're probably doing it right.

2111
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:24,260
It doesn't mean you are. And it's a very tough place to be.

2112
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:29,060
But I want to go back maybe to the spiritual aspect about it.

2113
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,860
I wanted to interject that about water,

2114
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,700
because go look up what water really is.

2115
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,860
And you'll start learning about geometry and how we've gotten away.

2116
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:45,560
And this is all because we've lost contact with what the creation is.

2117
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,420
And if we've lost contact with the creation,

2118
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,820
how are we supposed to get even to the creator?

2119
01:15:50,280 --> 01:16:00,030
He's got beings around him to stop you before you get there.

2120
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:04,990
If you look at anyone in power, there's layers that you have to get to.

2121
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:08,510
If you're messing up the creation, how are you going to expect to go to the creator?

2122
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,820
So here's the message that I'd like to give so far,

2123
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,320
is that law comes from your deity.

2124
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:24,440
Now, I've chosen the ever-living the way he is described in the Bible,

2125
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,840
and the message that he gave through that.

2126
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,140
And I explained the reason why I've chosen to study that

2127
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,420
is because I found the most amount of detailed information there.

2128
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:39,020
It doesn't make someone else's work invalid.

2129
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,600
But if you choose anything else to study,

2130
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,340
you must prove that what is written in that holy writ

2131
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,300
is workable in your life and is workable in time.

2132
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:51,500
Absolutely.

2133
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,780
You've got to live it, you know.

2134
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,200
Now, one thing I've noticed in the spiritual world,

2135
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,320
that 1,000 years of our existence is one day for them.

2136
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,300
Absolutely.

2137
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,640
So when someone says, well, that's really old stuff,

2138
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:11,600
and you look at, you know, it was given, let's say, 3,000 or 4,000 years ago,

2139
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:17,720
how is it old when it was just given to us four days ago from their perspective?

2140
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,280
What makes it so old?

2141
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,920
They're not used to looking in time like these people look in time.

2142
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,580
And this is the thing.

2143
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,400
I teach people to heal because it's a formula.

2144
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,540
It's a law.

2145
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,300
And once you understand the law,

2146
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:40,700
there is no time, there is no space, there is no damn distance.

2147
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,560
It's instantaneous.

2148
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,840
But these people don't believe and understand and think that

2149
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:53,000
because of the bullshit that's taught by these damn frappin' ass preachers, ministers, clerks, etc.,

2150
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,740
because they don't want you to know who and what the hell you really are.

2151
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,680
You don't know.

2152
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:07,720
You're never going to be the deity that you are supposed to be in matter, space, and time

2153
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,940
because you cannot identify with it.

2154
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:17,540
You can't ascend to the heavenly realm because your ass don't even know you come from there.

2155
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:25,140
Yes, that goes back to the notion of what is the spirit, what is the soul, and what is the body.

2156
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,640
We have those three aspects.

2157
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,220
And I have yet to get a straight definition,

2158
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,860
and sometimes you just got to lay it out and let people see it for themselves.

2159
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,340
Oh, absolutely.

2160
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,440
And this concept of heaven and hell.

2161
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,840
There's a lot of talk about heaven and hell, I've noticed.

2162
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,840
And even in the translations from the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata, and the Koran are not correct.

2163
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:53,560
And especially your KJV or your NIV or your whatever.

2164
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,020
How can it be so blunt in your face,

2165
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:00,700
and they go ahead and translate and put a word in that is not there?

2166
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,360
Yeah, it's kind of like somebody made a statement.

2167
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,040
Way too much anger.

2168
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,440
Well, you better go back and read about your Messiah, your teacher.

2169
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,260
He braided a cord, whipped their ass, and run them out of the temple.

2170
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,200
And the scripture does say, be angry and sin not.

2171
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:23,560
I can whip your ass and straighten you up and not violate the law if I understand it.

2172
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:29,520
Because if I can do that, then I can wake your lethargic ass out of your damn sleep,

2173
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,040
and you can be the sleeper that awaketh.

2174
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,540
Oh, hallelujah.

2175
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:41,120
It ain't frustration, it's the damn application of the formula of instigation.

2176
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,540
You gotta handle all that, young folks.

2177
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,820
You know what, I think they're drinking too much milk of amnesia.

2178
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,980
Oh, we're on the same page.

2179
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,640
I just love being a butt kicker.

2180
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,640
That's why in the hell I was sent here.

2181
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,600
We're on the same page.

2182
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,780
Yeah, it's milk of amnesia.

2183
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,220
So, you know, if you look at what's going on, this concept of heaven and hell,

2184
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,380
you know, here's the thing.

2185
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,760
I run into these folks all the time and say,

2186
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:19,820
well, if you don't accept Jesus Christ, you're gonna burn in hell.

2187
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,840
And I said, wait a second, wait a second.

2188
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,360
I just ran into another fellow a few minutes ago, and he says,

2189
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,580
he said that Jesus Christ said that I could do anything I want

2190
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,980
because he washed away all my sins with his blood.

2191
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,080
Okay.

2192
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,960
And then I just ran into another fellow over here who said that, you know,

2193
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,300
well, you know, you've got to see my point.

2194
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,600
How many of them are there?

2195
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:48,140
You know, if you start reading scripture, you're like, wait a second.

2196
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,960
Where did these folks get this stuff?

2197
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:51,080
Yeah.

2198
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,500
Where did these poor folks get this stuff?

2199
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,460
So that's why there are special, if you read Malachi chapter two,

2200
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,660
you know, you're going to get quite a sense.

2201
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,640
I've had, I used to be on some conference calls a few years ago,

2202
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,460
and some pastors would call me in private and say,

2203
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,220
I want you to come and speak to my congregation.

2204
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,020
And I said, whoa, why?

2205
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,720
He says, because you know a lot about the Bible.

2206
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,540
And I said, are you sure you want me to come and speak to your congregation?

2207
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,340
He says, absolutely.

2208
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,740
We're going to fly you out to Dallas and this and that.

2209
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,360
We couldn't teach them in their congregation.

2210
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:23,780
Yeah.

2211
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,520
So I tell these guys.

2212
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:31,100
There ain't no way in hell for me to tell the secret to the masses.

2213
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:32,400
Yes.

2214
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,640
Well, this is the point.

2215
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,200
And I say, well, I asked the pastor or the priest or whatever.

2216
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,200
I said, do you have a Bible?

2217
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,700
And they laugh, of course, you know, because how could you be a pastor and not have a Bible?

2218
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,160
I said, well, I want you to do me a favor and a promise.

2219
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,320
And he says, okay, I'll do what you tell me to do.

2220
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,860
And I said, well, I want you to read Malachi chapter two.

2221
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:50,400
What verse?

2222
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,620
Just start reading Malachi chapter two.

2223
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,560
When you had enough, hang up and call me back.

2224
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,020
And then we'll make the arrangements for me to come out.

2225
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,720
And none of them have ever called me back.

2226
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:01,800
None of them.

2227
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,320
No, because when they read Malachi, they know it's talking about them.

2228
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:09,440
It's talking.

2229
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,860
It's very, very, very, very specific.

2230
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,080
You can't get more specific than that.

2231
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,240
So that's what I'm saying.

2232
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:24,880
I've stopped speaking to people that adhere to a particular belief.

2233
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,200
When someone says to me again, well, I don't believe what he does or I don't believe what you do.

2234
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,340
I say, I don't care about what you believe.

2235
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,920
Tell me what you know, because what you believe cannot help me.

2236
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,560
But what you know might.

2237
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,740
I agree with you.

2238
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,880
What you know, what you are doing.

2239
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,220
Just like they're telling you.

2240
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,220
Well, I don't believe this.

2241
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,200
I don't believe that.

2242
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,660
So what do you want to die?

2243
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,940
You don't want to or do you want to get well?

2244
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,820
Well, I want to get well.

2245
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,180
Well, I don't do what you believe.

2246
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,540
And if I do what you believe, your ass is going to die.

2247
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:04,060
Now, if you'll listen to me, I'll tell you and I'll show you and you'll get well.

2248
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,060
Which one do you want?

2249
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,780
You know what they always tell me?

2250
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,820
Show me what it is you got.

2251
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,500
And so I do and they get well.

2252
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,960
And then they go back and they say, I know you did it.

2253
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,520
I just don't understand it.

2254
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,040
I said, well, which one do you want to get?

2255
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,200
You want to learn?

2256
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,340
You want to understand?

2257
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,620
You want to live?

2258
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,380
You want to be healed and healthy?

2259
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,220
Or do you sorry ass want to die?

2260
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,420
They got a graveyard out there and there's three or four cats as well and dig a hole.

2261
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,980
And they ready to shove your ass in there.

2262
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,800
Now, which one do you want?

2263
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,780
You know, it's amazing how much of an attitude adjustment they get.

2264
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,180
Well, again, you go to your deity and if you're doing it right, there's going to be provisions.

2265
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,820
And what you're going to notice is it takes a gift.

2266
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,960
For example, when the Christ turned the water into wine, did he really?

2267
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:07,760
If you look at the story very, very closely, he was told to do that.

2268
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,540
And he said, wait a second, if I do that, they will know what I'm able to do.

2269
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,480
So they're all in agreement.

2270
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:21,840
So what actually happened, his mother said, okay, he agreed.

2271
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:25,380
So do exactly as he tells you to do.

2272
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,640
So they were obedient.

2273
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,300
They would say, okay, tell us what we want done.

2274
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,580
Exactly as he tells you to do.

2275
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,680
It's not this mystical, magical stuff that nobody knows.

2276
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:44,300
The clerk, the Roman church, the damn government tells you, it's do what he tells you to do.

2277
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,360
Oh, God, I just love you.

2278
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,560
You see the deity aspect of it.

2279
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,620
So what they did was they went and fetched these large cisterns of water.

2280
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,580
And there's still water.

2281
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,000
And they poured it into a cup.

2282
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:55,840
It's still water.

2283
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,880
And they give it to the host's mouth.

2284
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,980
They're still bringing him water.

2285
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,760
He puts it to his mouth and now it's wine.

2286
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:09,380
And he says, wow, typically we bring out, you see, the best wine.

2287
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,540
You see how the story goes.

2288
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,520
So there's something going on here.

2289
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,740
That's why I tell people, if you want to see what's going on, it's all, you've got all the equipment.

2290
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,760
You just don't know how to use it.

2291
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,520
It's six sparkings of water.

2292
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,040
Six sparkings.

2293
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,860
Six is the number of man tripled.

2294
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,080
Outer court, middle court, motosa court.

2295
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:37,860
Six is the number of the feminine bab aspect.

2296
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:45,100
And until you impregnate her with life and possess her, as the creator told us from the beginning,

2297
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:49,560
your sorry ass is going to die because you're just an ignoramus.

2298
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,720
It's just that damn simple.

2299
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,320
All right, here's the other thing.

2300
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,180
When you read in any of the scriptures, where does it say to keep women down?

2301
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:58,900
Nowhere.

2302
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,680
Matter of fact, Little Al found a research paper today.

2303
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,800
And I sent it out to everybody on this call.

2304
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,320
And it was talking about Mary the Magdala, Magdalene.

2305
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:19,740
She was really the chief apostle because the men were so damn upset that the woman understood.

2306
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:27,260
But yet the woman, feminine, female, iron male, is symbolic of wisdom, Sophia.

2307
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:35,100
She could not find a place among men, the male aspect of the Vatican, the political aspect.

2308
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,580
But she was the teacher of the house.

2309
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:46,360
And our women have got to go back to being the witches, the wise women, the true teachers.

2310
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:52,940
And when they get off their ass and raise up and start teaching, then our children will raise up.

2311
01:26:52,940 --> 01:27:00,560
And then when our men understand what those women are, instead of beating and brow-beating and trying to beat them down,

2312
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,640
then damn it, we will all rise up.

2313
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,540
Because it is a two-fold aspect that creates the third aspect.

2314
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,220
Well, the man does this.

2315
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:19,320
I said, have you ever seen a rooster spread his wings and protect the chicks?

2316
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,200
He said, well, no.

2317
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,580
I said, well, what does?

2318
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,760
He said, the hen.

2319
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,660
I said, she spreads her wings and protects the brood.

2320
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,160
That's right, hen.

2321
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,760
That's why she's called the nail, the hook of the tent.

2322
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,880
And when you get your head out of your ass, rectus, as Bograts would say it,

2323
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:46,860
get a plexotomy so you can see, you'll understand, you'll quit beating these women down like this damn Roman cult has,

2324
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,060
and you'll come back to power.

2325
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,940
Our women are worth something.

2326
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:59,600
Well, the Christ even said, I would like to be like a hen spreading her wings over her little chicks to the Pharisees,

2327
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,820
but you would not let me.

2328
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,220
Well, if you read in Psalms 111, wisdom is what?

2329
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,360
A she.

2330
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,300
If you read in Ecclesiastes, wisdom is what?

2331
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:10,840
A she.

2332
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,120
She is wisdom.

2333
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,940
Okay, shekhinah.

2334
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,780
She-khinah.

2335
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,940
The feminine spirit aspect in nine applications.

2336
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,620
Seven chakras revealed.

2337
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,980
Two hidden.

2338
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,600
Oh, my.

2339
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,600
She's called the Holy Ghost.

2340
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:31,240
They tried to make a damn man out of her, but she is a woman.

2341
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,340
Yeah, it ain't got nothing.

2342
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:38,060
She is a teacher, the tent, the nail, the hook of the tent called the valve.

2343
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:42,560
Go read it in the book of Jasher in case you people don't get a grand on it.

2344
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,460
Well, why do you think this earth is in the milky way?

2345
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,680
The gal, galactic, literally means milk.

2346
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,600
Gal in Hebrew, gal in Greek.

2347
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,060
Oh, shit, I love this guy.

2348
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:00,760
You're in the milky way, the galactic galaxy, that's all milk, milk, milk.

2349
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,500
You wonder why we're on the milk?

2350
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,920
We're on the land of milk and honey.

2351
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,840
Maybe later I'll tell you what I found out about honey.

2352
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:14,520
But the aspect, we have so, we've become apathetic.

2353
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,840
And again, I've got nothing against the powers that be.

2354
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,880
They're simply accommodating the people.

2355
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,180
Yes, they are.

2356
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,440
They are simply accommodating them.

2357
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,520
It is up to each one of us.

2358
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:30,300
If we say something, that word believe or to believe is a killer.

2359
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,140
It is a killer.

2360
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,780
And there's examples of that in scripture as well.

2361
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:42,900
While I was on another call and I was more sober, so to speak,

2362
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,720
on the aspects of the information,

2363
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,700
and I always bring up the Exodus on Cecil B. DeMille,

2364
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:56,280
all the movies that you see of Christ being crucified, for example.

2365
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,400
Oh, yeah.

2366
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,940
Those things, when you read scripture and go look at those movies,

2367
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,340
I'm not talking about glancing at it.

2368
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,260
Or having it read to you.

2369
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:08,080
When you actually sit down and read it,

2370
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,840
you're going to say those things never happened that way.

2371
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,040
And they didn't happen for those reasons.

2372
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,280
You know, and that's why I mentioned to have a,

2373
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,420
if we wanted to go down that path,

2374
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,020
you know, I could show you, for example,

2375
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,880
the various different things that are just right there that we just don't see.

2376
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,700
Okay.

2377
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,340
Can I interject?

2378
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,600
You see, there's some of them that don't understand that in this country,

2379
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,280
Elisha is called a male.

2380
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:50,480
But over in other countries where they have not cornered this information,

2381
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,920
Elisha is a woman.

2382
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,160
Just like Micah is Micah.

2383
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,700
And they don't understand that these women were great prophetesses.

2384
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:07,340
But they have left out the teacher, the tent of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding.

2385
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:12,360
A child was raised and trained up in the tent of his mother.

2386
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,900
She taught him the law of the impregnating aspect of the creator,

2387
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,900
the male aspect called father.

2388
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,700
And these people don't understand this.

2389
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:27,240
Washington is not the father of a great nation.

2390
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,380
Hell, the old idiom.

2391
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,560
Mama's baby.

2392
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,480
Papa's maybe.

2393
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,380
Well, they provide a mama.

2394
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,860
It's called Columbia or Liberty or Justice.

2395
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,560
And they're providing both aspects of it.

2396
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,520
But if you start researching the history, the secular history,

2397
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,860
and the structure of what they're providing the people,

2398
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,160
and you go way back,

2399
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:53,900
go to a university that's got some old, old books,

2400
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:57,300
and look up your Chaldean Hebrew history,

2401
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,720
back in those Mesopotamian days,

2402
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,880
and you will see the rituals of human sacrifice that they did back then

2403
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,880
are still prevalent today.

2404
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:11,060
And they're disguised in holidays and birthday celebrations,

2405
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,420
in toys.

2406
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:16,420
And we're focusing on the death aspect.

2407
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,940
Nature has both sides.

2408
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,180
You have life and you have death.

2409
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,740
You have life-giving energies and you have death-giving energies.

2410
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,380
When you look at the life-giving energies,

2411
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,620
the big end always comes out first.

2412
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:34,980
And when you look at the death-giving energies,

2413
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,280
you have a sharp point.

2414
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,140
Case in point, in the death side,

2415
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,980
which most people only know,

2416
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,120
a snake has teeth, a viper fangs,

2417
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,760
and they're hollow and a fluid is ejected once it goes under your skin.

2418
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,200
Like a hypodermic needle.

2419
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,880
Do you see a spear?

2420
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,920
It has a pointy tip.

2421
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,840
What's the purpose of a spear or the point on a sword

2422
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,560
or the point of an arrow?

2423
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:06,000
I'm not talking about using it to tickle your back with.

2424
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,820
You see, the bee's got a stinger.

2425
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:12,460
It comes to a sharp point and it's like a hypodermic needle.

2426
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,700
You see the reference?

2427
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,480
Okay, now let's go to the life-giving aspect.

2428
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,440
The big end always comes out first.

2429
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:20,940
When a woman bears a child,

2430
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,880
what is it called when the head doesn't come out first?

2431
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,980
Boy, we've got problems.

2432
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,300
We've got a break.

2433
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:28,900
Yeah, we've got to have...

2434
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,260
Okay, when you plant your garden,

2435
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:34,020
you get your seeds in the right depth,

2436
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,700
nice and cozy, and you water it.

2437
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,420
What do you see popping out the sprout?

2438
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,480
You see the big end come out first, right?

2439
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,480
Right, the head always comes out.

2440
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,520
Now when a chicken lays an egg,

2441
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,860
the big end comes out first.

2442
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,660
When a raindrop, a drop of water, is falling through the sky,

2443
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,560
the big end of the drop is going towards the resistance.

2444
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,700
I see it.

2445
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,640
See, so in life-giving energies, the big end goes first.

2446
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,020
You can look at the male anatomy.

2447
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,760
You can look at the female anatomy.

2448
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:06,800
Yep.

2449
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,160
Okay, if a woman's uterus is in the shape

2450
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,810
of an egg, okay?

2451
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:16,050
Now here's the thing.

2452
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:18,230
They put out all these things, for example,

2453
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,350
just to test you.

2454
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:23,070
It's in society all the time.

2455
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:29,390
Just to test you to see if you're getting information

2456
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:30,670
and you're sure.

2457
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,830
And when I say getting information,

2458
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:34,050
not what to believe in.

2459
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,390
They got this thing called

2460
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:38,270
what came first, the chicken or the egg?

2461
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:41,410
And I've seen academics use that.

2462
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,030
So we don't know.

2463
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,410
It's like the chicken or the egg thing.

2464
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,110
I'm like, that is the most foolish question

2465
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:47,750
I've ever heard once I started reading scriptures.

2466
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,350
The chicken came first.

2467
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:53,010
How do you know?

2468
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:54,990
Well, if you show me a blue egg,

2469
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,230
I'll see that's not a chicken egg.

2470
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,190
That's a robin's egg.

2471
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,710
And if you show me an egg that's so large

2472
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:00,890
it fits in the palm of my hand,

2473
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,510
well, that's got to be an ostrich egg.

2474
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:04,330
Do you see how simple?

2475
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,330
You know, why did the chicken cross the road?

2476
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:08,390
Because someone built a road on the darn farm?

2477
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,810
You know, or what came first,

2478
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,630
the chicken or the egg?

2479
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,770
Well, today would be the chicken farmer, wouldn't it?

2480
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,410
Because chickens won't do too good in the wild today.

2481
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:26,430
No, they won't.

2482
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:28,870
Okay, so here's the other thing.

2483
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:30,330
I want to go back to time.

2484
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:32,890
Okay, so here are your months, all right?

2485
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:34,810
They've got all their pagan gods

2486
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,550
and here we get to the seventh month

2487
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:39,870
and they're calling it September, which is proper.

2488
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,450
Septim means seven.

2489
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:44,610
Octo is eight, like octagon.

2490
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:46,550
Novo is nine.

2491
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,690
December, decimal, deca is ten.

2492
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,090
So how do they get off calling December the 12th month?

2493
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:57,470
November, you see, the 11th, when it means nine.

2494
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:00,110
October, which means eight.

2495
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:01,750
They call it the 10th month.

2496
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:02,950
And September is seven.

2497
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:04,790
Yeah, they go back to them.

2498
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,430
They're calling it the ninth.

2499
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:08,350
What did Caesar and Augustus do when they screwed time?

2500
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,750
Well, this is what they did.

2501
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:13,670
They were following the sun.

2502
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:19,170
There's a certain aspect of if the sun doesn't rise,

2503
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,790
we're all screwed.

2504
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:22,130
We're all going to die.

2505
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:24,550
So we've got to focus on the sun.

2506
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:26,490
And go ahead and look at your friends

2507
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,850
that everybody thinks they're your friends, your Mayans.

2508
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:30,650
Oh, they love the Mayan calendar.

2509
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:34,610
These guys worked on a base 20 system, OK?

2510
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,690
It was completely different.

2511
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:42,750
And as a matter of fact, go study their society

2512
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,870
and look at what their pyramids were used for.

2513
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,960
You want to go down that line?

2514
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,740
OK, fine.

2515
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,820
That's OK.

2516
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,540
I don't know much about them, and I don't

2517
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,700
want to know much about them.

2518
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:01,060
Well, in reality, in reality, let me take that for them.

2519
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,920
That's why I'm bringing this up.

2520
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,780
I'm playing it.

2521
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,180
There's a wheel within the wheel.

2522
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,100
And Ezekiel is telling you about that because Ezekiel's

2523
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:15,600
grandmother, an Aaronite Levitical priest himself,

2524
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,300
his grandmother was Maya.

2525
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,140
And that's the Temple of Maya.

2526
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,140
And if you take that temple, it is the exact layout

2527
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:27,580
of the Book of Ezekiel.

2528
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:33,280
It's ankle deep, knee deep, hip deep, and water to swim in.

2529
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:38,560
His daddy was a cat called Buzi in the Book of Ezekiel.

2530
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,100
You know him as the Guatama Buddha.

2531
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,560
He walked in the middle path.

2532
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:48,320
He understood the three aspects of the cross

2533
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,460
and Golgotha, the place of the skull,

2534
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,820
the 22 bones of the cranium.

2535
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,160
And he knew that the right and left hemispheres

2536
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:01,440
had to be brought into subjection to the higher aspect

2537
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,900
of divine law.

2538
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,660
And that is what they are not teaching in our scripture.

2539
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:11,240
And our damn preachers don't know shit from Shinoah.

2540
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,360
Well, that would be a different aspect.

2541
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:19,920
One way to look at it, and that would be, again,

2542
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,260
I'm sort of adhering to the text because I see

2543
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:25,880
a straight flow through it.

2544
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:30,620
And your interjection is,

2545
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,480
I've got nothing.

2546
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,420
If that works for you, that's fine.

2547
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,180
Well, it does, because I can't heal if I don't understand it.

2548
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,760
Correct.

2549
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,540
Now, back with the time...

2550
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,660
To do the same thing, I have to teach them to do it.

2551
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,780
Okay, so when you look at your time...

2552
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,020
Nature means something.

2553
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,320
And nature has a law.

2554
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,620
And nature is under a higher law.

2555
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:57,260
And when you understand that law of creation,

2556
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:01,580
there is nothing that will be withheld from you.

2557
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,620
Now, we're rising to that level.

2558
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,380
And you're damn good at what you're doing,

2559
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,920
because with the etymological references,

2560
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,700
oh, man, I wish you'd get into all the stuff

2561
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,460
I heard you on Angela's call.

2562
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:15,640
Okay, well, all right.

2563
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,560
So when you look at the time...

2564
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,920
It'll make them go to thinking.

2565
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:21,420
That's why I love you,

2566
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,880
and that's why I really wanted you,

2567
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,360
is because you're gonna make these people think.

2568
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:29,480
And if they don't think,

2569
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,980
they will not lift their lethargic butt

2570
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:35,740
out of the place of destruction.

2571
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,240
They've got to learn to reason.

2572
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:41,600
And that's why you were so unique.

2573
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,380
And that is why I wanted you.

2574
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,280
And that is exactly what Angela was telling you.

2575
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:51,980
Get in there, click butt, and take some serious names.

2576
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,760
Hell, you got the program?

2577
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,620
You the sniper, start popping the cap.

2578
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,040
Wake the folks up.

2579
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,940
Let's do maybe a little bit on time.

2580
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,760
We need the meat instead of the milk.

2581
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,780
We need something we can chew on.

2582
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,280
Well, do you want me to give a quick proof

2583
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,560
on what time is in terms of keeping time?

2584
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,460
Or do you want me to show you how to define

2585
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:18,040
what the soul, the spirit, and the body really is?

2586
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,800
Yeah, get it on, Bubba, get it on.

2587
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,300
All right, let's go with time.

2588
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,560
Get out there.

2589
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:28,620
You know, we're able to stand up and, you know, it's not a big...

2590
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,720
All right, here you go with time.

2591
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,900
Okay, so they're telling you right in front of your face.

2592
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,600
Now, if you start going out screaming

2593
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,640
that September's really the seventh month,

2594
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,220
they got a place for you.

2595
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,880
You know, it's either behind bars or in a bar.

2596
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:50,160
You know, and these things I see in a way,

2597
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:54,880
they're left in place to kind of see who's waking up.

2598
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,860
Because, see, when you hold a big hammer,

2599
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,500
everything looks like a nail, right?

2600
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:03,840
And the nail that sticks up from the floor gets pounded down.

2601
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:09,060
So these things are going to be revealed to everyone.

2602
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,580
Everyone will know these things,

2603
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,160
but it's still right in front of us.

2604
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:14,560
So if we start looking at time,

2605
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,200
and you want to look at your functions of time,

2606
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,820
you've got your years and your months,

2607
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,540
you've got your weeks and your days.

2608
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:25,360
One of the core elements to kind of see what's going on

2609
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,540
is get your months down.

2610
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,640
Because once you get your months down,

2611
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:29,760
you get your weeks down.

2612
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,100
And then the days and the years are much simpler.

2613
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,700
So when you look at the word month, okay,

2614
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,960
if you look at the etymological roots of it,

2615
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:44,960
it came from the Germanic word mund, M-O-N-D-E,

2616
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,600
which sounds very much like moon.

2617
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,480
Now, if you ever heard the Latin term, the fin de mund,

2618
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,840
which means the end of the world,

2619
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,000
they're not talking about the end of the world

2620
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,460
because the world, there's a different name for the world,

2621
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:00,880
it's terra, is the world, I mean the earth.

2622
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,460
The world means society when they say the end of the world,

2623
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,680
and your society is based on the moon.

2624
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,200
They're saying the moon has something to do with it.

2625
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,440
And you hear about all this title research and all this stuff.

2626
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,240
Okay, well, so when they say fin de mund,

2627
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,020
it's not the end of the world, it's the end of the moon.

2628
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:22,000
Okay, so what's going on?

2629
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:27,080
Well, the creator says the seventh day is to be set apart.

2630
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,440
That means that one-seventh of your time

2631
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:34,660
is no commerce, no work.

2632
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:38,760
When I say work, I'm not talking about mowing your lawn,

2633
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,940
I'm talking about going to what you do for work.

2634
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,400
And the priests were exempt from this,

2635
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,460
because when you're a priest, there's a fellow saying,

2636
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:51,180
well, you know, I'm having a problem keeping the Sabbath.

2637
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,400
I'm like, didn't he make us kings and priests?

2638
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,220
What day did the priests take off?

2639
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,560
Oh, you're right, I see.

2640
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,740
You see, so when you take that priestly or kingly position,

2641
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,060
you're working all the time.

2642
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:07,960
But the Sabbath, everyone understands that,

2643
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,240
okay, we're supposed to take that day off.

2644
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,440
Okay, well, when does your month begin?

2645
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:17,680
Now, a simple example would be,

2646
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,800
well, let's look at the Battle of Jericho.

2647
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,700
Okay, now they get out of Egypt,

2648
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:27,020
and they go all the way around.

2649
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,140
If you look at all the zigzag paths they took,

2650
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:34,000
they took the long way to get to that part

2651
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,600
of what was called Canaan.

2652
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,680
And they approached it from the east, all right?

2653
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:43,380
And they marched around it for seven days.

2654
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,720
And on the seventh day, they attacked.

2655
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,680
And people say, well, see, that's a biblical anomaly,

2656
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:51,480
because attacking is work.

2657
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:58,020
And they basically pillaged it.

2658
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,780
So you see, there's a Sabbath anomaly there.

2659
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,860
I said, nope, there isn't.

2660
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,700
Because they started on the first day of the month.

2661
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,700
Now, the first day of the month, in reference to Scripture,

2662
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:14,520
is the first day of the month, period.

2663
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,700
The next day, or the second day of the month,

2664
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,060
is the first day of your first week.

2665
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,360
So when they started on the first day of the month,

2666
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:30,420
day two is day one, and so on and so forth.

2667
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:33,300
You see, day three is day two of the week,

2668
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:34,480
but third day of the month.

2669
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,740
That's why when you read in Scripture,

2670
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:38,820
it says on the 11th day of the fifth month.

2671
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,020
That has nothing to do with your weeks.

2672
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,680
Your month count is your month count.

2673
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,280
Your first day of the month is the first day of the month.

2674
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,420
And you get 12 or 13 first day of the months.

2675
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:53,540
So they marched on the seventh day,

2676
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,500
was the sixth day of the week, but the seventh day of the month.

2677
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,740
It was the seventh day of the second month.

2678
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:03,480
So they attacked Jericho, besieged it,

2679
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,520
and then they had their Sabbath.

2680
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,920
So when you see the new moon,

2681
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,600
and I'm going to explain what the new moon is,

2682
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:14,380
because it ain't what you think, scripturally.

2683
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:20,340
The new moon is your first day of the month.

2684
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,340
The next day is the first day of your first week,

2685
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,320
but your time is measured by saying,

2686
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,080
by using the day of the month, just like they do today.

2687
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:31,820
And here's a simple anomaly.

2688
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,380
When you look at your calendar, let's say,

2689
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,220
pick a day like, you know, September 15th.

2690
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,740
This year it might be on a Tuesday,

2691
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,340
but last year it was on a Wednesday.

2692
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:44,940
Next year it might be on a Thursday.

2693
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,040
What's going on here?

2694
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:49,800
Is September 15th a Tuesday, a Wednesday, or a Thursday?

2695
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:50,640
It's neither.

2696
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:53,540
Now who is your timekeeper here?

2697
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,740
Who is your priest in this part of the world?

2698
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:00,020
Well, if you look them up, it's called the Naval Observatory.

2699
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,220
You go to their website,

2700
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:06,460
and they'll tell you we only count days off of the Julian calendar.

2701
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,640
And you can go to the website yourself

2702
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,740
and research Julian and Gregorian calendars

2703
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:11,980
on the Naval Observatory,

2704
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:16,300
and they will tell you that we only count days,

2705
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,960
and weeks, and months, and years

2706
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,300
are nothing but arbitrary notions.

2707
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:27,500
Oh, so your rulers have done away with Sabbaths,

2708
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,560
and months, and years, and everything.

2709
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:31,520
It's right there in front of you.

2710
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,100
Just go.

2711
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,480
There's no specific link or anything.

2712
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:37,480
Anybody can search the Naval Observatory, Gregorian,

2713
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,500
or Julian calendar, and you shall see that.

2714
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,520
Now, if you read in...

2715
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,840
So when is it the first day of the month,

2716
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:46,960
and what is the new moon?

2717
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,720
Well, real simple, when you say new moon,

2718
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:52,560
you go to the Naval Observatory, and it's that dark moon, okay?

2719
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,800
It's new.

2720
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,200
Well, is it really?

2721
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:59,180
And if you look at what's called the Jewish or Hebraic calendar,

2722
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,420
they'll say it's the dark moon.

2723
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,480
But is that scriptural?

2724
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:07,120
He says in Genesis that he created the lights in the heaven

2725
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:11,240
for keeping the monads, the times, the seasons.

2726
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:15,580
Okay, then he made the lesser one and the greater one,

2727
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,540
one to rule the day and one to rule the night.

2728
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,880
They're both the same size.

2729
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,040
It's just one is the 2 million watt light bulb,

2730
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:25,240
the other one's a 200 watt light bulb,

2731
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,960
if you look at it in your Hebrew.

2732
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,580
And I was going to go over that strictly in the text,

2733
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,520
but I might as well just say it forward.

2734
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:38,920
Now, the eastern, the golden gate is facing the east.

2735
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,320
And Ezekiel, he says, when on the new moon,

2736
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,920
you open the eastern gate.

2737
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:47,520
Where does the full moon rise?

2738
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:48,240
In the east.

2739
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,260
And it's exactly the same size as the sun.

2740
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,480
The disk of the moon when it's full

2741
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:56,900
is the same size as the disk of the sun when it's rising.

2742
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:01,700
And it comes up on the opposite gate depending on the season.

2743
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,300
Where the sun rises in the winter,

2744
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,000
the moon rises in the summer.

2745
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,160
And they switch places gradually through the year.

2746
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,540
And that's another way of getting into your equinoxes.

2747
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:13,440
But your full moon is your new moon.

2748
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:17,060
And here's your other way to look at it.

2749
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:19,660
When they left Egypt,

2750
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,460
they left on the 14th day of the month,

2751
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,980
going on the 15th, okay?

2752
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:27,980
So, when they left Egypt,

2753
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:31,520
it says very specifically in Exodus

2754
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:39,020
that he gave them a pillar of smoke by day

2755
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:41,860
and a pillar of fire by night to give them light.

2756
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,900
Now, in the middle of your month,

2757
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,220
every month for me,

2758
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,640
around the 15th or 14th of the month,

2759
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,800
the sky is dark.

2760
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:53,780
Now, why would you give them a pillar of fire

2761
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:56,040
to give them light if it's a full moon

2762
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,020
in the middle of the month,

2763
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,020
if you use the dark moon as your new moon?

2764
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,800
That just doesn't make any good horse sense to me.

2765
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,920
And if you're reading your Psalms,

2766
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,960
I think it's 81,

2767
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,160
he says on the new moon,

2768
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,040
the full moon blow the trumpet.

2769
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,260
So, it's the full moon because you see

2770
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,600
he doesn't work in the dark.

2771
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:23,560
He brings things out into the light.

2772
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,060
So, you wonder why everybody's doing the opposite

2773
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,200
and you wonder why we're having all these problems.

2774
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,840
So, now, what you will also see

2775
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,500
what lines up really well

2776
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:36,620
is your first Sabbath is your first quarter,

2777
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,480
your first half waning moon.

2778
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,640
Your second Sabbath,

2779
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,660
your first Sabbath being on the eighth day,

2780
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,460
then you get another seven days.

2781
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,580
Because the first Sabbath is on the eighth day

2782
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:51,980
because you got the first day of the month plus seven.

2783
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,400
Your second Sabbath is on the 15th,

2784
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,140
which is what they call the new moon,

2785
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,660
which is actually the dark moon.

2786
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,640
And your third Sabbath

2787
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,980
is on your waxing half moon.

2788
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:11,320
And your fourth Sabbath comes right before

2789
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,040
your full moon.

2790
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:14,600
Because also you'll see the Sabbaths,

2791
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:15,760
when the Sabbaths are over,

2792
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,260
they're either going to be half full

2793
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:20,780
or precisely black or precisely full.

2794
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:23,320
So, the way you would do your count

2795
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,200
is if it's the first day of the month,

2796
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,740
it's the first day of the month,

2797
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:28,660
second day of the month,

2798
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,100
third day of the month and so on.

2799
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,440
But the second day of the month

2800
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,940
is when you start your week count.

2801
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,320
Now, you go all the way down.

2802
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,860
So, your Sabbaths are on the eighth of the month,

2803
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:43,260
the 15th, the 22nd and the 29th.

2804
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,940
Okay, here's the 29th day of the month.

2805
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:46,060
This is the last Sabbath.

2806
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:48,340
But it doesn't mean you're going to have

2807
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,100
29 days in your month.

2808
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,980
You might have 30, you might have 31

2809
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,240
because it's observational.

2810
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,800
He wants you to observe it.

2811
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,780
It's all by observation.

2812
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,960
So, you see how it's not 28 point whatever

2813
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,740
or 29 point whatever?

2814
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,800
How they show it.

2815
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,400
And everything works out in a neat little package

2816
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,620
once you get to the equinoxes.

2817
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:15,100
And then you need a little more

2818
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:16,380
information.

2819
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,300
But before we get to...

2820
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:23,040
And see, that would figure out your year.

2821
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,420
When spring, when you find the bead,

2822
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,080
your first month, your reference point.

2823
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,300
But before we jump to that,

2824
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,280
I want to go simply back to the day.

2825
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,740
Well, when does the day start?

2826
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,340
Well, everybody knows the day starts at midnight.

2827
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,360
That's what they say.

2828
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,880
Well, what happened before you had those clocks

2829
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,520
and what if they took all the clocks away?

2830
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,280
How would you reckon when the day starts?

2831
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,140
Well, when you look in Genesis,

2832
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:48,960
he keeps saying over and over,

2833
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,780
there was evening, there was morning,

2834
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,260
the first day, there was evening,

2835
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,660
there was morning, the second day,

2836
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:54,600
so on and so forth.

2837
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,600
Now, he only has to say it twice

2838
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,420
but he knows we're so thick and stubborn

2839
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:59,460
that he's going to have to say it

2840
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:00,460
at least six times.

2841
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,000
So, what does the word even mean?

2842
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:06,760
Well, if the scales are even,

2843
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:07,920
what does it look like?

2844
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,620
You've got the left and the right side

2845
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:12,560
equal parts.

2846
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,980
So, if the sun travels through the sky

2847
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,160
from east to west,

2848
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:20,500
when do you have equal parts of east

2849
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,840
and equal parts of west?

2850
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,020
When the sun is straight up and down, right?

2851
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,260
Straight above in the middle.

2852
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:26,440
Noontime.

2853
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,220
Noontime, right,

2854
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,440
but not noon with your mechanical clock.

2855
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,200
It's observational, you see.

2856
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,740
Now, let's jump back to this world now

2857
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:38,320
because we're talking about the way

2858
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,780
this is the spiritual message.

2859
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,460
If we jump back to this world,

2860
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,620
let's look at it real close.

2861
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,460
In banks, when you deposit a check afternoon,

2862
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,160
don't they count it as the next day?

2863
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:50,520
Okay.

2864
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,560
They used to do that before ATMs.

2865
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,400
If you go to your naval observatory again,

2866
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,360
look up Julian calendar or Gregorian calendar

2867
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,480
and start reading about what they're reckoning

2868
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:04,020
and they will tell you verbatim

2869
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,980
for everybody knows

2870
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:11,340
and also the scientific community

2871
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,440
that the day starts at noon.

2872
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,440
But for civil purposes,

2873
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,400
the people have been told

2874
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,900
it starts at midnight.

2875
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,660
Isn't it real easy to weed out

2876
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,980
the haves and the have-nots that way?

2877
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:30,580
Yes.

2878
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,420
Do you want to know who doesn't know?

2879
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,500
Everybody who stands around Times Square

2880
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,280
watching that ball drop at midnight?

2881
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:37,920
Do you want to know?

2882
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:39,360
Those are the people who don't know.

2883
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,920
I agree.

2884
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:45,400
Do you see where I'm going?

2885
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,700
You know, he talks about 7,000.

2886
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,440
Okay, he spoke to Elijah in the cave.

2887
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,360
Don't worry, there's 7,000 more.

2888
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,520
Well, look at it real carefully.

2889
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:56,680
Were there 7,000 or is there really 7,001?

2890
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,580
There are things that you see.

2891
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:07,320
Also, we work on a base of 10.

2892
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:10,440
Our numerical system of 0 through 9

2893
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,000
make all the numbers base 10.

2894
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,520
The Babylonians worked on a base 60.

2895
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,800
Computers work on base 2.

2896
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,500
The Bible works on base 7.

2897
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,540
I just want to throw that out there

2898
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,620
because that might be another call on numbering.

2899
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:29,620
But, you see, your day starts at noon.

2900
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,520
Now, if you go to Nehemiah around 13,

2901
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,200
he says, look,

2902
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:37,460
and it became dark under the gates of Jerusalem.

2903
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:39,740
Now, wait a second.

2904
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:42,080
He doesn't say it was dark in Jerusalem.

2905
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:44,080
You see, they got the people in certain religions

2906
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,980
believing that the day starts at sundown.

2907
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:52,460
Ain't so, because sundown is a very ambiguous thing.

2908
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,060
So, in Nehemiah, they say,

2909
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,760
well, it was dark in Jerusalem.

2910
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:00,900
Okay, it says here it was dark under the gates.

2911
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,400
Now, do you know what the gates of Jerusalem look like?

2912
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:07,820
They have these walls that are anywhere between 8 and 16 feet thick

2913
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:11,000
and there's an archway about 30 feet high

2914
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,800
and you walk under it.

2915
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,640
And that's how they let you in.

2916
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,200
It's kind of like you're crossing the border today

2917
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,680
or going through an airport, you know.

2918
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,820
They inspect everybody going in and coming out.

2919
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:24,520
And he says it was dark under the gates.

2920
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:28,180
That means the sun has to be overhead

2921
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,660
because if the sun is not,

2922
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,340
if it's on an angle in the sky,

2923
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,120
the shadow migrates and you get some light coming into the gate.

2924
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,180
And Nehemiah says, why are you letting the people in?

2925
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,200
It's the Sabbath.

2926
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,740
What are you doing letting them in?

2927
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:49,100
See, it's busy out there because everyone, you know, it's busy.

2928
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:51,480
It's midday.

2929
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:55,980
See, and another, if you go to, I think, chapter 7 or 8,

2930
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:00,880
he says, wait until the gates get really hot before you let them in.

2931
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,740
Well, how can it be at sundown or midnight

2932
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:08,800
when the gate's done cooled off by 4 o'clock, 3 o'clock?

2933
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,360
The gates get really hot by noon.

2934
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,920
So it's right there in your scripture.

2935
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,440
And you don't have to go as far as Nehemiah.

2936
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,640
There are many other examples.

2937
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,500
If you look at the New Testament, you see the same examples.

2938
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,740
When you start looking at your times, when your days were.

2939
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:29,140
You know, how can you be sitting around the shores of Galilee

2940
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:30,820
and the next day you get on the boat,

2941
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:32,520
you're sitting right there and you go across.

2942
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,520
You see, it's noontime.

2943
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,420
It's when the next day is counted.

2944
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,740
That's why there's so much confusion going on.

2945
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,560
But is there really confusion?

2946
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,100
Because if you go out today and tell people the day starts at noon,

2947
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:45,820
they're going to say you're nuts.

2948
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:49,040
Look at your old common law courts.

2949
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,720
They had, a man steals your horse, he's guilty.

2950
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:55,840
You have your court in the morning and you hang him the next day.

2951
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,900
That's how they did it in the West.

2952
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:00,600
But they always hung him at high noon.

2953
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:03,630
Yes.

2954
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:07,110
You see, so that was the next day.

2955
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:10,110
Not 12 midnight or sundown.

2956
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:13,990
So these things are right in front of us and they are organic.

2957
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:17,810
Okay, and we learn organically.

2958
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:20,350
You know, some people say, well, how do you know so many languages?

2959
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:21,390
And I'm like, real easy.

2960
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:23,790
Well, it's not real easy, it takes work.

2961
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:27,670
Go download a coloring book for children.

2962
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:30,610
Start coloring in those letters and words.

2963
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:33,810
And you will not forget them as a grown man using a coloring book.

2964
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,810
Those things will be absorbed much faster maybe.

2965
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:40,290
For some people, slower than for others.

2966
01:57:40,410 --> 01:57:43,130
But that is the simplest way to get familiar with a language.

2967
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:47,760
And once you start getting familiar with that language

2968
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,060
and you're familiar with scripture,

2969
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:53,900
you will see that not only individual people have been given pieces of it,

2970
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:58,860
but entire cultures have been given pieces of it.

2971
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:01,880
And they use them every day and they do not know what they're doing.

2972
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,500
I like how you use that analogy of the coloring book, Chris.

2973
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:08,440
I mean, that's how we taught our kids.

2974
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:10,720
Yeah, that's how we taught our kids.

2975
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:14,400
So you just basically go and do how you would teach a kid.

2976
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,880
You do it to yourself and you can learn it.

2977
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:18,380
I don't mean to give you a hard time,

2978
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:20,500
but I used to give people, you know,

2979
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:24,120
I hear them talking about the problems in the world.

2980
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:25,000
I said, hold on.

2981
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,000
And they're like, why?

2982
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,680
I said, we have no future.

2983
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,820
And they say, why do you say that?

2984
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,320
I said, because all of our children have been turned to goats.

2985
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,600
You see?

2986
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,620
I understand what you're saying.

2987
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:40,280
Yeah.

2988
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:47,480
I just wanted to point that out because, not on you,

2989
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,360
but the thing is, we can get very, very subtle.

2990
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,460
And a lot of people say, well, you're a real nitpicker or whatever.

2991
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:58,720
And I say, well, we've got the simple,

2992
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,900
let's look at the simple stuff first.

2993
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:02,500
The very simple stuff.

2994
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:09,520
And we're all trying and we're all working with each other.

2995
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:12,860
And that's the point.

2996
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:16,720
But again, with the time aspect,

2997
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:19,100
I just wanted to reveal those aspects of it.

2998
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:24,100
Now, to get into the year and when you determine the year,

2999
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,520
you basically use your equinoxes.

3000
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,640
And when you start, you've got your moons to count.

3001
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:36,040
But there's things called intercalation where your moon,

3002
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,900
sometimes you might have a 12th month.

3003
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,300
In a year, sometimes you'll have a 13th month

3004
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,600
based on your equinoxes.

3005
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:46,220
And that can get pretty complicated to explain at this point.

3006
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:50,180
But basically, your full moon after your spring equinox

3007
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:51,200
is your first month.

3008
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:53,640
That's an easy way to do it.

3009
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:00,360
What gets hard for people to wrap around their minds

3010
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:04,200
is that your year number changes in the seventh month

3011
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,080
during the time of ingathering.

3012
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:11,260
But it's not New Year's just because the number changes.

3013
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,680
Well, imagine like today, they go from January through December.

3014
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:19,060
And on December 31st at 1159.59, they change the year number.

3015
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:23,680
Well, how about you just change the year number in September,

3016
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:28,640
but your New Year's is still in January, let's say.

3017
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:31,020
That's one easy way to think about it, your celebration.

3018
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:36,260
So you actually have two New Year's in a scriptural year.

3019
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,180
You have the month that you change the year,

3020
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:40,080
which is the ingathering.

3021
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,480
He says in Leviticus, at the time of ingathering,

3022
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,880
that's the end of your year.

3023
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:49,960
But how can it be the end of the year at the seventh month

3024
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,320
when we're still way down the line from the first month again?

3025
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,320
Well, that's when you do your tallying in.

3026
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:57,920
You're accounting for the year.

3027
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,060
You see, they're using this kind of stuff today.

3028
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:07,540
The moon, typically the end of the month was when you settled accounts.

3029
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:10,920
That's why you get a monthly bill today.

3030
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:17,440
The same thing, you're still settling accounts before the moon,

3031
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,660
but it's not the creator's moon, it's their moon.

3032
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:23,360
The one that you have to get by buying a calendar

3033
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:25,200
or they actually give it to you on the phone

3034
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:29,260
or whatever electronic device you've got to kind of plug it in there.

3035
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:34,220
Because that just seems to be the standard today.

3036
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,400
That's just the way things are.

3037
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:39,240
And again, when you start getting into scripture,

3038
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:45,580
you get a very deep sense of comprehension on why things are the way they are.

3039
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:52,340
And it becomes easier for you to see that the things are the way they are

3040
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,140
because they're simply accommodating the people.

3041
02:01:55,140 --> 02:02:00,320
The people do not want to follow any form of ancient knowledge

3042
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,300
or the way things should be.

3043
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,620
And it's even in their own paperwork.

3044
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:11,040
It was quite shocking to go to the Naval Observatory

3045
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:16,120
and see on their website them mocking society

3046
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:22,520
by saying that scientists know, we know the day starts at noon,

3047
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:24,820
but for civil use it's at midnight.

3048
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:29,040
I mean, to me that's kind of a mockery in a way.

3049
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,420
I agree. That's why we can't trust, I guess,

3050
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,500
the leaders of the powers that be sometimes.

3051
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,800
They're accommodating the desires of the people.

3052
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:45,920
Now, here's the thing.

3053
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,460
Is it because they've held back education?

3054
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,460
Well, how have they held it back?

3055
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,460
I mean, I found it. It's right in front of me.

3056
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,780
But it's kind of a catch-22 because you go out teaching this,

3057
02:02:58,960 --> 02:02:59,700
you're viewed as a threat.

3058
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:02,840
Oh, what are you, going against our system?

3059
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:08,000
You see, so that's where the wisdom aspect comes in.

3060
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,760
Well, these things are not going to last very long.

3061
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,680
And, you know, when I tell people

3062
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,780
the Gregorian calendar is purely fiction,

3063
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,580
they say, well, it's been around a long time.

3064
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:18,880
I'm like, yep.

3065
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:24,570
You know, you don't start showing someone that says that something

3066
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:26,850
about what is really going on.

3067
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:33,590
Just because, you know, you put an ad in the paper for a carpenter

3068
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:35,470
and someone comes up to you and he says,

3069
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,690
well, I have 20 years' experience.

3070
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:39,270
Most people say, oh, that's great. It means you're good.

3071
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:41,410
No, it just means he has 20 years' experience.

3072
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:43,530
He could have been doing the wrong thing for 20 years.

3073
02:03:44,770 --> 02:03:45,510
I agree.

3074
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:50,450
Experience, you know, we need experience.

3075
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:50,930
Okay.

3076
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:56,090
So that's the aspect of your time.

3077
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:58,690
So, yeah, your day of rest.

3078
02:03:58,750 --> 02:03:59,890
Now, here's the kicker, okay?

3079
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:04,210
When you go research, I think there's a scientific term for it.

3080
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:06,750
It has to do with your metabolism and your heart rate.

3081
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:10,710
They've got a lot of documentation on how your heart rate is affected

3082
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:13,650
by the phases of the moon.

3083
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:16,510
Go imagine that.

3084
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:21,250
Where scripturally, each quarter is your Sabbath.

3085
02:04:21,450 --> 02:04:25,010
So maybe the quarters and the phases of the moon

3086
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:30,370
having an effect on the way your metabolism works

3087
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,430
is a coincidence.

3088
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:35,090
And if you look up that word coincidence,

3089
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:37,150
it really means to coincide with.

3090
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:39,730
So what is it coinciding with?

3091
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:41,990
Do you see my point?

3092
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:43,130
Yes.

3093
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:46,290
Coinciding with the truth in time.

3094
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:48,850
So we're not...

3095
02:04:50,470 --> 02:04:51,750
Believe it.

3096
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:56,030
We're out of sync with the true phases of the moon

3097
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:59,350
and we're coinciding with what they set up for us to follow.

3098
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:02,130
Well, yeah.

3099
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,610
I mean, you mean the people?

3100
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:06,350
You mean in general, the they or...

3101
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:09,970
Yes, because we don't...

3102
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:11,490
I mean, like you were talking about...

3103
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:12,730
He wants you to be more specific.

3104
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:13,910
He's more British.

3105
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:19,730
I understand, but what I'm saying is we've been taught a certain way

3106
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:22,710
and we don't know the true phases of the moon

3107
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:23,910
or the first day of the week.

3108
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:26,210
We only know what we've been taught.

3109
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:27,610
I know, yeah.

3110
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:30,690
Yeah, so what do we do?

3111
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:33,930
I mean, you know, the sharing, perhaps?

3112
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:36,990
You know, here's the thing.

3113
02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:40,550
You know, the things I speak on, it's not because I believe them.

3114
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:44,110
You see, I've observed them and I'm just sharing an observation.

3115
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:47,070
And once you observe it as being correct,

3116
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:49,010
because there is right and wrong and correct,

3117
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:54,590
you got to share it and you know it and you've got to live it.

3118
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:55,790
You see?

3119
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:59,290
There's many aspects to it.

3120
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:00,910
Now, there's people that know this information

3121
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:02,390
and don't do anything with it.

3122
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:03,190
They don't live it.

3123
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:06,470
So maybe that's another aspect to it.

3124
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:07,430
You've got to live it.

3125
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:11,090
I agree, but they're also keeping that from us.

3126
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:14,610
I mean, by all this other things they're making,

3127
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:16,510
keeping us busy, so to speak,

3128
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:18,810
where we don't have time for nothing else.

3129
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:21,770
To really find out the truth of many things.

3130
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:26,310
Yeah, if you go look at a lot of societies in history,

3131
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:29,570
Stalin put in a 10-day work week and an 8-day work week.

3132
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:33,990
There was some funny business going on in Egypt back in the days.

3133
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:37,030
There was funny business going on in China back in the days.

3134
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:40,750
I mean, if you go look at all your societies,

3135
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:43,590
everybody's trying to be their own deity, you see?

3136
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:46,670
Because the way you keep time, like I said earlier,

3137
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:48,850
you get it from your deity.

3138
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:53,770
And one easy way to make it more revealing

3139
02:06:53,770 --> 02:06:56,370
is you get law from your deity.

3140
02:06:56,610 --> 02:07:01,410
Law is not just civil law or traffic law or tax law or whatever

3141
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:02,610
like people have been taught.

3142
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:05,470
Law is every aspect of your life.

3143
02:07:05,570 --> 02:07:07,210
It's your operating system.

3144
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:10,810
It's what you eat, what you wear,

3145
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,110
how you do commerce, when you do commerce,

3146
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:14,070
how you keep time.

3147
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:19,790
And one easy way to make it really see how in your face

3148
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:24,330
they've managed us is every time you see the word law

3149
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:28,170
in anything, substitute it with the word god or deity.

3150
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:30,430
So let's go down the line.

3151
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:31,650
You've got commercial gods.

3152
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:32,890
You've got civil gods.

3153
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:34,850
You've got gods of nature.

3154
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,430
You've got Ohm's God, right?

3155
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:38,170
Like Ohm's Law, right?

3156
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:41,110
You've got the god of thermodynamics.

3157
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:44,710
You've got Einstein's God.

3158
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:48,970
And if you start substituting the word law with god

3159
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:50,650
or your deity or your L,

3160
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:55,560
it's going to paint a very clear picture.

3161
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:57,820
And then all of a sudden when you go back to your scripture

3162
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:01,280
and you start seeing about don't go after all these other gods,

3163
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:08,020
substitute when you read your scripture that word with law.

3164
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:09,880
Reverse it.

3165
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,760
And it'll be as plain as day to you.

3166
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:13,820
What's going on?

3167
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:18,370
Because that's the nature of your deity.

3168
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:19,870
That's where you get your law from.

3169
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:22,270
When I say, okay, what you eat, all right,

3170
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:24,610
how you keep time, what you wear,

3171
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:27,710
well, there are things in there about that.

3172
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:28,930
For example, what you eat.

3173
02:08:29,070 --> 02:08:33,190
He says if it's on the earth and it's got four legs,

3174
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:36,350
it better chew the cut and have a cloven hoof.

3175
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,190
Okay, done.

3176
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,950
All right?

3177
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:43,490
If it's a fowl, it better have a crop.

3178
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:45,830
Okay, fine.

3179
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:48,890
If it comes out of the water, it's got to have fins and scales.

3180
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:49,750
Okay, fine.

3181
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:52,730
That's, I mean, how easy is that?

3182
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:55,450
Okay, what you wear.

3183
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:59,690
He says my people do not mix the wool and the linen.

3184
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:01,310
Do not mix the wool and the cotton.

3185
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:03,570
Do not mix fibers on your clothing.

3186
02:09:04,230 --> 02:09:07,130
Okay, when I read that, I looked at myself and I said, oh, no.

3187
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:12,070
I got through my closet and I see 80% cotton, 20% polyester,

3188
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:12,930
really nice shirt.

3189
02:09:13,110 --> 02:09:13,970
Okay, got to go.

3190
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:15,370
I see this.

3191
02:09:15,470 --> 02:09:20,130
Okay, it doesn't mean that you can't have a wool jacket with a silk liner.

3192
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:24,730
It just means don't mix it within the same garment.

3193
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:28,250
You can have various different fabrics on layers

3194
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:29,850
as long as they're not woven together.

3195
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:34,250
How easy, I mean, how difficult is that to do?

3196
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:38,150
Well, you might feel kind of, you know.

3197
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,490
Go ahead.

3198
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:44,870
Okay, that's not difficult to do.

3199
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:47,850
And, you know, the priests are to wear,

3200
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:52,410
okay, the priests are to wear linen that is bleached white.

3201
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:54,830
Really?

3202
02:09:55,070 --> 02:09:56,210
Okay, that's interesting.

3203
02:09:56,610 --> 02:09:58,130
It has to be bleached white.

3204
02:09:58,230 --> 02:10:01,010
Has anyone ever done any research on linen fibers?

3205
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:08,090
Take a linen fiber about six feet long, okay.

3206
02:10:08,370 --> 02:10:12,410
Now, anybody that's into radio engineering or communications

3207
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:16,090
that builds antennas and stuff, in their rule book,

3208
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:21,150
well, basic rule of thumb in engineering for antennas,

3209
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:23,410
if anybody knows about this, they'll see it.

3210
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:27,390
They say never make an antenna six feet, exactly six feet long.

3211
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:32,710
Now, six feet long is your average, you know, length of a garment

3212
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:36,470
if it was going to go above, woven from around the shoulder

3213
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:39,890
down to your feet, all the way down, okay.

3214
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:43,770
Now, anyone in antenna and radio engineering will tell you,

3215
02:10:43,890 --> 02:10:46,990
never make an antenna exactly six feet long.

3216
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:48,410
Why?

3217
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:52,330
Because you're going to be picking up all this kind of weird ethereal energy

3218
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:53,590
and you're going to get a standing wave

3219
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:55,770
and you could blow up your radio set eventually.

3220
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:58,930
Pretty wild stuff.

3221
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:03,490
So, take yourself a wire exactly six feet long, stretch it on something

3222
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:07,430
that doesn't have any conductivity and put a copper plate and a zinc plate

3223
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:12,650
or a copper and an iron plate with a resistor, a coil and a capacitor in between

3224
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:17,720
and watch what happens with your voltmeter after a few days.

3225
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:20,800
And you'll get a reaction going for about three to four weeks

3226
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,620
and then it will stop.

3227
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:27,120
So, let's take a linen fiber and make it six feet long.

3228
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:30,440
And make it taut and resonate it.

3229
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:35,340
Pluck on it, measure it, run a current through it, pluck on it, measure it.

3230
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:42,460
Take that same linen fiber, bleach it white using sodium hydroxide,

3231
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:45,940
a lye type of bleach, not chlorine or fluoride or bromide.

3232
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:49,080
And go ahead and check its resonance again.

3233
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:53,770
You're going to see a drastic change in resonance.

3234
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:57,810
Just plucking on it and just bleaching it.

3235
02:11:57,810 --> 02:11:59,350
The same amount of mass there.

3236
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:05,170
In fabric design, it's called mercenization of cotton,

3237
02:12:05,290 --> 02:12:08,150
you know, where they do certain processes to it.

3238
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:10,530
I don't want to get into the results.

3239
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:11,410
It's a whole spin-off.

3240
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:13,290
It's very subtle but yet very powerful.

3241
02:12:13,710 --> 02:12:16,650
How many straight fibers do you need to make a garment?

3242
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:17,330
A lot of them.

3243
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:22,470
So, imagine thousands of these fibers all over your body bleached white in linen.

3244
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,490
And this was for the priests.

3245
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:33,410
I mean, I can go off on a whole other aspect of the scientific real science

3246
02:12:34,030 --> 02:12:35,530
of what's going on.

3247
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:38,270
You see, in science, they always teach you theories.

3248
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:42,970
But in the scientific principle, you have a hypothesis, a theory,

3249
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:44,550
an experiment, and a conclusion.

3250
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:48,870
And I'm noticing a lot of people going into debt for hundreds of thousands

3251
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:52,570
of their credits to learn theories.

3252
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:55,110
So they say, well, what about this theory?

3253
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:56,710
I'm like, I don't want to look at that theory.

3254
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:59,470
When you get a conclusion, come back and tell me, right?

3255
02:13:00,270 --> 02:13:01,370
We've got this theory.

3256
02:13:01,470 --> 02:13:02,270
We've got that theory.

3257
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:03,810
We've got this theory and that theory.

3258
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:05,830
Well, it's a theory.

3259
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:07,070
Is that good science?

3260
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:07,970
It's incomplete.

3261
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:10,310
You see?

3262
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:12,650
Yes, it's incomplete.

3263
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:15,810
Yeah, I'm going to take you out for some theoretical lunch.

3264
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,750
How do you like that?

3265
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:20,850
You think you're going to leave that lunch hungry?

3266
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:23,330
More than likely.

3267
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:24,290
Yeah.

3268
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:27,270
So why would you spend $20,000 a year learning theories?

3269
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:30,040
That's true.

3270
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:32,820
And they're supposed to be there looking for facts.

3271
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:34,820
Conclusions.

3272
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,360
Or conclusions.

3273
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:39,000
Yeah, let's finish this deal up, right?

3274
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:39,940
What's the conclusion?

3275
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:43,740
In other words, you have to believe in a theory, right?

3276
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:45,440
You know, to belie, believe.

3277
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:48,540
I don't want to know what you believe in.

3278
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:51,340
I want to know what you know, because I can't use what you believe.

3279
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,660
I can use what you know.

3280
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:56,040
I agree.

3281
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:59,060
You know, I tell people, you know, if you take really hot water

3282
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:01,700
and put it in the freezer with a stopwatch,

3283
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:05,520
and you put really cold water in the freezer with a stopwatch,

3284
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:08,320
you'll notice the really hot, almost boiling water

3285
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,240
will freeze faster than the cold water.

3286
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,940
I don't believe you, they say, okay?

3287
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:16,040
And they go and do it, and they call me up,

3288
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:16,840
and they say, hey, it worked.

3289
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:17,240
It does.

3290
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:20,440
The hot water always freezes faster than the cold water.

3291
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,180
And I said, okay, well, I didn't ask you to believe me.

3292
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:25,820
I'm glad you went and proved it, you know?

3293
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:28,000
Okay, but, you know, what else is going on?

3294
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,000
I knew that, you see?

3295
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:31,660
Well, I'm glad, you know, I was able to inspire you, maybe.

3296
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:32,840
It's like, well, how did you know that?

3297
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,320
Well, you ever work on a farm in Minnesota where it's like 20 below

3298
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,200
and go milk a cow, and you got that hot milk,

3299
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:42,020
put it down for five minutes, come back, it's solid like a rock.

3300
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:45,480
But the cold milk isn't frozen.

3301
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,360
It's got a little skin of ice on top of it.

3302
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,400
You see, they knew these things, you see.

3303
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:54,380
Go to a university where they teach dendrochronology,

3304
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,460
the study of trees, and pull aside, you know,

3305
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:59,860
your biggest rooster, you know, your highest priest

3306
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:03,620
from the department there, and they teach people about trees, right?

3307
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:07,660
And you say, okay, I'll take your courses,

3308
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:10,760
but before I do, I want you to explain to me

3309
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:12,640
how one blade of grass grows.

3310
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,020
And they're teaching on trees,

3311
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:18,860
and they don't know how a blade of grass grows.

3312
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,060
And I had an academic that got real...

3313
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:27,020
I once asked this question to an academic,

3314
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:27,780
and he turned around and said,

3315
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:31,360
how dare you talk to an academic like he's an asshole?

3316
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:32,960
Excuse the French.

3317
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,380
Didn't address it.

3318
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:35,720
So I'm like, well, before you go,

3319
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,980
I'll tell you what trees really are.

3320
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:37,760
He said, well, you know.

3321
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,120
I'm like, well, it's pretty simple, isn't it?

3322
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,120
It's pretty obvious, right?

3323
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:42,880
I said, well, what are they?

3324
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,480
I said, they're gates, they're valves,

3325
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:46,660
like a valve on your faucet.

3326
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:49,220
He's like, well, you look at them, all pretty and stuff,

3327
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,700
but they have a very simple function.

3328
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,420
Their roots are in the ground and their branches and trunks

3329
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,480
and leaves are in the air.

3330
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:57,500
They exchange what's produced in the air

3331
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:59,460
with what's produced in the ground.

3332
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:02,840
They pump the ethereal energy that's in the sky and the air

3333
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:04,220
and they pump that into the earth.

3334
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:06,100
And whatever's produced in the earth,

3335
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:08,600
the roots pump up the trunk and it's released through the leaves,

3336
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,420
pump it back into the atmosphere

3337
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:12,880
and it goes back out to outer space and feeds the sun.

3338
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,200
He's like, well, how did you learn that?

3339
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,320
Just by looking at it.

3340
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:22,340
They teach the people the sun is millions of degrees.

3341
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:23,300
Yeah, sure it is.

3342
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:26,760
You ever notice that when you heat or cool your house,

3343
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:31,500
the heat always goes to the ceiling

3344
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:33,260
and the cold always goes to the ground?

3345
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:34,379
Yeah.

3346
02:16:34,379 --> 02:16:37,900
Whether you're running the heater or the AC or whatever,

3347
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:39,620
the heat always goes up.

3348
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,860
You make a campfire, the heat always goes up,

3349
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,680
cold always goes to the ground.

3350
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:46,200
Okay, that means that all year round,

3351
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:48,840
you've got a hot head and cold feet.

3352
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,820
That's the worst health condition, isn't it?

3353
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,920
Now let's step outside through the seasons

3354
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:58,920
and look at what's going on out in nature.

3355
02:16:59,459 --> 02:17:00,780
And when we're at sea level,

3356
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:02,820
it's real hot in the valley, let's say,

3357
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:04,660
where do we go to cool off?

3358
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,459
Hey, honey, let's get in the car and go up to the mountaintop.

3359
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:13,520
Get in an airplane, they've got de-icers on the wings.

3360
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:16,219
You've got an airplane take off from the Sahara Desert

3361
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:18,299
or Hawaii or near the equator.

3362
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:20,040
It goes up and it's freezing up there.

3363
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:23,219
Okay, so on the earth, when you're on the earth,

3364
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:26,100
on the terrasphere, the closer you get to the sun,

3365
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,260
the colder it gets.

3366
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:28,480
Go figure.

3367
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:31,190
Right?

3368
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,410
Yeah.

3369
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:35,709
And if you're at sea level and I'm at 1,000 feet high,

3370
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:38,370
aren't I 1,000 feet closer to the sun?

3371
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:42,129
So if the sun is so many millions of degrees hot,

3372
02:17:42,209 --> 02:17:43,670
shouldn't I be a little bit warmer?

3373
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:45,930
Just a little, maybe?

3374
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:49,129
What if I go 20,000 feet higher than you?

3375
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:51,090
Now I'm 20,000 feet closer to the sun.

3376
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:54,250
If it's so darn hot, shouldn't I be just a little warmer?

3377
02:17:55,490 --> 02:17:56,570
But what's happening?

3378
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:57,230
The opposite.

3379
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:59,010
Yes.

3380
02:17:59,209 --> 02:18:02,190
Nathan, when you go into outer space,

3381
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:05,889
your body would literally just break apart from being so cold.

3382
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,490
Well, it can and it can't depend.

3383
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:09,709
You know, space is another...

3384
02:18:09,709 --> 02:18:11,150
Think of space as the ocean.

3385
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:14,889
It's another...

3386
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:17,650
Here's another way to think about it.

3387
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,950
You know, they tell everybody, you know,

3388
02:18:19,969 --> 02:18:21,510
let's go to the moon, let's do this,

3389
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:23,309
let's go look at outer space, look out there,

3390
02:18:23,350 --> 02:18:24,990
but they're not talking about what's happening

3391
02:18:24,990 --> 02:18:26,150
at the bottom of the ocean.

3392
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:30,830
Well, what do you call people that are not focusing on themselves

3393
02:18:30,830 --> 02:18:32,510
and focusing on somebody else?

3394
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:35,750
Somebody else's business, you know?

3395
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:38,129
You know?

3396
02:18:38,469 --> 02:18:40,230
It's like, why are you mining that way?

3397
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:43,049
And, you know, why aren't you putting stuff back

3398
02:18:43,049 --> 02:18:44,049
the way it was before?

3399
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:45,490
Well, mind your own business, right?

3400
02:18:47,309 --> 02:18:49,030
They don't know anything about the earth.

3401
02:18:49,129 --> 02:18:49,590
Well, they do.

3402
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:50,850
There are some people that do.

3403
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,790
And they're always looking away.

3404
02:18:53,889 --> 02:18:54,570
It's a distraction.

3405
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:55,910
You see, when you read scripture,

3406
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:59,010
you got, for simple vernacular,

3407
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:01,690
you've got pagan and non-pagan.

3408
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:03,690
Okay?

3409
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:06,850
And you start looking at this, you know,

3410
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:10,469
okay, pagans have no rules,

3411
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:12,770
and the non-pagans do.

3412
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:15,150
They have a sense of right and wrong.

3413
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:16,330
Okay?

3414
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:20,790
So, okay, what's the purpose of paganism then?

3415
02:19:21,549 --> 02:19:23,350
It has nothing to do with worshipping the earth

3416
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:24,590
and all the stuff they teach you.

3417
02:19:24,590 --> 02:19:27,090
It has to do with what's going on today,

3418
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:29,650
when no one's following any kind of holy writ

3419
02:19:29,650 --> 02:19:30,490
in their scriptures.

3420
02:19:31,610 --> 02:19:33,030
Then what's the purpose of it?

3421
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:34,309
Why isn't anyone following?

3422
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:37,730
Why do people have no law or no rules in their lives?

3423
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:39,410
Well, it's to hide a theft.

3424
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:42,950
How am I supposed to take from you,

3425
02:19:43,469 --> 02:19:45,469
if you're well organized and you know

3426
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:48,170
the difference between right and wrong?

3427
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:51,390
But if you teach people there is no,

3428
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:53,830
you know, the law is done away with, you know?

3429
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:56,210
Oh, there's no, you know, you see,

3430
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:57,650
there's no real right or wrong.

3431
02:19:57,950 --> 02:19:59,030
That's your opinion.

3432
02:19:59,430 --> 02:20:02,550
It's real easy to steal from them.

3433
02:20:02,790 --> 02:20:03,570
I'll give you an example.

3434
02:20:05,010 --> 02:20:07,950
Like, a non-pagan thief, okay,

3435
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:11,450
walks into a store and he's got a long trench coat

3436
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:14,150
and secret pockets, and he wants to stuff stuff,

3437
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:15,670
you know, put stuff in his pockets,

3438
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:17,630
and hopefully no one will see him.

3439
02:20:17,730 --> 02:20:19,230
You know, that's like your traditional,

3440
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:21,130
classical way of stealing, right?

3441
02:20:21,130 --> 02:20:24,830
Okay, but a pagan thief doesn't operate that way.

3442
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:25,770
He creates a distraction.

3443
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:27,930
He walks in and three, four of his buddies walk in.

3444
02:20:27,970 --> 02:20:29,230
They have a fight in aisle six.

3445
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:31,270
Everybody goes to see what's going on,

3446
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:32,970
and he just grabs everything in the cash register,

3447
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:35,230
waves goodbye in plain sight.

3448
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:39,620
When you create enough of a distraction,

3449
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:43,500
people will not see what's going on.

3450
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:48,020
And if people on this planet are not distracted,

3451
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,100
I don't know what they are.

3452
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:54,440
There's many aspects to that.

3453
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,820
I wanted to say something before for your other thing

3454
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:00,320
when you were talking about why it's cooler

3455
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:01,220
and the higher you go.

3456
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:04,760
It's all dealing with pressure and how fast the air rises.

3457
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:08,380
Okay, that's a good point.

3458
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:08,960
Thank you.

3459
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:10,900
That makes it cooler.

3460
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:13,740
It's basically when, during the day,

3461
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,020
when the sun hits the earth,

3462
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:19,440
the sun basically heats up the ground, obviously.

3463
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,560
Basically, the ground acts as an insulator.

3464
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:23,680
Right, and the cold air becomes,

3465
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:25,600
instead of cold air becoming heavy,

3466
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,500
it becomes light and it rises very quickly.

3467
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:30,720
Almost at the speed of air entering a vacuum.

3468
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:31,600
That's right.

3469
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:34,380
So in nature, the heat becomes dense

3470
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:37,040
and it goes down,

3471
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:41,080
and the cold becomes rarefied or light and it rises.

3472
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:43,800
But when you heat or cool your house,

3473
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,040
the cold becomes dense and goes down,

3474
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:52,420
and the heat becomes lighter and it rises.

3475
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,060
Now, why?

3476
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:57,800
See, why is what man is doing

3477
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:00,320
opposite of what nature is doing?

3478
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:02,800
That's a very large discussion,

3479
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:05,240
but I can give you the basics of it.

3480
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:08,200
Earlier we spoke about life-giving energy

3481
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:10,220
and death-giving, okay?

3482
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:13,640
Again, in life, the big N comes up first.

3483
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:15,840
You have coolness, contraction, implosion.

3484
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:20,040
With death, you have a sharp point in the beginning.

3485
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:25,300
It cuts, and it's expansive, and it's hot.

3486
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:28,580
So both of these energies work together.

3487
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:34,100
And when you are plugging in your electric heater in your house

3488
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:35,820
or your electric air conditioner,

3489
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:42,660
or you're using natural gas or oil or wood to fire your stove,

3490
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:45,900
you're using the death side principle of nature.

3491
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:48,960
What you're doing is you're creating chemical decomposition

3492
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,700
to get energy.

3493
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:53,560
And the energy that comes from chemical decomposition,

3494
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:56,040
the heat rises and the cold goes down.

3495
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:58,720
When you're using energies that are life-giving

3496
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:01,740
and life-producing and implosive versus explosive,

3497
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,700
you have the reverse pattern happening.

3498
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:08,240
You have a cool rising and the heat going down.

3499
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:11,380
Again, from experimenting with high-speed vortices

3500
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:17,320
under vacuums and without getting into the technical aspects of it,

3501
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:21,220
if you were to open one of these vessels

3502
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:25,360
and put your hand over it while that vortex is cooking,

3503
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,660
and I'm talking about in the tens of thousands of RPMs

3504
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:32,300
with the absence of air, if you were to open that sucker

3505
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:34,440
and put your hand over it,

3506
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:39,220
you will feel a shot of cold air right from the middle throat shooting up,

3507
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:41,300
almost like a cold blow dryer.

3508
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:45,380
And the bottom, the very, very bottom tip where you exit,

3509
02:23:45,380 --> 02:23:47,240
where you just open it, will start to warm up.

3510
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:56,610
So these energies can be produced and can be created.

3511
02:23:57,230 --> 02:23:58,650
And they can be used.

3512
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:02,490
Like I gave the analogy earlier,

3513
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:08,070
the 700-mile-per-hour underground train was invented in 1864.

3514
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:13,490
So how impressive is it now that you're getting 300 miles per hour?

3515
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:17,950
A hundred and what, 60-something years later, 150 years later?

3516
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:20,670
What's going on here?

3517
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:27,900
You see, go research a man named Nathan Stubblefield.

3518
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:34,540
Nathan, as it sounds, and Stubblefield will be S-T-U-B-B-L-E-F-I-E-L-D.

3519
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:38,260
And you will see the cell phone was invented before the telegraph.

3520
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:46,500
So what's going on? Some strange stuff.

3521
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:53,520
Now, I'm not talking about a cell phone like, you know, your iPhone or whatever.

3522
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:57,520
It was a wooden box, you know, and had a little antenna.

3523
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:58,660
No battery.

3524
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:03,360
That's why it never took off because there was no battery involved.

3525
02:25:12,390 --> 02:25:16,650
Now, the other aspect of the spiritual realm I wanted to speak of,

3526
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:18,970
I don't know if anyone has any questions on time.

3527
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:23,670
No, I don't.

3528
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:29,010
Okay, it's a very simple thing, but it's very difficult

3529
02:25:29,010 --> 02:25:32,730
because if it was taught when we were in kindergarten, it would be natural.

3530
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:39,930
The other thing I tell people is if you want to be an expert on any field,

3531
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:42,290
you can do it within a year or two with your own study.

3532
02:25:44,730 --> 02:25:51,490
In less than three to five years, you can be pretty much very well versed

3533
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:57,830
in any subject you want to learn within your range, like within your town or your city.

3534
02:25:58,230 --> 02:26:02,890
And if you study it for five or six years, you can be on a world expert level with it, any subject.

3535
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:11,340
If you go to a university library and read what they've got in their libraries

3536
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:14,820
or storehouses of information and then see what they're putting in their textbooks,

3537
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:15,880
they're not in agreement.

3538
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:20,340
And I'm talking about the textbooks that get republished every year.

3539
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:28,840
Now, I'm not saying don't go to school. That's fine.

3540
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:32,940
I'm just saying be aware of what you're learning.

3541
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:38,280
I once was speaking to someone and they went and started asking questions.

3542
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:39,820
The university gets a letter saying,

3543
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:46,740
we don't think you're academically fit to continue here, 19-year-old man.

3544
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:58,000
The other aspect I would like to speak on is there seems to be a lot of confusion

3545
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:05,320
about what a soul is, what a spirit is, and what the body is.

3546
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:08,480
Well, the body, not so much, but it's all intermixed.

3547
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:14,800
You've got soul music, oh, you're so spiritual, or you've got the body, the flesh.

3548
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,840
The body seems to be pretty clear on what it is.

3549
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:24,160
By looking at all of the holy writs of various cultures,

3550
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:27,960
I find that they're all in agreement, but their translations are not.

3551
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:33,400
And the believers of a particular brand of religion that may or may not have stemmed

3552
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:38,200
from that particular text do not know the difference between the soul and the spirit.

3553
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:46,620
And if you look in your Strong's Concordance, in the Greek, for example,

3554
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:51,600
when you look at the definition of soul, they're giving you the definition of spirit.

3555
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:58,460
And they also tell you that it can be a soul or a spirit.

3556
02:27:58,680 --> 02:27:59,800
It's like they don't know.

3557
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:04,660
When you look at the definition of spirit, it's the same thing.

3558
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:06,140
It could be either one, they're telling you.

3559
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:09,660
Well, it can't be. I can't go into a dictionary, look up cat,

3560
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:12,200
and the definition says, well, it can be a dog.

3561
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:16,280
Then I go to the, look up dog in a dictionary, and it says,

3562
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:17,440
well, it could be a cat.

3563
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:23,220
Wait a second, I'm not, you know, that ain't going well for me.

3564
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:25,080
It's got to be a publishing error.

3565
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:28,840
But if everyone's buying it, I don't buy it.

3566
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:35,300
So you dig a little deeper, and you look at the Greek word for soul,

3567
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:39,840
and in Greek it's pnevma, right?

3568
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:49,040
So phonetically, in English it would be spelled P-N-E-U, right?

3569
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:53,960
So you are a living soul, so the word soul, P-N-E-U, let's see,

3570
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:58,340
that has to do with breath. You get the word pneumonia from that, P-N-E-U?

3571
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:03,160
Or P-N-U-E? And you get the word pneumatic,

3572
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:05,960
like a pneumatic tire has to do with air or breath.

3573
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:09,480
When you're pumping up a tire, it's basically a pump breathing into the tire.

3574
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:12,260
Or when you blow up a balloon, that's pneumatic.

3575
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:18,460
So the breath is actually your breath. Your soul is actually your breath.

3576
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:21,500
Simple as that.

3577
02:29:24,010 --> 02:29:28,330
So in order to be a living soul, you need to be breathing.

3578
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:34,670
That's right, so you go to Genesis, and he says he made them a living soul.

3579
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:40,360
And if you look up in Hebrew, it's nefesh, and nefesh means breath.

3580
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,500
He breathed life into them.

3581
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,240
Okay, so what's this thing called the spirit?

3582
02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:49,220
Well, you go back to the Greek, and you look up the word spirit,

3583
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:55,380
and you will see in Greek it's psyche, P-S-Y-C-H-E.

3584
02:29:56,120 --> 02:30:00,900
Well, that's where you get the word psych from, like psychologist, or psychic,

3585
02:30:01,660 --> 02:30:07,080
or psychological. And whoa, that has to do with issues of the mind.

3586
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:10,180
So the spirit must be the mind.

3587
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:14,940
So you go to Hebrew, and you look at the word for spirit, and it says ruach.

3588
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:20,240
And the ruach has mental attributes, obviously. It's of the spirit.

3589
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:28,620
Okay, so what do you do with that? How does that affect you in your life?

3590
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:31,420
Well, maybe you need to be made more practical.

3591
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:37,800
Okay, I've seen someone lose their soul, and we put it back into them.

3592
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:39,600
Very simple.

3593
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,200
Swimming in a pool, they bumped their head, they didn't come up.

3594
02:30:44,380 --> 02:30:46,160
We pulled them up, they weren't breathing.

3595
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:52,280
Give them CPR, hit on their chest, give them more CPR.

3596
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:56,020
They took a breath, and that big gasp, and they vomited all this water.

3597
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,180
Well, for a little time there, they didn't have a soul.

3598
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:02,040
And we put a soul in their body, that's your breath.

3599
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:08,040
Well, we allowed it, we created the conditions for the soul to start working.

3600
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:09,860
It's simple as that.

3601
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:14,770
Now, your spirit is your mind.

3602
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:18,950
It's information, it's your personality, it's your character.

3603
02:31:19,130 --> 02:31:23,650
And if you start looking up your scripture, where the word spirit is being used,

3604
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:26,830
and soul, they've messed it up, they've made such a fine mess of it,

3605
02:31:27,250 --> 02:31:31,950
that unless you go through it to know what the words are in the original language,

3606
02:31:32,110 --> 02:31:36,210
even in your Sanskrit, if you go to your Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata,

3607
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:38,610
do the same thing.

3608
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:44,230
I've seen scripture in Bhagavad Gita, where they write the word soul,

3609
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:48,170
and you go back to the Sanskrit text, and it's not even there.

3610
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:53,800
Well, they use the spirit in a different way, and there's something going on,

3611
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:57,300
where they don't want you to know what the soul and the spirit is.

3612
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:02,490
So if the soul is your breath and the spirit is your mind,

3613
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:07,850
it's not the brain matter, it's your personality.

3614
02:32:07,850 --> 02:32:12,510
What makes you you, the way you think, your character, your mind, basically.

3615
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:18,330
Now, why can't we see that? Well, here's an example.

3616
02:32:19,150 --> 02:32:23,230
It can be used and it can be measured, and I always say,

3617
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:25,290
well, if we can't measure it, we can't manage it.

3618
02:32:25,970 --> 02:32:27,930
So it's very important to be able to measure it.

3619
02:32:28,490 --> 02:32:30,870
But let's look at it this way, a little more tangible.

3620
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:34,830
Let's say I get a DVD of The Matrix, the movie.

3621
02:32:34,830 --> 02:32:37,550
Okay, it's this round, you know, looks like a CD, right?

3622
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:41,710
And you give it to a materials analyst, and you give him a hundred bucks,

3623
02:32:41,770 --> 02:32:43,650
and you say, I'll be back in a week, tell me what it is.

3624
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:49,540
He'll give you a bunch of sheets of paper, it tells you it weighs this much, 19 grams,

3625
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,660
it's this thick, it's this wide, it's made out of this plastic,

3626
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:55,980
it's got metal film, it's got ridges in it at this dimension,

3627
02:32:56,100 --> 02:32:59,760
and you're like, wait a second, did you see that this is a movie of The Matrix?

3628
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:03,440
And he says, no, I can't see that in my lab, I can't see that with my...

3629
02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:06,440
The way I observe materials here is just don't see it.

3630
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:08,560
Do you have a DVD player or a computer?

3631
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:10,700
Put it in there and play it and see it's a movie.

3632
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:11,880
Well, I can't measure that.

3633
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:15,640
You need to have the specific device to run that information.

3634
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:20,620
So what happens when you die?

3635
02:33:24,470 --> 02:33:26,510
Your body dies, and so does your soul,

3636
02:33:26,650 --> 02:33:29,790
because if you're still breathing, your body's still alive.

3637
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:39,610
And it says your spirit goes back to the L, back to the boss, right?

3638
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:43,030
So the Hindus, they say you are reincarnated.

3639
02:33:44,650 --> 02:33:46,430
Okay, not over and over and over,

3640
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:49,130
or you were conscious of being here before all this.

3641
02:33:49,210 --> 02:33:51,130
It doesn't say that, it's just not in the text, sorry.

3642
02:33:52,130 --> 02:33:58,330
It says you are reincarnated, means you're put into meat again, karne.

3643
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:59,550
That's what it means.

3644
02:34:00,530 --> 02:34:01,930
Actually, it doesn't say that in Sanskrit,

3645
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:06,170
but you are put back into a body, flesh,

3646
02:34:07,810 --> 02:34:09,450
and then a bunch of stuff happens.

3647
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:17,180
Or there's a point there where you're entered into a different type of body,

3648
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:19,120
and a bunch of stuff happens.

3649
02:34:19,980 --> 02:34:23,980
But after you are reincarnated into a body again,

3650
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:27,380
there's a little trial that goes on, and then you get your spirit body.

3651
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:31,560
And then there are others that just go right into the spirit realm.

3652
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:35,000
They don't get reincarnated, but they still exist.

3653
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:37,420
And they're conscious, they get a light body.

3654
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,700
Now if you read, let's say, the Bible,

3655
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:45,340
okay, you are resurrected, everyone is resurrected,

3656
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:47,360
and you are put back into a body,

3657
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:50,940
or you are resurrected into a spirit body.

3658
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:57,600
And the ones that are just put into a regular body,

3659
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:00,380
you have a little trial, and then you get your spiritual body.

3660
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:05,870
Same stuff, you know, there's just more detail of it in the Bible.

3661
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:08,790
And that's why when people say,

3662
02:35:08,910 --> 02:35:12,270
well, you've got to be saved, and they can't tell me what I'm being saved from.

3663
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:14,870
So if I want to play a joke on them, I say,

3664
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:16,810
what are you talking about, you want to go to heaven?

3665
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:20,310
Everybody goes to hell, and nobody goes to heaven,

3666
02:35:20,350 --> 02:35:21,770
because heaven is coming here.

3667
02:35:22,470 --> 02:35:26,050
And they're shocked, and they run, or they freak out on you,

3668
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:29,370
or you better have a getaway car if you're in a Bible study saying that.

3669
02:35:31,390 --> 02:35:34,910
Because they've taken the word grave and translated it to hell.

3670
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:36,990
Dante's Inferno.

3671
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,300
There is no hell that you go to.

3672
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:43,800
Everything happens here.

3673
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:45,820
And all the texts, they all say the same thing.

3674
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:48,000
Now there's a place that's called the Lake of Fire,

3675
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,260
and that's not, you know, it's here on earth, but it ain't burning, it ain't hot yet.

3676
02:35:52,220 --> 02:35:55,100
I'm watching it, there's weird stuff going on around it.

3677
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:58,070
Okay?

3678
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:01,590
Big sinkholes there, you know, I think about a year ago,

3679
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:03,750
a tourist, you know, fell into it.

3680
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:07,450
And they're just putting signs around it now, telling people to stay away.

3681
02:36:08,470 --> 02:36:09,370
Because it's heating up.

3682
02:36:10,550 --> 02:36:11,730
Not for a while yet.

3683
02:36:11,790 --> 02:36:14,270
And these things, you know, you don't share them out in public.

3684
02:36:14,430 --> 02:36:16,330
You don't give people specifics.

3685
02:36:16,330 --> 02:36:18,610
I've done it before on another call with Andrew.

3686
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:23,650
I just, very nonchalantly, just started throwing out specifics and stuff, you know.

3687
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:29,880
And you can never put dates on these things, or days.

3688
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:31,300
They're all by observation.

3689
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:37,120
But the observations become so clear that when you look at the pattern,

3690
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:40,040
you know, that's why when you look, for example, in the Book of Daniel,

3691
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,280
the Book of Revelation, notice they're just day counts.

3692
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:43,360
What happened to the months?

3693
02:36:45,980 --> 02:36:47,340
Seems like the months are gone.

3694
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:48,280
It's just day counts.

3695
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:51,160
And if you're reading the Book of Enoch, it says,

3696
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:53,220
the moon will err in the last days.

3697
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:55,220
It means it won't become, it won't be reliable.

3698
02:36:58,330 --> 02:36:59,870
But these day counts will be.

3699
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:02,990
These things are very, very specific.

3700
02:37:03,230 --> 02:37:06,490
And the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation ain't got nothing to do

3701
02:37:06,490 --> 02:37:09,930
with what people I hear talking about it on the Internet,

3702
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:14,410
or the Bible studies, or TV, or talk shoes, or all that stuff.

3703
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:17,330
You don't have a clue.

3704
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:21,290
Your first clue is someone comes on and says,

3705
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:22,150
well, Happy New Year.

3706
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:27,040
And it's January or whatever, what they call January or whatever.

3707
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:30,000
And they start talking about the Book of Revelation or Daniel.

3708
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:34,820
It's like, okay, let's just hear what they got to say anyway.

3709
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:37,920
Or this or that or whatever.

3710
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:39,560
You can't mix the two.

3711
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,260
It tells you not to mix.

3712
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:45,060
You ever wonder why mules are infertile?

3713
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,140
They just don't mix.

3714
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:01,220
So the soul, the spirit, and the body are so distinct.

3715
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:06,920
And once you start seeing the procedure that they're telling us,

3716
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:09,600
things that are going to happen,

3717
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:16,060
you know, okay, I covered the spirit, the soul, and the body.

3718
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:18,360
And there's no hell. Hell is translated as the grave.

3719
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,940
But there is a place called the Lake of Fire, and it's on Earth.

3720
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:22,080
So what about heaven?

3721
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:26,590
Well, okay, if you look at the Book of Revelation,

3722
02:38:27,970 --> 02:38:31,390
there is a spot there where it tells you the new heaven descends, right?

3723
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:34,470
Okay, this thing is pretty large, but what's its shape?

3724
02:38:34,530 --> 02:38:36,290
And it's very clear when you read in Isaiah,

3725
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:38,090
the shape of it is a pyramid.

3726
02:38:38,250 --> 02:38:40,530
You ever wonder why all societies and cultures

3727
02:38:40,530 --> 02:38:42,510
throughout the world have built pyramids?

3728
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,820
Were they all just, was it a coincidence?

3729
02:38:48,180 --> 02:38:49,360
Absolutely it's a coincidence.

3730
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:53,600
It coincides with certain bits of information.

3731
02:38:58,550 --> 02:39:00,270
It's an incredible story.

3732
02:39:00,390 --> 02:39:04,330
And the thing is, most of the information, when you start to see it,

3733
02:39:04,350 --> 02:39:07,710
not just in the Bible, when you start to see it repeated over and over and over,

3734
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:10,870
and the Bible has the most specifics on it,

3735
02:39:11,170 --> 02:39:14,170
you're like, whoa, this thing is held in trust.

3736
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:15,910
This is a trust.

3737
02:39:16,850 --> 02:39:20,070
And there is a time in all of them where people will start speaking out,

3738
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:21,970
but you see, timing is everything.

3739
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:26,750
You've got to know when this information has to be given out.

3740
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:29,090
Not too soon and not too late.

3741
02:39:34,210 --> 02:39:36,590
And that's why, again, I mentioned to Gary,

3742
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:38,750
if you guys, we did have the time,

3743
02:39:38,830 --> 02:39:40,790
I could go through some stuff real quick with you

3744
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:43,230
and your translations to maybe show you how to fish,

3745
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:44,810
instead of giving you fish.

3746
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:56,990
Please show us.

3747
02:39:57,590 --> 02:39:58,430
Please explain.

3748
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:03,410
Okay, well, what I usually like to use as a reference

3749
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:04,990
is what they've put in front of you.

3750
02:40:06,210 --> 02:40:07,710
And what have they put in front of us?

3751
02:40:07,770 --> 02:40:09,090
You see the Cecil B. DeMille movie?

3752
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:12,910
Everybody's watched the Ten Commandments on TV, right?

3753
02:40:13,690 --> 02:40:16,390
When I say everybody, I'm painting everything with a white brush.

3754
02:40:17,050 --> 02:40:18,030
And what do you see?

3755
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:21,450
You see Charlton Heston, okay?

3756
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:26,710
And you've got a bunch of people lined up

3757
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:29,170
towards the middle of the movie.

3758
02:40:29,430 --> 02:40:31,970
And you've got Yul Brynner as Pharaoh with his chariot.

3759
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:37,390
And Charlton Heston says a bunch of stuff, lifts up his staff.

3760
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:38,830
And the waters open up.

3761
02:40:38,890 --> 02:40:43,030
They actually used Jell-O for the special effects.

3762
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:46,050
You know, they just fast-forwarded it, you know, stop motion.

3763
02:40:47,150 --> 02:40:49,930
And then you see all these people walking down

3764
02:40:51,410 --> 02:40:53,430
and walking across the bottom.

3765
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:58,830
You know, the waters, you know, kind of shimmering left and right,

3766
02:40:58,950 --> 02:41:00,130
you know, on their side.

3767
02:41:00,310 --> 02:41:01,370
They cross over.

3768
02:41:01,730 --> 02:41:02,850
Now, here come the Egyptians.

3769
02:41:03,050 --> 02:41:04,370
Here comes Pharaoh, because actually,

3770
02:41:04,450 --> 02:41:07,650
Pharaoh is the proper Egyptian way to call this.

3771
02:41:08,590 --> 02:41:09,630
Pharaoh comes.

3772
02:41:10,210 --> 02:41:12,390
And actually, Yul Brynner's on the shore.

3773
02:41:12,610 --> 02:41:14,770
Actually, in the text also, he doesn't go.

3774
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:19,050
But his troops go, and the waters collapse,

3775
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:22,350
like anti-gravity all of a sudden gives out.

3776
02:41:23,170 --> 02:41:24,130
And they drown.

3777
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:28,450
And that's the way the story goes on TV.

3778
02:41:29,530 --> 02:41:35,050
But the interesting part is that Cecil B. DeMille knew.

3779
02:41:36,110 --> 02:41:37,890
Now, I'm not going to hold him to it.

3780
02:41:38,770 --> 02:41:41,230
I believe, there's that word believe again.

3781
02:41:41,470 --> 02:41:46,230
Maybe I should say it appears that he knew what was going on.

3782
02:41:47,070 --> 02:41:51,910
Because if you read in the text, if you go to, for example,

3783
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:54,190
if you open up to an e-sort, it's right in front of you.

3784
02:41:54,270 --> 02:41:58,330
Go to 14, just hit somewhere around verse 9.

3785
02:41:58,470 --> 02:42:02,110
You go to, there's a book on the upper left.

3786
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:04,490
You click on Exodus, and you go to chapter 14.

3787
02:42:05,090 --> 02:42:07,650
Let's just hit verse 1 and then just start scrolling down.

3788
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:11,230
Well, if you read in other parts of the text,

3789
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:14,410
he says, not a one of them that left Egypt was crippled,

3790
02:42:14,610 --> 02:42:16,210
maimed, or weakened in any way.

3791
02:42:18,590 --> 02:42:22,190
And Cecil B. DeMille kept showing two or three times.

3792
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:24,690
They would edit the scene, and they would focus

3793
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:29,670
on someone being carried in a stretcher in the movie.

3794
02:42:30,290 --> 02:42:32,430
Now, right away, if you read the text in Scripture,

3795
02:42:32,630 --> 02:42:35,970
it said none of them were infirm or crippled.

3796
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:36,910
They all walked out.

3797
02:42:37,270 --> 02:42:40,670
And here he is showing you several times in your face, close up,

3798
02:42:41,050 --> 02:42:42,770
of a man being carried in a stretcher.

3799
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:44,990
So you know right away something ain't right.

3800
02:42:45,790 --> 02:42:51,420
So if you go to the text, let's say chapter 14.

3801
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:58,100
Let me see which verse to really, okay.

3802
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:02,000
All right, if you go to Exodus 14.21,

3803
02:43:03,740 --> 02:43:05,600
and he says, and Moses stretched out.

3804
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:09,120
If anybody could see that, it says like,

3805
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:13,080
if you hold your cursor over the green part,

3806
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:15,260
it shows you the actual word that was there.

3807
02:43:16,080 --> 02:43:17,320
And you'll see there's an 853,

3808
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:19,900
and that's not being translated at all.

3809
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:20,640
It says ep.

3810
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:22,580
But anyway, keep going.

3811
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:26,560
His hand over the C, and the L-O-R-D caused the C to go back.

3812
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:29,160
Well, you see back right there is italicized,

3813
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:31,560
and it's even in print italicized,

3814
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:34,320
and there's no Hebrew word attached to it.

3815
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:35,480
That means that was put in.

3816
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:37,120
That was not in the original text.

3817
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:38,700
Can you see that?

3818
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,100
Anyone?

3819
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:45,750
It's in Exodus 14.21.

3820
02:43:46,270 --> 02:43:48,810
Okay, and then it says, by a strong east wind.

3821
02:43:48,890 --> 02:43:49,930
That's there in the text.

3822
02:43:50,610 --> 02:43:52,250
And all the night, and he made,

3823
02:43:52,330 --> 02:43:53,930
okay, there's that 853 again.

3824
02:43:54,030 --> 02:43:55,750
It's not being translated, but keep going.

3825
02:43:55,850 --> 02:43:56,910
Forget about that for now.

3826
02:43:57,650 --> 02:44:01,730
And he made the sea dry land, and waters were divided.

3827
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,590
But wait a second.

3828
02:44:02,810 --> 02:44:04,910
L-A-N-D, land there is italicized,

3829
02:44:04,970 --> 02:44:06,730
and there's no Hebrew word attached to it.

3830
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:09,790
That means that there's no Hebrew word saying land.

3831
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:13,790
So it should read, and Moses stretched out his hand over the C,

3832
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:18,870
and the ever-living caused the sea by a strong east wind all night,

3833
02:44:18,990 --> 02:44:22,630
and made the sea dry, and the waters were divided.

3834
02:44:23,010 --> 02:44:24,330
There's no land there.

3835
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:27,030
And even if you have a King James in print,

3836
02:44:27,530 --> 02:44:29,970
you will see it is in italicized.

3837
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:31,930
That means it is not in the original text.

3838
02:44:32,670 --> 02:44:33,870
You go to Exodus 14.22,

3839
02:44:34,310 --> 02:44:38,170
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry waters.

3840
02:44:38,330 --> 02:44:39,310
It doesn't say ground.

3841
02:44:39,470 --> 02:44:42,270
If you hold your cursor over ground, the word ground,

3842
02:44:42,270 --> 02:44:44,570
it's italicized, it's light gray in this program,

3843
02:44:44,690 --> 02:44:46,790
and it has no corresponding Hebrew word.

3844
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:48,650
That means that it's...

3845
02:44:48,650 --> 02:44:52,550
And if you look at a print KJV, which I have several of them,

3846
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:53,950
it's always in italicized.

3847
02:44:54,010 --> 02:44:57,210
It's not in the original word, original text.

3848
02:44:57,970 --> 02:45:02,490
So, okay, and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry waters,

3849
02:45:03,170 --> 02:45:05,970
and then it says a wall onto them on their right hand,

3850
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:07,030
and a wall on their left.

3851
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:09,190
Because you see W-E-R, there's no corresponding.

3852
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:12,710
So that was put in as a conjunction there.

3853
02:45:14,090 --> 02:45:16,470
Okay, so, and you keep reading,

3854
02:45:16,590 --> 02:45:18,130
so the Egyptians pursued and went in,

3855
02:45:18,170 --> 02:45:21,490
and after them to the midst of the sea all of Pharaoh's horses

3856
02:45:21,490 --> 02:45:23,510
and his chariots and his horsemen came to pass.

3857
02:45:23,550 --> 02:45:25,410
And you keep reading, reading, and the waters returned,

3858
02:45:25,470 --> 02:45:26,310
and they covered them.

3859
02:45:29,450 --> 02:45:31,530
Okay, if you keep going to the rest of the chapter.

3860
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:33,270
So it seems like the story ends there.

3861
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:36,970
But then there's an interjectory aspect to it.

3862
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:41,950
And if you go to Exodus 15,

3863
02:45:44,060 --> 02:45:45,440
go to the next chapter,

3864
02:45:49,270 --> 02:45:51,510
just click one, verse one,

3865
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:53,830
and then saying Moses and the children of Israel,

3866
02:45:53,910 --> 02:45:56,590
okay, let's pass those verses and get to the meat of it here.

3867
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:01,080
Okay, you get to Exodus.

3868
02:46:01,620 --> 02:46:04,060
Well, actually, Exodus 15 is interesting.

3869
02:46:04,220 --> 02:46:08,160
It says the ever-living, or it would be Yahweh here in the original,

3870
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:10,540
or Jehovah, they have it,

3871
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:15,160
is a man, or an ish, I should say, of war.

3872
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:21,040
So, okay, and Yahweh is his name.

3873
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:23,200
And then you go to Exodus 15.4.

3874
02:46:23,260 --> 02:46:26,660
Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea.

3875
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:29,820
His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.

3876
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,480
Well, it's actually the Sea of Reeds.

3877
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:33,740
That's fine, that's reasonable,

3878
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:36,240
because in chapter 14 it said that that's what happened,

3879
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:38,020
if you keep reading through it.

3880
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:40,220
Now the depths have covered them.

3881
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:42,960
They sank into the bottom as a stone.

3882
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:48,160
Okay, so something's going on here,

3883
02:46:50,170 --> 02:46:53,310
because in the movie it showed them walking across the bottom.

3884
02:46:54,350 --> 02:46:58,510
And in the previous chapter I showed you

3885
02:46:58,510 --> 02:47:01,130
that they did not walk on dry land,

3886
02:47:01,210 --> 02:47:02,510
they walked on dry water.

3887
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:05,050
Well, wait a second.

3888
02:47:05,530 --> 02:47:08,590
If they walked on the bottom like it was in the movie,

3889
02:47:08,710 --> 02:47:11,090
how would they fall to the bottom like a stone?

3890
02:47:12,130 --> 02:47:14,290
Well, it's not finished here.

3891
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:17,610
If you keep reading, he says,

3892
02:47:17,850 --> 02:47:20,430
and with the blast of their nostrils,

3893
02:47:20,530 --> 02:47:22,610
the waters were gathered together.

3894
02:47:24,330 --> 02:47:27,690
The flood stood upright as a heap,

3895
02:47:28,230 --> 02:47:29,990
and the depths were congealed.

3896
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:33,330
If you hold Kafa, you see the word congealed

3897
02:47:33,330 --> 02:47:37,870
is to shrink, thicken, curdle, frozen, congeal,

3898
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:40,030
in the heart of the sea.

3899
02:47:40,030 --> 02:47:41,550
The heart, labe.

3900
02:47:42,610 --> 02:47:44,110
Okay, if you keep reading down,

3901
02:47:44,310 --> 02:47:45,870
in the middle, in the middle,

3902
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:47,590
not the whole sea, just the middle of it,

3903
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:49,870
the midst of the sea.

3904
02:47:50,210 --> 02:47:53,930
So what do you call water that's congealed or made hard?

3905
02:47:56,260 --> 02:47:59,100
Okay, and also the blast of his nostrils,

3906
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:01,600
if you go to Exodus 14,

3907
02:48:01,860 --> 02:48:04,100
it says that an easterly wind blew all night.

3908
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:05,860
Now you stop there for a second and say,

3909
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:08,100
wait a second, this sounds a lot like ice to me.

3910
02:48:10,570 --> 02:48:12,350
Could it possibly get that cold?

3911
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:17,530
You know, especially here when he says,

3912
02:48:17,770 --> 02:48:19,890
and the flood stood upright as in a heap.

3913
02:48:21,070 --> 02:48:22,570
And that's what it says there.

3914
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:24,870
If you hold it over the number, it's 5067.

3915
02:48:25,210 --> 02:48:27,230
It says, in the sense of piling up a mound,

3916
02:48:27,390 --> 02:48:27,970
that is a wave.

3917
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:31,110
So obviously the wind was frozen.

3918
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:32,970
Obviously it was frozen.

3919
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:35,570
But he said in the previous chapter,

3920
02:48:35,670 --> 02:48:37,250
he's blowing with an easterly wind.

3921
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:39,490
Where were they? Near Sinai, right?

3922
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:43,890
So you go to meteorological reports in Sinai, Egypt.

3923
02:48:43,890 --> 02:48:44,950
It's pretty easy to do.

3924
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:49,170
Do a Google search on meteorology of Egypt, Sinai vicinity,

3925
02:48:49,370 --> 02:48:51,870
or it actually would be outside of Egypt at this point.

3926
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:54,530
And you'll see meteorological reports

3927
02:48:54,530 --> 02:48:56,730
around the time of springtime at night.

3928
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:58,870
It goes down to 22 degrees at night.

3929
02:48:59,530 --> 02:49:03,190
As a matter of fact, last year it was down to 15 or 16 degrees Fahrenheit.

3930
02:49:04,390 --> 02:49:08,010
Or minus 8 degrees or 6 degrees Celsius.

3931
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:11,470
Now, earlier I mentioned that, you know,

3932
02:49:11,470 --> 02:49:13,830
the warm water freezes faster than cold water.

3933
02:49:15,310 --> 02:49:18,250
In the desert, in the sunlight, even in the spring,

3934
02:49:18,370 --> 02:49:19,270
the water is warm.

3935
02:49:20,950 --> 02:49:23,970
So we have a selective wind over a certain section.

3936
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:27,110
Now, before I give you some more evidence,

3937
02:49:27,310 --> 02:49:29,030
let's look more and see what happened.

3938
02:49:29,270 --> 02:49:31,350
Because he says it fell to the bottom like a stone.

3939
02:49:31,810 --> 02:49:32,990
But if you keep reading,

3940
02:49:33,770 --> 02:49:40,000
you go down to, let's see,

3941
02:49:40,100 --> 02:49:42,580
where it says it fell to the bottom like lead.

3942
02:49:42,580 --> 02:49:44,860
If anybody sees that, what verse would that be?

3943
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:45,740
Fast forward.

3944
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:48,620
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron,

3945
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:50,700
took a timbrel in her hand.

3946
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:52,600
See, there's a prophetess there as well.

3947
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:02,550
Let me see where it gives you a second witness

3948
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:04,250
that they fell to the bottom.

3949
02:50:20,890 --> 02:50:22,210
I don't believe I can't see it.

3950
02:50:23,690 --> 02:50:26,430
If you read the whole chapter, you'll see a second witness there.

3951
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:28,570
Just for economy of movement,

3952
02:50:29,630 --> 02:50:31,290
you'll see there's a second witness there

3953
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:32,430
where they fell to the bottom.

3954
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:34,190
They sank to the bottom like a stone.

3955
02:50:34,310 --> 02:50:35,630
They sank to the bottom like lead.

3956
02:50:36,410 --> 02:50:38,210
Again, if they're already walking on the bottom,

3957
02:50:38,310 --> 02:50:39,450
how can they fall to the bottom?

3958
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:44,530
And it doesn't say anything about clearing the bottom of a sea,

3959
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:46,970
which is a very, very nasty place to walk on.

3960
02:50:47,350 --> 02:50:49,210
And the silt would be at least knee deep.

3961
02:50:51,570 --> 02:50:55,090
Now, also, if you read these two chapters very carefully,

3962
02:50:55,170 --> 02:50:56,470
you'll see that there's confusion.

3963
02:50:58,410 --> 02:51:01,490
The Pharaoh's chariots went into confusion.

3964
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:04,130
If you've ever gone fishing on a frozen lake

3965
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:06,010
and that lake starts to crack,

3966
02:51:06,450 --> 02:51:08,310
you leave everything on there and you run.

3967
02:51:09,410 --> 02:51:12,630
Now, he says here in 15 and 14

3968
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:14,990
that with the blast of your nostrils,

3969
02:51:15,090 --> 02:51:17,610
the waters would gather together and frozen.

3970
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:20,890
So if you go, for example, here a little, there a little,

3971
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:23,590
if you go to...

3972
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:27,570
Let me see if I can... I'm trying to find some notes here.

3973
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:33,480
Psalms. All right.

3974
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:37,660
If you go to Psalms 147.17, click on the top.

3975
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:41,220
You're at Exodus now on that book,

3976
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:42,560
so you click down to Psalms

3977
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:47,120
and you go all the way down to 147.

3978
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:50,020
Then you click on 17.

3979
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:54,560
147.17 says,

3980
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:57,100
He casteth forth his ice like morsels,

3981
02:51:57,420 --> 02:51:59,100
who can stand before his cold?

3982
02:52:00,740 --> 02:52:03,920
Okay, so they weren't standing when the ice was broken

3983
02:52:06,720 --> 02:52:08,100
like pieces or morsels.

3984
02:52:08,240 --> 02:52:09,060
And then 18, he says,

3985
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:11,340
He sendeth out his word and melteth them,

3986
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:13,920
he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

3987
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,280
Okay, but if you also look in Scripture,

3988
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:17,480
it says the morning came,

3989
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:19,840
and the morning in the desert is very hot.

3990
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:21,880
Well, actually not very hot,

3991
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:24,420
but the heat in the desert, even in spring or winter,

3992
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,380
the sun is definitely warm enough to melt,

3993
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:29,080
even in the morning before you get to the desert.

3994
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:31,220
But if you get to Job,

3995
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:32,980
go back up to the book

3996
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:35,680
and on the top left of the program,

3997
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:36,640
click on Job,

3998
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:39,360
and then go to 37.

3999
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:43,100
Click on chapter 37,

4000
02:52:43,380 --> 02:52:44,680
and then verse 10.

4001
02:52:45,860 --> 02:52:46,240
You say,

4002
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:48,340
By the breath of G-O-D,

4003
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:49,300
E-R-L,

4004
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:50,700
frost is given,

4005
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:53,780
and the breath of the waters are strained.

4006
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:55,620
And the breath here would be Rahab,

4007
02:52:55,880 --> 02:52:57,320
which is literally the whiff.

4008
02:52:57,960 --> 02:52:59,120
Not the entire length,

4009
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:01,120
but the width of the waters,

4010
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:01,860
which is my aim,

4011
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:02,260
are strained,

4012
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:04,200
narrowness.

4013
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:07,480
So there's another witness to,

4014
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:08,700
through by his breath,

4015
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:09,600
frost is given,

4016
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:11,660
which is also mentioned,

4017
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:13,000
he blew an easterly wind.

4018
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:15,000
So a little bit here,

4019
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:15,780
a little bit there,

4020
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:17,100
and it's pretty well established

4021
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:18,740
that they walked on an ice bridge.

4022
02:53:21,890 --> 02:53:23,510
Now, when you're walking on ice,

4023
02:53:23,570 --> 02:53:25,030
you're walking on water, aren't you?

4024
02:53:26,190 --> 02:53:27,930
Haven't we heard about walking on water

4025
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:29,050
in other parts of the Bible?

4026
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:40,540
Jesus.

4027
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:44,020
Yeah, you see how things get pieced together,

4028
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:46,020
and they get pieced together

4029
02:53:46,020 --> 02:53:48,280
in a way that the book gets smaller

4030
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:49,880
and smaller and smaller.

4031
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:51,680
You'll start noticing links.

4032
02:53:51,780 --> 02:53:53,300
Kind of like neurons in your brain,

4033
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:55,340
these things have to be linked up.

4034
02:53:56,060 --> 02:53:57,240
Or a jigsaw puzzle.

4035
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:58,660
Look, you've got a jigsaw puzzle,

4036
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:01,340
and you dump it on the table,

4037
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:03,220
and you start assembling all the pieces.

4038
02:54:03,380 --> 02:54:04,240
And the way they're assembled

4039
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,560
is each piece interlocks

4040
02:54:05,560 --> 02:54:08,920
very specifically and tightly.

4041
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,260
And actually, when you start forming

4042
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:11,220
that jigsaw puzzle,

4043
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:13,160
each piece is so strong,

4044
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:15,820
you can lift up the entire piece,

4045
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:18,360
the entire puzzle from just one piece.

4046
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:20,240
But it's really hard to assemble that puzzle

4047
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:21,020
without a picture.

4048
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:22,740
You usually look,

4049
02:54:22,820 --> 02:54:24,380
you always use the picture on the box

4050
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:26,040
of that jigsaw puzzle as your reference.

4051
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,420
So the problem is,

4052
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:30,440
we've lost the picture that was painted.

4053
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:32,740
Or it's given, actually,

4054
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:34,940
in other parts of the scriptures.

4055
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:36,000
And every scripture has

4056
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,660
very similar attributes to it.

4057
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:40,660
But the Bible is extremely unique

4058
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:42,220
that it has the most detail.

4059
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:47,820
So that's why, again,

4060
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:50,700
I've gravitated towards this.

4061
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,100
Another aspect of it

4062
02:54:53,780 --> 02:54:55,560
is if you go to your e-sort,

4063
02:54:57,160 --> 02:54:58,980
and go to the book part,

4064
02:54:59,060 --> 02:55:00,300
and you go up to Genesis,

4065
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:03,200
go to verse 1, chapter 1,

4066
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:06,860
and you just look at that verse,

4067
02:55:06,860 --> 02:55:11,060
you see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

4068
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:13,120
Which is, in the beginning,

4069
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:16,360
G-O-D created the heaven and the earth.

4070
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:18,400
That's 10 words in English.

4071
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:20,640
But in the original,

4072
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:23,280
if you look at just the green numerals above,

4073
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:28,240
you'll see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

4074
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:31,960
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

4075
02:55:34,290 --> 02:55:36,130
Actually, they've left out one

4076
02:55:36,130 --> 02:55:36,770
in the beginning,

4077
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:37,930
which would be bed of sheep.

4078
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:40,370
So this is not even totally correct.

4079
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:41,930
There are actually seven

4080
02:55:41,930 --> 02:55:44,090
in the text of preservation.

4081
02:55:45,630 --> 02:55:46,630
But by the way,

4082
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:47,950
how do they get from six

4083
02:55:47,950 --> 02:55:51,390
of the original words

4084
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:55,040
in the language of preservation

4085
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:56,720
to 10?

4086
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,520
Okay, so they've added some.

4087
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:00,480
And also, if you look,

4088
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:04,140
if you hold the cursor over 853,

4089
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:07,440
you notice they didn't translate that.

4090
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,980
And it's E-T-H or F.

4091
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:13,640
Or Ate.

4092
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:18,050
So this is the first verse.

4093
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:19,290
When you first see someone,

4094
02:56:19,870 --> 02:56:21,670
like in the Dinalee language

4095
02:56:21,670 --> 02:56:22,410
or Navajo,

4096
02:56:22,970 --> 02:56:23,890
when you're greeted,

4097
02:56:24,070 --> 02:56:24,550
they say,

4098
02:56:24,850 --> 02:56:25,450
Ya Ate.

4099
02:56:26,390 --> 02:56:27,570
What a coincidence.

4100
02:56:28,110 --> 02:56:29,490
They left the Ate out.

4101
02:56:30,930 --> 02:56:32,790
Why aren't they translating that?

4102
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:36,750
And they give you this really lame excuse.

4103
02:56:37,230 --> 02:56:38,950
Well, what is Aleph Tav?

4104
02:56:40,030 --> 02:56:43,590
Apparently contracted from HG 26.

4105
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:44,490
Okay, apparently.

4106
02:56:44,650 --> 02:56:45,450
So that means it's not.

4107
02:56:46,490 --> 02:56:47,750
What is Aleph Tav?

4108
02:56:48,210 --> 02:56:50,030
Well, Aleph is the first letter

4109
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:50,970
of the Hebrew alphabet.

4110
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:52,690
And Tav is the last letter

4111
02:56:53,610 --> 02:56:54,850
of the Hebrew alphabet.

4112
02:56:55,430 --> 02:56:57,050
So it's the first and the last.

4113
02:56:57,130 --> 02:56:57,830
And it's a word.

4114
02:56:59,110 --> 02:57:00,090
Now, in Greek,

4115
02:57:00,190 --> 02:57:01,690
it would be the Alpha and the Omega.

4116
02:57:02,510 --> 02:57:05,130
And it's actually in the form of a word.

4117
02:57:05,370 --> 02:57:06,750
And it's the first and the last.

4118
02:57:07,090 --> 02:57:08,450
Wasn't there someone in Scripture

4119
02:57:08,450 --> 02:57:10,370
that called himself the Alpha and the Omega,

4120
02:57:10,530 --> 02:57:11,530
the first and the last?

4121
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:12,570
I am the Word.

4122
02:57:14,090 --> 02:57:15,110
How about in John,

4123
02:57:15,210 --> 02:57:15,730
where he says,

4124
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:17,450
In the beginning was the Word,

4125
02:57:17,490 --> 02:57:19,350
and the Word was with Elohim,

4126
02:57:19,970 --> 02:57:21,170
and Elohim was the Word.

4127
02:57:22,910 --> 02:57:24,570
Are we supposed to go to the beginning,

4128
02:57:24,690 --> 02:57:25,410
maybe to Genesis,

4129
02:57:25,630 --> 02:57:26,830
and see that they left out

4130
02:57:26,830 --> 02:57:28,430
the first and the last?

4131
02:57:29,550 --> 02:57:31,130
And if you do a search on that,

4132
02:57:31,710 --> 02:57:36,910
go ahead and copy that.

4133
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:39,770
Highlight it and right-click copy.

4134
02:57:40,030 --> 02:57:41,830
Go to where the binoculars are.

4135
02:57:41,950 --> 02:57:43,050
Click on those binoculars.

4136
02:57:43,190 --> 02:57:45,010
You bring up a search engine

4137
02:57:45,010 --> 02:57:45,870
within the program.

4138
02:57:46,130 --> 02:57:47,330
And just go ahead and paste that

4139
02:57:48,930 --> 02:57:50,010
H853 in the search.

4140
02:57:50,110 --> 02:57:51,210
And go ahead and click on that.

4141
02:57:52,210 --> 02:57:53,230
And you're going to see,

4142
02:57:54,870 --> 02:57:56,030
zero verses found.

4143
02:57:56,150 --> 02:57:56,730
You've got to wait,

4144
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:58,150
because there's hundreds of them,

4145
02:57:58,690 --> 02:58:00,310
hundreds of places where it exists

4146
02:58:00,310 --> 02:58:01,410
in Scripture in the Hebrew,

4147
02:58:01,530 --> 02:58:02,310
and they left it out.

4148
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:04,730
And you can click on each verse,

4149
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:05,470
and you can see,

4150
02:58:05,470 --> 02:58:07,610
okay, Genesis 1-4,

4151
02:58:07,810 --> 02:58:10,410
and Elohim, or G-O-D, saw,

4152
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:12,830
and then you see the H5-3,

4153
02:58:12,970 --> 02:58:14,690
the first and the last, again.

4154
02:58:14,850 --> 02:58:15,650
And then the light.

4155
02:58:16,750 --> 02:58:18,250
Okay, that was good.

4156
02:58:18,890 --> 02:58:20,690
And then Elohim divided, you know,

4157
02:58:20,730 --> 02:58:21,850
and they have another word there,

4158
02:58:23,190 --> 02:58:24,930
which is divided, badal,

4159
02:58:25,430 --> 02:58:26,470
is to divide.

4160
02:58:27,610 --> 02:58:30,350
Okay, but what's that word H996?

4161
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:33,050
They're not translating.

4162
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:36,270
Well, if you look at it,

4163
02:58:36,350 --> 02:58:37,490
it says properly constructed

4164
02:58:37,490 --> 02:58:39,630
from an otherwise unnamed noun,

4165
02:58:39,790 --> 02:58:41,570
okay, but actually ben, or ban,

4166
02:58:41,650 --> 02:58:42,390
means sun.

4167
02:58:43,170 --> 02:58:45,930
Not as in sun as in the helial sun,

4168
02:58:46,210 --> 02:58:47,970
the body of light and space,

4169
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:49,570
but as a father and a son

4170
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:52,010
from the darkness.

4171
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:54,650
So you can do your own research,

4172
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:56,370
and you start looking at,

4173
02:58:56,790 --> 02:58:57,830
click on each verse,

4174
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:58,730
all throughout Scripture,

4175
02:58:58,910 --> 02:59:00,490
where that 853 is.

4176
02:59:01,270 --> 02:59:03,030
Click on it, and you'll see,

4177
02:59:03,650 --> 02:59:04,830
stick that in,

4178
02:59:05,070 --> 02:59:08,530
for example, Genesis 37, 11.

4179
02:59:09,350 --> 02:59:10,810
And his brethren envied him,

4180
02:59:11,230 --> 02:59:12,450
but his father observed

4181
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:14,590
the first and the last saying.

4182
02:59:15,350 --> 02:59:16,890
So that first and the last

4183
02:59:16,890 --> 02:59:18,170
starts taking on a new meaning

4184
02:59:18,170 --> 02:59:19,230
when you start looking at

4185
02:59:19,230 --> 02:59:20,190
the original language.

4186
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:28,700
So, I mean, that's enough

4187
02:59:28,700 --> 02:59:30,700
of maybe just a quick way

4188
02:59:30,700 --> 02:59:32,060
to use that search engine,

4189
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:33,040
and you'll just look,

4190
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:35,620
even leisurely or recreationally,

4191
02:59:35,740 --> 02:59:37,780
what's being left out and why.

4192
02:59:43,700 --> 02:59:46,200
Any questions on that?

4193
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:48,600
Maybe I want to show

4194
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:50,360
one more thing.

4195
02:59:53,580 --> 02:59:55,380
Are you folks familiar with

4196
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:00,580
the Vatican?

4197
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:03,500
It has a statue of Moses,

4198
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,240
and he's sitting,

4199
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:08,840
it's a marble statue done

4200
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,920
by Michelangelo.

4201
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:14,120
Is anyone familiar with that statue?

4202
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:16,300
You can just do

4203
03:00:17,220 --> 03:00:19,040
statue of Moses in the Vatican,

4204
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:20,140
go to images,

4205
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:21,620
and it'll pull it right up.

4206
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:40,680
That's right, Angelo.

4207
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:44,300
I just turned on the chat.

4208
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:46,080
Yes, he has horns.

4209
03:00:47,420 --> 03:00:48,760
Does anybody else see that?

4210
03:00:51,440 --> 03:00:52,900
That Moses, the statue,

4211
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:54,100
has horns?

4212
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:58,080
Oh, he has horns like Ayatollah.

4213
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:00,660
Hold on a second.

4214
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:02,100
Don't spill the beans on me now.

4215
03:01:04,900 --> 03:01:07,860
Okay, now he's got horns,

4216
03:01:07,860 --> 03:01:09,040
and people look at that,

4217
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:09,480
and they're like,

4218
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:10,980
they're up to no good.

4219
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:13,320
They're doing something, okay.

4220
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:15,760
If you go to Exodus 34,

4221
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:19,180
let's say verse 29,

4222
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:21,780
and it came to pass

4223
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:23,520
when Moses came down from the mount,

4224
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:26,200
Sinai, with two tables of testimony

4225
03:01:26,200 --> 03:01:27,240
in his hand,

4226
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:28,820
but he came down from the mount

4227
03:01:28,820 --> 03:01:30,080
that Moses was not,

4228
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:32,580
that the skin of his face shone

4229
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:34,120
while he talked with him.

4230
03:01:34,620 --> 03:01:36,340
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel

4231
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:37,360
saw Moses, behold,

4232
03:01:37,400 --> 03:01:38,860
the skin of his face shone,

4233
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:40,400
they were all afraid

4234
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:41,640
and came nigh to him.

4235
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:43,300
Okay, Moses called on to them,

4236
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:45,580
okay, but if you skip down

4237
03:01:45,580 --> 03:01:47,280
to 34, 33,

4238
03:01:47,440 --> 03:01:49,060
till Moses had done speaking with them,

4239
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:50,520
he put a veil on his face.

4240
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:51,360
But wait a second.

4241
03:01:52,780 --> 03:01:53,840
The scripture tells us

4242
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:56,280
who lights a candle and hides it, right?

4243
03:01:57,260 --> 03:01:58,880
So if his face was shining,

4244
03:01:59,640 --> 03:02:00,960
why would he cover it?

4245
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:05,020
But if you hold the cursor where,

4246
03:02:05,160 --> 03:02:07,000
let's go back to 34, 29,

4247
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,460
he came down from the mount,

4248
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:10,080
the skin of his face shone,

4249
03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:11,720
that's the word 7160,

4250
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:12,980
which is Quran,

4251
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:16,860
the primitive route to push or gore

4252
03:02:16,860 --> 03:02:18,640
or to shoot out horns,

4253
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:20,980
figuratively raised.

4254
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:24,500
Is there a big difference

4255
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:25,900
between shooting out horns

4256
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:26,920
and your face shining?

4257
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:29,920
I think one has nothing to do with the other.

4258
03:02:31,160 --> 03:02:32,740
Do you see what's going on here, folks?

4259
03:02:37,060 --> 03:02:38,540
It's right there in your text.

4260
03:02:38,860 --> 03:02:40,140
It's not in your translation.

4261
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:42,680
But if you go back to the original,

4262
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:44,020
you got the tools to do it

4263
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:45,860
or get yourself a Hebrew interlinear.

4264
03:02:46,580 --> 03:02:47,700
You pull out a Hebrew interlinear

4265
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:48,980
and you'll be reading

4266
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:51,220
the English on the bottom

4267
03:02:51,220 --> 03:02:52,180
if you don't read Hebrew

4268
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:53,240
and you'll notice that,

4269
03:02:53,460 --> 03:02:54,140
wait a second,

4270
03:02:54,540 --> 03:02:55,600
why is that word italicized

4271
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:57,920
and what does that word mean in Hebrew?

4272
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:02,520
So Michelangelo actually knew the scriptures.

4273
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:06,020
Do you wonder why he had such a hard time

4274
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:07,160
getting along with the Pope

4275
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:08,880
and why the Pope said he would have killed him

4276
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:10,200
if he wasn't such a good artist?

4277
03:03:13,240 --> 03:03:14,840
He just went ahead and did it anyway.

4278
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:18,480
That's why, you know,

4279
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:20,520
the Vatican is completely overrated.

4280
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:22,840
They're not hiding,

4281
03:03:22,860 --> 03:03:24,660
they're not hiding scripture from you.

4282
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:26,200
They're hiding parts of it,

4283
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:27,520
but you can get those parts.

4284
03:03:27,900 --> 03:03:29,140
They've put in parts

4285
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:31,960
and you can figure out where they are

4286
03:03:31,960 --> 03:03:34,680
if you really want to be a workman in it.

4287
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:37,600
And it doesn't mean like a government job

4288
03:03:37,600 --> 03:03:38,620
where one guy is digging

4289
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:40,440
and eight people standing around saying,

4290
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:41,120
are you done yet?

4291
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:44,910
You need a group of people to do it,

4292
03:03:44,930 --> 03:03:45,990
to cut through the stuff.

4293
03:03:49,130 --> 03:03:49,970
So they're not hiding.

4294
03:03:50,250 --> 03:03:50,490
Okay.

4295
03:03:50,930 --> 03:03:52,490
Do you ever hear the term, for example,

4296
03:03:55,070 --> 03:03:56,330
have a nice day?

4297
03:03:59,620 --> 03:03:59,940
Okay.

4298
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:03,380
You want to go find yourself a nice church?

4299
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:06,580
You want to find yourself a nice girl to marry?

4300
03:04:06,740 --> 03:04:09,280
Or you got to find yourself a nice boy to marry?

4301
03:04:09,700 --> 03:04:12,200
Well, you didn't say that wasn't very nice.

4302
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:16,080
Anybody ever look up what that word nice actually means?

4303
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:19,280
You know?

4304
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:21,200
And I'm going to tie this in

4305
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:23,300
with what I'm talking about,

4306
03:04:23,340 --> 03:04:24,800
the Vatican being overrated.

4307
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:32,040
You go to the online etymology dictionary,

4308
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:32,680
excuse me,

4309
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:38,100
and the ones on the internet are about 80% good.

4310
03:04:38,240 --> 03:04:38,640
There's another,

4311
03:04:38,800 --> 03:04:40,220
there's a part of them that's lacking.

4312
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,980
But go ahead and click down

4313
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,640
to where you find that word nice.

4314
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:46,060
You know, people always wish,

4315
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:47,760
well, that wasn't very nice.

4316
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:50,060
Or, you know, you've got a nice jacket on

4317
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:52,460
or it's a very common word.

4318
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:56,920
So you go, I guess it's page eight,

4319
03:04:58,340 --> 03:04:59,280
page nine,

4320
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:03,280
and on this online etymology dictionary,

4321
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:05,240
which seems to have creeped up

4322
03:05:05,240 --> 03:05:07,080
in several positions on the internet.

4323
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:13,320
Anybody want to read the definition of the word nice?

4324
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:15,940
If you've got it?

4325
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:24,940
Bully, stupid, senseless.

4326
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:26,680
You got it.

4327
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:30,180
Bully, stupid, senseless.

4328
03:05:30,320 --> 03:05:31,080
And if you go down there,

4329
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:33,580
there's Jane Austen making fun of people,

4330
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:35,440
saying, I'm sure, cried Catherine,

4331
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:37,000
I did not mean to say anything wrong,

4332
03:05:37,240 --> 03:05:38,460
but it is a nice book.

4333
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:40,920
And why should I not call it so?

4334
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:42,060
Very true, said Henry.

4335
03:05:42,420 --> 03:05:43,880
And this is a very nice day.

4336
03:05:44,120 --> 03:05:45,900
And we're taking a very nice walk.

4337
03:05:46,340 --> 03:05:48,300
And you are two very nice young ladies.

4338
03:05:48,660 --> 03:05:50,800
And oh, it is a very nice world indeed.

4339
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:52,400
It does for everything.

4340
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,240
Do you think she knew what the meaning

4341
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:55,280
of that word nice was?

4342
03:05:55,460 --> 03:05:55,860
Absolutely.

4343
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:58,780
Okay, so the Vatican,

4344
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:00,980
wasn't that formed by what?

4345
03:06:01,060 --> 03:06:02,220
The Nicene Council?

4346
03:06:02,380 --> 03:06:03,440
Somebody already got it.

4347
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:06,780
Thank you, guest 77.

4348
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:12,080
It was formed by the nice,

4349
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:14,300
the very nice people at the Nicene Council.

4350
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:16,820
It didn't come across someone's head

4351
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:18,760
that these men that put this stuff together

4352
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:20,020
didn't know what they were doing?

4353
03:06:25,650 --> 03:06:28,670
That it coincides with hiding stuff in plain sight?

4354
03:06:31,090 --> 03:06:32,970
It's just right in front of us.

4355
03:06:33,630 --> 03:06:35,830
You're talking about from the Latin, right?

4356
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:39,250
And Old English, or Old French.

4357
03:06:39,430 --> 03:06:41,030
Nice, simple, silly from Old French.

4358
03:06:41,170 --> 03:06:42,010
From Latin it says,

4359
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:44,710
N-E-S-C-I-U-S.

4360
03:06:45,790 --> 03:06:48,950
Ignorant from N-E-C-I-R.

4361
03:06:49,290 --> 03:06:50,370
To be ignorant.

4362
03:06:50,770 --> 03:06:51,630
That's what they actually said.

4363
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:53,610
Yeah, so the Nicene Council.

4364
03:06:53,790 --> 03:06:55,950
Okay, so I think they're overrated, man.

4365
03:06:55,970 --> 03:06:57,490
They're telling us they don't know Jack.

4366
03:06:58,490 --> 03:06:59,950
Now, if you ever look at the history

4367
03:06:59,950 --> 03:07:01,490
of Constantine and those guys,

4368
03:07:01,490 --> 03:07:05,150
they were into forming a uniform state.

4369
03:07:05,370 --> 03:07:07,550
Like the UCC is the Uniform Commercial Code.

4370
03:07:07,870 --> 03:07:09,830
They were trying to form a set of rules

4371
03:07:09,830 --> 03:07:11,650
that if you want to create a state,

4372
03:07:11,710 --> 03:07:14,430
because there's a lot of land that needs to be reconquered,

4373
03:07:14,530 --> 03:07:17,170
because the Babylonians had once conquered the whole Earth.

4374
03:07:18,250 --> 03:07:19,190
It's in Scripture.

4375
03:07:20,490 --> 03:07:22,010
They wanted to reconquer it.

4376
03:07:22,030 --> 03:07:23,810
They wanted to go back out and take it again

4377
03:07:23,810 --> 03:07:25,450
under the Greek system.

4378
03:07:26,430 --> 03:07:28,350
And also, if people are not familiar with this,

4379
03:07:28,430 --> 03:07:30,110
it says Roman Civil Law.

4380
03:07:30,110 --> 03:07:31,790
This is Roman this, Roman that.

4381
03:07:31,850 --> 03:07:33,190
Where did the Romans get that from?

4382
03:07:34,730 --> 03:07:35,170
Greeks.

4383
03:07:35,930 --> 03:07:37,070
You're under the Greek system.

4384
03:07:40,550 --> 03:07:41,650
It's in your Scripture.

4385
03:07:42,370 --> 03:07:43,770
The third beast is the Greek.

4386
03:07:43,930 --> 03:07:45,710
And the system was divided into four.

4387
03:07:45,770 --> 03:07:46,690
It still stands today.

4388
03:07:47,070 --> 03:07:48,550
You've got another system coming here,

4389
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:49,390
right around the corner.

4390
03:07:51,650 --> 03:07:52,590
I've got a quick question, Ashton.

4391
03:07:52,670 --> 03:07:53,410
I'm going to cut you off.

4392
03:07:53,530 --> 03:07:54,950
Everybody's asking about your website.

4393
03:07:55,070 --> 03:07:55,710
Do you have a website?

4394
03:07:56,210 --> 03:07:56,850
No, I don't.

4395
03:08:03,910 --> 03:08:06,450
I've done a lot of research in things that,

4396
03:08:06,570 --> 03:08:07,610
if I had to do a website,

4397
03:08:07,830 --> 03:08:09,510
maybe I was thinking of doing a blog.

4398
03:08:11,730 --> 03:08:14,110
I don't want to put the time into developing it.

4399
03:08:15,270 --> 03:08:17,550
Yeah, you just want to be able to post this stuff real quick.

4400
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:19,850
So, yeah, you might want to do a blog.

4401
03:08:19,950 --> 03:08:20,470
I don't mind.

4402
03:08:20,590 --> 03:08:21,990
I've got a lot of notes,

4403
03:08:22,110 --> 03:08:24,110
and I've got a lot of stuff on many subjects.

4404
03:08:24,310 --> 03:08:25,970
And if someone wants to go that route,

4405
03:08:27,110 --> 03:08:27,970
set up a blog.

4406
03:08:28,090 --> 03:08:28,990
There's a lot of free ways,

4407
03:08:29,070 --> 03:08:31,250
and I don't mind pumping information that way.

4408
03:08:31,250 --> 03:08:34,690
But I know there's some wisdom that

4409
03:08:34,690 --> 03:08:37,270
if you know you're not going to do something,

4410
03:08:37,490 --> 03:08:39,230
and you're not going to succeed in setting up a website,

4411
03:08:39,350 --> 03:08:40,170
why even start it?

4412
03:08:41,610 --> 03:08:41,750
You know?

4413
03:08:43,570 --> 03:08:46,250
Anyone who has a website knows that it's a lot of work.

4414
03:08:47,170 --> 03:08:48,230
Oh, yeah, trust me, I know.

4415
03:08:49,550 --> 03:08:52,190
So Romans got it from the Greeks, I think you said.

4416
03:08:52,990 --> 03:08:53,810
You got it.

4417
03:08:54,230 --> 03:08:55,470
Where'd the Greeks get it from?

4418
03:08:57,150 --> 03:08:57,870
Oh, interesting.

4419
03:08:58,070 --> 03:08:59,130
Okay, it's in your scripture.

4420
03:09:00,430 --> 03:09:03,930
The Greeks got it from the Persians,

4421
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:06,110
and the Persians got it from the Babylonians.

4422
03:09:06,490 --> 03:09:09,070
And the Babylonians got it from their forefathers.

4423
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:11,170
That's why when you read in Genesis,

4424
03:09:11,390 --> 03:09:13,230
these were the men of old, the men of renown,

4425
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:14,090
the men of name.

4426
03:09:15,010 --> 03:09:18,030
Whenever you read that word name in your scripture,

4427
03:09:18,170 --> 03:09:19,890
it doesn't say name, it means shem,

4428
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:21,310
which is actually your character.

4429
03:09:22,470 --> 03:09:24,010
Just like when you meet someone,

4430
03:09:24,170 --> 03:09:25,890
you know your name is, let's say, Tom Smith.

4431
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:28,490
Oh, someone in your family must have been a Smith.

4432
03:09:29,130 --> 03:09:30,190
Or Michael Baker.

4433
03:09:30,370 --> 03:09:32,390
Well, someone in your family, you guys were Bakers, right?

4434
03:09:33,050 --> 03:09:34,270
Your name is your character.

4435
03:09:35,750 --> 03:09:39,250
So we're talking about some real tough cats back in those days,

4436
03:09:39,330 --> 03:09:41,650
and if you start going through your scriptures,

4437
03:09:41,890 --> 03:09:44,910
you'll start seeing things ain't the way they seem.

4438
03:09:47,350 --> 03:09:49,570
But the Greeks, basically,

4439
03:09:49,970 --> 03:09:51,910
if you've got to study your genealogy,

4440
03:09:52,130 --> 03:09:53,610
it's in your Genesis, too,

4441
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:55,850
where'd the Greeks come from genealogically?

4442
03:09:57,630 --> 03:09:58,110
Right?

4443
03:09:58,270 --> 03:10:00,310
And you've got to look at the kingdoms.

4444
03:10:02,130 --> 03:10:05,770
Your secular history does have a lot of information

4445
03:10:05,770 --> 03:10:07,310
regarding your question, by the way,

4446
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:08,570
where the Greeks got it from.

4447
03:10:08,810 --> 03:10:10,230
The Greeks got it from Egypt.

4448
03:10:11,350 --> 03:10:14,870
The Greeks got it from Persia later on.

4449
03:10:14,950 --> 03:10:18,050
But initially, your people that left Egypt,

4450
03:10:19,370 --> 03:10:20,750
there was a mixed multitude.

4451
03:10:23,910 --> 03:10:25,390
Most of them went east,

4452
03:10:25,530 --> 03:10:27,010
and some of them went north.

4453
03:10:27,970 --> 03:10:29,990
And some of them went east,

4454
03:10:30,270 --> 03:10:31,330
and kept going,

4455
03:10:31,710 --> 03:10:34,270
and then they kept going north across land.

4456
03:10:34,710 --> 03:10:35,630
And then west.

4457
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:41,230
For example, if you look at a lot of your Greek terms,

4458
03:10:41,310 --> 03:10:43,170
and you look at a lot of your Egyptian terms,

4459
03:10:43,250 --> 03:10:44,550
they're pretty much the same thing.

4460
03:10:44,650 --> 03:10:47,290
Like the word, how do you say chemistry in Greek?

4461
03:10:47,450 --> 03:10:51,350
Pretty much kimi, or kime, right?

4462
03:10:51,470 --> 03:10:54,090
And Egypt is the land of chem, kime.

4463
03:10:55,610 --> 03:10:56,130
Right?

4464
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:57,070
Okay.

4465
03:10:57,070 --> 03:10:59,730
If you look at the etymology of a lot of Greek words,

4466
03:10:59,830 --> 03:11:01,910
like if you look at the etymology of a lot of English,

4467
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:06,070
it comes from Greek or Latin.

4468
03:11:06,470 --> 03:11:08,610
You look at the etymology of a lot of Greek,

4469
03:11:08,750 --> 03:11:11,270
if you're studying within the Greek technical aspects of it,

4470
03:11:11,290 --> 03:11:13,430
you'll see it came from Egypt and Persia.

4471
03:11:14,230 --> 03:11:17,390
And a lot of it was inspired original form of speaking.

4472
03:11:17,930 --> 03:11:20,270
Some of it came from Cyprus,

4473
03:11:22,710 --> 03:11:23,890
which means copper.

4474
03:11:28,470 --> 03:11:31,150
And northern Phoenicia, northern Canaanite.

4475
03:11:31,870 --> 03:11:32,990
It's a mishmash.

4476
03:11:34,370 --> 03:11:35,790
But they're really tough.

4477
03:11:35,950 --> 03:11:37,410
I mean, they were pretty tough.

4478
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:40,370
Even today, their battle strategy

4479
03:11:40,370 --> 03:11:43,710
and their political strategies and their economics,

4480
03:11:43,890 --> 03:11:45,010
not so much their economics,

4481
03:11:45,210 --> 03:11:47,690
but I would say political, science, medical

4482
03:11:47,690 --> 03:11:49,510
is still dominating the world today.

4483
03:11:51,210 --> 03:11:54,230
Who are those folks over at the Land of Nod?

4484
03:11:56,970 --> 03:11:58,390
The folks over at the Land of Nod.

4485
03:11:58,390 --> 03:11:59,710
I don't know the answer to that one.

4486
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:02,690
Not much said about them.

4487
03:12:03,430 --> 03:12:05,570
Now, before the exodus, there were people

4488
03:12:05,570 --> 03:12:09,230
who had either won their freedom or just left

4489
03:12:09,230 --> 03:12:11,450
to go into other nations.

4490
03:12:11,650 --> 03:12:12,270
Is that correct?

4491
03:12:13,350 --> 03:12:15,830
There's a mixed multitude that left with them.

4492
03:12:17,050 --> 03:12:19,470
So they apparently took the same route,

4493
03:12:19,670 --> 03:12:21,290
but they divided later on

4494
03:12:21,290 --> 03:12:24,930
based on the etymology of what I see in the language,

4495
03:12:27,210 --> 03:12:27,710
you see.

4496
03:12:29,830 --> 03:12:32,030
But there's a lot going on, you see.

4497
03:12:32,190 --> 03:12:34,450
I mean, how has the world been faring

4498
03:12:34,450 --> 03:12:35,490
on this Greek system?

4499
03:12:36,850 --> 03:12:37,510
I don't know.

4500
03:12:38,690 --> 03:12:41,070
I think I gave the etymology of a democracy

4501
03:12:41,070 --> 03:12:42,430
at the beginning of the show.

4502
03:12:47,540 --> 03:12:49,920
The word democracy doesn't mean what you think it means.

4503
03:12:51,140 --> 03:12:52,680
Look at the moons of Mars.

4504
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:56,580
Phobos and Deimos.

4505
03:12:56,840 --> 03:12:59,020
Fear and dread or terror.

4506
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:04,180
Terror state is literally what democracy means, right?

4507
03:13:05,900 --> 03:13:06,380
Yeah.

4508
03:13:08,690 --> 03:13:10,250
Some people say demonocracy.

4509
03:13:11,310 --> 03:13:12,930
No, no, no, but look at the timing.

4510
03:13:13,050 --> 03:13:14,130
I'm trying to show you timing.

4511
03:13:15,730 --> 03:13:17,350
What do you see in the news every day?

4512
03:13:18,290 --> 03:13:19,370
News about what?

4513
03:13:20,110 --> 03:13:23,310
Ism. T-E-R-R-O-I-S-M, right?

4514
03:13:23,570 --> 03:13:24,210
All the time.

4515
03:13:28,900 --> 03:13:30,920
Is there a timing aspect involved here?

4516
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:34,180
All things will be revealed in the end?

4517
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:35,740
End of what?

4518
03:13:36,260 --> 03:13:38,380
The end is not like what people think.

4519
03:13:39,690 --> 03:13:42,250
Well, ultimately, the end is a new beginning.

4520
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,140
Right.

4521
03:13:46,360 --> 03:13:48,680
You got one more system coming in.

4522
03:13:50,180 --> 03:13:51,800
You got one more system,

4523
03:13:51,900 --> 03:13:54,840
and this system that's coming in is going to happen so fast

4524
03:13:55,540 --> 03:13:57,460
and under the radar,

4525
03:13:58,160 --> 03:14:00,220
and everyone's going to fall into it.

4526
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:04,020
And it's got nothing to do with the New World Order

4527
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:05,820
everybody's preaching and teaching and running

4528
03:14:05,820 --> 03:14:07,380
that we have to get rid of

4529
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:10,440
on all your conspiracy websites.

4530
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:17,340
Now, Angela says it's the age of Aquarius.

4531
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:19,580
You got it.

4532
03:14:20,620 --> 03:14:21,500
It is.

4533
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:24,340
But look at how your ages transpire.

4534
03:14:25,360 --> 03:14:26,840
There's always argument about that.

4535
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:29,000
Well, is it exactly 2,000 years?

4536
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:31,540
Is it 2,150?

4537
03:14:32,180 --> 03:14:34,000
It's neither. It's observational.

4538
03:14:34,980 --> 03:14:36,680
How do you know what age we're in?

4539
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:39,320
Well, you go out

4540
03:14:39,320 --> 03:14:42,300
in the beginning of the year in spring,

4541
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:44,260
your equinox,

4542
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:46,600
around your first of the month,

4543
03:14:47,360 --> 03:14:51,380
and you'll see what set of stars you see in the east

4544
03:14:51,380 --> 03:14:56,380
before the sunlight washes your ability to see the stars out.

4545
03:14:56,960 --> 03:15:00,760
And you'll see the water bearer, Aquarius.

4546
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:04,740
But he's not fully... He's there.

4547
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:07,460
Pretty much fully there, I'd say.

4548
03:15:07,540 --> 03:15:08,640
Well, not fully, but mostly.

4549
03:15:09,160 --> 03:15:13,400
And that's the time of the pouring out of the Spirit

4550
03:15:14,060 --> 03:15:15,260
by a man.

4551
03:15:15,380 --> 03:15:18,020
Now, biblically, the pouring out of water,

4552
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:19,600
water bearing, was a woman's job.

4553
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:21,840
All through Scripture,

4554
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:25,260
the camels were watered and the sheep were watered by women.

4555
03:15:27,420 --> 03:15:29,240
So there's going to be a change here,

4556
03:15:29,300 --> 03:15:30,560
but it's going to be the reverse.

4557
03:15:31,580 --> 03:15:32,600
So you have

4558
03:15:34,240 --> 03:15:37,640
the way these things are happening here changing.

4559
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:40,320
You see, the thing about that Gary was talking about

4560
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:42,120
in the beginning about women.

4561
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:45,740
If you want to raise the level of education...

4562
03:15:45,740 --> 03:15:47,120
I don't like using the word education

4563
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:49,060
because it means the training of animals.

4564
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:55,000
But if you want to raise the level of consciousness,

4565
03:15:56,140 --> 03:15:56,780
perception,

4566
03:15:57,260 --> 03:15:59,440
and true knowledge of a society,

4567
03:16:00,320 --> 03:16:02,380
you must raise the consciousness

4568
03:16:02,380 --> 03:16:04,740
or maintain the high level of consciousness

4569
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:06,880
and knowledge amongst women.

4570
03:16:09,790 --> 03:16:12,070
It's the women that raise the children

4571
03:16:12,070 --> 03:16:13,630
during their formative years,

4572
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:16,450
from when they're born to eight or nine years old.

4573
03:16:17,810 --> 03:16:19,370
If you dumb down the women,

4574
03:16:19,510 --> 03:16:20,850
you dumb down the society.

4575
03:16:21,790 --> 03:16:23,790
If you take the women out of the house,

4576
03:16:23,890 --> 03:16:25,290
you dumb down the society.

4577
03:16:26,270 --> 03:16:27,410
Do you see what's going on

4578
03:16:27,410 --> 03:16:30,890
with women going to work with this woman's lib backfiring?

4579
03:16:33,660 --> 03:16:36,000
Oh yeah, that puts the children in the hands of the state.

4580
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:37,880
Yeah.

4581
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:41,000
They've taken the mother who is

4582
03:16:42,340 --> 03:16:43,020
bearing...

4583
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:44,900
She has the...

4584
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:48,040
Her ability to interact with those children

4585
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:49,680
and pass down the wisdom

4586
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:52,720
and knowledge and consciousness

4587
03:16:52,720 --> 03:16:55,460
and perception and training to children,

4588
03:16:56,080 --> 03:16:59,120
both young boys and young girls,

4589
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:00,620
during their formative years.

4590
03:17:01,660 --> 03:17:02,960
If you eliminate that,

4591
03:17:03,020 --> 03:17:05,380
you're doing irreparable damage to those children.

4592
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:10,400
Why do you think they want all the women at work?

4593
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:14,530
The women's lib and women going to work

4594
03:17:14,530 --> 03:17:16,110
has nothing to do with women's lib.

4595
03:17:17,390 --> 03:17:19,110
That's all propaganda that was done.

4596
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:25,240
Just like when they took down that statue,

4597
03:17:25,360 --> 03:17:26,460
let's say, of Saddam Hussein

4598
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,180
and all you see is a crowd of people.

4599
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:31,820
They paid 100 people 50 bucks or 200 bucks each

4600
03:17:31,820 --> 03:17:32,760
to go stand around here.

4601
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:36,180
Oh, look at this big... Everybody says this is the way to go.

4602
03:17:36,420 --> 03:17:38,760
You pay a bunch of women to go out and burn their bras

4603
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:42,500
and do this and do that and women's rights and this and that.

4604
03:17:43,220 --> 03:17:44,460
What do you mean women's rights?

4605
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:45,500
Women run the house.

4606
03:17:46,460 --> 03:17:48,080
Women run the household, period.

4607
03:17:50,980 --> 03:17:51,900
They do the economy,

4608
03:17:52,560 --> 03:17:53,760
the maintenance of the house,

4609
03:17:54,220 --> 03:17:55,700
the scheduling of the house,

4610
03:17:56,100 --> 03:17:57,140
the child raising,

4611
03:17:58,840 --> 03:18:00,200
the education of the children.

4612
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:02,980
Well, again, the knowledge impartment to the children.

4613
03:18:08,610 --> 03:18:09,890
But it's all going to backfire.

4614
03:18:10,170 --> 03:18:11,650
Nothing is going to be the way

4615
03:18:12,190 --> 03:18:13,810
people are thinking it's going to end up.

4616
03:18:13,890 --> 03:18:15,530
I mean, look, you got people running around

4617
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:17,570
saying that you're going to burn in hell forever.

4618
03:18:17,910 --> 03:18:18,870
That's another thing.

4619
03:18:20,810 --> 03:18:25,270
Go find the word forever in your King James,

4620
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:26,090
in your e-sword.

4621
03:18:26,650 --> 03:18:28,890
Find that word and go ahead and hold the cursor

4622
03:18:29,790 --> 03:18:31,730
over either Greek or Hebrew.

4623
03:18:32,110 --> 03:18:32,750
Doesn't matter.

4624
03:18:35,140 --> 03:18:36,380
Well, if you do it in Hebrew,

4625
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:37,960
you're going to get the word olam.

4626
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:41,080
And keep reading the definition

4627
03:18:41,080 --> 03:18:42,980
and it'll tell you for the age.

4628
03:18:46,110 --> 03:18:48,150
And if you hold it over the Greek word for forever,

4629
03:18:48,290 --> 03:18:49,730
you're going to get the word eon,

4630
03:18:50,550 --> 03:18:53,650
which means for the age.

4631
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:58,500
So this concept of forever just ain't there.

4632
03:18:59,540 --> 03:19:01,680
That's something that's this new concept,

4633
03:19:01,860 --> 03:19:02,680
this new idea.

4634
03:19:04,300 --> 03:19:06,820
You know, an indefinite period of time.

4635
03:19:07,540 --> 03:19:09,020
You know, when it says ages of ages,

4636
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:10,240
you got eon times eon.

4637
03:19:10,300 --> 03:19:11,380
Well, how long is an age?

4638
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:14,660
It's a pretty long time for us.

4639
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:23,100
So we start putting these things in perception.

4640
03:19:23,300 --> 03:19:24,720
Okay, let's go back to your Bible.

4641
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:27,560
Okay, it says something about the second death.

4642
03:19:28,540 --> 03:19:29,580
Well, wait a second.

4643
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:32,220
If you die, okay,

4644
03:19:32,260 --> 03:19:34,180
and you either go to heaven or hell,

4645
03:19:34,320 --> 03:19:36,300
okay, you'll be in eternal hell fire

4646
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:37,860
or you're going to be up in heaven.

4647
03:19:39,960 --> 03:19:41,340
Where's the second death?

4648
03:19:42,280 --> 03:19:43,160
What does that mean?

4649
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:46,380
What he's trying to tell you is that people are so stubborn,

4650
03:19:46,500 --> 03:19:47,600
you got to kill them twice.

4651
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:51,320
But everyone gets the same thing in the end.

4652
03:19:51,380 --> 03:19:53,720
It's just what level you're going to be at.

4653
03:19:54,800 --> 03:19:56,760
Everyone gets a spiritual light body.

4654
03:19:59,280 --> 03:20:02,160
It's just that, you see, one thing people don't want to hear,

4655
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:06,820
again, is that there is a chain of command in the spiritual world

4656
03:20:06,820 --> 03:20:08,720
just like there is on the physical world.

4657
03:20:09,900 --> 03:20:11,200
And all the scriptures say,

4658
03:20:11,300 --> 03:20:13,760
as it is done in heaven, it is done on earth and vice versa.

4659
03:20:14,980 --> 03:20:19,600
So if you see a chain of command in a military style,

4660
03:20:19,720 --> 03:20:23,140
now military has nothing to do with what you think a military is,

4661
03:20:23,720 --> 03:20:25,420
waging war in this map.

4662
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:28,280
If you want to know what real military is,

4663
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:32,080
which is the way the military here and there is done,

4664
03:20:32,320 --> 03:20:35,060
but it's not portrayed to the people in their schools or anything,

4665
03:20:35,360 --> 03:20:36,980
go read Sun Tzu, The Art of War,

4666
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:41,380
which is taught to all students of military academies,

4667
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:42,360
all officers and generals.

4668
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:43,220
It's required reading.

4669
03:20:43,380 --> 03:20:47,220
Lao Tzu, Lao Tzu, The Art of War.

4670
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:49,660
It's also taught to students of economics, right?

4671
03:20:51,380 --> 03:20:54,560
It has nothing to do with what you think war is.

4672
03:20:56,180 --> 03:21:00,320
Okay, so the military has nothing to do

4673
03:21:00,320 --> 03:21:02,160
with what they're putting in front of the people

4674
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:03,980
with tanks and bombs and killing people.

4675
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:06,040
The chain of command, because if you look at,

4676
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:07,960
even at times of peace,

4677
03:21:08,320 --> 03:21:11,840
a standing army is to be held in every culture.

4678
03:21:14,670 --> 03:21:17,050
And if you look, oh, Tibetans, they're so peaceful there.

4679
03:21:17,090 --> 03:21:17,590
Yes, they do.

4680
03:21:17,650 --> 03:21:19,510
They do have a standing army in there.

4681
03:21:20,570 --> 03:21:22,950
Not with modern equipment and all that stuff,

4682
03:21:22,990 --> 03:21:24,590
but if you look at their culture and tradition,

4683
03:21:25,230 --> 03:21:26,970
the Japanese have their samurai.

4684
03:21:27,250 --> 03:21:28,750
I mean, however you view it,

4685
03:21:28,770 --> 03:21:32,050
there's always some form of chain of command with enforcement.

4686
03:21:33,710 --> 03:21:36,550
What good is a dog that has no teeth?

4687
03:21:37,850 --> 03:21:39,890
So there's always a chain of command,

4688
03:21:40,410 --> 03:21:42,910
whether it's in the spiritual world or in the physical world,

4689
03:21:42,950 --> 03:21:43,770
and there always will be.

4690
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:47,060
So get over it.

4691
03:21:47,820 --> 03:21:49,260
Just the way things are.

4692
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:50,920
Again, like with the water.

4693
03:21:51,200 --> 03:21:54,180
In nature, the water meanders left and right.

4694
03:21:54,320 --> 03:21:56,900
So it folds over and forms a longitudinal vortex,

4695
03:21:57,080 --> 03:21:58,840
which is a tornado laying down on its side,

4696
03:21:59,220 --> 03:22:00,700
to transmute the elements

4697
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:04,060
and also to carry sediment and keep itself cool.

4698
03:22:04,820 --> 03:22:05,740
But what does man do?

4699
03:22:05,860 --> 03:22:07,860
No, we're going to force it through straight pipes.

4700
03:22:12,270 --> 03:22:13,990
Rebellion against the natural world.

4701
03:22:14,210 --> 03:22:15,570
How's that working out for man?

4702
03:22:15,590 --> 03:22:16,310
Not very good.

4703
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:20,650
You cannot solve the problems of the world,

4704
03:22:20,710 --> 03:22:21,490
meaning society,

4705
03:22:21,810 --> 03:22:23,970
with the same mindset that created them.

4706
03:22:24,730 --> 03:22:27,810
You cannot solve the spiritual problems

4707
03:22:27,810 --> 03:22:29,490
that people have of the mind

4708
03:22:29,490 --> 03:22:33,210
through the same people that created them.

4709
03:22:37,480 --> 03:22:37,760
You see?

4710
03:22:38,900 --> 03:22:40,400
Again, like moving forward,

4711
03:22:40,520 --> 03:22:43,360
again, what deity do you follow?

4712
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:45,080
That's where you get your rules and you stick with it.

4713
03:22:45,140 --> 03:22:46,060
You don't vacillate.

4714
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:48,060
Okay, when you read the Bible, it says,

4715
03:22:48,220 --> 03:22:50,160
okay, there's a time when you go into Egypt

4716
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:53,260
and there's a time when you come out of Egypt.

4717
03:22:53,380 --> 03:22:55,280
And you could see there's an oscillation.

4718
03:22:55,740 --> 03:22:57,960
You go in, they went in with Joseph,

4719
03:22:58,120 --> 03:22:59,440
to save themselves.

4720
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:01,320
They gave up all their possessions to Pharaoh.

4721
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:03,280
They basically sold their bodies to him

4722
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:04,280
and they come out.

4723
03:23:05,300 --> 03:23:07,860
The Christ goes into Egypt and he comes out.

4724
03:23:08,980 --> 03:23:11,400
Okay, people always thought going to Egypt

4725
03:23:12,220 --> 03:23:13,760
was always going to save them.

4726
03:23:13,840 --> 03:23:15,480
And Jeremiah, the Babylonians, come,

4727
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:16,320
we're going to go to Egypt.

4728
03:23:16,440 --> 03:23:17,380
He says, no, if you go to Egypt,

4729
03:23:17,520 --> 03:23:19,920
you're going to die either by the feast,

4730
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:21,740
the famine, or the sword.

4731
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:23,460
And they didn't listen.

4732
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:24,840
And those that did, did, let's say.

4733
03:23:25,220 --> 03:23:27,420
Okay, well, Egypt is Chem.

4734
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:29,120
That's where you get the word chemistry.

4735
03:23:29,580 --> 03:23:31,640
So that was saying better living through chemistry.

4736
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:33,440
How's that working out for you?

4737
03:23:34,860 --> 03:23:36,460
Right now you stay out of it.

4738
03:23:36,920 --> 03:23:39,460
Later on, if you read in scripture,

4739
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:42,500
you go, he forms, he says,

4740
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:46,860
Egypt again will become, be my people.

4741
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:50,040
And there'll be a highway between Egypt and Assyria,

4742
03:23:50,620 --> 03:23:52,460
which doesn't exist right now, but it's coming.

4743
03:23:55,400 --> 03:23:57,640
So you either follow what your,

4744
03:23:57,640 --> 03:23:59,920
you know, whatever program,

4745
03:24:00,580 --> 03:24:02,680
or, you know, you don't mix back and forth.

4746
03:24:02,800 --> 03:24:04,840
So, you know, I've got nothing against knowledge,

4747
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:05,760
Egyptian knowledge.

4748
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:07,300
I've got nothing against culture,

4749
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:09,860
or ancient, or current, or all in between.

4750
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:11,860
I just leave it alone, because right now

4751
03:24:11,860 --> 03:24:12,940
is the time to stay away from it.

4752
03:24:12,960 --> 03:24:14,220
That's fine. It's good enough for me.

4753
03:24:17,290 --> 03:24:18,270
There's a merit in there.

4754
03:24:19,510 --> 03:24:23,210
When you look forward into the New Age,

4755
03:24:24,070 --> 03:24:25,630
Aquarius, between now and then,

4756
03:24:26,110 --> 03:24:28,410
do you see any possibility of a severe

4757
03:24:28,410 --> 03:24:31,130
continental slip, and or complete loss

4758
03:24:31,130 --> 03:24:32,910
of the magnetic field spectrum?

4759
03:24:35,550 --> 03:24:36,930
Yes and no to both.

4760
03:24:38,450 --> 03:24:40,570
Yes, continental slip, no.

4761
03:24:42,030 --> 03:24:44,830
But yes, not the way you think it's going to happen.

4762
03:24:45,250 --> 03:24:46,910
And the magnetic is not going to happen

4763
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:47,950
the way you think it's going to.

4764
03:24:47,950 --> 03:24:50,430
It's taught by science or anything like that either.

4765
03:24:51,010 --> 03:24:52,870
And it's a lot to get into, but I could give you

4766
03:24:52,870 --> 03:24:54,350
the shorthand version of it.

4767
03:24:55,310 --> 03:24:57,550
What I see in some of, and sometimes,

4768
03:24:57,550 --> 03:25:00,490
like I said, this information is held in trust,

4769
03:25:00,910 --> 03:25:02,950
that if you give the information too soon,

4770
03:25:04,010 --> 03:25:06,550
I may have incomplete little pockets

4771
03:25:06,550 --> 03:25:09,070
and not convey it properly,

4772
03:25:09,170 --> 03:25:10,770
because I don't have all the information yet.

4773
03:25:11,810 --> 03:25:14,010
Or it might just seem so ridiculous

4774
03:25:14,010 --> 03:25:15,490
and unbelievable according to what

4775
03:25:15,490 --> 03:25:18,010
the standard thing is being taught,

4776
03:25:18,070 --> 03:25:19,270
it just gets sloughed off.

4777
03:25:19,530 --> 03:25:22,130
And there's things in scripture

4778
03:25:22,130 --> 03:25:23,450
about casting pearls, right?

4779
03:25:24,970 --> 03:25:26,470
We have to be very careful.

4780
03:25:26,470 --> 03:25:29,870
So maybe, let's say, maybe I might know something

4781
03:25:29,870 --> 03:25:30,870
and tell you I don't know,

4782
03:25:30,970 --> 03:25:32,450
and maybe I really don't know it.

4783
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:35,270
But the point is, there's a subtle balance between it.

4784
03:25:35,350 --> 03:25:36,610
And if you want, I could tell you

4785
03:25:36,610 --> 03:25:38,890
what I think is appropriate to say.

4786
03:25:39,830 --> 03:25:41,430
But it's an ongoing project.

4787
03:25:41,710 --> 03:25:42,570
It's not information.

4788
03:25:43,390 --> 03:25:44,990
As we go more into the day,

4789
03:25:45,670 --> 03:25:47,250
these days that we're in now,

4790
03:25:47,290 --> 03:25:48,670
that started roughly 1998,

4791
03:25:48,910 --> 03:25:50,470
more information is being revealed

4792
03:25:50,470 --> 03:25:51,730
that's been there the whole time,

4793
03:25:52,010 --> 03:25:53,150
the perception of it.

4794
03:25:54,450 --> 03:25:56,650
So the magnetic field aspect of it,

4795
03:25:56,690 --> 03:25:59,190
well, you asked about the continental part first, okay?

4796
03:26:00,510 --> 03:26:03,290
The way that the continents and the oceans,

4797
03:26:03,450 --> 03:26:05,890
the relationship between the sea and the ocean

4798
03:26:05,890 --> 03:26:08,950
and the rifts in the ground and the continents,

4799
03:26:09,430 --> 03:26:10,690
and the way that it's being taught

4800
03:26:10,690 --> 03:26:14,250
is very similar to how it is in scripture.

4801
03:26:16,870 --> 03:26:19,630
But it's hard to give a good bearing on it.

4802
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:21,570
So I would say, no, the continents

4803
03:26:21,570 --> 03:26:22,750
are going to be just fine.

4804
03:26:23,150 --> 03:26:24,430
You're going to have, let's say,

4805
03:26:24,570 --> 03:26:26,050
someplace that is underwater.

4806
03:26:27,970 --> 03:26:31,150
Let's say the East Coast or places like that,

4807
03:26:31,210 --> 03:26:32,730
they're going to be, you know,

4808
03:26:32,830 --> 03:26:34,710
far enough underwater that, you know,

4809
03:26:34,750 --> 03:26:35,870
you won't be able to live there.

4810
03:26:36,010 --> 03:26:37,770
We're talking about 90 or 100 feet underwater.

4811
03:26:40,570 --> 03:26:42,570
You're going to have islands being underwater.

4812
03:26:44,350 --> 03:26:46,290
Okay, and then they'll be recovered again.

4813
03:26:46,590 --> 03:26:48,270
And that ties right into

4814
03:26:50,590 --> 03:26:53,310
the polar magnetic aspect, which, you know,

4815
03:26:53,350 --> 03:26:54,810
unless you're living under a rock,

4816
03:26:55,070 --> 03:26:57,230
you don't know that there's a lot of weird stuff

4817
03:26:57,230 --> 03:27:00,110
going on with the magnetism in North Pole right now.

4818
03:27:00,170 --> 03:27:02,030
There's a lot of havoc going on with it.

4819
03:27:03,070 --> 03:27:05,410
What's going to really happen with that,

4820
03:27:05,530 --> 03:27:09,290
I don't have a major amount of specifics

4821
03:27:09,290 --> 03:27:10,310
that I could share publicly,

4822
03:27:11,190 --> 03:27:13,410
but there is going to be a polar shift.

4823
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:17,170
The Earth is going to shift from its axis right now

4824
03:27:17,170 --> 03:27:18,250
where it rotates, let's say,

4825
03:27:18,270 --> 03:27:21,990
the North and South Pole are actually like an axis, right?

4826
03:27:22,450 --> 03:27:24,330
That axis is going to change.

4827
03:27:25,850 --> 03:27:28,450
And the Earth is not going to be rotating

4828
03:27:28,450 --> 03:27:30,890
on the axis that it is right now.

4829
03:27:31,710 --> 03:27:33,490
It's going to be rotating, let's say,

4830
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:36,930
imagine a line going through the North and South Pole, right?

4831
03:27:37,570 --> 03:27:40,130
That's the axle and the Earth is the wheel.

4832
03:27:41,030 --> 03:27:42,930
Well, the axle is going to move.

4833
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:46,170
And the axle is going to be somewhere in the Middle East,

4834
03:27:46,950 --> 03:27:49,730
the North Pole, and it's going to shoot through,

4835
03:27:50,210 --> 03:27:52,010
come out the other side of the Pacific.

4836
03:27:53,730 --> 03:27:54,910
That would be your South Pole,

4837
03:27:55,030 --> 03:27:56,790
but it's not going to be the way,

4838
03:27:57,250 --> 03:27:58,910
it's kind of difficult to explain.

4839
03:27:59,410 --> 03:28:01,570
It's going to tumble and then it's going to come back.

4840
03:28:02,490 --> 03:28:04,710
But that's not for now, that's much later.

4841
03:28:06,150 --> 03:28:08,610
But you see, when you're talking about something

4842
03:28:08,610 --> 03:28:09,750
as large as the Earth,

4843
03:28:10,750 --> 03:28:14,090
these large things don't happen overnight.

4844
03:28:14,090 --> 03:28:18,470
Some do, but they're gradual warnings and gradual signs.

4845
03:28:20,030 --> 03:28:23,130
What you will see, let's see,

4846
03:28:26,190 --> 03:28:29,190
what you will see though is a rotational speed adjustment.

4847
03:28:30,510 --> 03:28:31,650
What does that mean?

4848
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:35,130
Think about something for a second.

4849
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:39,900
You know when you put clothing in the wash cycle,

4850
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:41,540
you get centrifugal force, right?

4851
03:28:41,620 --> 03:28:43,460
And it dries out your clothes, right?

4852
03:28:44,240 --> 03:28:44,560
Yeah.

4853
03:28:45,020 --> 03:28:47,580
And the faster it spins, the more water comes off,

4854
03:28:47,740 --> 03:28:51,260
the water goes to the outer parts,

4855
03:28:51,520 --> 03:28:53,760
and the slower it spins, the less it does, right?

4856
03:28:54,580 --> 03:28:54,960
Yeah.

4857
03:28:55,380 --> 03:28:56,700
Sea level is relative.

4858
03:28:57,460 --> 03:28:59,080
If you look at the Panama Canal,

4859
03:29:00,620 --> 03:29:02,640
look at which side is higher, right?

4860
03:29:03,560 --> 03:29:05,400
One side, one ocean is higher than the other,

4861
03:29:05,460 --> 03:29:07,240
that's because of the rotation of the Earth.

4862
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:10,040
Sea level is relative,

4863
03:29:10,320 --> 03:29:13,980
meaning that the relative sea level near the equator

4864
03:29:13,980 --> 03:29:17,000
is higher than the relative sea level near the poles

4865
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:18,900
because the rotational vectoring,

4866
03:29:19,560 --> 03:29:22,160
the rotational velocity is a little bit greater.

4867
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:25,180
Even though they all rotate at the same time,

4868
03:29:25,240 --> 03:29:28,940
there's more centrifugal force at the equator.

4869
03:29:29,720 --> 03:29:32,200
Now if the Earth speeds up,

4870
03:29:33,340 --> 03:29:37,360
the shorelines become larger, right?

4871
03:29:37,420 --> 03:29:38,820
The water seems to recede.

4872
03:29:39,800 --> 03:29:41,660
If the Earth slows down,

4873
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:45,140
that 40 to 70 feet peak of water

4874
03:29:45,780 --> 03:29:48,940
that's near the equator starts to lose its steam

4875
03:29:48,940 --> 03:29:51,040
and starts to settle back down

4876
03:29:51,040 --> 03:29:52,320
and you get your flooding, right?

4877
03:29:53,380 --> 03:29:53,680
Uh-huh.

4878
03:29:54,900 --> 03:29:57,700
Okay, so that's maybe a way to look at it.

4879
03:29:58,080 --> 03:30:00,840
So one thing to do is go do some research

4880
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:02,720
and see if the Earth is slowing down

4881
03:30:02,720 --> 03:30:03,960
or is the Earth speeding up?

4882
03:30:05,140 --> 03:30:06,020
The Earth's speeding up.

4883
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:07,760
It's slowing down.

4884
03:30:07,860 --> 03:30:10,300
Okay, so that means you're going to have water coming inland, right?

4885
03:30:11,100 --> 03:30:11,680
Uh-huh.

4886
03:30:12,060 --> 03:30:13,740
Because that rise

4887
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:18,480
near the equator is going to start less momentum working on it.

4888
03:30:18,540 --> 03:30:22,380
It's going to start to level out, okay?

4889
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:24,820
Now right now what's happening in the Nile

4890
03:30:24,820 --> 03:30:28,580
that's not reported is the farmers are having a really hard time

4891
03:30:28,580 --> 03:30:31,920
because they're getting effluent water, salt water,

4892
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:33,640
coming in up the Nile.

4893
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:35,120
Never happened before like this.

4894
03:30:36,360 --> 03:30:39,040
And it's coming down really deep into the Nile.

4895
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:41,440
We're talking about a lot of miles down into Egypt.

4896
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:44,480
Can't grow in salt water.

4897
03:30:45,620 --> 03:30:48,040
Or brackish the way that you can,

4898
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:49,280
but not the way they're farming.

4899
03:30:51,410 --> 03:30:52,870
And it's evident all over the world.

4900
03:30:54,810 --> 03:30:56,550
But remember, these things come...

4901
03:30:56,550 --> 03:30:57,570
Nature has a rhythm.

4902
03:30:58,130 --> 03:31:01,950
The nature of rhythm is the rhythm when you...

4903
03:31:01,950 --> 03:31:03,510
The higher the energy in nature,

4904
03:31:03,650 --> 03:31:06,870
you end up oscillating in four-fifths time like a waltz.

4905
03:31:08,780 --> 03:31:11,100
The slower oscillations, the larger ones,

4906
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:11,960
are one to three.

4907
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:13,680
I mean, yeah, one to three.

4908
03:31:14,100 --> 03:31:15,420
You have four parts.

4909
03:31:15,420 --> 03:31:19,300
So you have one part in and three parts out.

4910
03:31:19,480 --> 03:31:20,960
One part in, three parts out.

4911
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:24,800
So you'll have one part slowing down,

4912
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:26,140
three parts speeding up.

4913
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:29,780
One part slowing down, three parts slowing up in four-fifths time.

4914
03:31:31,870 --> 03:31:32,910
Like a waltz.

4915
03:31:37,610 --> 03:31:40,150
And I'm just telling you this information without any background,

4916
03:31:40,650 --> 03:31:44,970
but what I'll tell you is you will start seeing things becoming strange,

4917
03:31:45,030 --> 03:31:46,830
but I can't put dates on them.

4918
03:31:49,410 --> 03:31:52,510
What I can see, if we're having the same conversation,

4919
03:31:52,670 --> 03:31:53,990
let's say, ten years from now,

4920
03:31:54,130 --> 03:31:57,890
I'll be able to give you more specific time periods.

4921
03:31:58,670 --> 03:32:01,130
Because this is how prophecy works, okay?

4922
03:32:01,990 --> 03:32:04,490
If it's a thousand miles from me to you,

4923
03:32:06,210 --> 03:32:09,610
all right, so I get in a motorized wagon.

4924
03:32:09,770 --> 03:32:12,330
It's not an automobile because I have to put gasoline in it.

4925
03:32:12,430 --> 03:32:15,210
If it was an automobile, it would just go on itself, right?

4926
03:32:15,950 --> 03:32:16,810
So I have a motorized wagon.

4927
03:32:17,250 --> 03:32:19,970
And I get in it, and I set the odometer at zero,

4928
03:32:20,150 --> 03:32:21,330
and I hit the gas, and I go.

4929
03:32:22,270 --> 03:32:24,090
Now, if you're a thousand miles away,

4930
03:32:24,110 --> 03:32:28,590
when I get to the 500-mile mark on my odometer,

4931
03:32:28,690 --> 03:32:31,890
that means I'm halfway there, because 1,500, right?

4932
03:32:31,950 --> 03:32:32,730
That's two, that's halfway.

4933
03:32:33,750 --> 03:32:35,150
Okay, that's all well and good,

4934
03:32:35,290 --> 03:32:39,710
but as soon as my odometer hits 500 miles,

4935
03:32:39,870 --> 03:32:41,870
and I look over to the side of the road,

4936
03:32:42,350 --> 03:32:43,510
and I see a sign,

4937
03:32:43,510 --> 03:32:48,290
500 miles ago to your house, like a landmark, right?

4938
03:32:49,030 --> 03:32:49,310
Okay.

4939
03:32:49,410 --> 03:32:51,770
I know I'm accurate, right?

4940
03:32:53,210 --> 03:32:56,790
Right now, we have certain landmarks that are taking place

4941
03:32:57,970 --> 03:33:01,710
for a spiritual prophecy to take place.

4942
03:33:01,870 --> 03:33:04,650
And those things, when you find those landmarks,

4943
03:33:04,670 --> 03:33:06,670
and you go back and reckon it with what's written,

4944
03:33:07,030 --> 03:33:11,690
it is so precise that it'll raise the hairs off the back of your head.

4945
03:33:12,450 --> 03:33:15,950
But if you start trying to put days, and years, and dates

4946
03:33:15,950 --> 03:33:18,690
on stuff that you don't have a landmark yet,

4947
03:33:18,790 --> 03:33:21,010
which usually gives you...

4948
03:33:21,010 --> 03:33:23,990
He gives you a 2,000-year landmark gap,

4949
03:33:24,050 --> 03:33:28,530
he gives you a 100-year, he gives you a 7-year, 14-year, 28-year,

4950
03:33:29,690 --> 03:33:34,800
he breaks it down to months, weeks, okay?

4951
03:33:36,500 --> 03:33:39,860
I've gotten the landmarks correct on several prophecies,

4952
03:33:39,900 --> 03:33:41,180
and they are so precise,

4953
03:33:42,000 --> 03:33:44,240
I mean, you could set the news to it.

4954
03:33:46,350 --> 03:33:46,710
You know what I mean?

4955
03:33:46,910 --> 03:33:50,550
Instead of setting your watch, you could turn on the news,

4956
03:33:50,710 --> 03:33:53,710
and, you know, my wife and I, we turn on the news sometimes,

4957
03:33:53,790 --> 03:33:55,150
we hear stuff that shocks people, and we're like,

4958
03:33:55,190 --> 03:33:57,290
oh, we knew that was coming, very specifically.

4959
03:33:59,230 --> 03:34:00,750
We're not psychic or anything.

4960
03:34:01,570 --> 03:34:04,370
We have psychic abilities, but we don't use them for that.

4961
03:34:05,330 --> 03:34:08,910
He tells you he's going to turn off all the psychics in the end,

4962
03:34:09,150 --> 03:34:11,590
they're going to be talking with a jabbering lip.

4963
03:34:12,390 --> 03:34:12,830
Nonsense.

4964
03:34:14,550 --> 03:34:19,690
And from what information I've been getting from the intelligence community,

4965
03:34:20,370 --> 03:34:22,570
that seems to be true since 2005.

4966
03:34:22,710 --> 03:34:23,430
It's lights out.

4967
03:34:27,290 --> 03:34:29,270
So I'm talking about these big...

4968
03:34:29,270 --> 03:34:31,990
I'm not talking about, you know, what you're going to have for lunch tomorrow.

4969
03:34:32,070 --> 03:34:34,970
I'm talking about these large, major events, earth-changing events.

4970
03:34:35,870 --> 03:34:38,670
Well, you remember when they had that big tsunami,

4971
03:34:39,450 --> 03:34:41,310
and they came on there and said that

4972
03:34:41,310 --> 03:34:47,610
that day was incrementally shorter than it would have otherwise been.

4973
03:34:48,150 --> 03:34:52,370
So that would indicate even enough to have to adjust the atomic clock to it.

4974
03:34:53,550 --> 03:34:55,030
Yeah, atomic clocks are a joke.

4975
03:34:55,130 --> 03:34:56,770
You take them on an airplane, they don't work.

4976
03:34:56,810 --> 03:34:58,730
If you set them at sea level, and vice versa.

4977
03:34:59,550 --> 03:35:02,910
Yeah. Well, anyway, incrementally shorter would mean that

4978
03:35:02,910 --> 03:35:05,990
there was a speeding up from just a wave rolling.

4979
03:35:06,790 --> 03:35:09,250
Slowing down, and the earth expanded a little bit.

4980
03:35:10,490 --> 03:35:11,610
Think of a skater.

4981
03:35:11,890 --> 03:35:15,310
When she wants to spin faster, she brings her arms in over her head.

4982
03:35:18,290 --> 03:35:19,290
Uh-huh. Yeah.

4983
03:35:19,670 --> 03:35:23,410
If the day's getting shorter, the earth is a little larger, or it's slowing down.

4984
03:35:24,950 --> 03:35:28,210
I'll tell you this, though, if you want to hear little pieces of prophecy,

4985
03:35:28,350 --> 03:35:30,250
I could give you very specific things.

4986
03:35:31,590 --> 03:35:33,290
I can't tell you when it's going to happen,

4987
03:35:33,310 --> 03:35:35,770
but I could tell you very specifically what's going to happen.

4988
03:35:36,370 --> 03:35:38,850
One thing, since we're on the global situation.

4989
03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:42,790
You know how you reckon 24-hour days with your clock?

4990
03:35:44,330 --> 03:35:44,550
Yeah.

4991
03:35:45,110 --> 03:35:48,370
Well, you're going to be reckoning 18-hour days with your clock.

4992
03:35:48,450 --> 03:35:54,510
In other words, you're going to get a one-third acceleration on the earth.

4993
03:35:56,470 --> 03:35:59,710
Instead of having 18 hours to go around its axis with your clock,

4994
03:36:00,010 --> 03:36:04,230
24 hours, it's going to go around in 18 hours.

4995
03:36:04,290 --> 03:36:06,130
That's going to freak some people out, don't you think?

4996
03:36:07,570 --> 03:36:11,730
And that's due to the expansion of the earth or speeding up?

4997
03:36:12,710 --> 03:36:16,790
Oh, it's going to speed up by 30% for a short while.

4998
03:36:17,490 --> 03:36:18,610
Yeah, it's going to wreak havoc.

4999
03:36:18,790 --> 03:36:22,230
I mean, no one's going to work that day.

5000
03:36:27,410 --> 03:36:31,270
That in itself right there would, in my mind, that in itself right there

5001
03:36:31,270 --> 03:36:34,030
would shut down the electromagnetic field as we're operating with it.

5002
03:36:35,730 --> 03:36:37,890
You're going to have problems with that before that.

5003
03:36:39,790 --> 03:36:41,030
Little hints here and there.

5004
03:36:41,330 --> 03:36:43,130
This is what I mean.

5005
03:36:43,210 --> 03:36:45,470
You know how earlier I said this new kingdom's coming on?

5006
03:36:45,510 --> 03:36:48,950
It's going to come in under the radar and everyone's going to accept it?

5007
03:36:50,350 --> 03:36:50,710
Right.

5008
03:36:51,610 --> 03:36:56,030
Do you know that if I got the newspaper today and made, let's say,

5009
03:36:56,090 --> 03:36:59,970
a tape of all the news for, let's say, the past year and assimilated it

5010
03:36:59,970 --> 03:37:04,870
and went back about 40 to 50 years and showed it to the people back then,

5011
03:37:04,890 --> 03:37:06,390
they'd be pulling the hair out of their head?

5012
03:37:07,890 --> 03:37:08,110
Yeah.

5013
03:37:09,650 --> 03:37:11,710
Do you see what I'm showing as a reference?

5014
03:37:13,630 --> 03:37:16,050
But the thing right now, see, entropy is increasing.

5015
03:37:16,210 --> 03:37:17,830
Entropy is the decay cycle.

5016
03:37:18,550 --> 03:37:19,970
And you've really got five seasons.

5017
03:37:20,110 --> 03:37:23,330
You don't have just four seasons, but your fifth season could last a week,

5018
03:37:23,390 --> 03:37:24,210
two weeks, a month.

5019
03:37:24,310 --> 03:37:25,630
It's called the rotting season.

5020
03:37:27,250 --> 03:37:29,330
And folks on a farm are familiar with it.

5021
03:37:29,430 --> 03:37:33,090
And even if you don't live on a farm, you'll notice at certain times of the year

5022
03:37:33,090 --> 03:37:35,930
that your milk goes bad faster than other times of the year.

5023
03:37:35,930 --> 03:37:38,190
And it has nothing to do with the temperature of your fridge.

5024
03:37:39,930 --> 03:37:43,130
That's the time of year where in Norway, people go out and when it rains,

5025
03:37:43,270 --> 03:37:45,590
they see these little white worms that fall on the ground.

5026
03:37:46,430 --> 03:37:49,110
And when the sunlight comes out, they dissolve into a liquid.

5027
03:37:49,970 --> 03:37:53,690
And they don't know what kind of DNA or they don't know what these things eat

5028
03:37:53,690 --> 03:37:56,930
or drink or how they reproduce, they know nothing about them.

5029
03:37:56,950 --> 03:37:58,370
And the scientists are telling the people,

5030
03:37:58,430 --> 03:38:01,410
oh, the wind picked that up from the ocean and dumped it over.

5031
03:38:01,490 --> 03:38:03,950
You know it didn't. Those are little critters living in the sky.

5032
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:10,380
Space is like an ocean.

5033
03:38:11,880 --> 03:38:14,720
When I mean space, I mean, once you...

5034
03:38:14,720 --> 03:38:19,900
For me, when I study and you read scripture and you do science, let's say,

5035
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:21,900
real science, that's the stuff they're teaching.

5036
03:38:23,660 --> 03:38:27,820
Space starts four to five inches above the earth, the terrasphere.

5037
03:38:27,940 --> 03:38:29,580
You got the atmosphere and the terrasphere.

5038
03:38:30,300 --> 03:38:32,780
There's a layer between the terrasphere and the atmosphere

5039
03:38:32,780 --> 03:38:35,500
that's anywhere between a few inches thick to a foot thick.

5040
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:38,320
I don't want to get into all that stuff, but...

5041
03:38:39,480 --> 03:38:41,640
That's where space begins and you go out from there

5042
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:43,120
and you go out as far as you want to go.

5043
03:38:44,980 --> 03:38:46,000
And it's just like the ocean.

5044
03:38:46,180 --> 03:38:48,560
You know, if you're in shallow water in the ocean,

5045
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:52,060
you go to the real deep ocean, it's like being in another universe.

5046
03:38:52,540 --> 03:38:53,760
But you're still in the ocean.

5047
03:38:57,510 --> 03:38:59,190
Anybody ever stop and think that...

5048
03:38:59,190 --> 03:39:04,610
You ever watch that Space Shuttle STS tether video

5049
03:39:04,610 --> 03:39:07,590
when they, about 15, 20 years ago,

5050
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:09,670
when they're putting out that 11 mile long tether

5051
03:39:10,090 --> 03:39:13,750
and it got zapped because of all the electricity

5052
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:16,970
and shorted it out, but these huge disks several miles wide

5053
03:39:16,970 --> 03:39:19,250
showed up all over the place?

5054
03:39:19,730 --> 03:39:20,270
Yeah, I saw that.

5055
03:39:21,070 --> 03:39:22,550
Yeah, okay. You know, everybody said,

5056
03:39:22,610 --> 03:39:24,330
oh, those are UFOs, motherships.

5057
03:39:24,430 --> 03:39:26,630
You ever stop and think that space is like an ocean?

5058
03:39:31,740 --> 03:39:34,120
If you went down... Imagine the people that first saw

5059
03:39:34,120 --> 03:39:35,940
some of these deep sea creatures down there.

5060
03:39:35,980 --> 03:39:37,400
You think they were calling them UFOs?

5061
03:39:37,720 --> 03:39:38,460
Yeah, I'm sure.

5062
03:39:39,960 --> 03:39:41,760
Okay, so you...

5063
03:39:42,240 --> 03:39:44,920
You can see huge living creatures in space.

5064
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:47,360
I'm going with that.

5065
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:51,840
Yeah, and it's not like what you ever see...

5066
03:39:51,840 --> 03:39:54,400
And there's many levels of it, like a shark in the water.

5067
03:39:54,500 --> 03:39:55,920
You ever see how a shark is swimming

5068
03:39:55,920 --> 03:39:57,720
and he's got little fish following him?

5069
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:00,280
Yeah.

5070
03:40:00,640 --> 03:40:02,140
And some of them, you know, he lets them,

5071
03:40:02,260 --> 03:40:04,280
they go into his mouth and they clean up his mouth

5072
03:40:04,280 --> 03:40:06,440
and he doesn't eat them, you know, he kind of lets them go, you know.

5073
03:40:08,440 --> 03:40:11,880
And, you know, sharks get a really bad rap on land, you know.

5074
03:40:12,100 --> 03:40:14,300
Everybody's been taught that sharks are...

5075
03:40:14,520 --> 03:40:17,500
You know, if you know what you're doing with a shark,

5076
03:40:17,580 --> 03:40:18,560
you could put him to sleep.

5077
03:40:19,860 --> 03:40:21,200
And I'm not talking about violently,

5078
03:40:21,400 --> 03:40:23,680
I'm just talking about just touching the right part of his body.

5079
03:40:25,880 --> 03:40:28,600
They paint a really bad picture, a picture of these animals.

5080
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:32,120
So what I'm saying is what's going on out there

5081
03:40:32,120 --> 03:40:33,340
ain't what we're being told.

5082
03:40:35,670 --> 03:40:37,570
Well, actually, they're pretty immune on the subject.

5083
03:40:38,150 --> 03:40:41,230
Have you ever seen an academic subject on life in space?

5084
03:40:42,370 --> 03:40:45,030
The multiple varieties of life in space?

5085
03:40:45,290 --> 03:40:46,070
I haven't.

5086
03:40:46,570 --> 03:40:50,430
If you even start bringing up anything like that, it's ridiculous.

5087
03:40:50,710 --> 03:40:53,310
You know, then it's like you're going to be laughed at it, you know.

5088
03:40:54,410 --> 03:40:54,850
Okay.

5089
03:40:56,610 --> 03:40:58,970
You know, look at how they date dinosaurs.

5090
03:40:59,210 --> 03:40:59,830
I'm serious.

5091
03:40:59,950 --> 03:41:02,830
I want to maybe get my computer and pull something up.

5092
03:41:03,170 --> 03:41:06,170
When they find dinosaur bones, you know, they don't date the bones,

5093
03:41:06,310 --> 03:41:08,970
they date the rocks that the bones are in.

5094
03:41:12,140 --> 03:41:12,500
Okay.

5095
03:41:12,500 --> 03:41:15,100
If you do some research on dating of dinosaur bones,

5096
03:41:15,640 --> 03:41:19,060
you will see that they have a particular science

5097
03:41:19,060 --> 03:41:22,900
that dates the rocks, not the bones.

5098
03:41:23,740 --> 03:41:25,720
So if you fell in a ditch and died,

5099
03:41:26,740 --> 03:41:30,160
and we pulled you out, let's say 20 years later,

5100
03:41:30,780 --> 03:41:32,000
and we dated those rocks,

5101
03:41:32,080 --> 03:41:34,440
we'd say this is a 4 million year old man, isn't it?

5102
03:41:35,820 --> 03:41:35,920
Right.

5103
03:41:38,340 --> 03:41:42,720
And were you listening to when I showed you guys how,

5104
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:45,000
do you remember the virus, you know, how you go to Wikipedia

5105
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,980
and look and see how they're describing the virus?

5106
03:41:48,080 --> 03:41:50,320
They really don't know, but they do know that it's a poison?

5107
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:52,100
Yeah, I caught that.

5108
03:41:53,580 --> 03:41:55,520
Yeah, go use that same frame of mind,

5109
03:41:55,600 --> 03:41:57,980
what they do know about all these creatures on Earth,

5110
03:41:58,180 --> 03:42:00,080
living, dead, past, present, or whatever,

5111
03:42:00,340 --> 03:42:01,920
and read it with that frame of mind,

5112
03:42:01,980 --> 03:42:03,400
and you'll see how little they really know.

5113
03:42:03,500 --> 03:42:05,620
What they're telling you is what they want you to believe.

5114
03:42:08,940 --> 03:42:09,900
They do know.

5115
03:42:10,380 --> 03:42:11,540
They know what's going on.

5116
03:42:14,020 --> 03:42:15,620
Look, one thing I've explained,

5117
03:42:15,620 --> 03:42:18,320
a lot of people come to me and talk to me about,

5118
03:42:18,440 --> 03:42:19,980
what about this, what about this,

5119
03:42:20,100 --> 03:42:22,180
this project here, secret project,

5120
03:42:22,320 --> 03:42:24,100
I'm like, look, this third dimension,

5121
03:42:24,240 --> 03:42:25,840
this dimension is fleshy dimension,

5122
03:42:26,020 --> 03:42:27,680
you know, when you walk into a wall, it hurts?

5123
03:42:28,820 --> 03:42:28,920
Right.

5124
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:32,220
Okay, you know, plywood is really strong,

5125
03:42:32,300 --> 03:42:35,440
and we use it because of the different layers

5126
03:42:35,440 --> 03:42:36,460
that are glued together,

5127
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:40,420
give it a multiple strength,

5128
03:42:40,500 --> 03:42:42,460
where you can't crack it across one grain

5129
03:42:42,460 --> 03:42:43,840
like you can a standard board.

5130
03:42:44,340 --> 03:42:45,980
So we make plywood,

5131
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:49,080
so it's strong in every direction.

5132
03:42:50,240 --> 03:42:53,040
You ever come to think that this physical reality

5133
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:55,140
is like plywood held together with glue?

5134
03:42:55,380 --> 03:42:57,880
What happens to plywood when you take the glue out?

5135
03:42:57,960 --> 03:42:59,900
You got little thin pieces of wood, right,

5136
03:42:59,940 --> 03:43:01,240
but not very strong at all.

5137
03:43:03,380 --> 03:43:03,620
Right.

5138
03:43:05,800 --> 03:43:06,240
Okay.

5139
03:43:08,480 --> 03:43:11,600
So the thing is, if you want to see what's going on

5140
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:13,020
with this physical reality,

5141
03:43:13,600 --> 03:43:16,300
instead of knocking your head against a hard piece of plywood,

5142
03:43:16,300 --> 03:43:18,660
why don't we start looking at what's holding it together,

5143
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:20,760
what kind of glue, you see?

5144
03:43:21,140 --> 03:43:24,120
And maybe if we just peel back

5145
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:26,280
or find a way to release some of the glues

5146
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:27,680
certain periods of time,

5147
03:43:28,860 --> 03:43:33,240
we'll be able to find out what this free energy thing

5148
03:43:33,240 --> 03:43:34,760
that people keep talking about,

5149
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:36,820
because nothing's for free, it's coming from somewhere.

5150
03:43:37,660 --> 03:43:39,880
I always wondered if free, F-R-E-E,

5151
03:43:39,980 --> 03:43:42,860
is an acronym from revenue emanated elsewhere.

5152
03:43:46,320 --> 03:43:47,940
Yeah, that's a good one.

5153
03:43:48,020 --> 03:43:51,060
You see, you know, is it? Of course it is.

5154
03:43:51,240 --> 03:43:52,220
Where are you getting it from?

5155
03:43:52,740 --> 03:43:55,100
You know, and they got everybody sort of zero point.

5156
03:43:55,400 --> 03:43:56,620
There's no such thing as zero.

5157
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:02,700
So they're sending you down what they used to call

5158
03:44:02,700 --> 03:44:03,680
the primrose path.

5159
03:44:03,820 --> 03:44:05,880
I don't know if people are old enough to remember the,

5160
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:07,920
you know, you don't want to go down the primrose path.

5161
03:44:10,770 --> 03:44:11,970
It's right in front of you.

5162
03:44:13,750 --> 03:44:14,110
So...

5163
03:44:15,150 --> 03:44:16,070
Yeah, go ahead.

5164
03:44:16,070 --> 03:44:20,670
If you can see, and I can see,

5165
03:44:21,750 --> 03:44:24,910
living entities like that in space,

5166
03:44:25,010 --> 03:44:26,810
can you see them with an intelligence?

5167
03:44:27,490 --> 03:44:28,950
I'm not saying we're real smart,

5168
03:44:29,090 --> 03:44:30,930
but at the level at least that we're at

5169
03:44:30,930 --> 03:44:33,390
or maybe even above or...

5170
03:44:33,390 --> 03:44:37,110
Different, just like you'd have to reckon that intelligence

5171
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:39,190
using a reference point.

5172
03:44:39,290 --> 03:44:42,650
And the only reference point I would use

5173
03:44:42,650 --> 03:44:45,490
is the balance that I spoke of earlier

5174
03:44:45,490 --> 03:44:49,690
between the properties of life and death.

5175
03:44:51,110 --> 03:44:54,950
Are they part of a...

5176
03:44:55,650 --> 03:44:58,550
In other words, how well are they adapted?

5177
03:44:58,710 --> 03:45:00,730
On which end of the natural cycle are they?

5178
03:45:00,790 --> 03:45:01,790
Are they a cleanup crew?

5179
03:45:03,150 --> 03:45:07,770
Are they like a snake's fang or a bee's stinger?

5180
03:45:08,290 --> 03:45:10,370
Or are they a sprout coming out of the ground

5181
03:45:10,370 --> 03:45:12,290
or a fish going through the water, you see?

5182
03:45:12,370 --> 03:45:14,130
Or are they a shark? I don't know.

5183
03:45:14,130 --> 03:45:15,930
I don't see them...

5184
03:45:15,930 --> 03:45:18,030
I've never thought of it that way.

5185
03:45:18,850 --> 03:45:20,770
I don't know how to reckon it.

5186
03:45:21,390 --> 03:45:22,290
I just know they are.

5187
03:45:24,070 --> 03:45:25,030
It's pretty...

5188
03:45:25,030 --> 03:45:26,510
Well, I shouldn't say it's pretty obvious.

5189
03:45:26,610 --> 03:45:28,110
That's not a good thing to say.

5190
03:45:30,010 --> 03:45:31,870
But they're out there.

5191
03:45:34,310 --> 03:45:37,290
Well, back on Earth, there's stuff going on here

5192
03:45:37,290 --> 03:45:40,370
that we need to suss out.

5193
03:45:40,470 --> 03:45:43,950
And again, your law, one thing comes from your deity.

5194
03:45:44,910 --> 03:45:46,630
And if you pick one, you pick well.

5195
03:45:46,730 --> 03:45:48,590
I'm going to read you something out of...

5196
03:45:48,590 --> 03:45:50,130
If anybody's got a Bible,

5197
03:45:50,910 --> 03:45:53,570
you know, you ever wonder why they have people swear on the Bible

5198
03:45:53,570 --> 03:45:59,330
when the Bible tells you you're not supposed to swear on it, by the way?

5199
03:45:59,810 --> 03:46:01,450
You know, why do you think they know?

5200
03:46:01,730 --> 03:46:03,670
Well, not the ones telling you to do it,

5201
03:46:03,710 --> 03:46:06,210
but that was set up to show who knows and who doesn't.

5202
03:46:07,490 --> 03:46:09,170
You're not supposed to swear on anything.

5203
03:46:11,090 --> 03:46:13,550
So, and they do stick in there, I affirm,

5204
03:46:13,630 --> 03:46:14,650
if you don't want to say swear.

5205
03:46:14,650 --> 03:46:16,470
But if you go to the book of Joshua,

5206
03:46:19,090 --> 03:46:20,050
chapter 24,

5207
03:46:21,530 --> 03:46:23,350
if you go to verse 14,

5208
03:46:24,150 --> 03:46:27,130
I'm going to read this out of a Scriptures translation I have,

5209
03:46:27,190 --> 03:46:30,710
which tries to stick to the original text,

5210
03:46:30,810 --> 03:46:33,130
but it's not really... It does a pretty good job.

5211
03:46:33,410 --> 03:46:37,510
But if you read the book of Joshua, verse 24,

5212
03:46:37,970 --> 03:46:40,190
I mean, chapter 24, verse 14,

5213
03:46:40,950 --> 03:46:42,790
the setting there is

5214
03:46:43,550 --> 03:46:45,630
they're ready to go into Canaan

5215
03:46:47,370 --> 03:46:49,110
and sell the land.

5216
03:46:49,690 --> 03:46:51,010
And this is what he tells the people.

5217
03:46:51,750 --> 03:46:56,430
And now, fear Yahweh, serve Him in perfection and in truth,

5218
03:46:56,690 --> 03:46:58,470
and put away the mighty ones

5219
03:46:59,310 --> 03:47:02,910
which your fathers served beyond the river and in Mitzrayim,

5220
03:47:03,290 --> 03:47:04,270
and serve Yahweh.

5221
03:47:04,970 --> 03:47:07,790
And if it seems evil in your eyes to serve Yahweh,

5222
03:47:08,450 --> 03:47:12,090
choose for yourselves this day whom you are going to serve.

5223
03:47:12,090 --> 03:47:16,010
Whether the mighty ones which your fathers served

5224
03:47:16,010 --> 03:47:18,310
that were beyond the river, he's talking about the Nile,

5225
03:47:19,210 --> 03:47:21,330
or the mighty ones of the Amorites,

5226
03:47:22,250 --> 03:47:23,410
right, it's north of them,

5227
03:47:23,590 --> 03:47:26,570
and in whose land you're going to dwell.

5228
03:47:27,170 --> 03:47:28,230
But here's the kicker.

5229
03:47:28,690 --> 03:47:31,250
But I and my house will serve Yahweh.

5230
03:47:31,890 --> 03:47:35,750
So he's basically, he's not condemning or judging.

5231
03:47:35,890 --> 03:47:37,630
He says, you've got to serve someone.

5232
03:47:38,210 --> 03:47:41,970
You're either going to serve these deities

5233
03:47:42,090 --> 03:47:44,010
or you're going to serve this deity.

5234
03:47:44,710 --> 03:47:47,670
But you've got to choose, you see.

5235
03:47:48,050 --> 03:47:50,670
So someone said earlier, even when you're not making a choice,

5236
03:47:50,750 --> 03:47:52,290
you're making a choice, and it's harsh.

5237
03:47:52,790 --> 03:47:57,090
And one thing you will learn about serving these minor deities

5238
03:47:57,090 --> 03:47:59,250
and the deities that man is acting as,

5239
03:47:59,310 --> 03:48:04,150
is you will find extreme cruelty in those systems.

5240
03:48:05,470 --> 03:48:06,550
That's the difference.

5241
03:48:07,670 --> 03:48:09,310
And you could look it up in scripture,

5242
03:48:09,310 --> 03:48:12,490
and you could look it up in secular history.

5243
03:48:13,010 --> 03:48:16,630
Go look up the Baals, do research on the Baals,

5244
03:48:16,730 --> 03:48:19,010
the lords of the Phoenicians.

5245
03:48:20,150 --> 03:48:21,730
Every historian will say,

5246
03:48:22,070 --> 03:48:25,210
these were some very, very cruel rituals,

5247
03:48:26,690 --> 03:48:28,610
cruelty beyond belief,

5248
03:48:29,970 --> 03:48:32,410
based on what we consider cruel today.

5249
03:48:34,630 --> 03:48:37,650
The Baal, by the way, is lord,

5250
03:48:38,150 --> 03:48:39,290
translated to English.

5251
03:48:39,950 --> 03:48:41,710
And if you read in the book of Jeremiah,

5252
03:48:42,290 --> 03:48:45,590
he's going to tell you, they will replace my name with Baal.

5253
03:48:46,630 --> 03:48:49,390
Well, what's lord translated to Hebrew?

5254
03:48:49,590 --> 03:48:49,850
Baal.

5255
03:48:49,950 --> 03:48:51,450
What's Baal translated to English?

5256
03:48:51,610 --> 03:48:51,850
Lord.

5257
03:48:54,030 --> 03:48:54,750
Well, well.

5258
03:48:55,010 --> 03:48:56,450
Isn't that prophecy nice?

5259
03:48:59,940 --> 03:49:02,500
So, you know, when someone starts reading scriptures,

5260
03:49:02,680 --> 03:49:04,720
they say, I don't believe they're using Lord for his name.

5261
03:49:04,780 --> 03:49:06,580
I said, wait a second, don't get upset at them.

5262
03:49:06,600 --> 03:49:07,400
You ain't going to change them.

5263
03:49:07,860 --> 03:49:09,300
Look here, come over here in Jeremiah.

5264
03:49:09,400 --> 03:49:10,180
Let me show you something.

5265
03:49:10,260 --> 03:49:11,300
And he reads it, and he says,

5266
03:49:11,860 --> 03:49:15,020
they're going to change my name for Baal or Lord.

5267
03:49:15,280 --> 03:49:16,100
What's Baal Lord?

5268
03:49:16,220 --> 03:49:17,400
I say, oh, there's your prophecy.

5269
03:49:17,640 --> 03:49:19,500
You know, that was done a long time ago.

5270
03:49:22,440 --> 03:49:24,300
You ain't changing nobody, son.

5271
03:49:27,750 --> 03:49:28,490
Now, Baal,

5272
03:49:29,330 --> 03:49:30,750
okay, Lord in English,

5273
03:49:31,310 --> 03:49:32,210
you got two choices.

5274
03:49:33,010 --> 03:49:35,250
It's either an English title of nobility.

5275
03:49:36,410 --> 03:49:37,030
That's it.

5276
03:49:37,170 --> 03:49:37,290
Okay?

5277
03:49:37,850 --> 03:49:40,010
Or it's an ancient Hebrew demon.

5278
03:49:42,120 --> 03:49:43,800
I didn't say this is multiple choice,

5279
03:49:43,840 --> 03:49:44,760
and you got two choices.

5280
03:49:44,760 --> 03:49:46,540
Don't start, there's no third one there.

5281
03:49:46,940 --> 03:49:49,620
Now, you want to start making up your own fairy tales about it?

5282
03:49:49,680 --> 03:49:50,580
Go for it.

5283
03:49:51,860 --> 03:49:53,580
So every dictionary, every,

5284
03:49:54,460 --> 03:49:56,760
all your unabridged Bibles have that in,

5285
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:58,200
have it in your,

5286
03:49:58,640 --> 03:49:59,720
in your introduction.

5287
03:50:00,320 --> 03:50:02,020
Go get yourself an unabridged Bible,

5288
03:50:02,180 --> 03:50:03,060
and you've got anywhere,

5289
03:50:03,240 --> 03:50:05,980
they got introductions telling you why they printed it that way.

5290
03:50:06,040 --> 03:50:08,940
They tell you we're using God and Lord for publishing purposes.

5291
03:50:10,380 --> 03:50:11,240
What is in the,

5292
03:50:11,360 --> 03:50:12,360
what's a publisher?

5293
03:50:12,520 --> 03:50:13,360
It's a business, right?

5294
03:50:13,360 --> 03:50:15,080
What's a business for selling, right?

5295
03:50:17,430 --> 03:50:19,530
Have you ever heard of a light bulb factory

5296
03:50:19,530 --> 03:50:21,430
that made light bulbs that didn't burn out?

5297
03:50:23,210 --> 03:50:25,730
You know, you just make one and then close up shop.

5298
03:50:26,330 --> 03:50:28,910
If you start printing Bibles that started, you know,

5299
03:50:29,230 --> 03:50:31,150
putting words like, you know,

5300
03:50:31,170 --> 03:50:34,190
how they're supposed to be from the language of preservation,

5301
03:50:35,870 --> 03:50:38,590
you know, you can't go to church after you read that.

5302
03:50:41,080 --> 03:50:41,260
You know?

5303
03:50:43,800 --> 03:50:45,780
Scripture says you pray in,

5304
03:50:47,820 --> 03:50:50,200
you pray, there's an agenda here, by the way.

5305
03:50:50,600 --> 03:50:52,680
Scripture says pray in Matthew 6,

5306
03:50:52,780 --> 03:50:53,860
there is somewhere around there.

5307
03:50:54,600 --> 03:50:56,480
It says when you pray, you do it in private.

5308
03:50:56,760 --> 03:51:00,220
Don't do it in public like the hypocrites do

5309
03:51:00,220 --> 03:51:01,780
so they get attention from people.

5310
03:51:03,200 --> 03:51:04,260
And then he repeats it.

5311
03:51:04,540 --> 03:51:05,900
He says go to your private spot.

5312
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:06,440
That's it.

5313
03:51:07,240 --> 03:51:08,960
Okay, so if you go to King James,

5314
03:51:10,200 --> 03:51:11,240
you know what word they put there?

5315
03:51:11,240 --> 03:51:13,700
They said go to your closet, go pray.

5316
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:14,800
Now, wait a second.

5317
03:51:14,940 --> 03:51:16,640
Why did they choose the word closet

5318
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:19,620
when that word actually means storehouse or private room?

5319
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:22,600
Because nobody wants to go in a closet.

5320
03:51:22,720 --> 03:51:24,360
That's where they keep the skeletons, right?

5321
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:25,920
Skeletons in your closet, right?

5322
03:51:26,220 --> 03:51:26,620
Psychological.

5323
03:51:28,880 --> 03:51:30,580
Because if you go into your closet,

5324
03:51:30,660 --> 03:51:31,960
you're going to come out of your closet.

5325
03:51:32,100 --> 03:51:33,340
Whoa, that's not good either.

5326
03:51:33,540 --> 03:51:36,140
So, no, we don't want to pray in the closet,

5327
03:51:36,240 --> 03:51:37,720
so let's go down to that nice church.

5328
03:51:37,900 --> 03:51:39,120
Remember that really nice church?

5329
03:51:39,220 --> 03:51:39,440
Remember?

5330
03:51:40,300 --> 03:51:41,000
You see?

5331
03:51:41,240 --> 03:51:41,340
Uh-huh.

5332
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:41,560
You see?

5333
03:51:41,780 --> 03:51:42,720
They're using...

5334
03:51:42,720 --> 03:51:46,380
Okay, now, the Creator says,

5335
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:47,640
my covenant with you.

5336
03:51:48,160 --> 03:51:49,420
All right, so, you know,

5337
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:52,540
they're saying, well, that's done away with.

5338
03:51:53,080 --> 03:51:54,240
I'm under grace.

5339
03:51:55,380 --> 03:51:57,300
Okay, I wonder why.

5340
03:51:57,340 --> 03:51:58,860
I wonder why they keep saying that.

5341
03:51:58,920 --> 03:52:00,020
So you go to your...

5342
03:52:00,020 --> 03:52:01,920
find that word covenant in your strongs

5343
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:02,660
and look it up,

5344
03:52:02,980 --> 03:52:05,460
and it says the cutting of flesh, the cutting.

5345
03:52:06,080 --> 03:52:08,320
You're like, ooh, no, man, I don't want no covenant.

5346
03:52:08,320 --> 03:52:09,900
Get away from me with that covenant.

5347
03:52:11,480 --> 03:52:12,040
You see?

5348
03:52:14,200 --> 03:52:15,220
I don't mean to intervene here,

5349
03:52:15,400 --> 03:52:17,760
but the call might automatically try to end

5350
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:19,140
when it gets to four hours.

5351
03:52:19,320 --> 03:52:21,160
It's three hours and 52 minutes.

5352
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:23,160
Well, let's maybe just wrap it up.

5353
03:52:24,020 --> 03:52:26,000
I'd like to say, I didn't realize it was on this long.

5354
03:52:26,060 --> 03:52:28,180
It kind of feels like I'm sitting around a campfire now.

5355
03:52:29,460 --> 03:52:31,580
Well, I'm just saying that it'll cut off

5356
03:52:31,580 --> 03:52:33,540
and automatically end the call itself,

5357
03:52:33,700 --> 03:52:35,340
and I have no control over it.

5358
03:52:35,900 --> 03:52:38,300
Okay, but you see, there's a psychology being used

5359
03:52:38,320 --> 03:52:40,400
there, but if you actually look at the word covenant

5360
03:52:40,400 --> 03:52:42,300
in the Hebrew language of preservation,

5361
03:52:42,520 --> 03:52:45,040
it's berit, B-R-I-T,

5362
03:52:45,200 --> 03:52:46,880
and if you look at the wonderful thing

5363
03:52:46,880 --> 03:52:49,060
about that particular language is that

5364
03:52:49,060 --> 03:52:49,900
you don't need a dictionary.

5365
03:52:50,120 --> 03:52:51,220
Each letter means something.

5366
03:52:51,360 --> 03:52:54,920
So the letter B-R-I-T, which means covenant,

5367
03:52:55,460 --> 03:52:57,420
B means house, R means the head,

5368
03:52:58,280 --> 03:52:59,500
but actually there's no I.

5369
03:52:59,580 --> 03:53:01,220
There's just B-R-T, berit.

5370
03:53:01,800 --> 03:53:03,840
So B means the house, R means the head,

5371
03:53:03,860 --> 03:53:05,780
and the T means the sign or the seal.

5372
03:53:06,240 --> 03:53:08,040
So to go into covenant means you're getting

5373
03:53:08,320 --> 03:53:10,340
a sign or seal from the head of the house.

5374
03:53:11,060 --> 03:53:12,800
How do you get cutting on from that?

5375
03:53:13,980 --> 03:53:14,920
Cutting on yourself.

5376
03:53:15,080 --> 03:53:15,860
How do you get that?

5377
03:53:15,960 --> 03:53:18,140
Or cutting on, cutting open.

5378
03:53:18,240 --> 03:53:19,100
How do you get that?

5379
03:53:20,460 --> 03:53:20,700
You know?

5380
03:53:21,300 --> 03:53:22,360
Because it doesn't sound good.

5381
03:53:23,220 --> 03:53:25,500
So is that berit if covenant man?

5382
03:53:26,100 --> 03:53:27,820
That's kind of an urban myth.

5383
03:53:28,020 --> 03:53:32,340
You can say that because if you look around you,

5384
03:53:33,300 --> 03:53:36,220
but the British really was, in Old English,

5385
03:53:36,220 --> 03:53:38,980
was with a P, which was the pritim,

5386
03:53:39,140 --> 03:53:43,000
or the Greeks had named them the pritish,

5387
03:53:43,480 --> 03:53:44,220
or the pritim.

5388
03:53:44,940 --> 03:53:48,120
That's why pretty women are attractive.

5389
03:53:51,210 --> 03:53:51,790
They're pretty.

5390
03:53:54,170 --> 03:53:56,190
But yeah, I guess you can make that connection.

5391
03:53:56,310 --> 03:53:57,770
There's a lot of connections you can make.

5392
03:53:57,850 --> 03:53:58,290
Here you go.

5393
03:53:58,670 --> 03:54:00,290
I'll make one more connection before I go.

5394
03:54:01,710 --> 03:54:02,570
Oh, we go.

5395
03:54:03,350 --> 03:54:06,550
Okay, so earlier we were talking about fear and terror, right?

5396
03:54:07,690 --> 03:54:08,090
Yeah.

5397
03:54:08,610 --> 03:54:10,730
Do you want to make a connection to the British in that?

5398
03:54:13,010 --> 03:54:15,330
In scripture it says if you run from fear,

5399
03:54:16,590 --> 03:54:18,890
you're going to fall into the ditch or the pit,

5400
03:54:19,010 --> 03:54:21,170
and then when you come out of the pit or the ditch,

5401
03:54:21,950 --> 03:54:23,810
you're going to get caught in the snare, right?

5402
03:54:25,430 --> 03:54:25,830
Right.

5403
03:54:26,310 --> 03:54:27,330
Yeah, that's in Isaiah.

5404
03:54:27,550 --> 03:54:28,570
That's also in Jeremiah.

5405
03:54:29,230 --> 03:54:30,450
It's a very popular term.

5406
03:54:31,110 --> 03:54:31,750
You can look it up.

5407
03:54:32,110 --> 03:54:33,850
Run from fear, fall into the ditch,

5408
03:54:33,950 --> 03:54:36,450
come out of the ditch, get caught in the snare.

5409
03:54:37,010 --> 03:54:38,430
Now you know what a snare is.

5410
03:54:38,430 --> 03:54:40,190
Most people, if you don't know what a snare is,

5411
03:54:40,290 --> 03:54:43,830
it's a very cheap trap that catches an animal around the neck,

5412
03:54:44,110 --> 03:54:45,590
and it's ruthless.

5413
03:54:49,310 --> 03:54:50,770
So okay, look what's going on.

5414
03:54:50,830 --> 03:54:54,230
So right now you've got fear and terror going on,

5415
03:54:56,110 --> 03:54:57,230
and what's a ditch?

5416
03:54:57,270 --> 03:54:58,110
Isn't that a recess?

5417
03:54:58,330 --> 03:54:59,830
Isn't that a recess in the ground?

5418
03:55:01,370 --> 03:55:04,370
You dig a recess in the ground to flow water away, right?

5419
03:55:04,370 --> 03:55:09,010
Okay, so you've got a recession going on right now

5420
03:55:09,010 --> 03:55:10,950
from currency, water flow currency.

5421
03:55:11,350 --> 03:55:14,270
Now you come out of the recession, right,

5422
03:55:14,390 --> 03:55:15,870
and you get into a recovery.

5423
03:55:16,130 --> 03:55:18,750
You know, when a trapper sets a snare,

5424
03:55:18,850 --> 03:55:21,350
he comes back to recover his prey, doesn't he?

5425
03:55:21,350 --> 03:55:22,890
He's got to check on it every day, doesn't he?

5426
03:55:24,110 --> 03:55:24,390
Yeah.

5427
03:55:25,490 --> 03:55:26,510
Do you see what's going on?

5428
03:55:28,820 --> 03:55:29,220
Yeah.

5429
03:55:29,540 --> 03:55:31,500
He's talking about recession and recovery.

5430
03:55:34,220 --> 03:55:36,220
The ditch, the pit, and the snare?

5431
03:55:38,710 --> 03:55:39,770
I mean, there's so many levels.

5432
03:55:39,930 --> 03:55:41,450
If you want to play with words and scripture,

5433
03:55:41,590 --> 03:55:45,690
you could spend a lifetime with 100 people writing stuff up,

5434
03:55:45,710 --> 03:55:48,230
but that's not the way I look at it in my studies,

5435
03:55:48,310 --> 03:55:50,970
or I like to really impart information that way.

5436
03:55:51,050 --> 03:55:52,970
Even though it exists, you can see it.

5437
03:55:53,530 --> 03:55:55,310
Like, what is this recess, you know,

5438
03:55:55,370 --> 03:55:57,710
what is this pit and snare thing going on?

5439
03:55:58,950 --> 03:56:00,910
You know, but that's yet to come also.

5440
03:56:01,010 --> 03:56:02,050
There's many levels to it.

5441
03:56:02,050 --> 03:56:05,510
See, that's the wonderful thing about the divine.

5442
03:56:07,190 --> 03:56:10,450
The spiritual realm is your source.

5443
03:56:15,280 --> 03:56:17,240
You know, and that's why I came on Angela's call

5444
03:56:17,240 --> 03:56:21,120
and I told people, if you don't understand what birthdays,

5445
03:56:21,240 --> 03:56:25,000
cannibals, and dolls have in common or comprehend,

5446
03:56:25,300 --> 03:56:27,120
I don't want to use the word understand for that,

5447
03:56:27,640 --> 03:56:29,820
you won't comprehend what's going on around you.

5448
03:56:32,860 --> 03:56:34,860
And I'm not going to go over that now.

5449
03:56:34,860 --> 03:56:38,980
I know you go to that call somewhere back there in the past

5450
03:56:38,980 --> 03:56:43,300
and Angela's the Greek and forward.

5451
03:56:46,280 --> 03:56:52,840
Well, again, maybe we should say goodnight.

5452
03:56:53,580 --> 03:56:54,820
I sure hope you'll come back.

5453
03:56:56,380 --> 03:56:57,200
Yeah, it's been a pleasure.

5454
03:56:57,560 --> 03:56:59,620
I mean, I don't mind you keep talking,

5455
03:56:59,740 --> 03:57:01,260
I just don't know if talk show's going to kick it.

5456
03:57:01,280 --> 03:57:03,140
Last time we had a call go this long,

5457
03:57:03,140 --> 03:57:07,580
when I got up to four hours, they shut down the call themselves.

5458
03:57:08,920 --> 03:57:09,260
Okay.

5459
03:57:10,940 --> 03:57:14,840
Well, again, I read that last verse in Joshua.

5460
03:57:15,040 --> 03:57:19,940
Just to show you, it's also in all of your various,

5461
03:57:20,060 --> 03:57:21,400
what I call, holy writs.

5462
03:57:21,940 --> 03:57:23,480
They all say the same thing.

5463
03:57:23,720 --> 03:57:25,740
And the reason I've been studying the Bible

5464
03:57:25,740 --> 03:57:30,500
is because it has the most detail on time and law.

5465
03:57:31,460 --> 03:57:33,500
And there's a deep sense of irony

5466
03:57:34,420 --> 03:57:36,680
when you see the whole world is using it,

5467
03:57:36,720 --> 03:57:37,680
but no one's reading it.

5468
03:57:37,740 --> 03:57:39,480
They're using it like baseball bat.

5469
03:57:40,780 --> 03:57:43,220
That's why people say, you know, you're a Bible thumper,

5470
03:57:43,360 --> 03:57:45,600
if you start saying anything about the, you know, scripture.

5471
03:57:46,320 --> 03:57:49,180
But very often I tell people, be careful what you say,

5472
03:57:49,240 --> 03:57:52,680
because if you start saying things as absolutes,

5473
03:57:53,520 --> 03:57:56,120
you know, and they're not, you're going to get in trouble.

5474
03:57:56,120 --> 03:58:00,200
And, you know, you're going to either be laughed at by those who know,

5475
03:58:01,660 --> 03:58:04,080
or you're going to be misleading those who don't know.

5476
03:58:04,200 --> 03:58:06,160
And there's a lot of, there's more misleading

5477
03:58:06,160 --> 03:58:08,720
than being laughed at going on right now.

5478
03:58:10,400 --> 03:58:13,500
You know, and when I say laughed at is when you say something

5479
03:58:13,500 --> 03:58:17,240
and you actually negate what you just said in the same breath,

5480
03:58:17,380 --> 03:58:22,180
that's a laughing matter, you know.

5481
03:58:24,020 --> 03:58:25,700
So we have to be very careful.

5482
03:58:26,040 --> 03:58:29,500
So what, you know, I'll leave you off with a couple of more tidbits

5483
03:58:29,520 --> 03:58:30,520
and maybe I'll keep going.

5484
03:58:31,280 --> 03:58:33,040
One thing that's going on is,

5485
03:58:33,180 --> 03:58:37,440
you ever wonder when you pick up an English translation of the Bible

5486
03:58:37,440 --> 03:58:39,300
and you read from Genesis to Revelation,

5487
03:58:40,200 --> 03:58:42,760
you ever wonder if they have the books in the right order?

5488
03:58:46,060 --> 03:58:46,620
They're not.

5489
03:58:46,840 --> 03:58:48,420
Pretty sure they're not, right?

5490
03:58:48,660 --> 03:58:49,200
They're not.

5491
03:58:49,300 --> 03:58:51,840
And if you want to do some good study on that,

5492
03:58:52,340 --> 03:58:54,220
there's a fellow named Ernest Martin,

5493
03:58:55,020 --> 03:58:56,820
and it's spelled just like it sounds.

5494
03:58:58,300 --> 03:59:00,800
And he's put it together, he spent his whole life

5495
03:59:02,140 --> 03:59:04,640
using history and clues in the scripture

5496
03:59:04,640 --> 03:59:06,100
to put them in their correct order.

5497
03:59:07,720 --> 03:59:10,240
Now I read his stuff and he's right on the money.

5498
03:59:11,440 --> 03:59:13,900
Because I was able to confirm what he told me.

5499
03:59:15,140 --> 03:59:16,340
Just like the fellow, I said,

5500
03:59:16,400 --> 03:59:18,840
you know hot water freezes faster than cold water?

5501
03:59:18,960 --> 03:59:21,000
You know, I got a big guffaw and a laugh, you know.

5502
03:59:21,520 --> 03:59:22,860
I got laughed out of the room.

5503
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:24,920
A week later he calls me back and says,

5504
03:59:24,940 --> 03:59:25,940
I don't believe it's true.

5505
03:59:26,220 --> 03:59:28,080
I said, well, you're not supposed to believe it.

5506
03:59:28,100 --> 03:59:29,280
I'm glad you did the experiment.

5507
03:59:29,280 --> 03:59:34,210
So I went ahead and looked at his stuff,

5508
03:59:34,810 --> 03:59:37,330
and I just kept working on it.

5509
03:59:39,090 --> 03:59:42,210
And I took it and seeing what is this?

5510
03:59:42,530 --> 03:59:44,090
Ernest Martin did a lot of work

5511
03:59:44,090 --> 03:59:47,710
combining secular history of the order

5512
03:59:47,710 --> 03:59:50,730
and also the spiritual hints,

5513
03:59:50,890 --> 03:59:52,710
you know, the way that it was penned

5514
03:59:52,710 --> 03:59:54,930
by the prophets that were inspired to write it.

5515
03:59:55,570 --> 03:59:57,710
The prophets were basically secretaries.

5516
03:59:58,530 --> 03:59:59,970
And you know when you're reading Genesis,

5517
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:01,270
you've got to keep in mind,

5518
04:00:01,710 --> 04:00:03,070
that was penned by Moses

5519
04:00:03,710 --> 04:00:07,750
2,500 years almost after the fact of Adam.

5520
04:00:08,630 --> 04:00:09,370
That's a recap.

5521
04:00:09,790 --> 04:00:11,830
When you're reading Genesis 1, that's a recap.

5522
04:00:14,310 --> 04:00:16,450
You see, but spiritually,

5523
04:00:16,570 --> 04:00:18,110
what's going on in the spiritual world,

5524
04:00:18,190 --> 04:00:21,250
you're going to find out there's another higher order

5525
04:00:21,250 --> 04:00:23,050
that is established.

5526
04:00:24,610 --> 04:00:27,210
You see, because when,

5527
04:00:27,210 --> 04:00:30,110
you notice that they talk about the scrolls.

5528
04:00:30,370 --> 04:00:31,290
You got the scroll.

5529
04:00:31,750 --> 04:00:32,790
Okay, what is a scroll?

5530
04:00:33,350 --> 04:00:35,690
Well, if you look at it on the end,

5531
04:00:35,790 --> 04:00:37,850
it looks like an axle of a cart.

5532
04:00:38,090 --> 04:00:40,070
And when you unroll it, it's like a wheel.

5533
04:00:40,610 --> 04:00:41,730
You got the axle,

5534
04:00:42,650 --> 04:00:44,930
the axle and radial aspects of it.

5535
04:00:45,030 --> 04:00:47,950
So if we look at the hints in scripture,

5536
04:00:48,170 --> 04:00:49,530
it's taught as a scroll

5537
04:00:49,530 --> 04:00:51,630
that can be written on both sides.

5538
04:00:52,750 --> 04:00:55,370
And it's sweet in the mouth like honey,

5539
04:00:55,990 --> 04:00:57,510
but bitter in your stomach.

5540
04:00:57,730 --> 04:00:58,770
And there were several prophets

5541
04:00:58,770 --> 04:01:00,730
that were fed this particular scroll.

5542
04:01:01,450 --> 04:01:02,950
So what's being said there?

5543
04:01:05,360 --> 04:01:07,240
Well, to get to the short of it,

5544
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:11,180
if Christ said, I am the word,

5545
04:01:12,340 --> 04:01:15,040
and all the prophets say that he wrote all the scripture

5546
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:16,580
and gave it to us,

5547
04:01:19,870 --> 04:01:21,450
and I am the Alpha and the Omega,

5548
04:01:21,970 --> 04:01:23,450
I am the first and the last,

5549
04:01:23,770 --> 04:01:25,410
and then he gives all these parables

5550
04:01:25,410 --> 04:01:27,950
that the last will be first and the first will be last.

5551
04:01:28,030 --> 04:01:28,970
He keeps saying that.

5552
04:01:30,090 --> 04:01:31,810
And if you're one to take a hint,

5553
04:01:31,930 --> 04:01:33,410
you're going to say, but wait a second.

5554
04:01:34,370 --> 04:01:37,550
If the last is first and the first is last,

5555
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:39,550
let me go to the first book,

5556
04:01:40,490 --> 04:01:42,070
which they give us, Genesis.

5557
04:01:42,950 --> 04:01:45,530
Okay, that starts with the letter B,

5558
04:01:46,310 --> 04:01:48,070
because in Hebrew it's Ben-Ashid.

5559
04:01:50,270 --> 04:01:51,770
And if you go to the last book,

5560
04:01:52,610 --> 04:01:53,570
it's Apocalypse,

5561
04:01:53,950 --> 04:01:55,430
it starts with the letter A.

5562
04:01:56,350 --> 04:01:59,090
Because Apocalypse ain't got nothing to do

5563
04:01:59,090 --> 04:02:00,950
with doom and gloom and destruction,

5564
04:02:01,210 --> 04:02:02,430
like they tell you in English.

5565
04:02:02,910 --> 04:02:04,830
Apocalypse just means to reveal,

5566
04:02:06,110 --> 04:02:08,790
completely, no holding back.

5567
04:02:09,630 --> 04:02:11,370
So Apocalypse is A,

5568
04:02:12,190 --> 04:02:15,310
and he also says that it starts with the letter A,

5569
04:02:15,430 --> 04:02:16,330
but not only that,

5570
04:02:16,850 --> 04:02:19,790
it's written by the Father given to the Son.

5571
04:02:20,590 --> 04:02:22,270
The other one's all written by the Son.

5572
04:02:22,410 --> 04:02:24,310
Wait a second, this could possibly be

5573
04:02:24,310 --> 04:02:26,310
the first book in the spiritual realm.

5574
04:02:28,200 --> 04:02:31,340
And the first is last and the last is first.

5575
04:02:31,600 --> 04:02:34,120
Hmm, some interesting stuff going on here.

5576
04:02:34,520 --> 04:02:36,240
If you want to operate on that level.

5577
04:02:38,780 --> 04:02:40,360
No wonder it's very difficult

5578
04:02:40,360 --> 04:02:42,020
to have a rational discussion

5579
04:02:42,020 --> 04:02:43,660
with anyone on the book of Revelation.

5580
04:02:50,940 --> 04:02:53,560
We may be getting cut off here any second.

5581
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:57,700
You spoke about a Bible called the Scriptures,

5582
04:02:57,700 --> 04:03:00,380
and you said it was the closest to the original text.

5583
04:03:01,820 --> 04:03:03,260
Where do you find that,

5584
04:03:03,680 --> 04:03:06,100
and what really are you asking for?

5585
04:03:06,420 --> 04:03:08,340
You can just research it online.

5586
04:03:10,280 --> 04:03:13,020
It's got about 200 and some odd mistakes.

5587
04:03:13,320 --> 04:03:16,000
Look up the Institute for Scripture Research.

5588
04:03:16,960 --> 04:03:18,720
They're printed in South Africa,

5589
04:03:18,920 --> 04:03:21,760
and they distribute it somewhere here out of Kentucky.

5590
04:03:22,700 --> 04:03:26,540
It's about $20 for a soft cover.

5591
04:03:26,540 --> 04:03:28,980
It's pretty good if you're tired

5592
04:03:28,980 --> 04:03:31,620
of looking at L-O-R-D and G-O-D

5593
04:03:31,620 --> 04:03:33,600
and Sunday and Good Friday

5594
04:03:33,600 --> 04:03:35,140
and all that other stuff.

5595
04:03:36,440 --> 04:03:38,220
If you're tired of looking at that,

5596
04:03:38,340 --> 04:03:39,660
because when I read that it's like,

5597
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:42,900
you know, I just can't read it

5598
04:03:42,900 --> 04:03:44,040
for any length of time.

5599
04:03:44,040 --> 04:03:46,160
I have one of the, I think they call it

5600
04:03:46,160 --> 04:03:50,200
the Ratherdam Bible or something like that,

5601
04:03:50,620 --> 04:03:54,140
where they left the original Yahweh in it.

5602
04:03:54,660 --> 04:03:54,980
Okay.

5603
04:03:56,300 --> 04:03:59,780
Yeah, there's also one called the Jerusalem Bible,

5604
04:03:59,940 --> 04:04:01,800
which is the Catholic Bible.

5605
04:04:01,980 --> 04:04:03,680
It has some apocryphia in it.

5606
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:07,200
They still use L-O-R-D, though.

5607
04:04:08,260 --> 04:04:09,280
Then there's another one.

5608
04:04:09,320 --> 04:04:10,680
If you could get your hands on it,

5609
04:04:10,700 --> 04:04:13,500
it's a Jerusalem Bible printed out of Jerusalem,

5610
04:04:13,720 --> 04:04:15,520
and they only printed a few thousand of them

5611
04:04:15,520 --> 04:04:17,100
about 30 years ago. I have one.

5612
04:04:17,860 --> 04:04:19,820
And it has the original language on the right

5613
04:04:19,820 --> 04:04:22,240
in the way, not the original language,

5614
04:04:22,360 --> 04:04:24,280
but the language that it was preserved in.

5615
04:04:25,620 --> 04:04:27,200
Now, here's one thing.

5616
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:29,980
I'll give you another little nugget

5617
04:04:29,980 --> 04:04:31,120
to think about.

5618
04:04:32,520 --> 04:04:34,440
Did the Israelites speak Hebrew?

5619
04:04:35,640 --> 04:04:37,840
Or did they speak an Israelite tongue

5620
04:04:37,840 --> 04:04:39,380
that no one is familiar with today?

5621
04:04:39,440 --> 04:04:41,540
Or very few are, and we don't really know about it.

5622
04:04:42,700 --> 04:04:44,120
And is the modern Hebrew text,

5623
04:04:45,480 --> 04:04:47,900
actually, when they show you Paleo-Hebrew,

5624
04:04:48,020 --> 04:04:50,440
that's not Paleo-Hebrew, that's pre-Hebrew.

5625
04:04:50,940 --> 04:04:52,720
And the modern Hebrew text,

5626
04:04:53,280 --> 04:04:54,960
the actual paleo to that is

5627
04:04:54,960 --> 04:04:57,660
the cuneiform that you see on clay tablets.

5628
04:04:58,680 --> 04:04:59,900
If you do your own research,

5629
04:05:00,060 --> 04:05:01,600
you might find some interesting stuff.

5630
04:05:02,300 --> 04:05:04,900
And also, if you go to Jeremiah,

5631
04:05:06,760 --> 04:05:11,010
I think chapter 15, verse 5,

5632
04:05:12,220 --> 04:05:13,860
somewhere, or I might have reversed it,

5633
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:16,460
but Jeremiah 15, I think,

5634
04:05:17,520 --> 04:05:20,620
he'll tell you that he's going to send,

5635
04:05:20,960 --> 04:05:24,240
he says, I'm going to send a people over here,

5636
04:05:24,240 --> 04:05:26,600
and they're going to take you over,

5637
04:05:26,700 --> 04:05:29,060
they're an old nation, renowned, powerful,

5638
04:05:29,900 --> 04:05:31,780
and you don't understand their language,

5639
04:05:31,980 --> 04:05:33,040
and you don't speak their tongue,

5640
04:05:33,080 --> 04:05:34,260
you don't know what they're saying.

5641
04:05:34,760 --> 04:05:38,060
He's referring to the Babylonians.

5642
04:05:40,040 --> 04:05:42,360
Okay, I think it's 515, Jeremiah.

5643
04:05:44,060 --> 04:05:46,240
Or I got to open it up.

5644
04:05:46,600 --> 04:05:47,840
Okay, now hold on a second.

5645
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:50,520
Go into your encyclopedias,

5646
04:05:51,220 --> 04:05:53,460
and look up Hebrew.

5647
04:05:53,460 --> 04:05:56,880
You'll find that it's a Chaldean or Babylonian language.

5648
04:05:59,570 --> 04:06:01,450
It's also used by the Canaanites.

5649
04:06:04,230 --> 04:06:05,910
Now, he also tells them,

5650
04:06:06,050 --> 04:06:09,230
because they're going to be a stumbling block to you.

5651
04:06:09,670 --> 04:06:10,650
But here's the thing.

5652
04:06:11,150 --> 04:06:13,870
He chose that language to have it preserved in,

5653
04:06:14,670 --> 04:06:15,730
to our day.

5654
04:06:19,150 --> 04:06:22,690
And the wonderful thing about what the Babylonians did,

5655
04:06:24,910 --> 04:06:26,030
let's see, 515,

5656
04:06:26,550 --> 04:06:30,230
is that they were operating on a totally different number system

5657
04:06:30,230 --> 04:06:32,390
and their letters were extremely precise.

5658
04:06:34,030 --> 04:06:36,290
And if you ever get some time,

5659
04:06:37,210 --> 04:06:41,430
do some research on the cylinder seals of the Babylonians.

5660
04:06:43,450 --> 04:06:45,770
And I'll give you an example why.

5661
04:06:47,070 --> 04:06:50,430
Let's say we're taking a stroll through the desert somewhere out there,

5662
04:06:51,110 --> 04:06:54,550
and we find some Babylonian cylinder seals.

5663
04:06:55,730 --> 04:06:57,510
And we start talking about it.

5664
04:06:57,510 --> 04:07:00,090
You're going to have black helicopters and special ops people

5665
04:07:00,090 --> 04:07:02,110
coming at your door, taking everything you got,

5666
04:07:02,210 --> 04:07:03,230
no questions asked.

5667
04:07:05,450 --> 04:07:08,450
What's so important about those Babylonian cylinder seals?

5668
04:07:14,260 --> 04:07:15,340
Think about it.

5669
04:07:17,460 --> 04:07:18,240
If you read...

5670
04:07:18,240 --> 04:07:23,140
Okay, here, Jeremiah 515.

5671
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:25,760
See, I am bringing the nation against you from afar,

5672
04:07:26,240 --> 04:07:27,800
O house of Israel declares Yahweh.

5673
04:07:27,880 --> 04:07:30,660
It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation,

5674
04:07:31,040 --> 04:07:32,960
a nation whose language you do not know,

5675
04:07:33,080 --> 04:07:34,840
nor do you understand what they say.

5676
04:07:36,060 --> 04:07:38,120
Nehemiah, when they came back from Babylon, he said,

5677
04:07:38,200 --> 04:07:39,820
why are you guys speaking that language?

5678
04:07:41,740 --> 04:07:42,720
What's wrong with you?

5679
04:07:43,800 --> 04:07:46,520
You know, we're losing it here, we're losing our culture,

5680
04:07:46,620 --> 04:07:47,900
our people, our language, everything.

5681
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:50,620
And if you read in scripture later, he says,

5682
04:07:50,680 --> 04:07:53,080
I'm going to restore to you your language.

5683
04:07:53,980 --> 04:07:55,360
You didn't say I'm going to give you a new one,

5684
04:07:55,380 --> 04:07:56,340
I'm going to restore it.

5685
04:08:00,150 --> 04:08:05,550
Well, you know, when the colonies were gathered together

5686
04:08:05,550 --> 04:08:07,990
and we decided to become a nation,

5687
04:08:08,010 --> 04:08:12,450
that they voted on the national language

5688
04:08:13,090 --> 04:08:15,410
and Hebrew lost by one vote.

5689
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:19,620
Okay, you mean in modern days?

5690
04:08:20,460 --> 04:08:20,760
Yeah.

5691
04:08:21,320 --> 04:08:24,460
Yeah, because they have Greek and French and English now.

5692
04:08:26,060 --> 04:08:27,720
Well, Hebrew is extremely precise,

5693
04:08:28,220 --> 04:08:31,220
it's one of the only languages that you don't need a dictionary for.

5694
04:08:33,200 --> 04:08:36,080
If you learn, if you get yourself a Hebrew coloring book

5695
04:08:36,080 --> 04:08:38,880
and you learn those letters and what they mean,

5696
04:08:38,880 --> 04:08:40,480
you could pretty much get familiar.

5697
04:08:41,080 --> 04:08:42,240
I mean, it's slow going,

5698
04:08:43,540 --> 04:08:46,100
but they can't fool you on the definition.

5699
04:08:46,620 --> 04:08:49,140
But they know most people aren't going to do that kind of research

5700
04:08:49,140 --> 04:08:51,400
so they could put anything they want in Strong's.

5701
04:08:51,960 --> 04:08:52,480
Right.

5702
04:08:53,780 --> 04:08:55,400
You know, but it's so simple.

5703
04:08:57,100 --> 04:08:59,520
And whenever you see something in Strong's

5704
04:08:59,520 --> 04:09:01,340
or an etymological dictionary

5705
04:09:01,900 --> 04:09:04,260
where they tell you of unknown origin

5706
04:09:05,220 --> 04:09:06,720
or unknown root,

5707
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:08,560
they're lying.

5708
04:09:09,360 --> 04:09:10,620
What was the last time you walked in

5709
04:09:10,620 --> 04:09:12,360
and looked at a carpenter's toolbox

5710
04:09:12,360 --> 04:09:14,560
and you asked him what that hammer and saw is

5711
04:09:14,560 --> 04:09:15,560
and he said, unknown.

5712
04:09:18,620 --> 04:09:20,680
You know, it just don't happen.

5713
04:09:22,160 --> 04:09:24,120
It just behooves the mind.

5714
04:09:24,300 --> 04:09:25,340
I mean, what do you mean unknown?

5715
04:09:25,500 --> 04:09:25,960
Look here.

5716
04:09:26,540 --> 04:09:28,480
This letter means this, this letter means that.

5717
04:09:28,540 --> 04:09:30,200
Look how it's being used. What do you mean?

5718
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:33,500
I know they've gradually changed the Strong's.

5719
04:09:34,360 --> 04:09:36,360
I waited a long time to get an old one.

5720
04:09:37,280 --> 04:09:38,520
Well, even the old ones.

5721
04:09:38,700 --> 04:09:40,100
It's still in the old ones, too.

5722
04:09:40,220 --> 04:09:44,100
They'll give you these really long, long, long explanations

5723
04:09:44,100 --> 04:09:45,520
and they're just taking you off.

5724
04:09:45,700 --> 04:09:48,600
Oh, I know it's not great by any means,

5725
04:09:48,720 --> 04:09:50,520
but better than the newer ones.

5726
04:09:52,000 --> 04:09:54,020
Oh, yeah, the new... Well, here's the thing.

5727
04:09:54,120 --> 04:09:55,440
You know, if you read...

5728
04:09:55,440 --> 04:09:57,040
I was telling this to someone, you know,

5729
04:09:57,060 --> 04:09:58,120
it says, I got to be saved.

5730
04:09:58,260 --> 04:10:00,820
They said, okay, all right, hold on, I got to be saved.

5731
04:10:00,820 --> 04:10:02,540
And right here in your own...

5732
04:10:02,540 --> 04:10:04,860
Give me your Bible, and I like using their Bibles

5733
04:10:04,860 --> 04:10:07,580
because when you show them a verse in their Bibles,

5734
04:10:07,720 --> 04:10:10,840
it seems to have like 70% more impact on them.

5735
04:10:10,920 --> 04:10:11,540
I don't know why.

5736
04:10:13,220 --> 04:10:15,560
Then they're sure you don't have a trick deck of cards.

5737
04:10:16,260 --> 04:10:17,780
Because they're carrying it around, you know,

5738
04:10:17,840 --> 04:10:18,960
and they think they know it.

5739
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:20,880
You know, they don't know anything in there at all.

5740
04:10:22,460 --> 04:10:25,700
And I show them some verses and it just shocks them

5741
04:10:25,700 --> 04:10:28,580
because, you know, if you show it to me out of your Bible,

5742
04:10:28,760 --> 04:10:29,760
you know, it can't be true.

5743
04:10:30,820 --> 04:10:31,400
It can't be the only true one.

5744
04:10:31,420 --> 04:10:32,620
So you show them out of theirs, you know.

5745
04:10:33,100 --> 04:10:35,360
And it says that...

5746
04:10:36,160 --> 04:10:38,760
He says, the Christ said,

5747
04:10:38,920 --> 04:10:40,880
the gospel will be preached to the whole world

5748
04:10:40,880 --> 04:10:41,900
and then I will return.

5749
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:44,760
I said, do you see it around right now?

5750
04:10:45,760 --> 04:10:46,140
Nope.

5751
04:10:46,220 --> 04:10:49,180
I said, well, then that means the gospel hasn't been preached yet, right?

5752
04:10:53,300 --> 04:10:54,000
Very simple.

5753
04:10:57,090 --> 04:10:59,150
And the word gospel that you're looking up

5754
04:10:59,710 --> 04:11:01,270
is not gospel in Greek.

5755
04:11:01,410 --> 04:11:02,590
It has nothing to do with that.

5756
04:11:03,710 --> 04:11:05,770
That comes from the German term,

5757
04:11:05,870 --> 04:11:07,510
Godspeak or Gotspiel.

5758
04:11:09,710 --> 04:11:11,810
The Greek word is Evangelo.

5759
04:11:12,370 --> 04:11:14,190
The EU prefix in Greek

5760
04:11:14,190 --> 04:11:18,310
is usually used with prefixes in words

5761
04:11:18,310 --> 04:11:20,230
that have to do with healing and health.

5762
04:11:22,360 --> 04:11:25,020
And the second part of the word, Angelos, means messenger.

5763
04:11:26,140 --> 04:11:28,460
So what it is, it's the message of healing.

5764
04:11:30,060 --> 04:11:31,820
It's what it literally means.

5765
04:11:32,920 --> 04:11:35,100
And they've translated that into gospel.

5766
04:11:36,100 --> 04:11:37,600
Or Godspeak or Gotspiel.

5767
04:11:41,360 --> 04:11:43,860
Do you think that's why a lot of people aren't being healed?

5768
04:11:44,400 --> 04:11:45,100
Or not, you know?

5769
04:11:45,640 --> 04:11:47,240
Their whole perception is wrong.

5770
04:11:49,840 --> 04:11:51,080
Now, who am I to say it's wrong?

5771
04:11:51,160 --> 04:11:52,840
Well, according to the way I...

5772
04:11:52,840 --> 04:11:54,120
the deity that I follow,

5773
04:11:55,140 --> 04:11:56,800
he gives me what's right and wrong.

5774
04:11:58,360 --> 04:11:58,820
Right?

5775
04:11:59,640 --> 04:12:01,180
I don't need CNN or...

5776
04:12:02,440 --> 04:12:03,360
Harvard or...

5777
04:12:03,860 --> 04:12:04,480
you know.

5778
04:12:05,960 --> 04:12:09,380
And why it's important to pick something to follow

5779
04:12:09,380 --> 04:12:11,580
that is of ancient times

5780
04:12:11,580 --> 04:12:13,420
is because it's your reference.

5781
04:12:13,560 --> 04:12:14,460
It's your yardstick.

5782
04:12:15,120 --> 04:12:17,180
I mean, there's things that are not in scripture,

5783
04:12:17,360 --> 04:12:20,180
but I always use them that I find throughout my life.

5784
04:12:20,240 --> 04:12:21,900
But I use that as my reference.

5785
04:12:22,660 --> 04:12:23,740
How does it measure up?

5786
04:12:24,980 --> 04:12:26,420
In Ecclesiastes, he says,

5787
04:12:26,500 --> 04:12:27,980
there's nothing new under the sun.

5788
04:12:28,340 --> 04:12:29,840
Everything that is, was,

5789
04:12:29,900 --> 04:12:31,780
just knowledge of it has been lost.

5790
04:12:33,080 --> 04:12:36,860
So you start hearing about all this high technology stuff,

5791
04:12:36,940 --> 04:12:38,860
now you want to know what's being hidden from you.

5792
04:12:39,820 --> 04:12:42,820
Why? Why are they hiding knowledge of high technology?

5793
04:12:42,960 --> 04:12:44,380
Because, let's say,

5794
04:12:44,620 --> 04:12:46,920
you lived in a common society

5795
04:12:46,920 --> 04:12:48,660
three or four thousand years ago,

5796
04:12:49,040 --> 04:12:50,920
and you knew how to use electricity.

5797
04:12:51,580 --> 04:12:54,560
Do you think that would give you power over the people around you

5798
04:12:54,560 --> 04:12:55,940
if you didn't share that information?

5799
04:12:58,400 --> 04:12:59,520
Absolutely, wouldn't it?

5800
04:13:01,310 --> 04:13:03,250
Just like you were talking about before,

5801
04:13:03,250 --> 04:13:07,270
the cell phone being created before telegraph.

5802
04:13:08,030 --> 04:13:08,850
Yeah, go look it up.

5803
04:13:08,910 --> 04:13:10,010
Nathan Stubblefield.

5804
04:13:11,790 --> 04:13:13,370
Go look up Beach.

5805
04:13:14,570 --> 04:13:17,410
The guy who established Scientific American.

5806
04:13:17,650 --> 04:13:20,270
And the wonderful thing is he built this tunnel in secret.

5807
04:13:21,370 --> 04:13:22,970
No one knew he was even building it.

5808
04:13:24,410 --> 04:13:27,770
And those trains were designed to go 700 miles per hour,

5809
04:13:28,650 --> 04:13:29,250
underground,

5810
04:13:29,750 --> 04:13:31,570
because they were being drawn by a vacuum.

5811
04:13:32,190 --> 04:13:35,190
And air enters a vacuum at 700 miles per hour,

5812
04:13:35,290 --> 04:13:36,470
and this is in 1860s.

5813
04:13:37,890 --> 04:13:41,050
And now we're supposed to be impressed with a 300 mile per hour train

5814
04:13:41,050 --> 04:13:42,930
150 some odd years later?

5815
04:13:43,250 --> 04:13:44,530
It doesn't impress me.

5816
04:13:47,810 --> 04:13:51,290
Because you're talking about the machines making things instead of people.

5817
04:13:53,830 --> 04:13:56,970
Yes, the ancients knew how to make machines that made things.

5818
04:13:58,230 --> 04:14:01,930
But they found the quality of those things were not as good

5819
04:14:01,930 --> 04:14:04,450
as if you had machines made of flesh and blood.

5820
04:14:05,990 --> 04:14:06,970
Do you know what I mean?

5821
04:14:07,010 --> 04:14:09,530
Another word is a slave or a worker.

5822
04:14:10,070 --> 04:14:12,590
Right. Well, that's what everybody is here.

5823
04:14:13,370 --> 04:14:15,590
Yeah. Well, when you get all that stuff from China,

5824
04:14:16,630 --> 04:14:19,390
a lot of that stuff is handmade, but it's made so fast

5825
04:14:19,390 --> 04:14:20,670
and it's not competent.

5826
04:14:21,670 --> 04:14:23,390
I'm not saying it's not competent,

5827
04:14:23,570 --> 04:14:26,010
because they will build anything to specification,

5828
04:14:26,390 --> 04:14:30,130
but the specifications they give those folks over there

5829
04:14:30,130 --> 04:14:31,470
is how cheap can you make it?

5830
04:14:31,930 --> 04:14:33,150
That's exactly right.

5831
04:14:33,730 --> 04:14:36,750
So when people say stuff from China is cheap and not good,

5832
04:14:36,850 --> 04:14:41,630
it's because the people here are giving that as their main specification.

5833
04:14:41,950 --> 04:14:44,630
I've seen stuff made in Chinese factories

5834
04:14:44,630 --> 04:14:46,890
to very, very, very high specifications.

5835
04:14:47,510 --> 04:14:49,310
I was just going to elaborate on that.

5836
04:14:49,390 --> 04:14:54,310
I actually have talked to a lot of Chinese manufacturers out there,

5837
04:14:54,410 --> 04:14:56,610
and they said they'll do it to whatever spec I give it.

5838
04:14:56,650 --> 04:14:57,790
And they gave me some examples,

5839
04:14:57,950 --> 04:15:00,430
and like you said, they'll put whatever chip you want.

5840
04:15:01,930 --> 04:15:04,830
Whatever spec, and you know what's wonderful about what they do?

5841
04:15:05,010 --> 04:15:09,150
If they don't have the equipment to do it,

5842
04:15:09,210 --> 04:15:11,010
they'll go out and get the equipment to do it.

5843
04:15:11,050 --> 04:15:15,150
Here, if you go to a company and what you want exceeds their spec,

5844
04:15:15,230 --> 04:15:17,390
we don't have the equipment. Sorry. Go down the road somewhere.

5845
04:15:19,810 --> 04:15:21,790
So you wonder why all the business is going there.

5846
04:15:24,110 --> 04:15:29,010
I have seen from doing design work in audio equipment,

5847
04:15:29,830 --> 04:15:32,510
a company, they went to design.

5848
04:15:32,510 --> 04:15:37,010
We designed a tiny little amplifier, Class D, very high power.

5849
04:15:38,530 --> 04:15:42,870
And it was a multi-billion dollar corporation that they went to,

5850
04:15:42,950 --> 04:15:47,230
and they didn't have the specific wave soldering tools

5851
04:15:47,230 --> 04:15:49,190
and machines to make these little things.

5852
04:15:49,310 --> 04:15:51,230
And they just went out and spent $150,000

5853
04:15:53,310 --> 04:15:56,450
when they were giving us the bid, just so they could make the prototype.

5854
04:15:59,340 --> 04:16:02,640
When do you have an American company go out and spend $150,000

5855
04:16:02,640 --> 04:16:06,260
to make you a tiny little prototype without charging you for it?

5856
04:16:07,740 --> 04:16:10,720
In other words, they were so happy to be a part of something.

5857
04:16:10,860 --> 04:16:15,600
Here we shopped it around all over, TI, Texas Instruments,

5858
04:16:15,660 --> 04:16:17,540
all these other places, and they were like,

5859
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:20,620
no, no, no, no, no. We don't even want to deal with it.

5860
04:16:21,700 --> 04:16:25,640
So a lot of times, the manufacturers and designers

5861
04:16:25,640 --> 04:16:28,320
have no choice but to go to the East.

5862
04:16:28,320 --> 04:16:35,140
So the ancients had technology.

5863
04:16:35,660 --> 04:16:41,640
Today, in the current era that we live in,

5864
04:16:42,680 --> 04:16:47,300
if you find a cave or an opening in the ground, it's illegal to go into it.

5865
04:16:47,320 --> 04:16:49,140
They have federal laws. You can't go in there.

5866
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:52,760
You're not supposed to go in there. Why?

5867
04:16:52,860 --> 04:16:54,580
Because for the past hundred years,

5868
04:16:54,960 --> 04:16:58,500
people have been going into caves, pulling out artifacts that just shouldn't be.

5869
04:17:00,800 --> 04:17:03,720
You know, oh, the ancients, oh, they were so poor.

5870
04:17:04,100 --> 04:17:06,220
You see, we're more advanced. Sure you are.

5871
04:17:07,480 --> 04:17:09,800
You know, what end of the circle are we on?

5872
04:17:12,170 --> 04:17:16,970
So it's all being stored up for some show.

5873
04:17:19,210 --> 04:17:23,390
You know, the next show, the bread and circuits.

5874
04:17:24,450 --> 04:17:27,570
Okay, so the technology that I'm looking at right now,

5875
04:17:27,610 --> 04:17:30,050
this computer knowledge, is really very ancient technology.

5876
04:17:31,270 --> 04:17:35,190
What's the possibility in your mind that some of that ancient technology

5877
04:17:35,190 --> 04:17:37,750
from way back when, what you're talking about,

5878
04:17:37,950 --> 04:17:41,350
is still in somebody's hands and that machine is still operating?

5879
04:17:42,650 --> 04:17:47,540
Okay, all right.

5880
04:17:49,820 --> 04:17:53,280
Think of it this way. Let me see. I'll just come out and say it.

5881
04:17:55,660 --> 04:17:56,900
Imagine a piece of metal.

5882
04:17:57,680 --> 04:17:59,540
Okay, you found something really, really old

5883
04:17:59,540 --> 04:18:01,280
or you know something is really, really old.

5884
04:18:01,280 --> 04:18:04,920
Okay, I'm talking about we can't date it.

5885
04:18:05,000 --> 04:18:07,600
I mean, it doesn't resemble any modern technology.

5886
04:18:07,740 --> 04:18:08,620
A piece of metal, okay?

5887
04:18:09,740 --> 04:18:10,060
Okay.

5888
04:18:10,780 --> 04:18:13,240
And you look under a microscope. It looks like aluminum.

5889
04:18:13,480 --> 04:18:16,600
It's kind of heavy for aluminum, but it's got properties of aluminum.

5890
04:18:17,460 --> 04:18:21,900
And you look under 200X, which is, you know,

5891
04:18:21,900 --> 04:18:24,600
you need a good microscope for that if you're going to get any resolution.

5892
04:18:26,040 --> 04:18:30,100
And you start to see stuff that looks like crushed animal crackers

5893
04:18:30,100 --> 04:18:34,380
or little circuit boards, microcircuit boards,

5894
04:18:34,420 --> 04:18:35,980
all through the metal, in and out.

5895
04:18:36,260 --> 04:18:38,960
And it's not an accident. It's deliberate. It's logic.

5896
04:18:43,310 --> 04:18:46,770
That doesn't resemble anything you see in your computer today

5897
04:18:46,770 --> 04:18:48,330
because when you see your computer today,

5898
04:18:48,390 --> 04:18:51,650
you've got this plastic, they call it a box in the computer industry, right?

5899
04:18:52,450 --> 04:18:54,890
And you've got the motherboard and you plug these circuits out

5900
04:18:54,890 --> 04:18:58,590
and you see these circuits that are, you know, chips and stuff soldered together.

5901
04:19:00,050 --> 04:19:02,650
Imagine a computer that's actually part of the metal.

5902
04:19:02,650 --> 04:19:05,670
Whatever you're casting, let's say a hammer, you know,

5903
04:19:05,770 --> 04:19:08,450
or part of a tool or a machine,

5904
04:19:08,690 --> 04:19:11,350
and it's got the computer integrated in with the material.

5905
04:19:11,950 --> 04:19:13,490
They have stuff like that.

5906
04:19:13,650 --> 04:19:15,150
They have this film that they've created,

5907
04:19:15,290 --> 04:19:17,690
but they're not going to release that. It's too expensive, they say.

5908
04:19:19,870 --> 04:19:25,610
Yeah, right. Well, you know, we're talking, okay,

5909
04:19:25,690 --> 04:19:28,850
the Babylonian cylinder seals and the plywood.

5910
04:19:29,810 --> 04:19:31,550
This reality is like a plywood.

5911
04:19:31,550 --> 04:19:34,890
Tesla found out if you hit enough voltage,

5912
04:19:35,030 --> 04:19:37,770
the right voltage and the right frequency at the right current,

5913
04:19:38,730 --> 04:19:48,970
you started seeing things that just shouldn't be there, you know?

5914
04:19:49,950 --> 04:19:51,150
How about this?

5915
04:19:52,790 --> 04:19:56,210
Let's say about 15 years ago, there were some hikers out in California,

5916
04:19:57,350 --> 04:19:59,050
up there in Marin County,

5917
04:20:00,650 --> 04:20:03,030
and as they were walking through a suburban neighborhood

5918
04:20:03,030 --> 04:20:08,750
parallel to the park, one of these high-powered transformers blew up.

5919
04:20:11,300 --> 04:20:15,040
And, you know, oil and noise and sparks and everything went everywhere.

5920
04:20:16,040 --> 04:20:20,520
And all three people that were there witnessed a civil war battle in front of them.

5921
04:20:22,200 --> 04:20:23,380
Oh, my.

5922
04:20:25,240 --> 04:20:27,820
Okay? And then it just went away.

5923
04:20:29,460 --> 04:20:30,960
So was that the time when...

5924
04:20:30,960 --> 04:20:34,940
The people in the battle appeared to them as ghosts,

5925
04:20:34,940 --> 04:20:38,640
and they appeared to the people in the battle as ghosts.

5926
04:20:39,300 --> 04:20:43,760
So is that a simultaneous time situation?

5927
04:20:45,460 --> 04:20:46,200
Yeah, high energy.

5928
04:20:46,580 --> 04:20:53,020
I tell people if you want to learn your science and you got a TV,

5929
04:20:53,740 --> 04:20:56,560
all their documentaries and history is your science fiction

5930
04:20:56,560 --> 04:20:58,400
and your science fiction is your documentary.

5931
04:20:58,780 --> 04:20:59,740
Oh, exactly.

5932
04:21:00,800 --> 04:21:03,760
They always tell us in the movies what's going to happen.

5933
04:21:05,280 --> 04:21:08,120
They do. Why do you think when they bring this high technology

5934
04:21:08,120 --> 04:21:12,140
in the science fiction, they call it a wormhole?

5935
04:21:12,300 --> 04:21:15,380
Why? Because psychologically it messes with you.

5936
04:21:15,520 --> 04:21:17,380
Because what's in a wormhole? A worm, right?

5937
04:21:19,300 --> 04:21:22,280
You're not a worm, so you can't go in a wormhole in your mind.

5938
04:21:23,180 --> 04:21:24,120
They're not wormholes.

5939
04:21:27,710 --> 04:21:30,230
That's why they tell you in school you descended from apes.

5940
04:21:30,250 --> 04:21:31,270
How does that make you feel?

5941
04:21:34,310 --> 04:21:36,490
I look at them and tell them they're stupid.

5942
04:21:38,230 --> 04:21:42,330
But it's a psychological dig in your mind subconsciously.

5943
04:21:42,470 --> 04:21:44,830
If the people that are saying that want to accept it, fine.

5944
04:21:45,130 --> 04:21:46,410
But it's not my truth.

5945
04:21:47,790 --> 04:21:49,650
Yeah, you know, why do they teach little children

5946
04:21:49,650 --> 04:21:51,330
rock-a-bye baby in the treetop?

5947
04:21:51,450 --> 04:21:54,170
Now tell me who puts a baby cradle in a treetop?

5948
04:21:54,990 --> 04:21:56,010
And then lets it fall.

5949
04:21:56,950 --> 04:21:57,990
And then it falls, right?

5950
04:21:58,250 --> 04:22:00,270
Yep. It's stupid.

5951
04:22:00,890 --> 04:22:04,290
Yeah, but these are all, they always...

5952
04:22:04,290 --> 04:22:05,530
You see anyone here?

5953
04:22:06,410 --> 04:22:06,910
Yeah.

5954
04:22:08,490 --> 04:22:11,530
So you're saying that that explosion caused,

5955
04:22:11,790 --> 04:22:15,830
for lack of better words, a psychic time warp of reality

5956
04:22:15,830 --> 04:22:17,950
into the past and they actually saw the past.

5957
04:22:18,190 --> 04:22:19,070
Is that what you're saying here?

5958
04:22:20,490 --> 04:22:22,690
What they saw appeared to them as a ghost.

5959
04:22:22,830 --> 04:22:24,070
But it was two-way.

5960
04:22:24,390 --> 04:22:28,030
They also appeared in the other reality and they looked like ghosts.

5961
04:22:29,350 --> 04:22:31,150
Let's take this the other way.

5962
04:22:31,590 --> 04:22:34,510
It leads back to the question about the machines still operating.

5963
04:22:35,290 --> 04:22:37,010
If I took a nickel out of my pocket

5964
04:22:37,010 --> 04:22:39,370
and I was able to take that metal

5965
04:22:40,450 --> 04:22:43,810
20 years into the future and bring it back to present time,

5966
04:22:43,930 --> 04:22:46,070
it would not start the nuclear disintegrate

5967
04:22:46,070 --> 04:22:47,850
or you couldn't even scratch it.

5968
04:22:48,090 --> 04:22:51,790
It wouldn't age until it reached that point in time to which I'd taken it.

5969
04:22:53,190 --> 04:22:55,930
Not necessarily true because it's not the same quarter.

5970
04:22:58,120 --> 04:23:00,740
I'm going to share some stuff that's been shared with me.

5971
04:23:00,820 --> 04:23:01,320
How's that?

5972
04:23:03,260 --> 04:23:04,440
About this subject.

5973
04:23:05,140 --> 04:23:06,160
Okay, that quarter.

5974
04:23:06,340 --> 04:23:08,080
Okay, go ahead and put that quarter in front of you

5975
04:23:08,080 --> 04:23:10,480
if you're sitting down on your desk, let's say, right?

5976
04:23:10,580 --> 04:23:11,220
Or on the floor.

5977
04:23:12,780 --> 04:23:13,040
Right?

5978
04:23:13,680 --> 04:23:13,960
Okay.

5979
04:23:13,980 --> 04:23:17,220
And now that quarter in your hand,

5980
04:23:17,300 --> 04:23:20,860
that's got a time-space, a space-time coordinate.

5981
04:23:21,220 --> 04:23:21,960
It's a quarter.

5982
04:23:22,180 --> 04:23:24,320
You can give your material science on it.

5983
04:23:24,420 --> 04:23:26,500
And it's got a coordinate in space.

5984
04:23:26,500 --> 04:23:26,740
Okay?

5985
04:23:28,680 --> 04:23:31,140
You could GPS it or whatever you want to do.

5986
04:23:31,240 --> 04:23:34,020
Longitude, latitude, or, you know, on a big scale,

5987
04:23:34,080 --> 04:23:37,240
on a universal scale, beyond what the satellites do.

5988
04:23:37,660 --> 04:23:38,700
Beyond the Earth, okay?

5989
04:23:39,300 --> 04:23:42,700
If you take that quarter and move it three feet to the right,

5990
04:23:43,060 --> 04:23:44,380
is it still the same quarter?

5991
04:23:49,260 --> 04:23:50,000
It aged.

5992
04:23:50,960 --> 04:23:51,940
Hold on a second.

5993
04:23:52,640 --> 04:23:54,960
Most people would say yes because it's right in front of me,

5994
04:23:55,040 --> 04:23:58,280
but I'll tell you mathematically it's not with this type of math

5995
04:23:58,920 --> 04:24:02,640
because the coordinates of where it is in space are different, right?

5996
04:24:03,500 --> 04:24:04,840
Thus, it's a different quarter.

5997
04:24:06,240 --> 04:24:08,960
That's due to what I call nuclear disintegration.

5998
04:24:09,100 --> 04:24:10,240
Yes, it's constantly bleeding.

5999
04:24:10,640 --> 04:24:14,020
But if I stop that process, take it into the future and bring it back,

6000
04:24:14,080 --> 04:24:16,880
it will not start again until it reaches that point in time

6001
04:24:16,880 --> 04:24:21,200
at its present position or whatever position there you put it in around planet Earth.

6002
04:24:22,900 --> 04:24:25,220
Okay, but the other coordinates beyond the planet.

6003
04:24:25,480 --> 04:24:26,560
But, yeah, I see what you're saying.

6004
04:24:26,560 --> 04:24:28,840
Yeah, essentially we're talking about the same thing.

6005
04:24:30,200 --> 04:24:32,500
But when I say nuclear disintegration,

6006
04:24:33,100 --> 04:24:36,220
I don't know, I don't know.

6007
04:24:36,660 --> 04:24:38,020
It's something to think about.

6008
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:44,280
Go on your astrophysics and they have discovered,

6009
04:24:44,440 --> 04:24:49,620
even until today, that the Earth is the only planet in the solar system

6010
04:24:49,620 --> 04:24:53,420
that has radioactive material like, you know, plutonium, strontium, cesium,

6011
04:24:53,880 --> 04:24:55,180
uranium, all that other stuff, right?

6012
04:24:57,940 --> 04:24:58,340
So they say.

6013
04:24:59,060 --> 04:25:01,020
So they say those really large atoms.

6014
04:25:01,180 --> 04:25:04,520
And if you actually start seeing that the chemicals

6015
04:25:04,520 --> 04:25:09,620
or the elements on the periodic table are not empirical but ephemeral,

6016
04:25:11,240 --> 04:25:15,120
meaning that everything came basically from hydrogen all the way to carbon,

6017
04:25:17,340 --> 04:25:18,460
combinations thereof,

6018
04:25:19,160 --> 04:25:25,080
and if you look and see that hydrogen is not really the first element but the eighth,

6019
04:25:25,080 --> 04:25:27,020
it's the beginning of the second octave.

6020
04:25:29,500 --> 04:25:33,240
And you'll see that the primary octaves end around gold and platinum

6021
04:25:33,240 --> 04:25:37,200
and around mercury they, you know, they start going radioactive.

6022
04:25:38,980 --> 04:25:39,500
Okay.

6023
04:25:39,980 --> 04:25:41,960
And you got the lanthanide groups in between.

6024
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:46,120
You're going to start, and then you just go back and use, let's say,

6025
04:25:46,220 --> 04:25:48,760
what the ancient principles of yin and yang are.

6026
04:25:50,040 --> 04:25:55,140
The opposites attract, hot and cold, positive and negative, skinny and fat,

6027
04:25:55,140 --> 04:25:56,740
dark and light.

6028
04:25:57,840 --> 04:26:05,510
If you could categorize those elements in the yin and yang concept

6029
04:26:05,510 --> 04:26:09,710
or opposite polarities in character in a spiritual way,

6030
04:26:10,190 --> 04:26:11,950
because spirit means character or mind,

6031
04:26:13,290 --> 04:26:17,990
you will see that amongst the octaves most of the organic material that we have

6032
04:26:17,990 --> 04:26:20,330
was formed between hydrogen and carbon.

6033
04:26:21,230 --> 04:26:23,130
And your elements after that are different combinations

6034
04:26:23,450 --> 04:26:25,710
of all the elements between hydrogen and carbon.

6035
04:26:28,480 --> 04:26:30,100
Here's an easy example.

6036
04:26:30,920 --> 04:26:37,700
When you take water and you warm it up, the oxygen component becomes aggressive.

6037
04:26:37,980 --> 04:26:41,340
That's why if you want to rust metal fast, put hot water on it in the sun.

6038
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:47,960
But you notice that if you keep, get a nail or a piece of iron

6039
04:26:47,960 --> 04:26:52,100
and put it in some cold water, 39 degrees, and you'll see how long it takes to rust.

6040
04:26:52,140 --> 04:26:52,960
It almost doesn't.

6041
04:26:55,110 --> 04:26:59,770
Because oxygen becomes passive near 39 degrees in water,

6042
04:26:59,870 --> 04:27:01,190
which is its anomaly point.

6043
04:27:03,420 --> 04:27:07,620
But hydrogen becomes aggressive and it wants to bond with other things.

6044
04:27:08,960 --> 04:27:14,240
So if you take water and you vortex it, I'm not talking,

6045
04:27:14,300 --> 04:27:16,600
I'm talking about high speed stuff here, high energy.

6046
04:27:17,180 --> 04:27:19,580
But once you get it going, it kind of runs itself.

6047
04:27:21,970 --> 04:27:26,830
And you put, you have it in a proper shaped vessel and you evacuate the air

6048
04:27:26,830 --> 04:27:28,450
and you put in carbon dioxide.

6049
04:27:29,990 --> 04:27:35,570
While that vortex is going, the hydrogen becomes aggressive,

6050
04:27:35,730 --> 04:27:43,460
wants to bond with the carbon and you start forming carbohydrates in the water.

6051
04:27:45,870 --> 04:27:49,330
When you had no carbohydrate bonding or anything going on before.

6052
04:27:52,690 --> 04:28:00,070
Another way to look at it is if you take two carbons in the atmosphere

6053
04:28:00,070 --> 04:28:05,310
and you put some electrical current through it, carbon rods, let's say,

6054
04:28:05,450 --> 04:28:11,010
and you touch them together and the air is cold and the carbon rods,

6055
04:28:11,110 --> 04:28:13,770
I'm sorry, the carbon rods are cold and the air is warm.

6056
04:28:14,430 --> 04:28:18,190
Every time you arc that, you're going to see an arc

6057
04:28:18,190 --> 04:28:20,650
and a little piece of carbon is going to be blown off, right?

6058
04:28:21,430 --> 04:28:21,710
Right.

6059
04:28:22,110 --> 04:28:26,510
But you'll notice that when you start collecting this carbon dust at the bottom,

6060
04:28:28,110 --> 04:28:28,910
it's magnetic.

6061
04:28:29,870 --> 04:28:30,590
It's iron.

6062
04:28:31,770 --> 04:28:35,810
And if you look at the chemistry of it, you'll see X amount of oxygen

6063
04:28:35,810 --> 04:28:39,490
and X amount of carbon makes Fe.

6064
04:28:39,590 --> 04:28:40,830
You get an Fe56.

6065
04:28:42,010 --> 04:28:43,670
And if you start playing around with this,

6066
04:28:43,770 --> 04:28:46,530
well, there was originally iron in the carbon.

6067
04:28:46,670 --> 04:28:48,510
All right, okay, if you say so, fine.

6068
04:28:48,570 --> 04:28:51,690
I'll go out and get some 999 fine carbon and do it with.

6069
04:28:52,230 --> 04:28:54,790
And how come 20% of my residue is iron?

6070
04:28:54,790 --> 04:29:01,490
And if you use these basic principles,

6071
04:29:02,030 --> 04:29:03,870
you'll see with the right amount of electricity

6072
04:29:03,870 --> 04:29:05,670
and the right temperature on the right element,

6073
04:29:05,770 --> 04:29:07,290
you start making stuff happen.

6074
04:29:08,710 --> 04:29:10,170
And this was known to the ancients.

6075
04:29:10,670 --> 04:29:12,270
And that type of iron won't rust

6076
04:29:14,510 --> 04:29:17,270
because when it goes from carbon and oxygen,

6077
04:29:17,410 --> 04:29:21,550
you'll see it'll go through silicon and nickel for a very short period of time

6078
04:29:21,550 --> 04:29:23,190
before it gets pinned at Fe.

6079
04:29:23,830 --> 04:29:25,250
So alchemy is real.

6080
04:29:25,730 --> 04:29:27,210
You can transmute the elements.

6081
04:29:27,210 --> 04:29:29,750
You can grow gold biologically.

6082
04:29:31,450 --> 04:29:32,550
You can take copper,

6083
04:29:33,050 --> 04:29:36,330
the right amount of temperature, pressure and electricity

6084
04:29:36,330 --> 04:29:39,410
and take it to silver and then take a portion of that silver to gold.

6085
04:29:41,580 --> 04:29:42,840
This is not science fiction.

6086
04:29:43,420 --> 04:29:47,000
There are actually people on the web doing it right now on the internet.

6087
04:29:47,500 --> 04:29:50,140
Just research transmutation of copper to silver to gold.

6088
04:29:50,240 --> 04:29:52,720
You'll see a couple of people ready to go into production.

6089
04:29:56,690 --> 04:30:01,150
So the elements have been conquered over and over and over again.

6090
04:30:02,550 --> 04:30:06,810
The space-time continuum has been manageable and hidden from the people.

6091
04:30:07,250 --> 04:30:10,430
Like you were giving your analogy of going into the future with the quarter.

6092
04:30:10,730 --> 04:30:12,810
The way I was told that it works

6093
04:30:12,810 --> 04:30:17,750
is that your space coordinates and your time coordinates,

6094
04:30:18,550 --> 04:30:21,970
just by moving location, it's not the same object.

6095
04:30:22,130 --> 04:30:24,830
So if you go back and you know the right type of math

6096
04:30:24,830 --> 04:30:26,510
and the right type of energy,

6097
04:30:26,510 --> 04:30:31,450
you start, okay, well, let's do the coordinates the other way.

6098
04:30:31,530 --> 04:30:32,770
Work the equation the other way.

6099
04:30:33,270 --> 04:30:38,350
Let's say we change the time and space or space and time

6100
04:30:38,350 --> 04:30:40,670
and that makes the quarter not correct.

6101
04:30:41,490 --> 04:30:45,410
What if we want to keep the same quarter and just change the space and time?

6102
04:30:45,570 --> 04:30:52,570
Oh, now we've got some serious actual teleporting type technology,

6103
04:30:52,890 --> 04:30:53,510
if you know what I mean.

6104
04:30:56,120 --> 04:30:59,180
Yeah, that's basically what I was getting into with it.

6105
04:30:59,180 --> 04:31:02,020
It has nothing to do with Star Trek

6106
04:31:02,020 --> 04:31:05,000
where they disintegrate your atoms and assemble it somewhere else.

6107
04:31:06,340 --> 04:31:07,600
That's not how it's done.

6108
04:31:07,680 --> 04:31:11,060
It's actually done by loosening some of the glue in the plywood,

6109
04:31:11,200 --> 04:31:11,920
if you know what I mean.

6110
04:31:14,080 --> 04:31:18,120
So in that, there is a possibility of a very ancient machine

6111
04:31:18,120 --> 04:31:20,420
or machines still operating today.

6112
04:31:21,320 --> 04:31:22,180
You betcha.

6113
04:31:24,930 --> 04:31:26,460
You betcha it's operating.

6114
04:31:26,920 --> 04:31:28,340
More than just operating.

6115
04:31:30,740 --> 04:31:31,960
More than just operating.

6116
04:31:34,690 --> 04:31:35,970
Can I ask you a question, Gregg,

6117
04:31:36,990 --> 04:31:40,650
about the signs that we see in front of us basically all the time?

6118
04:31:41,290 --> 04:31:44,670
What about the exit that's always in front of us?

6119
04:31:44,710 --> 04:31:47,550
We always see the exit sign, we see the entrance sign.

6120
04:31:47,970 --> 04:31:48,250
Right.

6121
04:31:48,330 --> 04:31:48,490
Yeah.

6122
04:31:49,290 --> 04:31:51,510
So, you know, what is the exit?

6123
04:31:51,630 --> 04:31:53,430
Is that the tin, the deca?

6124
04:31:54,050 --> 04:31:55,510
What is it showing us?

6125
04:31:55,630 --> 04:31:56,250
Do you have any idea?

6126
04:31:56,850 --> 04:31:57,590
I don't know.

6127
04:31:58,510 --> 04:31:58,850
Okay.

6128
04:31:58,850 --> 04:32:00,390
Good question, thanks.

6129
04:32:01,390 --> 04:32:01,850
Yeah, you're welcome.

6130
04:32:03,730 --> 04:32:05,770
But again, if I were to make one point is,

6131
04:32:06,810 --> 04:32:08,330
again, like Joshua told them,

6132
04:32:08,370 --> 04:32:09,970
you have to pick who you're going to serve.

6133
04:32:10,230 --> 04:32:11,590
Where's your reference point?

6134
04:32:12,290 --> 04:32:15,770
You know, railroad, the standardization of railroad tracks

6135
04:32:15,770 --> 04:32:19,450
is what made the train so prolific.

6136
04:32:22,290 --> 04:32:24,110
So, and I don't mean between,

6137
04:32:24,930 --> 04:32:27,730
I'm talking about between you and society,

6138
04:32:27,730 --> 04:32:29,250
I mean between you and your creator.

6139
04:32:29,650 --> 04:32:33,190
You've got to find a set of rules and you've got to stick to it.

6140
04:32:35,400 --> 04:32:37,100
And you can't get that without studying.

6141
04:32:38,320 --> 04:32:41,080
And when you study, when you go along that path,

6142
04:32:41,120 --> 04:32:43,180
you're going to dig up meanings of words

6143
04:32:43,180 --> 04:32:47,520
and start seeing things in a, let's say, different way.

6144
04:32:52,130 --> 04:32:54,750
You know, and the word believe or beliefs

6145
04:32:54,750 --> 04:32:56,070
will not be in your vocabulary.

6146
04:32:57,410 --> 04:33:00,130
You're going to strive for precision and accuracy.

6147
04:33:04,290 --> 04:33:07,509
So, yeah, I mean, I'd love to eventually,

6148
04:33:08,890 --> 04:33:12,130
as time goes on, I know I will happen to be just like,

6149
04:33:12,650 --> 04:33:14,529
you know, meet more people just like a musician.

6150
04:33:14,790 --> 04:33:17,390
When you play an instrument, you need others to jam with, you know,

6151
04:33:17,869 --> 04:33:21,720
to make music, you know.

6152
04:33:22,380 --> 04:33:25,180
So, but at the same time, those musicians,

6153
04:33:25,400 --> 04:33:27,980
they make a living by being music teachers too, you know.

6154
04:33:29,660 --> 04:33:32,460
Or they, you know, they go on stage or something.

6155
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:34,939
But at the same time, within their time,

6156
04:33:34,939 --> 04:33:36,259
you need others.

6157
04:33:36,580 --> 04:33:39,180
See, everyone's got a piece.

6158
04:33:40,020 --> 04:33:43,580
And it's not only the men and the women individuals

6159
04:33:43,580 --> 04:33:46,560
and the children, but it's also in cultures.

6160
04:33:49,300 --> 04:33:50,500
You know, there are entire cultures

6161
04:33:50,500 --> 04:33:52,200
that hold a piece in their language.

6162
04:33:52,320 --> 04:33:53,880
And it's as clear as day.

6163
04:33:53,939 --> 04:33:55,480
I'd like to give an example of that.

6164
04:33:57,279 --> 04:34:00,419
You know, the scriptures talk about the keys.

6165
04:34:01,180 --> 04:34:02,700
Where are the keys?

6166
04:34:03,460 --> 04:34:04,619
You know, what are the keys?

6167
04:34:04,619 --> 04:34:08,119
Okay, if you go to any Spanish-speaking man or woman

6168
04:34:08,119 --> 04:34:11,240
in any Spanish-speaking country,

6169
04:34:11,720 --> 04:34:13,580
ask them, how do you unlock a door?

6170
04:34:13,700 --> 04:34:15,160
What do you use to unlock a door?

6171
04:34:15,279 --> 04:34:17,160
They're going to tell you, we use the llave.

6172
04:34:17,980 --> 04:34:18,259
Right?

6173
04:34:20,380 --> 04:34:20,740
Yeah.

6174
04:34:24,000 --> 04:34:25,220
I'm glad you got that.

6175
04:34:25,520 --> 04:34:27,419
Because it's just right there, right?

6176
04:34:27,599 --> 04:34:29,020
I mean, it's not, it's a coincidence.

6177
04:34:29,259 --> 04:34:32,300
It coincides with, do you see how it's in,

6178
04:34:32,400 --> 04:34:33,460
it's right in front of us?

6179
04:34:36,310 --> 04:34:38,650
I don't mean to cut in, but I'm going to have to give you

6180
04:34:38,970 --> 04:34:39,290
a couple more minutes.

6181
04:34:39,450 --> 04:34:40,410
I've got to get up quite early.

6182
04:34:40,570 --> 04:34:42,630
And if I close it down, it's going to shut the call down.

6183
04:34:43,830 --> 04:34:45,710
Okay, well, I'm surprised that we're still on.

6184
04:34:46,110 --> 04:34:47,009
I am, too.

6185
04:34:48,009 --> 04:34:49,730
I'm guessing it might be the fifth hour.

6186
04:34:51,169 --> 04:34:51,529
Wow.

6187
04:34:51,630 --> 04:34:53,070
Well, okay, let's...

6188
04:34:53,070 --> 04:34:55,169
Maybe they're listening and they find it enjoyable.

6189
04:34:57,630 --> 04:34:57,990
Sometimes.

6190
04:34:59,490 --> 04:35:03,529
It's just that I have a couple appointments tomorrow

6191
04:35:03,529 --> 04:35:06,470
and I have a computer that I still got to clear up.

6192
04:35:06,650 --> 04:35:07,650
And it's filled with malware

6193
04:35:08,970 --> 04:35:09,849
and I have to work with other computers.

6194
04:35:09,849 --> 04:35:11,270
Oh, I agree. I do the same.

6195
04:35:11,369 --> 04:35:15,470
And another reason, again, why I got into time

6196
04:35:16,110 --> 04:35:18,410
and all that, because when you read in Scripture

6197
04:35:19,290 --> 04:35:21,509
around Leviticus 23 and other parts,

6198
04:35:21,630 --> 04:35:23,130
he says, the Creator says,

6199
04:35:23,189 --> 04:35:24,869
these are my appointed times.

6200
04:35:25,630 --> 04:35:27,210
And they actually do mean appointments.

6201
04:35:28,570 --> 04:35:30,509
So if you don't know how to keep time,

6202
04:35:30,650 --> 04:35:32,450
how are you going to meet your appointment?

6203
04:35:32,610 --> 04:35:34,810
Because he's talking about appointments here on Earth.

6204
04:35:37,740 --> 04:35:39,160
Right? And he's got seven of them.

6205
04:35:39,960 --> 04:35:42,660
And when he says on the first day of the seventh month,

6206
04:35:42,740 --> 04:35:45,080
he's not talking July 1st.

6207
04:35:46,720 --> 04:35:48,320
You see? When he says this time,

6208
04:35:48,740 --> 04:35:50,400
you can't go to a calendar.

6209
04:35:53,939 --> 04:35:56,439
Because, you know, that's just so fake.

6210
04:35:56,520 --> 04:35:57,540
It's faker than fake.

6211
04:35:59,689 --> 04:36:01,930
I don't know if there's a word that's worse than fake

6212
04:36:01,930 --> 04:36:03,590
without using cow dung, you know?

6213
04:36:05,070 --> 04:36:08,169
So you're missing your appointments with your deity

6214
04:36:08,169 --> 04:36:11,090
if you're not in sync with how they want you

6215
04:36:11,090 --> 04:36:13,290
to keep time on Earth at the moment.

6216
04:36:14,090 --> 04:36:15,830
That's another reason that got me to strive.

6217
04:36:15,970 --> 04:36:16,470
Wait a second.

6218
04:36:17,090 --> 04:36:18,529
First day of the seventh month?

6219
04:36:18,890 --> 04:36:21,430
It can't be. I mean, what's going on here?

6220
04:36:22,650 --> 04:36:24,450
It can't be September 1st.

6221
04:36:27,470 --> 04:36:28,849
So that's another thing.

6222
04:36:28,910 --> 04:36:30,450
You'll notice in all your holy writ,

6223
04:36:30,950 --> 04:36:33,090
through all the cultures, there's timekeeping.

6224
04:36:34,029 --> 04:36:37,070
Now, I mentioned earlier the phases of the moon

6225
04:36:37,070 --> 04:36:37,910
are your Sabbaths.

6226
04:36:37,990 --> 04:36:39,470
Well, you know, the Buddhists do that.

6227
04:36:39,610 --> 04:36:41,470
Go study the Buddhist culture.

6228
04:36:41,470 --> 04:36:43,290
They're kind of eliminating it right now,

6229
04:36:43,390 --> 04:36:46,270
but they consider the new moon the full moon

6230
04:36:46,270 --> 04:36:48,910
and the rest, they don't work on each quarter.

6231
04:36:49,630 --> 04:36:51,790
So there's another culture that has a piece, you see?

6232
04:36:54,300 --> 04:36:56,340
There's no reason to be fussing and fighting.

6233
04:36:57,680 --> 04:36:59,700
We just got to look around and learn.

6234
04:37:00,360 --> 04:37:02,599
They consider the new moon the full moon.

6235
04:37:03,580 --> 04:37:05,240
The full moon is the new moon, yeah.

6236
04:37:06,160 --> 04:37:07,259
The Buddhists know that.

6237
04:37:07,320 --> 04:37:10,320
Go look up Buddhist cultures and what days they take off.

6238
04:37:10,400 --> 04:37:11,759
They go by the quarter of the moon.

6239
04:37:11,759 --> 04:37:13,700
So what do they call the dark moon?

6240
04:37:15,960 --> 04:37:17,080
That's the middle of the month.

6241
04:37:20,480 --> 04:37:22,480
The dark moon is the middle of the month

6242
04:37:22,919 --> 04:37:25,320
because the middle of the month always comes around

6243
04:37:25,320 --> 04:37:27,140
the 14th or 15th of the month.

6244
04:37:28,840 --> 04:37:31,140
So when they were in Egypt, leaving around that time,

6245
04:37:31,200 --> 04:37:33,580
he gave them the pillar of fire so they had light.

6246
04:37:33,860 --> 04:37:34,960
It says it very clearly.

6247
04:37:35,700 --> 04:37:41,119
Now, if you reckon the new moon as being the dark moon

6248
04:37:41,119 --> 04:37:42,939
by the middle of the month, you've got a full moon.

6249
04:37:43,140 --> 04:37:48,279
So it doesn't make any sense to use that.

6250
04:37:48,919 --> 04:37:52,580
So why would you need a pillar of fire for light?

6251
04:37:54,180 --> 04:37:57,180
And also if you look at the Egyptian culture back in those days,

6252
04:37:57,240 --> 04:38:01,779
it was a bad omen to leave your city during the dark moon.

6253
04:38:03,099 --> 04:38:05,140
You had to wait for it to get out of that phase.

6254
04:38:07,759 --> 04:38:11,520
So they broke the cultural thing that they were looking at.

6255
04:38:11,880 --> 04:38:13,700
They didn't have flashlights and beacons.

6256
04:38:15,259 --> 04:38:16,599
No, you had a light.

6257
04:38:17,619 --> 04:38:19,900
The light was the light of the fire.

6258
04:38:20,900 --> 04:38:22,960
And in the desert, can you imagine?

6259
04:38:23,720 --> 04:38:24,800
It was very dark.

6260
04:38:25,320 --> 04:38:27,380
There were probably shadows with the full moon.

6261
04:38:28,400 --> 04:38:29,259
Here's the thing.

6262
04:38:30,300 --> 04:38:37,680
People, life today, these signs have been shut down on a large level.

6263
04:38:38,740 --> 04:38:41,340
And Christ even said that you will have no signs,

6264
04:38:41,460 --> 04:38:43,520
just the sign of Jonah, which is the fish.

6265
04:38:44,180 --> 04:38:47,259
But in the end, which we're rolling into it,

6266
04:38:47,540 --> 04:38:50,599
there are going to be these signs again in the heavens,

6267
04:38:50,740 --> 04:38:51,880
and you've got to look up.

6268
04:38:52,240 --> 04:38:53,400
No one's looking up.

6269
04:38:54,460 --> 04:38:55,880
Everyone's just looking around,

6270
04:38:56,040 --> 04:38:58,980
within five feet in front of their nose, and that's about it.

6271
04:38:59,439 --> 04:39:01,439
But these things are going to start coming back.

6272
04:39:01,500 --> 04:39:04,279
Not exactly how they were, but you're going to have signs in the heavens.

6273
04:39:04,939 --> 04:39:06,320
Jeremiah 10 tells you that.

6274
04:39:06,400 --> 04:39:08,119
Don't be afraid of the signs in the heavens.

6275
04:39:11,160 --> 04:39:13,500
The people with no covenants will.

6276
04:39:13,500 --> 04:39:14,520
They're going to be scared.

6277
04:39:14,660 --> 04:39:15,240
You know what?

6278
04:39:19,500 --> 04:39:22,939
Is that also considering like clouds and things like that?

6279
04:39:23,040 --> 04:39:24,779
I don't know about everybody else,

6280
04:39:24,860 --> 04:39:27,240
but I see a lot of signs in the clouds all the time.

6281
04:39:28,700 --> 04:39:31,660
Yeah, the Hopi's got the web weavers, they call them.

6282
04:39:33,320 --> 04:39:35,900
It could either mean the railroad tracks or up above.

6283
04:39:36,340 --> 04:39:39,700
Now I'm talking about major stuff like stuff in the stars,

6284
04:39:39,700 --> 04:39:42,680
just like Abraham went to reckon the stars,

6285
04:39:43,720 --> 04:39:44,760
and he reckoned well.

6286
04:39:44,880 --> 04:39:48,600
He reckoned a particular female set of stars, Virgo, very well,

6287
04:39:48,680 --> 04:39:50,340
which shows up in Revelation 12,

6288
04:39:50,900 --> 04:39:54,020
which happens to be the reckoning of the day that Christ was born.

6289
04:39:54,480 --> 04:39:55,240
Pretty accurate.

6290
04:39:55,800 --> 04:39:56,940
Seventh month, too.

6291
04:39:58,440 --> 04:40:00,280
Yeah, it happens to be around Tabernacle.

6292
04:40:00,500 --> 04:40:03,000
It's when the moon is at her feet and the stars are at her head,

6293
04:40:03,380 --> 04:40:04,780
and she's cloaked with the sun,

6294
04:40:04,860 --> 04:40:07,420
and it ends up being September 11th, 3 B.C.

6295
04:40:09,880 --> 04:40:11,400
You know, that we know.

6296
04:40:11,780 --> 04:40:13,900
Number 11, there's no such thing,

6297
04:40:13,940 --> 04:40:16,460
but if you reckon it in the Gregorian calendar,

6298
04:40:16,580 --> 04:40:18,180
it's September 11th, 3 B.C.

6299
04:40:20,040 --> 04:40:21,520
It's when the Christ was born,

6300
04:40:22,060 --> 04:40:28,100
and that was shown to Abraham in Chapter 15,

6301
04:40:28,400 --> 04:40:29,660
and if you look later,

6302
04:40:29,860 --> 04:40:33,020
he sends 12 of his sons to the east with the bullet.

6303
04:40:33,900 --> 04:40:37,140
The conference is scheduled to be broken down automatically in...

6304
04:40:37,140 --> 04:40:37,400
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

6305
04:40:39,800 --> 04:40:40,480
5 minutes.

6306
04:40:43,320 --> 04:40:44,400
I don't know how to press star 8.

6307
04:40:44,500 --> 04:40:45,140
I don't have star 8.

6308
04:40:46,040 --> 04:40:48,500
I think we need to...

6309
04:40:49,820 --> 04:40:52,300
Anyway, because I know...

6310
04:40:52,300 --> 04:40:53,940
Yeah, I got to do some stuff.

6311
04:40:54,040 --> 04:40:57,540
I mean, it's been a pleasure, and thank you for the...

6312
04:40:57,540 --> 04:40:59,280
Hey, J.D., let us know...

6313
04:40:59,280 --> 04:41:00,740
Thank you for coming, Greg, J.D.

6314
04:41:00,760 --> 04:41:02,580
Let us know when he's coming back, send us a mail,

6315
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:04,560
because this is real good stuff.

6316
04:41:05,020 --> 04:41:06,160
I definitely will.

6317
04:41:09,000 --> 04:41:10,320
Yeah, maybe I can connect...

6318
04:41:11,520 --> 04:41:12,940
Yeah, you can connect with Gary

6319
04:41:12,940 --> 04:41:17,000
and find out when we can get him back on.

6320
04:41:17,400 --> 04:41:20,000
Yeah, if you could shoot Gary an e-mail,

6321
04:41:20,580 --> 04:41:22,280
and then we'll schedule you in.

6322
04:41:22,380 --> 04:41:24,020
It's been a pleasure, and thank you for the knowledge.

6323
04:41:24,100 --> 04:41:25,480
Sorry we couldn't extend it longer.

6324
04:41:28,700 --> 04:41:34,160
Hello? Hello?

6325
04:41:35,220 --> 04:41:35,820
Is it dropped?

6326
04:41:37,100 --> 04:41:38,660
I don't see him. Dropped.

6327
04:41:41,530 --> 04:41:42,610
Mr. Greek, you still on?

6328
04:41:47,790 --> 04:41:49,410
Are you, Larry? Is that you?

6329
04:41:50,030 --> 04:41:51,530
Yeah, can you hear me?

6330
04:41:51,610 --> 04:41:53,370
Did you guys hear that call from TalkShoe?

6331
04:41:53,450 --> 04:41:54,310
Did it beep on your end?

6332
04:41:54,510 --> 04:41:54,850
Yeah.

6333
04:41:55,610 --> 04:41:56,010
Okay.

6334
04:41:56,970 --> 04:41:58,910
Well, maybe that was his Skype phone.

6335
04:42:00,850 --> 04:42:01,290
I don't know.

6336
04:42:01,290 --> 04:42:03,450
No, it said that this is TalkShoe.

6337
04:42:03,630 --> 04:42:06,130
It'll be ended in that many minutes,

6338
04:42:06,170 --> 04:42:08,010
press star-8, but I don't have no star-8

6339
04:42:08,010 --> 04:42:09,370
or an extension on my end,

6340
04:42:09,430 --> 04:42:13,230
because I'm on the actual web interface.

6341
04:42:13,650 --> 04:42:15,210
Okay, well, his telephone dropped

6342
04:42:15,210 --> 04:42:16,590
according to my computer screen.

6343
04:42:18,270 --> 04:42:19,130
He's still on.

6344
04:42:19,810 --> 04:42:20,290
Kat.

6345
04:42:21,310 --> 04:42:22,990
Everybody, you have a wonderful night,

6346
04:42:24,030 --> 04:42:26,810
and we will reconvene here next week,

6347
04:42:28,170 --> 04:42:30,330
next Sunday, I think the 23rd.

6348
04:42:30,730 --> 04:42:32,370
Right. Thanks, J.D.

6349
04:42:32,870 --> 04:42:34,770
I'm sorry it's late for you.

6350
04:42:36,330 --> 04:42:37,570
Yeah, and then we have these,

6351
04:42:37,730 --> 04:42:39,070
I need to talk to TalkShoe,

6352
04:42:39,130 --> 04:42:40,810
because there's some guests that come in here,

6353
04:42:40,910 --> 04:42:42,510
and I might have to have everybody register,

6354
04:42:42,650 --> 04:42:45,690
because they put their name down

6355
04:42:45,690 --> 04:42:46,550
on certain things,

6356
04:42:47,650 --> 04:42:49,590
and they post stuff in the chat

6357
04:42:50,210 --> 04:42:51,010
that's inappropriate,

6358
04:42:51,490 --> 04:42:53,430
and it keeps on coming in over and over again.

6359
04:42:53,770 --> 04:42:57,390
So they're not really part of our group, so to speak.

6360
04:42:58,170 --> 04:42:59,670
No, it's just a young kid,

6361
04:43:00,170 --> 04:43:02,070
so I have to keep on constantly doing it,

6362
04:43:02,110 --> 04:43:03,290
because they put vulgarity,

6363
04:43:03,690 --> 04:43:06,150
and I have the ability to block guest participation,

6364
04:43:06,530 --> 04:43:08,190
which will make everybody forced to register,

6365
04:43:08,330 --> 04:43:09,510
then it's easier to block the people

6366
04:43:09,510 --> 04:43:10,710
that cause trouble, you know?

6367
04:43:12,030 --> 04:43:14,130
But I don't want to limit the same time

6368
04:43:14,130 --> 04:43:17,690
with the people that don't have an account,

6369
04:43:17,910 --> 04:43:19,610
but they probably need to just go

6370
04:43:19,610 --> 04:43:20,990
and sign up on the TalkShoe website,

6371
04:43:21,170 --> 04:43:22,350
and then they have their account and log in,

6372
04:43:22,410 --> 04:43:23,330
and it's just easier that way.

6373
04:43:26,010 --> 04:43:27,810
Well, you have a great weekend.

6374
04:43:28,590 --> 04:43:30,510
You too. Everybody, thank you very much

6375
04:43:30,510 --> 04:43:31,570
for being a part of the show.

6376
04:43:32,090 --> 04:43:34,390
Thank you, J.D. Appreciate what you do.

6377
04:43:35,710 --> 04:43:36,510
I try.

6378
04:43:37,990 --> 04:43:39,090
Thank you, J.D., as well.

6379
04:43:39,230 --> 04:43:40,790
This is Robert. I've never met you before,

6380
04:43:40,890 --> 04:43:42,510
but thanks for putting this call together.

6381
04:43:43,670 --> 04:43:44,390
No problem.

6382
04:43:44,390 --> 04:43:46,290
Thank you for joining the show.

6383
04:43:46,390 --> 04:43:49,430
If you have time, go and look at the prior calls

6384
04:43:49,990 --> 04:43:51,430
on the TalkShoe site.

6385
04:43:53,810 --> 04:43:54,350
I'm going to.

6386
04:43:55,070 --> 04:43:55,790
Thank you.

6387
04:43:56,530 --> 04:43:57,010
Thanks.

6388
04:43:59,090 --> 04:44:00,130
Everybody have a good night,

6389
04:44:00,170 --> 04:44:00,770
and God bless you.

6390
04:44:01,630 --> 04:44:04,610
Shalom, prosper, and be in perfect divine health.

6391
04:44:05,530 --> 04:44:05,690
Yes.

6392
04:44:06,650 --> 04:44:07,070
Good night.

6393
04:44:07,190 --> 04:44:11,030
Yes. Amen. Bye-bye.

6394
04:44:11,830 --> 04:44:12,090
Bye.

6395
04:44:12,510 --> 04:44:12,690
Bye.
