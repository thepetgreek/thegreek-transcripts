1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,780
All right, everyone, so I'm very, very, very happy to announce that I have The Greek on

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,240
my show.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,020
Also co-hosting is Daniel Sala out in Romania.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Very happy to have you.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,700
Greek, you reached out to me, so people have a little bit of background context, because

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:37,780
I am a, as you call, a seeker, and you would email and call and just load me down with

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,040
such information, it would literally just stop the rest of my day, and I just, I've

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,360
never had anything, any information come to me that really made everything that I've experienced

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,940
or seen or learned in life that much clearer.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
It's so much mental clarity all at once, the things you would just volunteer to me,

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,940
that it truly is mind-blowing, and I think that what you're doing is on another level,

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,880
which I'm sure you would think is sad, because humanity has been just dumbed down or is this

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,660
disposable race in so many words, as you would say, but if we could just jump right into,

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,600
I have a channel that talks all about space and the elites, maybe if you could give a

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,580
background on, I don't know, who's running the world, why, and TRB3s or something, we

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,320
can start in that.

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,660
I'll just get to intertwine.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:28,900
Anyway.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,920
That's very broad.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,680
I don't need to, there's no introduction necessary for who I am, because it's actually, I'm kind

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,500
of embarrassed to say 90% of what I'm saying, because it should be obvious to most, but

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:41,960
it's not.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:49,140
I don't think there's any elite, and the TRB3 throw in there, I think that would probably

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,900
be brought up maybe eight hours of conversation later, way down the road, because there's

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,140
so many things in what's considered in the common framework, the reality framework of

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:07,639
the mainstream human that is lacking, that just, to talk about the advanced sciences

27
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,800
and things like that is just way, way, way out.

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,760
The amount of background that needs to be laid down for just basic, basic human existence

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,340
in any field is so lacking, and that's what I've been trying to put out to, quote, unquote,

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,080
other humans, if they're considered as such.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
The basic human existence.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,080
Let's just, we'll start there.

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,900
Oh, okay.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,660
Can you be a little more specific, because-

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,480
How did this, I guess, epoch get here, and why?

36
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,380
Isn't this like the fifth time humans populated the earth, or from what I've tried to gather,

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,720
or?

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,920
Well, that's, again, another big question.

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,560
I don't want to seem evasive.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Okay, let's just, I want to just go back.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,420
Maybe let's just, these are really big questions, and I'm able to answer four or five questions

42
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,800
at the same time, and I just can't do it as such, so a little background.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,640
We first met, I was looking at the internet, and I commented on one of the videos you did

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,800
with Daniel Sala regarding the Bucedge Mountains discoveries, I think the Peter Moon book,

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,080
so on and so forth, Romania, and the entire saga, which probably still continues, and

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,280
you left a phone number, and what's interesting is when people leave a phone number, it harkens

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,060
back to the old days, right, if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,840
No email, no texting, you just call me on the phone, right, and we continued from there.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,060
One thing, just to throw out, I'm kind of evading the question that you asked about

50
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,320
the human saga, because it's just so big, that it has to be run backwards.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,940
People are so disconnected from even any basic knowledge of themselves, that to throw in

52
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,280
where they came from and whatever is, it's kind of like the sprinkles on the cupcake,

53
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,900
but there's no cupcake at this point, you see?

54
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,760
Yes.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,620
So just to go back again, to be objective is very difficult, because as we, you mentioned

56
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,660
the TR3B and where we come from, as we continue, you'll see how fluid this reality is, and

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,760
it's framed in another reality, let's say.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,060
But in the meantime, my vantage point is as if I'm visiting this planet, taking notes,

59
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,860
kind of scouting out what's going on, actually, let me just give you a couple of paraphrases

60
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,460
here and analogies, I'm doing this cosmic newsletter about what's going on on the Earth,

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,020
and it doesn't go to humans, it goes to others outside of the Earth, right?

62
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,500
So it gets very interesting, because this is not something I'm asking people to believe,

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,440
it's not meant for Earth people, I'm kind of reporting on what's going on here, and it's

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
kind of embarrassing, let's just say, right?

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,500
So why not focus on what people can do, what they can access, you know, who they are, just

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,680
basic knowledge here, because it's kind of hypocritical to discuss on what's going on

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
on Earth to others, when the situation is so ridiculous, take some time out and just

68
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,320
go back to the humans and tell them, hey, you know, you're missing about 99% of everything.

69
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,560
So let me give you an example.

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,440
There's something called tradition, custom, culture, right?

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,680
And this is what you're getting trapped in all the time.

72
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,040
For example, I am a heavy, not just critic, because just to criticize is not really good.

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,320
So you have to give constructive criticism, basically, if you point out something that's

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,940
negative, you should have at least two or three positives to back it up and remedy the

75
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,760
situation, right?

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,940
And that's the vantage point that I always take.

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,660
So let me give you an analogy of what's going on on Earth without using, without directly

78
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,860
saying what's going on on Earth.

79
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,360
So I visited this other world, and they have a custom there, everyone on the planet, they

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
put a thumbtack down on the seat or the chair before they sit.

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,800
And they're fleshy beings, and it's actually very painful.

82
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:11,060
So this entire industry was developed to develop this Kevlar or bulletproof underwear that everyone

83
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,000
would have to buy.

84
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,220
So they put this on, so before they sat on the seat, the thumbtack wouldn't penetrate

85
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,700
and it wouldn't be so bad.

86
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,680
So when I found out about this, I said, well, why don't you just stop putting thumbtacks

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,300
on chairs?

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,180
And they said, you're actually attacking our society by saying that.

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,200
And not only that, when the companies that were making the Kevlar underwear found out,

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,860
they wanted to, you know, obviously get rid of me because I was now messing up their business.

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,500
Do you see this analogy?

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,200
No, I understand that.

93
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,660
And that, in so many words, that's the whole reason why I'm just so upset.

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,440
That's my main malfunction in life.

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,920
That's why I sit and wonder and think at night, is why these industries wouldn't want to start

96
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,540
a new, you know, yes, there would be the death of, let's say, oil and gas or the death of,

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't know, you know, windmills and other stuff, because there is free energy, things

98
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,040
like Tesla.

99
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,820
But that's true.

100
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,160
New industries, and I'm sure they could, with their power and minutia could stay on top

101
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,660
of that.

102
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,840
You know, it's like, I feel we're being kept down by design.

103
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,200
Right.

104
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,980
Well, that's much later on in the conversation, because what happens when you get into more

105
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,960
existential topics, free energy, how many times we've been here, who we are and all

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,240
this.

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,900
We're basically, I'm going to try to say this as kindly as possible, giving it to a juvenile

108
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,540
mind that hasn't been conditioned, lacks the discipline and the information to do anything

109
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,520
with the information.

110
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,300
Give me an example.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,480
You walk into a, let's say, a first grader elementary school, you know, six, seven year

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,660
olds, there's 30 of them sitting, and you start discussing astrophysics, you're, let's

113
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,720
say you're an astrophysics scientist, and you start discussing astrophysics with these

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,100
five year olds for an hour.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,560
And they're all sitting quietly, they're all very attentive.

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,220
And after an hour, you say, does anyone have any questions?

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,720
And they all raise their hands and they say, well, what's the question?

118
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,320
Do you have any candy?

119
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,300
Completely irrelevant.

120
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:09,740
Yeah.

121
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,280
Yeah.

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,540
You see, so these people are asking, in other words, that I see on the internet, one of

123
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,840
the things I keep looking for is, you know, on the pushing, who's pushing the fringe,

124
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,120
right?

125
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,660
And I found the videos that you guys did, I mentioned again, on the book reviews that

126
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,180
Daniel Sala did so well.

127
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
And he actually did a bang up job better than at most, about 99% of the stuff you'll ever

128
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
find on the internet.

129
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,520
Because he framed it, he framed it in a realistic way.

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,980
What was, okay, so without getting on that, the humans at this point, they need to come

131
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,300
up at least to a third or fourth grade level.

132
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,300
And then we can discuss energy problems on and on and on and on.

133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
And actually, by the time you get to the third or fourth grade level, let's say I'm using

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,540
the, let's say the K through 12 analogy, right, which is kindergarten through 12th grade.

135
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,620
We can get an education also.

136
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,140
So the topics that must be covered, it takes a very long time to give the background, but

137
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,500
you do it in shorthand, is everything about, for example, the human body, how it really

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,940
works.

139
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,000
That's kind of important because you spend most of your time in it, your environment.

140
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Then you look into more mental systems like governments, religions, how to gather information,

141
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,760
how to discern.

142
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,300
And then they go back to the physical world.

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,280
So these are the things that I've been discussing for over a decade publicly and privately.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,280
I've kind of given up on doing it publicly, of course, because there's no audience for

145
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,520
it.

146
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,720
Again, it's the same reason there's no audience for the people that buy the bulletproof underwear

147
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,560
instead of just not sitting on the thumbtack.

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:49,760
But anyway.

149
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,880
No, there is, you can't unite, that's the thing.

150
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,000
With censorship and I guess angry or jealous or shitty people, it's people like Daniel

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,580
Saleh and I, we want to come together.

152
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,320
We want to sit.

153
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,660
We want to, you know, I understand you have just so much more information.

154
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm not trying to kiss your ass or anything, I'm just saying like, no, no, or like the

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,940
father figure I've always cared for that has information and all right.

156
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,800
Let me just interject one thing.

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,620
One thing that I kept hammering to you is go back and listen to some, there's a series

158
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,360
online called Ocelli and the Greek.

159
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,700
That's a brief overview of stuff that I did a while back.

160
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,020
None of it is scripted.

161
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,000
There's no outlines.

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:29,880
Right?

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,140
Actually, if I'm not going to get compensated, I'm not going to sit down and write an outline

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,340
or a script because it takes a lot of time because you have to provide everything, which

165
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,700
I want to maybe drop some images in if we continue.

166
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,080
I don't know how long we want to go.

167
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,820
And it doesn't seem like, I feel sorry for the listeners right now because we've been

168
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,160
on for a few minutes and it doesn't seem like I've said anything.

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,340
So let's maybe get into it.

170
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,100
Pick a topic.

171
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,340
Any topic.

172
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,700
I'm assuming an elite and they had the silver tube with the map about crossing the Atlantic.

173
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,620
Can we start there?

174
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,400
That's way down the road.

175
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
That's way down the road.

176
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,940
I prepared some stuff if you want.

177
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,680
Yeah, Dan.

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:06,900
Sure.

179
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,540
Well, you mentioned I only got to three or four of your Ocelli videos or I should say

180
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,620
a podcast, but I did take some notes and one of the things that brought up is that it all

181
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,520
comes down, this human life to the quality of food, clothes, and shelter.

182
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,180
Yes.

183
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,840
And would you say that, well, I wasn't quite clear on the clothes part.

184
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,640
Was it just aesthetic or was it comfort or was it something else?

185
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,160
The food, clothing, and shelter, because the first thing would be food sustenance.

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,820
And then there would be clothing because we're the only quote unquote beings that don't have

187
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,680
any covering, right?

188
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,360
You see the deer, the horse, the cow, the monkey, they're all born, they're ready to

189
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,780
go, right?

190
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,580
They don't go shopping for clothing.

191
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,240
So comfortable clothing and then shelter, of course, because the elements are very harsh

192
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,660
to us.

193
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,900
So let me just interject one thing.

194
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,820
A lot of people, this is a catchphrase that I use to see who can be drawn into going to

195
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,600
the next level.

196
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,720
And what I mean by that is some people say to me, Greek, that sounds too basic.

197
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,620
That's so simple.

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,300
It sounds like it's irrelevant because it's so simple.

199
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,140
I said, yes, it is.

200
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,620
And it's on purpose because if you're seeking the highest quality foods, the intake, the

201
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,900
highest quality clothes and shelter, of course, that you want to afford and have access to,

202
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,580
in that journey to find the highest quality of those things, you will learn so many other

203
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,920
things that you will become more all encompassing.

204
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,660
That's basically what it comes down to, I would guess.

205
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,900
And it's actually synonymous with learning what makes you healthy, right, in life?

206
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,280
That's another thing, healthy.

207
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,740
There's no such thing as being healthy.

208
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,780
There's different levels of health depending on what you're doing in life.

209
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,000
For example, if you want to go climb the tallest mountains, you're going to have to develop

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,540
a type of health that will allow you to do that, right?

211
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,380
If you're going to be a mountain climber, if you're going to be a professional, let's

212
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,140
say bicycle racer, that's a different type of health.

213
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,580
If you're just going to be sedentary, then sitting back and watching TV and drinking

214
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,140
beer and junk food is just fine, right?

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,440
So when you say healthy, what are you trying to do with your body?

216
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,880
What part of the world, what are you doing?

217
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,500
If you want to be a construction worker, let's say, that's a different level of health.

218
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,040
If you have a bad back or bad feet, you won't be able to do that, you see?

219
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,060
Well, my definition of health is being able to think with perfect clarity, I mean with

220
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,780
maximum clarity.

221
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,340
And it does, the way I see it, depend on all these things like food and shelter.

222
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,440
And it's not a multitude of things.

223
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,400
The way I see it is one variable.

224
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,740
Okay, let me just interject.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,840
To have clarity, let's just say, use the visual analogy.

226
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,380
If you want to see with a far perspective and someone just comes a few meters in front

227
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,400
of you and pulls up a black shade or a blanket, it cuts off your vision, right?

228
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,940
And you're being blocked.

229
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,560
So that opaque block or veil, let's say, is the cultures and traditions that people are

230
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,140
engrossed in and you've been raised in.

231
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,820
Once you remove that and you could see through the cultures and traditions and what you're

232
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,580
being told from a young child on any topic doesn't make any sense, you will spend a lot

233
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,820
of energy moving that veil to the side so you could see beyond it.

234
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,980
And it's very, very, it's so easy to do that when I see people not do it, I see it as a

235
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,740
form of extreme laziness, stubbornness, rebelliousness.

236
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,380
And it's very obvious.

237
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,660
Here, let's just make this a video about secrets.

238
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,460
Let me give you some standard Greek speak stuff that I usually steamroll people with, okay?

239
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,320
So what I've been doing lately is for the past few years, I stopped now, I used to call

240
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,860
the physics department and the air conditioning and heating contractors.

241
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,940
And I used to ask them, I said, how many people called you yesterday about developing devices

242
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,980
that make a rising cold and a descending heat for their cars, planes, boats, and their homes

243
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,780
so that they don't have a hot head and cold feet.

244
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,140
And they don't even know what I'm talking about.

245
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,340
I said, really, you don't have any demand?

246
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,580
You see, because in natural systems, the cold rises and the heat descends, right?

247
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,380
If you're in the valley, it's hot, you go up to the mountain, it's cold.

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,440
And if you call a medical technician, calling them doctors is really not due, but, and you

249
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,880
call him and he can't see you and you say, I have a hot head and cold feet.

250
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,980
He doesn't need to see you to say you're not feeling well.

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,320
So in all natural biological systems, the cold is rarefied and it rises and the heat

252
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,940
is densified and it descends.

253
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,160
So how many earth inhabitants are calling their technicians to demand devices for climate

254
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,580
control that make an ascending, rising cold and a descending, densifying heat so they

255
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,600
don't have a hot head and cold feet and they have a more healthful condition.

256
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,140
I know this sounds, this is a secret.

257
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't tell anyone please, right?

258
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,120
That in nature, cold rises and heat descends, you know, that's, you know, if that secret

259
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,960
ever gets out, we're in trouble, right?

260
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,360
Well, we might be censored.

261
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
Do you see why my sarcasm is due in this one, right?

262
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,560
You know, we can go into, for example, timekeeping.

263
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,760
There's a form of navigation, whether you get out of bed and go to the bathroom or the

264
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,120
kitchen or whether you're traveling across the world, in order to navigate, you need

265
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,100
to know your distance, your speed and your time, okay, to do it properly or to be able

266
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,580
to record it or document.

267
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,840
We have an element of something we call time.

268
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,460
Some people say it does exist.

269
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Some people say it doesn't, whatever.

270
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,080
Actually time does not exist.

271
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,960
What we call as time is the recordation of events.

272
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,480
When we record events, we use a nomenclature, just like we have the metric system and the

273
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,400
English system, we use time.

274
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,540
That's all.

275
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,780
When people say it doesn't exist, it's actually a method of recording an event.

276
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,700
So here, when you look at the entire world being on what I call sarcastically the Pope's

277
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,540
work schedule, which is Monday through Friday, January through December, they always give

278
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:18,900
an out.

279
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,700
You know, when you take a multiple choice question and answer test, you have the question and

280
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,599
you have four possible answers.

281
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,220
Now, hopefully no one here is ignorant enough to think that all those answers are true.

282
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,600
You have to pick one of them, right?

283
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,480
Well, so the number four comes up very reasonably and most everyone is failing because if you

284
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,040
look at September, it means seven.

285
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,020
October means eight, like octopus and octagon.

286
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,060
Nova means nine and December means 10.

287
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,840
But everyone is writing it as September as nine, you see October as 10.

288
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,240
So they're giving it and no one is paying attention.

289
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,820
We had a school that we had Julius Caesar stick in June and July.

290
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,500
You see it like to mess that up.

291
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,080
Oh yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,960
That's what we're told.

293
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:02,980
Right.

294
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,220
So, but what happens with this, it's coded.

295
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,640
It's a code.

296
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,300
So when someone says I'm an atheist, you ask them what day it is and they tell you anything

297
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,200
between Monday through Friday or January through December, they're Catholic.

298
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,680
It's code.

299
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,140
It means like they're okay with the Pope.

300
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,800
They don't know it.

301
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,940
You don't have to know it or not.

302
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm not saying you shouldn't be okay with the Pope, even though it is a ridiculous institution.

303
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,220
The far side of it is when you're a human, let's say moving around on this planet and

304
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,640
you are basically on a celestial body, the shape of it is irrelevant.

305
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,080
The lawful way of keeping time, when I say lawful is astronomical.

306
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,260
What I mean by that is it doesn't matter when you live, if you measure time astronomically,

307
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,460
no matter where you are, whoever you're communicating this timeframe to in the future, they will

308
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
comprehend it.

309
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,300
Right?

310
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:02,720
So what I sarcastically laugh at, the clock is I call the wind up toy known as the mechanical

311
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,420
clock and then the Pope's work schedule.

312
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,760
So it's very simple.

313
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,780
If anyone here is old enough to remember years ago, I'm going to bounce around a little.

314
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,320
Before the electronics banking conventions, if you deposited a check in the bank after

315
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,660
noon, after 12 o'clock, they counted it as the next day.

316
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:30,180
If you go to the astronomical university curriculums and astronomical timekeeping, or if you go

317
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,700
to the Greenwich meantime website or the Naval Observatory, these are the timekeeping references.

318
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,520
They tell you the day starts at solar noon and they even are sarcastic about it.

319
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,160
They say for scientific and astronomical reasons, but for the people it's midnight.

320
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,140
That's like saying back in the early days when, let's say Webster's dictionary, they

321
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
weren't showing how to structure definitions.

322
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,860
They had a little bit of sarcasm in there also.

323
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,380
If you looked up the word oats, it said oats, you know, which is a grain.

324
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,580
It's what we feed horses in England, but it's the staple of the people of Scotland, basically

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,840
comparing the Scots to their horses.

326
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,700
And this is being done constantly.

327
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,340
You could see the sarcasm in society.

328
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,300
Okay.

329
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,780
The other thing, you mentioned Julius Caesar, we can get into that also.

330
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,700
Your month, give me an example.

331
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,280
For thousands of years, people settled their debts with the full moon.

332
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,600
The full moon is the new moon.

333
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,540
I can explain why.

334
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,940
Not the dark moon, maybe at another time.

335
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,140
So they settled their debts with the full moon when it came around.

336
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,340
It rises in the east like the sun and all that.

337
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,820
That is the new moon.

338
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,980
That's when the month starts.

339
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,460
Actually, if you look at the Pope's work schedule and the calendrical system, they kind of are

340
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,060
very similar.

341
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,900
That's why today when you have, let's say what they call bills for utilities and other things,

342
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,380
don't you get a monthly bill?

343
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,600
Don't they ask you to settle your bills still traditionally with the monthly?

344
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,380
Get it?

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,080
Okay.

346
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,400
So everything has drifted off.

347
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,940
Here's something that's completely ridiculous and how the population is being made fun of,

348
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,160
just like the people of Scotland being compared to horses.

349
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,240
They have this thing called a blue moon or something, where you have two full moons in

350
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,580
a month.

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,940
That is so stupid.

352
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,040
That is such an oxymoron because the actual moon defines when the month starts and ends.

353
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,700
It's not possible.

354
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,440
It's astronomically and lawfully impossible to have two full moons in one month.

355
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,800
And it's just a way to make fun of people.

356
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,040
And after a while, it's kind of like, you ever see when a young child's being bullied

357
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,800
and you just can't take it anymore and you have to step in?

358
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes.

359
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,840
You just get fed up with frustration, like that's it.

360
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,500
And then, yeah.

361
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,240
Right.

362
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,880
And yeah.

363
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,640
So I just mentioned the differences in the temperature directions, how they move in natural

364
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,120
biological systems, whether it's plant, animal or the atmosphere.

365
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,780
No one is paying any attention.

366
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,760
No one is paying attention to timekeeping.

367
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,500
We can go on and on and on and on and on about all subjects.

368
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,740
Religions are very important also, because right now you're under what's called the entire

369
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,180
world.

370
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,320
If you look at the history, and I'm not going to get into it too much, but the history of

371
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
the earth, which is written basically by atheists, academics.

372
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,180
Most academics are atheists.

373
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,660
How do I know?

374
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,440
Well, just ask them.

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,140
They tell you.

376
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,480
The historians, they call this the Christian era.

377
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,100
The Christian era.

378
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Well, wait a second.

379
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,120
If the atheist historians are labeling that we live in the Christian era, whatever, 20,

380
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,920
22 AD.

381
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,800
Don't they do that?

382
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,040
Right?

383
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,900
And BC?

384
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,100
It's not a religious thing, but if you've never heard of Christianity and you run over

385
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,660
to what it is, even like Lao Tzu said, this world is run not by words and laws and knowledge,

386
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,720
but by symbolism.

387
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,820
When you are first visiting this planet and you find out that their academics are calling

388
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,660
it the Christian era, the first thing you're going to notice is this Christian symbol,

389
00:22:59,820 --> 00:22:59,920
right?

390
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,920
You know, the crucifix and all that, right?

391
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,500
So you're not from here, so you're reasonably intelligent.

392
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,420
So you're going to say, well, where does this supposedly come from?

393
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,520
And they all say it comes from the Bible and then, of course, you'll see history.

394
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,780
And so you go ahead and you read the Bible and you see that this has something to do

395
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,340
with a very specific entity known as Yahweh.

396
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,660
And he basically, the Bible is very simple.

397
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
He says, there are all these gods that all these nations are following, and I don't have

398
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,560
a nation for myself.

399
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,580
So he goes to Abraham and he says, hey, look, your descendants are going to be my people.

400
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
They're going to have an allegiance to me, right?

401
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,140
And he says, okay, let's do it.

402
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,220
That's what it's about.

403
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,900
So if you're not part of that, it's got nothing to do with you.

404
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
It's a hijacked document.

405
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,680
Anyway, as you go further on, one of the supermen, let's say, or super being that's going to

406
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,380
be sent to the earth through this lineage to show mankind what happens after you die

407
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,360
eventually, you know, was known as the Christ.

408
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,040
And who is, you can dub as Yahshua ben Joseph or on and on.

409
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,360
And what's interesting, his name is Yahshua.

410
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,320
And I don't know why they call him J-E-S-U-S, because the sixth book of the Bible is the

411
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,100
book of Yahshua.

412
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,500
They should just call him Yahshua.

413
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,300
So calling him J-E-S-U-S right away is another code to show that no one is paying attention

414
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,600
and they're just going for whatever they're told to do.

415
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,600
So the first thing you should say is you need to make a correction.

416
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,940
There is no J-E-S-U-S.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,260
You already have the book of Yahshua, just call him Yahshua.

418
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,760
That's his name, Yahshua ben Joseph.

419
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,460
But no, we can't do that.

420
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,660
So here's the other thing.

421
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,360
They show you this guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper, right?

422
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,220
That's the Christian symbolism.

423
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,960
But remember, we're not from here, so we're reasonably intelligent.

424
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,940
So we go back and we read the biblical text and they have this thing, they somehow divided

425
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,820
it in the end and they call it the New Testament.

426
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,720
But since we're reasonably intelligent, we're reading this document and we notice that it's

427
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,500
framed in time.

428
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,640
In other words, the beginning of the book is older than the end of the book, right?

429
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,040
Usually.

430
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,420
So as we go through, we realize reading this document that as we get to what they call

431
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,900
the New Testament, that's more like the graduate level study of the Bible.

432
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,480
In other words, like the beginning is the kindergarten, second grade, third grade, fourth

433
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,840
grade, right?

434
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,380
As you get to the middle, you're in sixth grade.

435
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,480
And as you get towards the end of the Old Testament, beginning of the New Testament,

436
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,540
it's kind of like high school.

437
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,220
And when you get to the part that talks about this Yahshua ben Joseph or Yahshua the Christ,

438
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,800
you're on a college level.

439
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,380
So what they're doing to the people is telling them, just ignore the rest, go to the college

440
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,720
level.

441
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,420
So now you end up being, remember the lecture with the astrophysicist, right?

442
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,680
And he asked, do you have any questions?

443
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,680
What did they all ask?

444
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
Do you have any candy?

445
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:42,840
You see?

446
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,680
So it's kind of like they're telling people to go read college graduate level stuff when

447
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,340
they're illiterate.

448
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,220
So let's just give up the sarcasm, get to the point.

449
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,420
Even if you've never read the Bible and you just watched the movies and heard the stories,

450
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,180
that time of Judea, they were occupied by the Roman Empire.

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,840
And the Roman Empire had put as prefect governor of Judea Pontius Pilate.

452
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,100
So make a long story short, this Christ figure, Yahshua, was arrested by the Judean religious

453
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,820
authorities.

454
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,680
Notice I'm not using the word Jewish, right?

455
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,920
They're Judean religious authorities.

456
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,520
They take him to the subjected king who was suzerain to the Romans, which then finally

457
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,800
subjects him to the Roman Pontius Pilate.

458
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,000
Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the matter when he's presented with the Christ.

459
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,240
He brings out a bowl and he washes his hands.

460
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,080
That is a symbol that Pontius Pilate was given the area book.

461
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,260
Do you know, you guys know what an area book is?

462
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,360
Okay.

463
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,020
When you're in the military and you're sent to a foreign country, they give you an area

464
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,540
book that has a list of all the laws and customs of the people.

465
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:54,400
So when you go there, you don't do something offensive to create an international affair,

466
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,240
right?

467
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,020
Yes.

468
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,940
So let's just say even further, Pontius Pilate was a self-professed historian and very close

469
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,680
friends with Claudius Tiberius Caesar at the time, who was also a historian.

470
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,920
So they were very interested in cultures and laws.

471
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,120
So he knew the Judean law very well.

472
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,820
So they brought the Christ to him and they wanted him killed, the Judean religious authorities.

473
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,500
And his response to them was, I see no reason to kill this man for the reasons you give

474
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:22,740
me.

475
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,740
So I'm returning him back to you to use your law.

476
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,780
You could read in the book of Mark and the book of Luke, you could preface what I'm saying.

477
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,820
Remember, this is graduate level study also regarding biblical matters.

478
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,380
So he says to the Judean authorities, I'm returning him back to you to use your law,

479
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,440
your law.

480
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
And the Judean authorities respond, how can we under Caesar?

481
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,400
And he says, I am making this exception.

482
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,840
I know you have a law.

483
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,040
See, because we know that Pontius Pilate knew the biblical law because he brought up a laver

484
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,940
to wash his hands.

485
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,620
That's symbolic.

486
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,480
When something bad is going to happen, you wash your hands to show that it's the part

487
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
of the rules of the red heifer.

488
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,380
But so let me ask a rhetorical question, which I'll also answer.

489
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,080
Do the Judeans use Roman law or do they use the law of Moses?

490
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,320
Very good.

491
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,080
The law of Moses.

492
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,540
Right.

493
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,140
And she made this exception.

494
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,960
Under the law of Moses, what is the capital punishment, the method of capital punishment,

495
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,960
stoning or lapidation?

496
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,580
Very good.

497
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,300
So that's why when you read the people pass from the sinks to the ninth hour doing what?

498
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,640
There's no crucifixion.

499
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,600
It's very, very simple.

500
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,440
And this is like second, you should, anyone in the third grade biblical study would know

501
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:34,700
this.

502
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,880
And you have billions of people that think that the symbolism that they're showing them

503
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,920
is accurate because they haven't lifted a finger, but they're so brainwashed that if

504
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,580
they go to the document, it would be like giving the astrophysics textbook to the five

505
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:49,900
year olds.

506
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,660
They just want candy after they spend six hours reading something they'll never understand

507
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,540
with their perspective.

508
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,620
You see.

509
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,660
But let me get into this a little bit more.

510
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,460
It's very simple.

511
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:06,760
Now, the amount of detail that is in the Bible, if you are clear, is astonishing and no one

512
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,980
is talking about it.

513
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,640
Actually, I think there is one person, I don't know if you know, Stan Tannin.

514
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,060
No, never heard of him.

515
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,560
Yeah, he actually didn't know a lick of Hebrew.

516
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,300
And he just one day decided he was a physicist by trade and just looked at the Bible one

517
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,780
day and tried to decipher it.

518
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,000
And what he figured out was that it was written in an ancient alien language.

519
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:36,160
There was no other explanation because he looked at the first sentence of Genesis and what

520
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,740
it turned out to be and then the rest.

521
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,420
But just the first sentence of Genesis contained volumes of information.

522
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,400
And yes, he figured out that every single every single letter is actually just a shadow

523
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:55,140
of a ram's horn, which is kind of the cross section of a toroid, something like this.

524
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,920
Oh, yes.

525
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,480
Oh, yes.

526
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,880
Someone just to interrupt.

527
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,660
Someone else has brought up, for example, in English, if you read the first verse of Genesis

528
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,180
is in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

529
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:04,780
Ten words.

530
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,500
In Hebrew, it's better sheath, but I don't hear it.

531
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,980
Hashemi and they hit the audits.

532
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,880
There's seven words.

533
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,760
And basically it's beginnings, gods, plural, the group, a race of gods formed and the elephant

534
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,620
the top they leave.

535
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,100
They don't translate that out.

536
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,480
The alpha and the omega, they don't translate that.

537
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,640
And then the heavens and earth.

538
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Right.

539
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,240
So if you look, the most important thing to see in the book of Genesis, if you just bring

540
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,140
up an interlinear, the first verse, they're not even translating the fourth word in there.

541
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,460
There are seven words, better sheath, but I don't hear it.

542
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,320
Hashemi invaders are not translating the center one.

543
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,360
If you were to translate the center word, it's the olive top or the alpha and the omega

544
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,120
and the Christ said, I am the alpha and the omega.

545
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,520
So basically he's standing right there in the middle.

546
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,720
So you don't have to get in a ram's horns and shadows because each one of those letters

547
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,300
have numbers.

548
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,140
And when you see how they're put together, they form a tree into forming the other books.

549
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,720
Again, I've done discussions on this and other things, but it's pretty fruitless.

550
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,100
Yeah.

551
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,580
I just want to go back to the Christ story just for another minute because it's very important.

552
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,340
I know people know this has nothing to do with religion, has to do with history, false

553
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,400
flags and all this.

554
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,660
Like for example, I compare 9-11 to Christianity.

555
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,660
It's identical the way they, everything, the people's perceptions of it.

556
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,300
So let me go.

557
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,080
So the Christ, you're saying a Greek, he wasn't crucified.

558
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,540
What are you talking about?

559
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:29,740
Yeah.

560
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,660
Well, he died by, he was killed by stoning because if you read in Deuteronomy 21 in the

561
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,420
law, a high crime, it's very shameful to die that way.

562
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,440
Usually when they hang you on a tree.

563
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,460
Okay.

564
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,900
And we know it was an almond tree because we're, we're reasonably intelligent.

565
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,660
There's over 20 references to the almond tree from Genesis all the way through the prophets

566
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,160
that something is going to happen, including the seven branch lampstand that Moses was told

567
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,120
to make in the likeness of the almond tree.

568
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,700
So the people were passing for six hours doing what?

569
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,240
Playing patty cakes, throwing dice, betting or what for six hours, they're throwing stones.

570
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,780
Three men on one almond tree.

571
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,180
The Christ was front and center.

572
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,080
He dies first.

573
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,100
The men on the left and the right, they have to have their femoral arteries cut because

574
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,580
breaking the legs doesn't do it right.

575
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,980
Anyway, the Roman soldiers were casting lots for the robe that Herod had given him because

576
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,880
it was a king's robe.

577
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,040
Why did they do that?

578
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,500
Why were they casting lots?

579
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,900
Because they were made aware of what happens when someone, when this ceremony happens,

580
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,640
when someone is executed through stoning nailed to a tree, what happens after that?

581
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,840
Of course, no one knows because it's published in the Bible, it's in the book of numbers.

582
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Anything that hangs from a tree is accursed and to be burned.

583
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,360
So everything was burned.

584
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,100
So they remember Herod had given him his robe.

585
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,160
So the Romans were like, oh, this is the king's robe.

586
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,260
Who's going to get it?

587
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,360
So they cast lots.

588
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,660
So anyway, you see, that's why when Moses built the seven branch lampstand, he said, make

589
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,880
sure it looks like the blossoms of an almond tree.

590
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,920
And what happens on top?

591
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,320
You light fire.

592
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,800
So anyone that comes around and tells you, here's a piece of the cross, here's a piece

593
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,100
of this.

594
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,580
It's just laughable joke, right?

595
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,840
It's like in 9-11 when they found the passport in the rubble, right?

596
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,220
Or the inflated tire, the airplane tire, fully inflated on the ground, 100 stories down.

597
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,140
But here's my point.

598
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,340
And if anything, the stuff that I'm saying is for eight-year-olds.

599
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,960
If you're older than 12, you won't be able to hear what I'm saying.

600
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,540
This is for the young people to just open their eyes and see what's going on.

601
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,540
Now, if you look at the rest of the story, that's why it was very important that he was

602
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,740
condemned for many reasons.

603
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,960
And his purpose to come here was not to teach anything.

604
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,480
As a matter of fact, he even said that, that all of the people, the public were following

605
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,720
him.

606
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,320
What did he do?

607
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,000
He shunned them away and ignored them.

608
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,260
There's one scene there where he's walking with one of his followers, and this woman

609
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,820
is walking with them almost the entire day, and he's ignoring her.

610
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,580
And then they ask him, why are you ignoring this woman?

611
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,699
He says, because I didn't come for her, basically.

612
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,380
He was the most hateful individual in the entire Bible.

613
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,080
He kept saying to people, you'd be better off if you were in Sodom and Gomorrah.

614
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,199
So he didn't come here for all the stuff that people think to teach anyone anything, because

615
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,440
he says, if you want to know, it's already been said.

616
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,620
It's in Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.

617
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,280
He came here to show what happens after you die, if you're chosen to be resurrected or

618
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,440
reincarnated in this particular plane again.

619
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,139
See, because everything else had been proven.

620
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,300
They walked on water, they came out of Egypt, all these miracles, right?

621
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,639
But what was in doubt was two things, the existence of angels and what happens after

622
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,219
you die.

623
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,500
And he came here to show that.

624
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,060
And he didn't come here for everyone.

625
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,139
Initially, he says, it came for the lost tribes of Israel.

626
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,540
If you translate that properly, it's those that have perished of Israel, not lost like

627
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm lost wandering around.

628
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,960
Anybody got a map, any clue where I'm going?

629
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,440
No, no, no.

630
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,320
The perished, the ones that have perished, you see.

631
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,800
So the story, again, I compare it to 9-11, because if you look at really what happened

632
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,740
in 9-11 and what people think of it, if you look at what a Christian will tell you, and

633
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm not harping on the Christians.

634
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,620
I don't care.

635
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm not, you know, it just happens to be the dominant billions of people right now that

636
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,320
have been misled, right?

637
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,740
You see?

638
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,320
So the reason I gave this is because everything that you're engaged in right now, so a lot

639
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,920
of people might be, their ears are burning, oh, why is a Greek talking about religion?

640
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,720
I don't care about it.

641
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Everything is religion.

642
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,600
Let's bounce to the medicine.

643
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,720
I don't know, unless Daniel's got a question about what I said, you brought up a good

644
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,700
point that someone else is talking about it, but sadly to say it has nothing to do with

645
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,440
what I've been saying.

646
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,400
Well, yeah, it's kind of a tangential question, but I am curious if you think that the Bible

647
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,200
gods are Anunnaki, and there's several like waves of them.

648
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,960
And you said that you watched the Chinamar videos, and that one is kind of polarizing

649
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,860
in the sense that it says that the initial role of humans and was foreseen by, you know,

650
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,600
higher entities.

651
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,080
And it was, we were meant to be made and stuff.

652
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,620
And that was 430,000 years ago.

653
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,740
And the first wave of Anunnaki was totally well-intentioned, everything.

654
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:27,140
And it was only the latter ones from a totally different offshoot planet that were more slavery

655
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,580
oriented.

656
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,240
And would you say that these latter ones are the ones in the Bible?

657
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,360
Yes.

658
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Yes and no.

659
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,420
For example, you know, when you go to certain Middle East countries, you'll see a older

660
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,360
wealthy man and he's got 42 children and 160 grandchildren because he has all these wives,

661
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,680
right?

662
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,540
Right.

663
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,480
Very easy to do.

664
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,260
Okay.

665
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, multiply that as if you run into someone and he has 10,000 children and a million grandchildren

666
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
and they're gods.

667
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,400
They're very, very populous.

668
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:01,060
For example, the God of the Bible, Yahweh, is not an Anunnaki, but he's of a similar

669
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,960
race, right?

670
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,180
There are so many gods.

671
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:04,980
I don't know.

672
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,740
Let's say, I don't trust you.

673
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,700
If you said there's seven or 8 billion people on the planet, those figures are held by the

674
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,220
World Bank.

675
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
They're the ones that manage those figures.

676
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,660
Now, if you know anything about banking, their books are not very accurate, right?

677
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,300
There's one set of books they show people and one set of books that they know.

678
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,900
So let's say, for example, there are 7 billion people.

679
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,500
There are 7 billion types of gods out there.

680
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,560
So how many gods?

681
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,160
You see, they're so populous, right, that it's almost impossible to, unless we're given

682
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,980
information to find out more about them, they have to give us the information.

683
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,780
So what I'm trying to say is, I find it absolutely ridiculous on how everyone tries to lump everyone

684
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,880
into, oh, well, Yahweh's really Enlil, or Yahweh's really Enlil.

685
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,840
That's like saying, you know, John Wayne is Mickey Mouse or, you know, whatever, you know,

686
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,640
they're not.

687
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,060
They're completely different beings.

688
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,880
There's so many of them that it's almost, they're so populous and they're not this density,

689
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,600
okay, which is not difficult, but certain groups in the military right now, they know

690
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:10,900
that.

691
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,680
There's military ops that could walk into your house and you don't even know they're

692
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,240
there, right?

693
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,180
So if humans can do that.

694
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,120
If they interact with us, doesn't that mean that they're capable of being in 3D as well

695
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,980
as 4 and 5, making them multidimensional?

696
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,580
Yes.

697
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,260
Well, actually, and here's the thing that, again, that irks me, there's only one dimension

698
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,000
in this universe, right?

699
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,860
Each universe has one dimension.

700
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,380
What happens within that one dimension is the being's perception.

701
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,140
For example, you could look this up.

702
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,840
As humans, even with the best eyesight, we see only 1% of what can be, what is actually

703
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,260
happening in the light spectrum, 1%.

704
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,740
And within the sound spectrum, we're seeing about 5% of what can be heard, like a dog

705
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,200
and cat can hear higher frequencies and other animals can see beyond our spectrum, okay?

706
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,720
So they exist in that realm also.

707
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,300
In other words, they're here and it's only one dimension, but the density is different.

708
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,100
Like for example, you can't see infrared unless you have the, you can't see it in the night

709
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,640
unless you put on night vision goggles that actually allow you to see that tool, right?

710
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,120
But there are other creatures that can, you see, and the density, in other words, material

711
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,400
or mass is the same.

712
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,280
This is another thing just to bounce into this.

713
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,360
When you look at atomic structure, what gives things mass, like right now, if you got up

714
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,060
from your chair and you ran at the glass wall or the brick wall, you will get hurt, right?

715
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,140
You can't go through a solid object as you are right now because you don't understand

716
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,900
what's going on and you think that you've been, you've learned since a young child that

717
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,720
don't touch the stove, it's hot, you'll burn.

718
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,940
And you know, as an adult, that if you run to the brick wall, it's going, you're going

719
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,560
to hit the brick wall, fall down and probably get hurt, right?

720
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,400
Give you an analogy.

721
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,800
When in scientific matter, when they look at atoms, even the hardest material, let's

722
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,700
say diamond, they'll tell you it's 99.9999% space.

723
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,900
They say there's a proton and electron, but it's all space.

724
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,880
So how can the hardest material known be 99% nothing, space, right?

725
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,300
Well, very simple explanation.

726
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,120
Let's say you have a table fan, you know, for blowing air, okay?

727
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,200
Or a bicycle wheel, you have it on your table, just it's not moving.

728
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,700
You can put your hand right through the spokes of the bicycle wheel or your hand inside where

729
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,120
the fan is and the fan blades, no problem, right?

730
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,560
Once you get the bicycle wheel spinning or the fan, you plug it in and turn it on, go

731
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,880
try to put your hand through it.

732
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,660
That entire area that is moving acts as a solid, right?

733
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,100
And it's the same for planets.

734
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,600
The faster the spin, the bigger the magnetic field.

735
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,720
Oh boy, you just stepped on something there.

736
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,800
Magnetic field, define a magnetic field.

737
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm not putting you on the spot.

738
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,160
Well, you can ask a physicist, they can't do it.

739
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:11,300
The way I can only parallel like what I read, which is that it is kind of like the way the

740
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,920
echo of a planet in time, it's imprint.

741
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:15,760
Okay.

742
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,040
Here's one way to think about it.

743
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,580
Very simple.

744
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,400
I think, Zan, we talked about magnets and I gave, I broke it down on a third grade level

745
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,500
that no physicist will understand, but a third grader will understand.

746
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,400
Do you remember the analogy, Zan?

747
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,740
Can we do it again?

748
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,340
Yes, please.

749
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,580
Yeah.

750
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,240
Okay.

751
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,640
A magnetic field.

752
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,880
Okay.

753
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,540
Anytime you ask a physicist or a scientist what a field is or a wave, they just run away

754
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,220
like morons that they are.

755
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,980
A field is a qualitative thing.

756
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,160
It's not a physical thing.

757
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,680
A wave is also a qualitative thing.

758
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,420
Like if I'm standing here and I'm waving at you, I am not a wave.

759
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,200
A wave is what something does, not what something is.

760
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,140
Okay.

761
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,360
If I'm waving at you like hello or goodbye, am I a wave?

762
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,180
That's ridiculous.

763
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,220
And this is what they're saying.

764
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,340
Electromagnetic waves.

765
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,200
Waves of what?

766
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,980
Magnetic field.

767
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,240
Magnetic field.

768
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,120
Define a field they can't.

769
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,320
Okay.

770
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,920
Very simple.

771
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,900
It's a quality thing.

772
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,480
I have, iron is very common.

773
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,200
I bet either one of you right now, if you got up from where you're sitting and walked

774
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,420
around the street for about 10 minutes, you'll find a piece of iron on the street somewhere.

775
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,720
It's very cheap.

776
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
Nobody cares about it, right?

777
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,280
And you bring it here and it says a piece of iron.

778
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,800
So what?

779
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,360
That's junk.

780
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,120
Okay.

781
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,580
Because that's a qualitative statement.

782
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,740
Now I'm going to take that piece of iron that you brought and I'm going to wrap a copper

783
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,560
wire around it and send a very high current through it.

784
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,660
And when I remove the wire, if the current is high enough, that piece of iron will be

785
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,380
able to stick to your refrigerator door and stick to other pieces of iron.

786
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,300
According to a material science, it's the same hunk of junky iron.

787
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,260
Nothing has changed.

788
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,380
What I changed was its quality.

789
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,480
Okay.

790
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,540
So what happens is when you see that electrical perturbance that goes on the iron, it creates

791
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,860
a vortex through the metal.

792
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,800
And if you're looking at it one way, it looks right-hand.

793
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,380
And if you look at it from the back, it looks left-hand.

794
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,260
Just like if you look at the top of a spinning ball, it looks left-hand.

795
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,240
In the same spin, go underneath, it looks right-hand, right?

796
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,680
So there's no poles on the magnet.

797
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,720
Like, for example, to say there's a North Pole attracts the South Pole, or there's a

798
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,600
North Pole and a South Pole on a magnet is absurd.

799
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,700
Because if a North Pole attracts the South Pole and you have a bar magnet, while they're

800
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,740
already on the same bar magnet, they would attract themselves internally and make all

801
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,380
magnetism an impossibility.

802
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,080
It's absurd what they're saying.

803
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,480
Okay.

804
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,780
So what is a magnet?

805
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,620
Another analogy, Zain, if you remember, a piece of iron is to a magnet what photographic

806
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,800
paper is to light.

807
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,760
When you have a photographic negative or a CMOS chip and you expose it to light, it exposes

808
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,720
that moment in time, you develop it, and you have this beautiful photograph that, you know,

809
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,880
some photographers sell their wedding photos for $500, $600, right?

810
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,240
But it's just a crappy piece of paper that's worth nothing.

811
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,560
But if you have a photograph, what is the difference between a beautiful photograph that

812
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,320
sells at auction for $10,000 versus just a piece of paper?

813
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,740
Nothing.

814
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,520
Maybe a little chemical.

815
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,040
It's the quality of the paper that's chained.

816
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,580
So when you expose a photo negative or a photo paper to light, you've captured that instant

817
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,980
moment, and it stays there until you erase it or damage it.

818
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,480
The same with a piece of iron.

819
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,900
When iron is subjected to a perturbation of the ether, perturbation means disturbance.

820
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,040
Perturbation would be you have a still body of water and you throw a pebble in it and

821
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,320
you see the ripples go out.

822
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,400
Imagine doing that and the water freezes with the ripples in place.

823
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,180
This is what a magnet is.

824
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,180
It's very, very simple.

825
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,380
But the other thing that's interesting about a magnet, you have the fast part of the magnet,

826
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,980
the outer part that you see, then you have the counter spatial.

827
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,700
If you will, a counter space would be like a drain in a bathtub or a black hole.

828
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,520
When you literally, when you have a magnet in your hand, especially a simply loaded magnet,

829
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,100
you're actually holding a portal in your hand.

830
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,860
When I say it's portal, I mean the sci-fi space portals that you walk through and go

831
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,520
somewhere else.

832
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,700
It's just a downscaled version of it?

833
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,060
It's a very minimal, downscaled version, a very, very subtle version.

834
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,260
Just like if I said, when you watch the water go down the drain in your tub, that's a tornado.

835
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,360
Well, hold on a second.

836
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,440
If you say tornado, that thing rips buildings apart and lifts cows a thousand feet in the

837
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:32,540
air.

838
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,620
How can you say it's a tornado?

839
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,060
Well, it is, geometrically.

840
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,860
It's analogous to the same.

841
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,240
And is the macro version of that what's inside each planet and the bigger version of that

842
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,700
what's inside the suns and the bigger version of that, the big black hole in the center

843
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,220
of the galaxy?

844
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:49,840
Yeah.

845
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,700
The black holes, no one has ever seen one by, it's like a wave.

846
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,020
It's what something does.

847
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,080
What happens is the space, the centrifugal part, you have the centrifugal, which pushes

848
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,180
out and the centripetal, which goes in.

849
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
That's why Newtonian physics doesn't work.

850
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,220
If you look at all the Newtonian physics, they tell you an object in motion stays in motion

851
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,680
and force is equal to what it's acted upon and all this bullshit.

852
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,100
They cannot explain vortex dynamics.

853
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,820
If you, for example, spin a vortex in a five gallon bucket with water very fast, the outside

854
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,740
of the bucket, you see the plastic wants to explode and break as if you have a bomb in

855
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,380
there, but the center has got massive suction.

856
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,180
So this has to be comprehended that you have the fast part of the magnet, the same with

857
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,660
a planet.

858
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,360
That's why planets can never collide.

859
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,960
Because the equatorial part is the centrifugal and the centripetal part is in the pole.

860
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:51,560
So what's going on with these fields, what the planets really are, are manifestations

861
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,420
of the stars, but not that they come from stars.

862
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,720
It's very difficult to summate.

863
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,940
For example, the hardest objects that you see, let's say a planet was made of rock.

864
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,440
That rock was formed by the light and the energy from the sun.

865
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,000
The finest, the most subtle energies form the hardest objects and vice versa.

866
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,720
But to get into planetary discussion, a planet, okay, if we're going to get into biology for

867
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,720
a moment, which is very important, I think that was the crux of getting together a week

868
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,400
ago discussing getting into how the human body works.

869
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,700
If you know what the mitochondria inside of a cell is, that's what a planet is.

870
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,120
It has its energy core and it has all the information for the environment that's on

871
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,620
the surface.

872
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,740
And one thing I mentioned also, if you look in the solar system, it looks pretty bare.

873
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,320
That's because they're highly advanced societies.

874
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,800
Let me just say this.

875
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,260
When you're an advanced society, you don't live on the surface.

876
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,620
You live under the surface because you're not subject to weather, asteroid impacts,

877
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,180
attacks, solar conditions, things like that.

878
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,300
Let me give you an example of how simple that is that people miss all the time.

879
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,200
Let's say you go out and build a house.

880
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,200
Do you live on the roof?

881
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,340
Or do you live inside of it after you build it?

882
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,200
You live inside.

883
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,300
We basically build our own underground.

884
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,420
So it's kind of like an oxymoron.

885
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,080
The planet was formed to do so, just like the mitochondria is formed to do so.

886
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,820
A planet is a sentient being.

887
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,000
It's very slow.

888
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:29,660
For example, if I told you a rock is a sentient being, but you don't recognize it as such

889
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,040
because it only has one thought every thousand years, which actually is more often than most

890
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,860
people that I've met.

891
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,740
But anyway, do you negate it because it has one thought every thousand years?

892
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,360
It's easy to dismiss it, right?

893
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,340
Well, to answer that question, I think I read this in a book, but I agree that the way to

894
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,740
look at stones and rocks having their own souls is they're part of a hive soul.

895
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,340
And if you look at them together, like at the mountain, you can say that it has its

896
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,700
own imprint there.

897
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,820
And I also just want to add that the thing about dimension and density that this book

898
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:14,140
had to say is that something like you said, that densities are nested inside the dimensions.

899
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,660
And for example, rock and mineral and planets are one dimensional.

900
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,520
And then we have animals and the plant order, they are second.

901
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,080
And then we are third and then the more advanced aliens.

902
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,980
And there has to be something to that, that Draco and stuff and Anunnaki are 4D and 5D,

903
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,220
right?

904
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,280
Equal density.

905
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,520
What do you say, D?

906
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:34,780
Okay.

907
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,460
For example, let's look at the ether is an expression, in other words, everything physical

908
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,220
and non-physical is an expression of a more subtle energy called the ether.

909
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,780
When I write ether, I like to spell it the old way with an A, so A-E-T-H-E-R versus just

910
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,060
E-T-H-E-R, because that was when it was really studied.

911
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,260
Ether just means sky.

912
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,880
It's a Greek word, ethios, right?

913
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,600
This is a very subtle energy.

914
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,120
It acts as a fluid generally, just like high voltage acts as a fluid.

915
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,160
If you have a spark plug wire or a very high tension wire, if you break the insulation,

916
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,540
the way the high voltage leaks out is no different than if you had a garden hose.

917
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,760
So it almost acts like a fluid in some cases.

918
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,260
But let me just mention the life forms.

919
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,820
So you have the stones and the rocks, which are very subtle.

920
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,060
And we can define, I'd like to also define what a soul and a spirit is in the body.

921
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,440
It's very easy, and everyone is misusing that.

922
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,820
But let's just go back to the rock collective.

923
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,480
One thing about stones is they can't move, just like plants.

924
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,360
Plants can't move, but they are sentient beings.

925
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,900
There's a book about that, how they hooked up devices to measure impulses in plants.

926
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,220
And when they cut a leaf off, the impulse went up.

927
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,040
And they were so intelligent that even if you stood on the secret life of plants, even

928
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,280
if the next day, if you came back just holding a scissor, it would sense that you were holding

929
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,080
a scissor, right?

930
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:56,780
Okay.

931
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,700
So but the plants can't move either, you know, they're subject to it.

932
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,520
So plants and rocks are in a constant dream state, and otherwise they would be in a shock.

933
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,020
Like for example, if you're in a dream state and you find yourself dreaming that you're

934
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,020
in the middle of the road and here comes this big semi truck and it runs you over, you kind

935
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,720
of get startled.

936
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,900
But you're like, ah, screw it, it's a dream, I'm okay, right?

937
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,600
So in other words, to go into the mind of a rock, the spirit of a rock or a plant, because

938
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,140
they can't move, they're constantly in a dream state.

939
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,340
Let's just, just not to close the subject, move fast forward.

940
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,980
You've heard of ayahuasca, cannabis, marijuana, all these things.

941
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,660
When you take these plants, strong plant extracts, what kind of a state do you go into?

942
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,720
Ah, thank you.

943
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,440
You see, hallucinogenic dream state kind of thing.

944
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,080
So we are right.

945
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,560
So and the minerals, when you take minerals, you see, so these things are all connected.

946
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,840
What about cocaine though?

947
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,860
Cocaine is not really, it's a derivative.

948
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,320
Like for example, it would be like heroin to opium, right?

949
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,860
Cocaine is highly, highly derived.

950
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,260
It's highly refined, like white cane sugar, like white, not even white cane, just like

951
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,420
white sugar is highly refined.

952
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,700
It would be more like an artificial sweetener.

953
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,220
For example, even today, if you go into the airports of Peru or places in Japan where

954
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,240
they have high altitude airports, they have a street vendor that has cocoa leaves from

955
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,620
the cocoa plant that they grind up in a tea and they give you a little bit of chalk or

956
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,060
alkaline because it's very acidic to take, to help with high altitude sickness, for example,

957
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,440
right?

958
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,440
So anyway, let's go back to the Elohim and the Akanunaki.

959
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,440
We branched off into the field and the densities, but go ahead, Daniel.

960
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,520
This is a proper discussion.

961
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,060
Yeah.

962
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,440
Yeah.

963
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,380
If you had something on Akanunaki, I'm all ears.

964
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,380
If you want to finish with that.

965
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:52,900
No, well, the gods is very, is complex because, for example, you have the beings that tell

966
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,440
humans, simple minded humans, that they're gods.

967
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,660
And the Bible says if someone does, you have to test them, right?

968
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,720
Or other ancient texts, right?

969
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,980
Like the djinn and other places.

970
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,200
Okay.

971
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,380
So there's many, many levels, many hierarchies to it, and it's all based on power.

972
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,300
When we're talking about this universe here, like for example, you also mentioned the Draco

973
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,160
So that is another set of beings.

974
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,180
They also have a bad rap, which they shouldn't.

975
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:28,640
Most of the beings out there are reptilian, by the way, not human.

976
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,420
Even if you're reading the Bible, what they call Satan in the Garden of Eden was what's

977
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,220
called a Nakash, a shining one.

978
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,640
We're looking at Nakash.

979
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,540
It wasn't a snake at all.

980
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,700
But anyway, that's another discussion.

981
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,140
Actually, if you have comprehension, one day we can discuss the book of Genesis, and I'll

982
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,480
show you what's in there, and you'll freak out, and you'll see that modern science, what

983
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,720
they tell you about cosmology, what happened 13,000 years ago and before, it's all right

984
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,040
there.

985
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,960
You don't need some mysticism, right?

986
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,480
If you're one of these people that knows Septim means seven, Octo means eight, Nova means

987
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,840
nine, and Decim means 10, and you're surrounded by morons, then you'll be able to see what

988
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,920
I'm talking about, right?

989
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,580
So, or get to that point very quickly.

990
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,080
But the beings that are known as the Elohim are different than the Anunnaki, but similar.

991
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,280
They're not from planets as such.

992
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,860
Just like, for example, there are certain species, anthropomorphic looking species, if

993
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:30,280
you run into them and you ask them what planet you're from, they kind of like shake their

994
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,040
head and don't really, you have to rephrase it, because for a thousand generations, they

995
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,320
live on a spaceship that's a thousand miles long and 500 miles wide.

996
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,760
Why do we need a planet, right?

997
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:40,700
You see?

998
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:46,140
Which their mothership sometimes are actually, from what I heard, hollowed out comets and

999
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,980
such, but-

1000
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,320
They can be.

1001
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,940
That's just like you have different types of architecture.

1002
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,820
You have people living in tents all the way to people living in castles, people living

1003
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,640
on the side of a cliff and, right, different.

1004
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,580
The Japanese architecture is very different than the European architecture.

1005
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,100
You have mud brick homes, right?

1006
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,680
Also, we have a close example like that, the moon.

1007
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,300
Am I correct?

1008
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,340
I mean, yes, there's some-

1009
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,520
The moon is something that's been kicked around literally like a cheap whore for a

1010
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,500
very long time, but the moon is very important to acknowledge the moon in time referencing

1011
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:24,520
because it affects the ether flow, meaning gravity, which I can maybe define how simple

1012
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,300
gravity is.

1013
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,100
Actually, there's no such thing just like time, but the moon is something that has a

1014
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:36,020
very strong stimulus on hormones, growth of beings on the planet, the tides as it's

1015
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,960
known, geology.

1016
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,040
So, it cannot be ignored, right?

1017
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,980
But it's not indigenous and I can explain.

1018
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,580
The moon is another thing that's easy, simple to explain, but it's still cloaked in tremendous

1019
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,160
mystery until we know more about it.

1020
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,740
That guy, Bergel Norman from NASA that wrote that book Rainmakers of Saturn, I don't know

1021
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,720
if that's disinformation, but it does, I think, at some point show how like or talk about

1022
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,440
how the moon was towed into orbit and no planet is just like in tidal lock like that.

1023
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,980
It's an observation station and the joke's on us.

1024
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:07,840
It is.

1025
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,680
The joke is, and also the other thing, even NASA has recently admitted that, and I've

1026
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,600
been saying this for 30 years, the moon is in Earth's orbit and it's in high atmosphere.

1027
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,500
And recently, I think a month ago, NASA admitted that the moon is in Earth's high

1028
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:21,880
atmosphere.

1029
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,020
In other words, our atmosphere goes out to the moon, right?

1030
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,720
It's very thin, obviously, but it changes.

1031
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,680
It's logarithmic and fractal.

1032
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,660
In other words, as you go away from the Earth, the gravity decreases, but then you go another

1033
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,040
few hundred miles, it increases.

1034
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,860
Then you go further away, it decreases, then it increases again.

1035
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,560
Just like the ripples in the pond, you have one ripple that goes below the surface and

1036
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,200
a ripple that comes above the surface.

1037
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,300
It's offset, yes.

1038
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,420
It's offset, right.

1039
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:57,940
And also, there are also migrations because there are currents that attach the moon to

1040
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,600
the Earth, like you want to talk about that silver tube you started off with.

1041
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,320
There are currents between the Earth and the moon that make travel much easier.

1042
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,360
Just like the silver tube had a map, for example, that was 500 years old, that if you

1043
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:16,540
had this information on what day you leave to go from Europe to America, you'll have

1044
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,940
a 50 to 70 mile per hour, if you translate wind on your back, so you'll make the trip

1045
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,680
in three days.

1046
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,900
And what day to leave America to come back to Europe and what path to take so you can

1047
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,960
make it back in three days.

1048
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,480
If you didn't have this information, you're out on the ocean for one to three months,

1049
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,220
right?

1050
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,380
Big difference, right?

1051
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,040
So, and this was, this is still, all these things are still being, I've seen things that

1052
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,300
I'm like, shouldn't that be in a museum?

1053
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,800
Is it legal for, I was young, is it legal for you to have that?

1054
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,920
You know, I've seen stuff from the ancient Egyptian dynasties that look brand new and

1055
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,280
many things, but that's another discussion.

1056
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,560
So anyway, we were talking about the gods.

1057
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,860
Let me just drop this on people.

1058
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,660
You know how we take a hint, you know, when you're talking, some people could take a

1059
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,540
hint better than others.

1060
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,400
And some people are just really thick.

1061
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,340
They cannot take a hint.

1062
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,920
And even when you tell them clearly, they still don't get it.

1063
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
That's the other extreme.

1064
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,080
But if you look at ancient texts, for example, before we go to, let's say the biblical text,

1065
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,840
and I'm not a Bible thumper at all.

1066
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,340
The only reason I refer to the biblical text, because it has more information and history

1067
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,600
and detail that we can relate to than anything else that I've seen out there, other than

1068
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,620
some of the Rig Vedas and the Mahabharata when it comes to the alien wars that happened.

1069
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,500
But that's another thing.

1070
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,740
You know, the 10,000 suns that lit up the sky.

1071
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:31,820
Okay.

1072
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,680
So when you go into the biblical text, for example, before I do that, there's a movie

1073
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,880
called Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1074
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,580
Okay.

1075
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:46,300
A lot of these science fiction things, for example, like George Orwell, 1984, Aldous

1076
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,480
Huxley, Brave New World.

1077
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,620
If you read the unabridged introduction, those were commissions that the elite, those were

1078
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,040
not books that these authors did on their own cognizance.

1079
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:56,580
No.

1080
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,520
They were told to write that.

1081
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:58,920
Yeah.

1082
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,920
And they say it.

1083
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,620
Before they wipe us out.

1084
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,000
I think the term is soft disclosure, right?

1085
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:05,700
Yes.

1086
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,540
Soft and hard disclosure, because if you read Brave New World, that's pretty rough.

1087
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,420
So is 1984.

1088
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,980
That's not soft at all.

1089
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,320
How?

1090
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,860
And these people didn't have, I mean, I'm not saying Aldous Huxley or George Orwell are

1091
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,740
dumbasses at all.

1092
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,340
I'm simply saying they couldn't have had that clear of foresight.

1093
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,140
Exactly.

1094
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,240
I mean, like, and, you know, yes, of course, this is all relayed to them and they put it

1095
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,740
out there because I look, I don't know what your views are on Alex Jones, which I'd like

1096
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,700
to know, but he's a publicist first, right?

1097
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,580
He's a publicist.

1098
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,720
So that's my view on him.

1099
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,020
So what is this?

1100
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,820
He's a publicist.

1101
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,640
What is he publishing?

1102
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,980
Well, he's trying to break things down for us.

1103
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,180
As a publicist can.

1104
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:51,980
Okay.

1105
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,220
Yeah.

1106
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,100
But yeah, outside of you, it's almost like saying he's an attorney or he's a politician.

1107
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,880
How much are you going to get out of a politician or attorney or a publicist?

1108
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,660
He's beholden to other forces that he can't, you see, it's kind of like when you watch

1109
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,880
stuff on TV, they can't tell you something that's against the commercial they're going

1110
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,840
to play in five minutes.

1111
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,700
What is their response?

1112
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:09,980
Yeah.

1113
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,860
Just being of a certain fame level kind of precludes you from being able to tell as much

1114
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,200
truth.

1115
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,800
Well, there's one thing and there's another thing that's being responsible to the audience.

1116
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,020
In other words, you put the appropriate object in the appropriate vessel.

1117
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,060
The reason why things are in air quotes and putting so bad is because they're simply

1118
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,380
accommodating the people.

1119
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,240
The people don't want the truth.

1120
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,380
If you don't believe that, let's stop this call right now and go outside your door and

1121
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,120
stand there for five minutes and start talking to whoever walks by.

1122
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,120
They don't want the truth.

1123
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,080
I'm not being sarcastic.

1124
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,760
So they're accommodating them.

1125
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,620
But what happens is if you accommodate them too much on junk food or whatever, they get

1126
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:53,580
sick and then it gets a vicious cycle until they become destroyed.

1127
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,520
For example, if you go out, we have big highways here in America, like I-10, it goes through

1128
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,020
the desert.

1129
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,440
Hey, I got a business proposition.

1130
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,680
We're going to spend a few million dollars to open a big gas station convenience store

1131
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,700
in the middle of the desert.

1132
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,700
You're crazy.

1133
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,860
That's terrible for business.

1134
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,680
Who's going to come and buy anything?

1135
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,880
The coyotes and the rattlesnakes and the birds?

1136
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,700
No, no, no.

1137
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,920
It's on I-10.

1138
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,800
There's 200,000 cars that drive by every day.

1139
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,580
Oh, great.

1140
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,760
We're going to do really good business, right?

1141
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,060
What happens if that highway closes?

1142
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,940
The business is done.

1143
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,020
So this is what's going on.

1144
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:34,480
The highway is the people and the Illuminati, the TV, the media, all the stuff that you

1145
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,680
see, the religions is accommodating them.

1146
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:44,360
Do you see a hot dog vendor in the middle of the street selling street food because

1147
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,160
there's nobody there?

1148
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,600
No, he's there because there are people there that are going to buy it.

1149
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,600
And basically, so what happens is it's a catch-22.

1150
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,000
So you have to break the cycle.

1151
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,600
One is eliminate the provider.

1152
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,880
And then the people ask what happened or eliminate the people and then the people's mindset

1153
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,200
to want that stuff.

1154
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,080
And it's not going to happen because they're locked in a catch-22 resonant phase right

1155
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,580
now.

1156
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:14,000
At the same time, disclosure seems kind of at the boiling point where they can't hide

1157
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,060
it for much longer.

1158
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,320
Well, there's nothing to hide.

1159
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,720
It's already been disclosed.

1160
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,960
That's why I want to get into what I mentioned earlier, the Aldous Huxley, I want to go back.

1161
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,660
There's a movie and a book, I forgot who wrote it.

1162
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,480
It's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1163
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:33,180
So they could find this supercomputer on a planet and they ask the supercomputer, what

1164
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,260
is the answer to everything?

1165
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,120
So they come back 1 million years later.

1166
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,400
Yes.

1167
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,540
And they said, it can't be.

1168
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,840
No, it is.

1169
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,680
I thought about it for a very long time.

1170
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,920
If you go back to the biblical text, there were 42 stations that the Israelites moved

1171
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,960
through in the desert.

1172
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,980
In the first book of what they call the New Testament, the book of Matthew, there are

1173
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,320
42 generations that lead to the Christ.

1174
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,700
That number 42 keeps showing up, which is 6 times 7.

1175
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,560
This is the 42nd time on the earth that the humans have been basically created and destroyed.

1176
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,380
Well, there's no created.

1177
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,000
There's one type that's been created and there's one type that's been formed.

1178
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,620
In other words, there's a created human.

1179
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,800
And then there's another one that's genetically modified, which is a reformation.

1180
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,520
And that's in the Bible in the first bit.

1181
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,140
And I've explained that there's two.

1182
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,420
So if I ask, for example, let's say you look at the biblical text as being a history of

1183
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:29,960
humanity, which one are you, Daniel or Zen?

1184
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,200
Are you one of the ones?

1185
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,840
Are you that were made on the sixth day or the one that was made on the eighth day?

1186
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,360
Which one?

1187
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,040
And you don't know.

1188
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:36,660
And I don't know.

1189
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:36,860
Right.

1190
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,720
Well, actually, that's another story.

1191
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,300
I like to not talk about what sometimes those personal things.

1192
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,040
But if you look at the creation in Genesis, there's seven days, right?

1193
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,180
And man was made on the sixth day.

1194
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,960
We know that each day is a thousand years.

1195
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,440
It's mentioned three times in the Bible.

1196
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,740
Psalms, one of the prophets in the New Testament twice, that when the gods or the all of him

1197
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:01,400
talk about a day, it's a thousand years for us, which gives us a three hundred and sixty

1198
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,860
thousand to one ratio.

1199
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,260
Three hundred and sixty days in a year times.

1200
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,740
Right.

1201
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,180
You see.

1202
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,360
So three hundred and sixty thousand to one ratio, because a thousand days is a thousand

1203
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,640
years is one day anyway.

1204
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,780
Does that have to do with you mentioned in one of your interviews that our atmosphere

1205
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,180
is pumped with a certain gas?

1206
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,240
Yes, they pump.

1207
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,180
And is that one being that?

1208
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,800
Well, that's no, we're not oxygen breathers.

1209
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,920
We're nitrogen breathers.

1210
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,120
We convert the nitrogen into oxygen.

1211
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,400
We can talk about Lewis Kervran and how chickens produce calcium from magnesium in their bodies.

1212
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,260
We produce oxygen in our bodies by breathing nitrogen.

1213
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:46,480
There's a little bit of oxygen that's required with the nitrogen as a catalyst to get the

1214
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,280
reaction going.

1215
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:52,640
And if you look at the periodic table of elements, when you see nitrogen, in order for nitrogen

1216
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,980
to become oxygen, to transmute, it has to pass through carbon.

1217
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,520
So a little bit of carbon is also created in the lungs.

1218
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:04,400
That's why they they've mistakenly say that you intake the oxygen and you exhale carbon

1219
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:04,840
dioxide.

1220
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,560
No, you don't exhale anything ever.

1221
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,740
The exhaling is the byproduct of the nitrogen turning into oxygen, passing through carbon

1222
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,220
and that carbon bond is formed.

1223
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,960
And I could prove that many times.

1224
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,700
I could show you how that works.

1225
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,680
Everything works through transmutation.

1226
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,580
Can I just interject one thing here?

1227
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:30,620
Because I was going to ask you, and this is the most organic, I guess, that all these

1228
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,960
people talk and rightfully so that food is the principal thing that gives you health

1229
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,300
and it's certainly not medicine or anything.

1230
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,320
But something that's overlooked is that food, you can go without for something like, I don't

1231
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,700
know, 40 days and water for like seven days.

1232
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,820
But no one puts much emphasis on the quality of the air.

1233
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,720
And I would think that from my personal experience, that's actually the most life-giving and the

1234
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,260
most overlooked thing that you should commit to.

1235
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,360
And the most insidious one in that is the one that makes you the sickest without you

1236
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,060
noticing ever.

1237
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,880
And if you were to commit more attention to the quality of your air around you, you would

1238
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,440
see benefits much more than from food and the like.

1239
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:07,940
Oh, of course.

1240
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,300
OK, the human body, let's jump into it real quick.

1241
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,600
Now, the thing is, you know what the concept of mixing is when you have various things

1242
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,620
and you throw them together?

1243
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,700
The knowledge about biology and medicine and all that that's put out in university and

1244
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:27,440
would comment from common to university, and doctors don't know much, by the way, they

1245
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:27,980
were religion.

1246
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:33,780
If you ask a doctor about the or a dentist about fluoride, he cannot give you any information.

1247
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,080
He just says, I believe in it.

1248
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,180
I'm like, oh, my goodness.

1249
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:42,400
You know, so anyway, you cannot mix what is being put out to the public and what the people

1250
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,800
know with what I'm about to say.

1251
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,440
They do not make.

1252
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,140
So give you an example.

1253
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,980
When I drive around in the car, I have a map on the Garmin locating all the doctor's

1254
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,480
offices, clinics and hospitals in my area.

1255
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,940
And I also recently invested in some really good earplugs, the ones you crush and put

1256
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,500
inside your ear.

1257
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,260
There's some other ones.

1258
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:05,980
And the reason why I have those earplugs and the map of the doctor's offices, the medical

1259
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,140
clinics and the hospitals is when I know I'm approaching one, I have to slow down

1260
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,740
and put the earplugs in, because if I don't, when I pass the doctor's office, the quacking

1261
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,940
is so loud and deafening and deafening that my ears ring for two or three days.

1262
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,740
So I have to be very careful driving around town.

1263
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,780
Anyway, give me an example.

1264
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,880
Let's start off very simply how asinine and how ridiculous humans are.

1265
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:35,120
I hear this all the time, not just the people that order the triple cheese pepperoni pizza

1266
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,320
with a diet Coke, but they tell you calories, caloric intake, right?

1267
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,180
Caloric intake.

1268
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:40,980
Oh, my goodness.

1269
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,820
This is another prank.

1270
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,840
Worse than the timekeeping.

1271
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:45,340
Worse.

1272
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,020
Okay.

1273
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,400
A calorie is defined.

1274
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:51,860
It's a thermal unit, basically not it's a type of thermal unit that the amount of energy

1275
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:56,040
that's required to raise one gram or one cubic centimeter of water, one degree Celsius.

1276
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,820
So if you've ever been around a calorimeter, it's basically a vessel that has a viewing

1277
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:05,160
glass and you put whatever in there that you want to find out how many calories it

1278
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,380
has.

1279
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,080
It's put into water there.

1280
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,740
It's pumped up with pure oxygen inside the container and they put a spark in there and

1281
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:15,380
everything inside the container goes poof and turns into ash, carbon, even beyond that.

1282
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,300
And they measure how much heat it gives off.

1283
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,460
And that's the caloric value of that object.

1284
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:19,979
You with me?

1285
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,939
So let's say you look at a banana.

1286
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,600
You take the calories of a banana.

1287
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,180
Let's say it's 60 calories.

1288
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,340
So you eat that banana and you pass it through your body and you take your stool after you

1289
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,279
pass it through your body.

1290
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,760
Is that burnable?

1291
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:36,020
Yes, I can take the stool and put it in the calorimeter and poof, it'll burn and give

1292
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:36,620
off more heat.

1293
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:38,899
So how many calories did you get out of the banana?

1294
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:44,399
Oh, unless you're pooping carbon, right?

1295
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,640
Every time you go to the bathroom, pure carbon comes out that cannot be burned.

1296
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,080
Calories have nothing to do with nutrition.

1297
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,640
A cubic centimeter of chlorinated plastic.

1298
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,939
Let's just say if you've been around young children and you give them a chess board or

1299
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:02,960
checkers board, you'll hear some crying and screaming because one of the young guys came,

1300
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,359
picked up the piece and swallowed it, right?

1301
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,399
What do we do?

1302
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,040
Are you okay?

1303
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,580
Can you breathe?

1304
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,160
Yeah, he swallowed the chess piece.

1305
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,020
The four-year-old.

1306
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,120
Okay, so then what happens is he passes it and you clean it up really well.

1307
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,260
You got your chess piece back.

1308
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:21,260
That little 20 grams of plastic has about 3,000 calories in a calorimeter.

1309
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,240
How many calories did you get out of that piece of plastic when you swallowed it?

1310
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,560
Calories are a prank and a joke.

1311
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,439
It has not so, okay.

1312
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,979
Are you with me on this?

1313
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:32,899
Yeah.

1314
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,420
Okay, so we go on and on and on.

1315
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,800
Like another thing, the body is completely sealed.

1316
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,920
Nothing ever goes in.

1317
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,080
Nothing ever comes out.

1318
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:43,520
For example, actually, before I get to that, I want to get to another thing.

1319
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,340
They have these grocery stores, these big supermarkets here.

1320
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,080
And inside they have pharmacies.

1321
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,040
And in the pharmacy, I don't know if you've seen them.

1322
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,240
They, when people are waiting in line to get their...

1323
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,740
By the way, the word pharma means poison in Greek.

1324
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,520
You could look it up.

1325
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,560
It doesn't mean medicine.

1326
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,280
It means poison.

1327
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,060
And they're telling you, there's your soft disclosure.

1328
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,360
I think it's a hard on, not a soft one, right?

1329
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,800
In your face.

1330
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,000
And because they used to put big penises in ancient cultures as arrows.

1331
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,500
By the way, the siege, when they would tear down a wall,

1332
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,520
a battering ram had the shape of a penis in ancient times, right?

1333
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,120
Let's go on with the thing.

1334
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,140
They have a blood pressure machine at the pharmacy.

1335
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,660
You put a dollar or some coins, it tells you your blood pressure.

1336
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,700
So whenever I see the pharmacist is not too busy,

1337
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,200
because I don't like disturbing people and creating disturbances,

1338
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,180
I'll catch his eye and I'll say, hey, excuse me.

1339
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,780
Where can I get one of these?

1340
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,640
And I'm pointing at the blood pressure machine.

1341
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,880
And he says, I don't know.

1342
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,460
We rent them.

1343
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,440
But why do you want one?

1344
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,140
Because I'm opening a museum of medical fakery and quackery.

1345
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,980
And I want this to be one of my exhibits.

1346
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,100
And he scratches his head.

1347
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,440
He never says, get out of here, whatever.

1348
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,020
Sometimes they see me and they take a break.

1349
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,020
They say, why do you say it's medical fakery and quackery?

1350
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,980
I said, wow, you're a pharmacist and you don't know.

1351
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,820
It's just like, for example, if you run into a priest and ask him about the J-E-S-U-S,

1352
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,220
he's going to give you the parting line.

1353
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,720
He doesn't know anything that I just said earlier about the biblical Christ, right?

1354
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,580
These doctors are exactly the same.

1355
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:08,400
These doctors don't know any more than the common people, by the way.

1356
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,860
And I'll get into why and how the only thing that they're worth is emergency medicine.

1357
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,120
If you're leaking, all your guts are spilling out.

1358
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,320
They have battlefield medicine knowledge that's been accumulated for 3,000 years

1359
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,440
that they're applying to you.

1360
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,440
They don't know anything beyond that.

1361
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So here we go.

1362
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,920
They put a strap on your arm and they inflate it to block the blood flow,

1363
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
which is moving under a vacuum condition, negative pressure.

1364
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,420
And they measure the pulses, the interval between the blood pulse,

1365
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,220
and they tell you that's your blood pressure.

1366
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,620
How ridiculous is that?

1367
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,520
Anyone who's worked around pressurized vessels with fluid knows that

1368
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,060
if you cut yourself, there's no pressure there at all.

1369
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,880
If there was any pressure in the body, positive pressure,

1370
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,780
you would attach an IV bag to someone and come back 10 minutes later,

1371
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,640
it'd be full of bodily fluids and blood.

1372
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,820
But I've seen in hospitals, when they attach an IV bag to someone,

1373
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,540
it drains out and gets sucked into the body, right?

1374
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:03,960
It's obvious.

1375
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,340
This is in your face, okay?

1376
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,200
So what they're doing with blood pressure is a prank and a hoax.

1377
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,600
Just like, for example, you go to one of these quote-unquote doctors for a diagnosis.

1378
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,420
By the way, people say I came to the doctor, Greek,

1379
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,440
and I want to know, I want you to tell me if what he told me is possible.

1380
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,360
I said, did he take your blood pressure and all that as part of the diagnosis?

1381
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,380
Yeah, I don't want to hear it.

1382
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,320
The guy is incompetent, right?

1383
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,940
For example, if you look at animals,

1384
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,660
when do they take a blood pressure of a horse or a dog or a cat?

1385
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,100
That's a hoax that's designed to hoax the people.

1386
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,620
So this is the same thing.

1387
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,500
You go to the doctor and he says, I have to diagnose you.

1388
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,420
So he ties a string around your finger and he makes it really tight,

1389
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,840
and it can't be a regular string.

1390
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,180
It has to be a medically approved FDA string.

1391
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,820
And he can't use a regular clock,

1392
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,680
has to be a medically approved FDA or whatever authority.

1393
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,780
And then after a certain time, he has a chart on the wall

1394
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,380
that goes from flesh tone to purple.

1395
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,220
And he holds your finger up to see what color your finger turned.

1396
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,960
And he says, you've got stupiditis A or stupiditis B, right?

1397
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,960
And the people believe it.

1398
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,780
So now he writes a prescription for that.

1399
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,200
See, what people don't understand is this, that I give an analogy.

1400
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,600
When I say Microsoft, you think of Bill Gates, right?

1401
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,340
When I say Apple Computer, you think of Steve Jobs.

1402
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,540
If I say Ford Motor Company, you think of Henry Ford,

1403
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,040
the early Plain and the Wright Brothers.

1404
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,040
If I say the medical system,

1405
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,300
you need to think of people like Rockefeller.

1406
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,180
Yeah, 1911, Flexner, right?

1407
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,120
Flexner Report.

1408
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:30,040
Yeah.

1409
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,500
Okay, what do you know about these people?

1410
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,240
They're fake philanthropy and they're whatever.

1411
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:35,980
They're vicious.

1412
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,260
Okay, so I want you to, both of you, if you can,

1413
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,060
put in cross section of a car tire, go to images.

1414
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,480
And pull that up.

1415
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,200
This is like, let's say someone's driving

1416
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,420
and listening to this sonic event.

1417
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,800
At least three of us looking at the picture,

1418
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,580
it tends to telecommunicate better.

1419
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,780
Okay, now I want you to do another image.

1420
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,040
Put in the intestines, right?

1421
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,680
Cross section of intestines and pull up a closeup.

1422
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,780
Okay, what's the difference?

1423
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:07,700
Structurally.

1424
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,820
You made this point, nothing can get through, you were saying.

1425
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,880
Yeah, look at it.

1426
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,240
Nothing can get, you could, if you have a closeup,

1427
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,440
I don't, I'm not sure how to do this image that I have.

1428
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,880
You know, let me tell you, this too, Greek, sir,

1429
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,760
is here in Louisiana, us very sophisticated people,

1430
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,480
we make something called boudin,

1431
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,080
which is you literally take the intestines of an animal

1432
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,620
and you put liquids in solids.

1433
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,560
And it holds it.

1434
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,240
And it holds, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so.

1435
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah, the soccer ball, the original bladders.

1436
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,940
Bladders are still being used by people,

1437
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,140
indigenous tribes all over the world to hold water.

1438
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,560
Nothing passes through.

1439
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,880
If anything is absorbed or passes through

1440
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
any physical tissue in the body,

1441
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,120
you will die of sepsis within three days.

1442
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,040
So let me, okay, do you know

1443
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,740
what controlled opposition is, right?

1444
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,380
Okay, the holistic medicines, not some of them,

1445
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,320
all of them are controlled opposition.

1446
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,260
Just like, for example, I like to use 9-11 as a thing.

1447
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,600
Well, they have the other people,

1448
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,040
oh, it was space weapons or it was,

1449
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,680
oh, they had explosives on each floor.

1450
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,940
That's all controlled, they love that, they laugh at that.

1451
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:11,300
So the holistic doctors are being laughed at.

1452
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,420
They're not a threat at all

1453
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,260
because the holistic doctors talk about,

1454
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,280
I have a really good supplement.

1455
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,160
It's natural and the body absorbs it really well.

1456
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,420
Oh my gosh, get the,

1457
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,380
and when I challenge them on it or do the images,

1458
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,740
they say, well, I've been practicing for 30 years.

1459
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,180
You didn't answer the question.

1460
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,260
It's like you're catching a rat in the corner.

1461
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,320
So why I'm saying this,

1462
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,380
I'm being kind of embittered about it

1463
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,940
is because people, you're on your own.

1464
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,220
You're not gonna go find a holistic doctor

1465
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,540
because if you had a holistic doctor,

1466
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,080
alternative doctor that was saying half of what I'm saying,

1467
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,720
they're not gonna be around very long

1468
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,600
because they're operating under the Rockefeller privilege.

1469
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,400
Anyway, this is not conspiracy theory.

1470
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,840
This is constructive reality.

1471
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,680
There's a difference.

1472
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,620
So you're being surrounded with choices

1473
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,160
and it's the same groups that are controlling it.

1474
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,440
Okay, so the next one, let's go to another one.

1475
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,700
Do a cross section that I have here on image,

1476
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,720
cross section of the skin.

1477
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,800
Very close.

1478
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,680
You're gonna see it's very much like the intestine.

1479
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,440
The follicles and the dermis are slightly arranged differently,

1480
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,260
but like the car tire in the intestine,

1481
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,560
cross section of skin.

1482
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,460
There's no water, the water is,

1483
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,800
I'll explain how the sweat forms and all that.

1484
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,800
Very simple, right?

1485
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,340
Do you see it?

1486
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,320
You guys see the cross section of the human skin?

1487
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,580
It's like the car tire or the intestine.

1488
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,540
Now let's do the lung, cross section of lung tissue.

1489
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,240
That's actually extremely robust.

1490
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,560
It has some hollow sections

1491
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,460
because of course we're dealing with gases.

1492
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,440
A peripheral note, if the Rockefellers

1493
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,420
are the ones extinguishing all this good information,

1494
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,720
how are they storing theirs

1495
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,300
and preserving it for future generations?

1496
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,480
Do they have their own libraries?

1497
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,720
Yeah, they do and they don't.

1498
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,800
At this point, let me just, they worship death.

1499
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:02,160
So for them to bring death upon the living

1500
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,880
is worshiping their God.

1501
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,180
Even if you see, this is kind of macabre,

1502
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:09,160
but for example, the skull and bones,

1503
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,580
look up, do a quick search on 322 skull and bones.

1504
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,580
Yeah, but if you look at even Wikipedia,

1505
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,980
they're actually known as what?

1506
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,280
The brotherhood of what?

1507
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:21,640
Look it up.

1508
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,680
Somebody say it.

1509
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:23,900
Yes, that's right.

1510
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,060
The brotherhood of death, yes.

1511
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,360
Why do they worship death though?

1512
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,580
That's the thing, like it's-

1513
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,860
Well, because everyone dies.

1514
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,400
And so you can have, when you're alive,

1515
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,120
you could practice whatever religion you want,

1516
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:33,980
but you're all gonna die.

1517
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,140
So death is the superior.

1518
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,540
I could get into what the Freemasons say about that,

1519
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,220
which is another thing.

1520
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,760
One day, the highest secrets of Freemasons will do.

1521
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,120
Yeah, you'll see how ridiculous it is.

1522
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,920
Okay, so do you see that nothing passes through?

1523
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,940
So what's going on is the body is sealed up in a vacuum

1524
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,080
and what's happening is transmutation.

1525
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,620
As these products pass through,

1526
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,840
you have an opening that pass through

1527
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,560
from the mouth through the anus, okay?

1528
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,520
So you have an opening,

1529
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,560
just like let's say you dig a tunnel through a mountain,

1530
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,980
the mouth on one end and the anus on the other.

1531
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,460
And that's the only thing.

1532
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,100
You have some ducts and some organs,

1533
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,180
but that's not relevant at this point.

1534
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,240
They have different purposes.

1535
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,760
As the matter passes through,

1536
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,760
whether it's the cul-de-sac of the lungs where it goes in

1537
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,400
and then it has to turn around and come back out

1538
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,620
like a cul-de-sac or the intestines,

1539
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,640
you have a process called induction.

1540
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,000
Induction is very similar to,

1541
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,200
you ever see these glass top stoves

1542
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,880
where you have a pot of boiling water

1543
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,500
and you move the pot,

1544
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,400
put your hand right on the glass top,

1545
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,200
it's room temperature.

1546
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,860
You put the pot right on the glass again

1547
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,720
and it starts boiling immediately, okay?

1548
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,160
That's the process of induction, okay?

1549
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,140
There's a fellow named Louis Kervran,

1550
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,780
K-E-R-V-R-A-N,

1551
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,420
that was wondering how chicken eggs

1552
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,880
are so robust with calcium.

1553
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,940
So where does the calcium come from?

1554
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,780
And he eliminated,

1555
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,880
did a regen diet where they made sure

1556
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,020
they got all the food for the subject chickens

1557
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:03,760
from a laboratory,

1558
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,160
make sure there was no traces of calcium in their food.

1559
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,380
And after three months,

1560
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,980
they were still producing robust calcium eggs

1561
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,080
with no bone loss.

1562
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,640
So where's the calcium coming from?

1563
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,260
He's another person that they hounded to death

1564
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,020
and made sure that he spent his last days

1565
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,200
living on a park bench,

1566
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,200
just like they did for Tesla

1567
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,680
and all these other people.

1568
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,780
Is it this whole thing about being in a vacuum

1569
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,360
comparable to hollow earth?

1570
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,900
It's like a microcosm of that,

1571
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:31,060
meaning that you said also

1572
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,600
that you can kill a broken bone

1573
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,840
inside the three to six days,

1574
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,180
if you know how.

1575
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,220
And meaning that it's stuff

1576
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,180
that is happening non-physically, I guess?

1577
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,560
Yeah, it's by, well,

1578
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,280
is the thing that we would ask

1579
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,400
is induction a physical or not?

1580
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,200
It's both.

1581
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,380
It's an ethereal non-physical.

1582
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:51,880
In other words,

1583
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,660
electricity running through your wires

1584
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,040
is not a physical thing, right?

1585
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,980
I always cut wires.

1586
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:57,780
I have rubber gloves.

1587
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,740
I cut the wire and I have a dustpan

1588
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,980
to collect all the electrons

1589
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,020
that come out of the wire.

1590
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,400
Never found them, by the way.

1591
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,440
Or I never found the photons

1592
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,360
out of a light bulb.

1593
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,040
I don't know how the photons

1594
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,600
in a vacuum filament of a light bulb

1595
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,680
go through the glass

1596
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,020
without making a hole in the glass,

1597
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,560
the photons, and go into the room.

1598
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,720
Ridiculous.

1599
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,720
Most of the world is non-material.

1600
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,540
First thing you have to do

1601
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,180
is accommodate the body's vacuum

1602
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,020
and you trick it

1603
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,220
depending on what you want to do.

1604
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,080
We can get into that.

1605
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:24,820
But here, real quick,

1606
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,200
the other thing is seasonality.

1607
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,000
Very, very, very, very important.

1608
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,180
This is not a diversion.

1609
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,960
This is parallel.

1610
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,820
When you're living in, let's say,

1611
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,920
a cold climate,

1612
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,880
it's generally cold,

1613
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,200
like 9 or 10 months of winter,

1614
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,160
and you order food from the tropics,

1615
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,180
like some bananas, papayas, and mangoes

1616
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,560
that are grown in a warm climate.

1617
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,340
When you eat those products,

1618
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,900
your body is going to say,

1619
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:49,840
oh, these are products

1620
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,800
from a warm climate,

1621
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,940
and the chemistry here

1622
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,960
is going to induce a thinner blood

1623
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,560
and a chemistry

1624
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,160
as if I'm living in the tropics

1625
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,060
and you're going to get sick.

1626
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,160
The opposite is true.

1627
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,460
If you're living in the tropics

1628
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,380
and you say, I want to eat some Arctic fish,

1629
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,800
like salmon from Alaska

1630
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,140
or the Arctic Ocean

1631
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,140
or whale blubber or something,

1632
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,040
when you eat that

1633
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,440
living in the hot temperatures,

1634
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,860
it's going to make your blood thick

1635
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,040
like you're living in the Arctic

1636
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,440
and you will get sick again.

1637
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,920
So the way you get sick, for example,

1638
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,700
is the first thing

1639
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,900
is your body starts to lose

1640
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,100
this vacuum condition.

1641
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,500
Just like, for example,

1642
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,620
if you look at a high-performance sports car

1643
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,360
on the dashboard,

1644
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,360
you have all these gauges.

1645
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,400
It tells you oil pressure,

1646
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,080
fuel, electricity, all these things, right?

1647
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,120
Gauges on sophisticated equipment.

1648
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,080
Imagine a vacuum gauge,

1649
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,140
and this is how it works.

1650
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,680
For example, let's start off with this.

1651
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,480
When a woman is pregnant,

1652
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,580
what holds the baby in?

1653
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,960
Do you guys know in the cervix

1654
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,500
and the uterus,

1655
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,720
what keeps the baby from falling out?

1656
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,300
What is that mechanical,

1657
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,980
physical thing called?

1658
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,820
Because if a woman stands up,

1659
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:56,640
well, why doesn't the baby

1660
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,940
fall out with everything, right?

1661
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,000
It's called the mucus plug.

1662
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,280
Look it up if you want.

1663
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,100
What holds the baby

1664
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,780
from falling out of the uterus

1665
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,620
when a woman is pregnant?

1666
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,140
You'll see a diagram,

1667
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,320
and there's a long arrow.

1668
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,580
It says mucus plug.

1669
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,920
All right.

1670
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:13,680
I see it.

1671
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:14,700
You see it?

1672
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,060
Okay.

1673
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,180
When you start developing a sinus,

1674
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,060
like, oh, my nose is runny

1675
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,380
or my nose is clogged up,

1676
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,540
you notice a little child gets sick.

1677
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,560
I'm getting a cold.

1678
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,160
You can't breathe.

1679
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,240
Mucus, right?

1680
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,820
When you are losing vacuum,

1681
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:28,940
the body lets you know that

1682
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,800
by starting to plug up certain areas

1683
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,040
because obviously the lungs

1684
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,100
are the biggest, most obvious one.

1685
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,500
And then there's swelling and edemas

1686
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,520
and things like that.

1687
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,800
So your first sign

1688
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,800
that you're losing vacuum

1689
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,280
is mucus development

1690
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,240
in the throat,

1691
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,620
in the mouth,

1692
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,280
in the nose,

1693
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,460
especially the sinuses

1694
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,420
that, by the way,

1695
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,460
reach out to the ears.

1696
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,000
Okay.

1697
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,200
Anyone who does swimming

1698
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,900
knows that their air comes

1699
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,820
in the vent holes

1700
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:51,780
in the ears as well.

1701
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,820
Very common ear infections

1702
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,400
with children,

1703
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:55,380
mucus in the ears,

1704
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,240
liquid in the ears,

1705
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:56,860
all these things.

1706
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,480
So the body's telling you,

1707
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,140
hey, dummy,

1708
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,680
I'm losing vacuum.

1709
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,180
That's why when you live

1710
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,080
in a cold climate,

1711
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,760
they tell you in New York

1712
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,040
or places in Europe,

1713
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,120
the doctor says,

1714
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:07,920
oh, take vitamin.

1715
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:08,960
You need vitamin C.

1716
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,120
So you get fruit from the tropics.

1717
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:11,960
It's snowy outside.

1718
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:12,420
The children,

1719
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,540
they give them orange juice

1720
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,500
and tropical fruits

1721
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,780
and they get worse

1722
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,940
and worse and worse, right?

1723
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,460
Because, you know,

1724
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,660
no one knows

1725
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,780
what's inside of an orange.

1726
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,960
Oranges have vitamin C.

1727
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:23,840
Bullshit.

1728
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,560
If you find out

1729
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,580
how they determine that

1730
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:27,540
is they take the orange

1731
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,560
and they do an assay.

1732
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,220
They take it,

1733
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:29,920
they crush it,

1734
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:30,660
they powderize it

1735
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:31,440
and they burn it.

1736
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,460
It's no longer an orange.

1737
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,520
Each process of determining

1738
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,260
what's in it

1739
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,420
changes it completely.

1740
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,540
No one knows what's in an orange.

1741
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,680
Don't tell me it has vitamin C

1742
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,400
in all this.

1743
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,340
It's the same with everything

1744
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,700
in the human body actually, right?

1745
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:46,420
Yes.

1746
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,160
Now the other thing,

1747
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,040
let's go back to the rock.

1748
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,840
Are you guys familiar?

1749
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,120
Do a quick search.

1750
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,900
Victorian corpse medicine.

1751
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:53,860
Go to images.

1752
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,620
And the doctors were telling the people

1753
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,540
there are health benefits

1754
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:57,800
to eating dead corpses

1755
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,020
so that when people died,

1756
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,040
they would cut them

1757
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,540
into little cube-sized pieces,

1758
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,720
sugar cube-sized,

1759
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,160
and distribute them as medicine.

1760
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,940
And the children found it

1761
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,800
to be very bitter

1762
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,120
so they would dip it in chocolate.

1763
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,400
These are the same people

1764
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,580
when they were doing this,

1765
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,620
chopping up corpses,

1766
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,680
they would go and deliver a baby

1767
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,140
and the infant mortality rate

1768
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:16,800
was so high

1769
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,820
they were almost going

1770
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,380
into genociding themselves.

1771
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,940
And a couple of people

1772
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,580
that suggested

1773
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,780
there was a hygiene problem,

1774
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:23,880
they should wash their hands

1775
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,060
when they're dissecting cadavers

1776
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,440
before they deliver a baby.

1777
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,780
The people that suggested

1778
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,920
they should wash their hands

1779
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,180
and observe better sanitary conditions

1780
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,920
were driven to suicide.

1781
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,380
There are things that I found

1782
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,300
on an old computer

1783
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:37,820
that I booked

1784
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,260
that no longer exist online.

1785
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,040
This is the group

1786
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,940
that is the backbone

1787
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,820
of your medicine.

1788
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,500
By eating corpses,

1789
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,440
rich Europeans

1790
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,800
once think they could heal.

1791
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,060
And then it has,

1792
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:51,960
I mean, you can't read it,

1793
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:52,480
but you can see

1794
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,220
someone writing in a journal.

1795
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,340
And yeah, no,

1796
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,760
there's actually articles about it

1797
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,340
and it's like a humorous criticism,

1798
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:58,680
right?

1799
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,360
Because, of course,

1800
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,860
you don't want to talk about.

1801
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,980
Long before Advil,

1802
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,520
people would willingly consume

1803
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,940
human blood and bone powder

1804
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,100
to cure ailments.

1805
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:06,740
Right.

1806
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,880
How bizarre is that?

1807
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:09,660
Okay.

1808
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,020
So the seasonality,

1809
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,120
let's go back to this.

1810
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,700
The seasonality

1811
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,860
is very, very important.

1812
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:15,520
For example,

1813
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,280
I met someone

1814
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,320
and it was early winter here in Tucson,

1815
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,160
which is mild.

1816
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:21,340
And they were wearing,

1817
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,880
I'm out in a short sleeve shirt,

1818
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,600
you know, whatever,

1819
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,440
because it's 60 degrees, 65.

1820
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,680
I'm very well acclimated,

1821
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:27,440
you know, Fahrenheit

1822
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,160
in the high 20s,

1823
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,560
I guess,

1824
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,280
Celsius or mid 20s Celsius.

1825
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:33,660
And this person was wearing a sweater

1826
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,240
and they were cold.

1827
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:35,120
I go over to their house

1828
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:35,860
and they have bananas

1829
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,060
on their counter and oranges.

1830
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,480
I take the bananas and oranges

1831
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:38,760
and said,

1832
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,820
you can't eat this now

1833
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,000
if you're complaining

1834
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,060
about being cold.

1835
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,040
I went and bought a piece of salmon

1836
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,960
and I poached it.

1837
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,860
And it was about a half a kilo.

1838
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,420
I said, eat this for the next two days.

1839
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,840
And then three days later,

1840
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,580
that person was out in a short sleeve shirt

1841
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,540
like me, just fine.

1842
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,620
For example, here in the US,

1843
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,500
if you're going to go up

1844
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,980
to the northern state of Alaska

1845
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,320
and work on the oil fields there,

1846
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,440
they give you a cut sheet,

1847
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,100
a piece of paper a few weeks before.

1848
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,080
And they said, before you come up here,

1849
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,840
you should get a tub of cool whip

1850
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,700
and corn oil and mix it together,

1851
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,440
whipped cream and corn oil

1852
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,340
and take a few tablespoons every day

1853
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,400
before you come up here.

1854
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:15,640
Right?

1855
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,780
This is common for people

1856
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,020
that work up in the colder areas.

1857
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,540
You see, so seasonality,

1858
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,580
the blood chemistry,

1859
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,400
not the chemicals in the food

1860
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,280
of being absorbed,

1861
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,400
but the chemistry next to each other,

1862
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:29,360
just like induction, right?

1863
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,600
Now, induction,

1864
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,000
you could look up what that means.

1865
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,680
It's a non-physical transferring.

1866
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,320
So literally what's happening,

1867
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,420
literally, let's jump to a crux here,

1868
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,740
a cross in the road.

1869
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,100
Let's just like, you know,

1870
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:42,920
do a hyper jump.

1871
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,660
Let's skip a bunch of stuff and go up.

1872
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,760
You just eat typical American food,

1873
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,220
a bologna and margarine sandwich

1874
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,340
on white bread, okay?

1875
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,780
You eat that and you think you eat that

1876
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:53,820
and that's going to give you power

1877
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,600
for the next day

1878
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,120
because you absorbed something.

1879
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:56,700
Ridiculous.

1880
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,240
You eat your bologna and margarine sandwich,

1881
01:26:59,400 --> 01:26:59,920
but by the way,

1882
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,420
don't take it as a put down.

1883
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,500
I'm just saying what I see.

1884
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,900
You eat that and as the digestion starts

1885
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,900
at the taste, at the mouth,

1886
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,760
the saliva, you swallow it.

1887
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,140
It goes from the stomach to duodenum,

1888
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,880
small intestine, large intestine,

1889
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:14,740
colon out.

1890
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,880
Through that entire process,

1891
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,140
that food is being changed

1892
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,400
and prepared to run parallel

1893
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,200
against these membranes

1894
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,400
in all those areas

1895
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,300
that I just mentioned.

1896
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,420
And an induction process happens

1897
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,780
where the food is being broken down

1898
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,960
by enzymes and electrical processes.

1899
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,460
And I say electrical processes,

1900
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,880
you ask any doctor

1901
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,460
that's a gastrointestinologist.

1902
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:42,580
And I say in 30 seconds or less,

1903
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,700
explain to me how the human digestive system

1904
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:44,940
works.

1905
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,860
He says it's a series of electrical impulses

1906
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,880
and electrical movements.

1907
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,880
Where's your electrical medicine then?

1908
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,900
The hypocrisy is incredible.

1909
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,440
So anyway, as this material,

1910
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,980
the food, the bologna and margarine sandwich

1911
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,820
passes through all these membranes

1912
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:02,360
that I mentioned, those organs.

1913
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,400
In the tissue that you saw

1914
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,240
that looked like the car tire,

1915
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,220
there are a series of processes

1916
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,520
that break it down into energy,

1917
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,000
pure energy, non-material.

1918
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,560
And then on the inside of the body,

1919
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,460
on those vessels,

1920
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,000
blood vessels surrounding the organs

1921
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,680
that you see,

1922
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,700
it starts to manifest first as an energy,

1923
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:22,820
then as a gas,

1924
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,380
then as a liquid,

1925
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,020
and then as a solid to repair the cells.

1926
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,960
That's why, for example,

1927
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,340
if you eat a food that

1928
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,580
it does not quote unquote agree with you,

1929
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,200
you get flatulence or gassy

1930
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,000
because some of that energy

1931
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,340
did not was formed on the wrong side.

1932
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,040
And that's like your body telling you,

1933
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:42,680
hey, you're gassy.

1934
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:43,580
Don't eat that again

1935
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,380
because it reverses the process.

1936
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,200
So now I just explained

1937
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,700
how flatulence and gas develops.

1938
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,320
Very simple.

1939
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:52,720
For example, if you're ever,

1940
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,900
let's just bounce around a little.

1941
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,220
If you ever ride a bike or motorcycle

1942
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:56,900
and you fall,

1943
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,100
you get what's called road rash,

1944
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,860
a large area of skin comes off

1945
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,240
or even a scab if you fall,

1946
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,300
let's say something a few centimeters in diameter.

1947
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,500
If you peel that scab,

1948
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,780
you know, the hard skin and blood

1949
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,340
that's dried up after a few days,

1950
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,920
you see a clear liquid.

1951
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,960
And in that clear liquid,

1952
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,260
you see small gas bubbles.

1953
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,720
If you look very closely,

1954
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,980
because the way the skin repairs itself,

1955
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,840
first, you create swelling

1956
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,520
to stop the leaking from the vacuum.

1957
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,840
Secondly, the gases,

1958
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,260
the energy that stopped the leaking

1959
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,840
by creating this swelling,

1960
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,520
gases develop.

1961
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,920
The gases then drop down to a liquid,

1962
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:31,580
a gel liquid,

1963
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,040
and then become the skin tissue.

1964
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,120
I know it sounds pretty remarkable, right?

1965
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,640
We were engineered to do that,

1966
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,200
not by what, a higher race?

1967
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,060
No, this is actually,

1968
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:43,200
this is just as simple as saying,

1969
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,820
if you want to take this basis,

1970
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,060
like for example,

1971
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,660
to develop an airplane,

1972
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,840
you have to understand what an airfoil is.

1973
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,560
You have a flat surface.

1974
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,760
The bottom of the surface is completely flat,

1975
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,200
but the top is slightly curved.

1976
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,140
So when the air passes over both sides,

1977
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,860
it does so at different speeds

1978
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,900
and actually creates a lower pressure on the top,

1979
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,760
which creates lift.

1980
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,660
So once you understand the process of induction,

1981
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:06,200
which is non-material,

1982
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,640
the initial material to form is an imponderable gas,

1983
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,940
then a ponderable gas,

1984
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,560
then a ponderable liquid.

1985
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,800
When I say imponderable,

1986
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,600
there are things called imponderable gases and liquids,

1987
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,060
meaning they don't follow the rules of liquids and gases.

1988
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,200
If you put, for example,

1989
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,720
an imponderable liquid in a sealed container,

1990
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,000
a very good sealed container,

1991
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,360
you come back the next day and it's on the table

1992
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,360
and the container is totally,

1993
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,560
there's no hole in the container

1994
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,560
and it's completely sealed.

1995
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,420
How did it get out?

1996
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,960
The physicists show you

1997
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,500
liquid helium is an imponderable gas liquid

1998
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,200
because when they pour the liquid helium in a glass,

1999
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,560
it rises up on the glass

2000
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,600
and it flows out all on its own.

2001
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,500
That's not-

2002
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,840
Yeah, that's the term they use.

2003
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:46,960
What's that?

2004
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,100
Superfluid, right.

2005
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:48,780
So for example,

2006
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:50,240
if you go out into outer space

2007
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,840
and you capture the gases there,

2008
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,440
you're not going to bring them back to earth

2009
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,080
because they go right through the container,

2010
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,820
even if it's three inches thick steel or aluminum,

2011
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,360
they can't bring it back.

2012
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,260
By the way, it smells like burning flesh out there.

2013
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,060
The way you bring gases from space back

2014
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,380
is you use a honeycomb,

2015
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,360
it's open on the top.

2016
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:07,960
I'm not going to,

2017
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,960
how do I know this?

2018
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:09,600
But anyway,

2019
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,100
let's go to the,

2020
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,940
continue with the human body.

2021
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,820
So this is how it all works.

2022
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,760
Now there's a lot of,

2023
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:21,120
the reason Daniel said I left a comment

2024
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,200
because I sometimes look around SSBOs

2025
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,080
and they talk about something,

2026
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:24,820
I don't want to say it,

2027
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,280
but I'll say med beds and all that.

2028
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah.

2029
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,120
And once you understand the process of induction,

2030
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,320
this is basically how you build a med bed.

2031
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,480
You understand the human induction,

2032
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,020
every one is slightly different.

2033
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,320
You have to get that slight difference.

2034
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,920
It's based on their race,

2035
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:43,060
when they were born,

2036
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,180
their cosmology,

2037
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,280
basically, you know,

2038
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,020
not their horoscope,

2039
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,380
but where, when they were born,

2040
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:49,020
all this stuff,

2041
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,640
the stuff that's in the mitochondria,

2042
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,760
the induction process begins,

2043
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,020
the super gases,

2044
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,220
the super fluid gases,

2045
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,320
or the imponderable gases must be produced

2046
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,780
that become the gel fluids,

2047
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:05,160
then become the tissue based on the reference material.

2048
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,140
Let me give you an example.

2049
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,180
We're bouncing around here,

2050
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,980
but we're hoping that whoever's listening

2051
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:11,000
is reasonably intelligent

2052
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,580
and they can take this parallel thinking,

2053
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,540
because that's how life is.

2054
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,560
It's like driving down the road.

2055
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,160
Here's a red car.

2056
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:15,800
Here's a green car.

2057
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:16,960
Here's a little lady crossing the street.

2058
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,440
Here's a baby.

2059
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,480
There's like, you see, that's how life is.

2060
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,000
But anyway, so when you're going down this road

2061
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,820
on how the body works and the healing,

2062
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,460
and I brought up the stupid notion of a med bed,

2063
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,940
when I tell you why it's stupid and maybe later,

2064
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:32,840
or I can,

2065
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,660
is because the principle must be understood.

2066
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:38,740
Let's say you have a med bed and it breaks down

2067
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:39,720
or you lose it.

2068
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,260
Now what?

2069
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,940
You don't know how it works.

2070
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,420
It becomes a ritual.

2071
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:46,080
What you see with the SSP is all these rituals.

2072
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,260
What they're talking about,

2073
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,920
when I listen to these people about the SSP,

2074
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,620
to me, it's like the ritual that I see,

2075
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:56,300
I see a very wealthy woman with a fur coat

2076
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:00,540
and she walks up to her $300,000 Rolls Royce

2077
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,880
and she gets into it and she drives around all day

2078
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,220
and comes back with her shopping.

2079
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,980
And I ask her anything about that car.

2080
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,380
She knows absolutely nothing.

2081
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,820
To her, that car is a ritual.

2082
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,160
The ritual is that she knows that if she gets into the car,

2083
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,920
this pedal on the right,

2084
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,160
if she performs this ritual, the car goes.

2085
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,320
This other pedal, if she performs this ritual,

2086
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,280
the car stops.

2087
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,380
If she turns this wheel to the left,

2088
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,420
the car goes to the left,

2089
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,660
turns this wheel to the right, it goes to the right.

2090
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,260
She cannot explain anything.

2091
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,400
She doesn't know anything that's going on.

2092
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,360
She doesn't, you see.

2093
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:36,940
Let's go back to the healing process.

2094
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:38,640
You must understand the product.

2095
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,000
For example, if you're on a deserted island

2096
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,280
that was very high altitude

2097
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,600
and you wanted to build a glider to get off

2098
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,420
because it was more efficient than building a raft,

2099
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:48,860
can you do it?

2100
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,180
Yeah, if you understand the principle of an airfoil,

2101
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,560
of course, right?

2102
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,980
So the principle here is the induction.

2103
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,740
Let's just bounce around a little bit.

2104
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,600
Let's go back to someone, for example,

2105
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,980
who is not feeling well.

2106
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,820
And you notice they have mucus and swelling.

2107
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:12,720
The body is struggling to increase the negative pressure,

2108
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,780
right, by clogging things up and decreasing the volume.

2109
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,640
So what you do to help that person

2110
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,320
is you wrap their body tight or put weights on them.

2111
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,000
I tell people, take a blanket and put sandbags

2112
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,740
or if you do several blankets

2113
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,400
and if you have books or anything heavy,

2114
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,720
put it on their limbs,

2115
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,040
not the central core like the stomach or lungs

2116
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,920
where it has to move,

2117
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,000
but their arms and legs.

2118
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:35,840
Cover it with weights for 20 minutes.

2119
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,320
So what you're doing,

2120
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,300
that weight is going to decrease the volume

2121
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:40,660
and the body's going to say,

2122
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,320
oh, I don't have to struggle to create so much vacuum

2123
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,340
because the volume just decreased.

2124
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,160
I'm at equilibrium.

2125
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,020
Actually, there's compression wear for athletes.

2126
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,960
There's some like tight,

2127
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,480
you know how the athletic wear is tight?

2128
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,140
Certain panels on the tops or the bottoms are extra tight

2129
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,360
to create compression on certain areas.

2130
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,340
Here's another notion.

2131
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,460
When you bang your elbow on your nose or your head,

2132
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,940
your first instinct is to what?

2133
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,460
Put your hand on it and squeeze it.

2134
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,320
That's your instinct.

2135
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,040
Even a child does that

2136
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,960
because if you don't do that,

2137
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,900
you're going to get swelling

2138
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:14,940
and the swelling is the,

2139
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,960
what happened, the cells are packed so tight

2140
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,760
that that bumping movement

2141
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,940
moves them momentarily enough to lose vacuum

2142
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:25,140
and the lymphatic fluid flows in there to make a plug,

2143
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,980
a natural plug, right?

2144
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,520
That's why when you get a cut,

2145
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,260
first thing is wrap it very tight,

2146
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,640
so tight that it doesn't matter

2147
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,700
if you cut off circulation just for a few minutes.

2148
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,300
So the brain does,

2149
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,120
see, five times a second,

2150
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:42,200
the brain sends a message to the body saying,

2151
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:42,840
are you okay?

2152
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,100
And five times a second,

2153
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,180
the body, it's just below the Schumann residence.

2154
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,940
Five times a second,

2155
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,260
the body sends a message back to the brain saying,

2156
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:51,900
we're okay.

2157
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,360
Back and forth constantly, right?

2158
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,220
That's, okay.

2159
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,940
What I wanted to say earlier

2160
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:59,180
before I got into this is,

2161
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,240
you know, like the doctor,

2162
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,460
when they take a blood test,

2163
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,160
they look at the blood cells, right?

2164
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,160
Right.

2165
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,040
You know what they don't know when they,

2166
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,460
let's say, take red blood cells.

2167
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,160
Okay, let's just take one group of cells.

2168
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,680
When they have a sample

2169
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,900
and they're looking at a slide

2170
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,920
and they see, let's say, a few hundred cells

2171
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,900
and you ask them, what is that?

2172
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,060
And they'll say, those are red blood cells.

2173
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,020
Okay, and?

2174
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,120
And that's it.

2175
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,240
They'll tell you the certain shape

2176
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,600
because there's certain like anemia,

2177
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,640
sickle cell, Cooley's anemia, right?

2178
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,600
That the cell becomes twisted, right?

2179
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,640
Let's say they're healthy cells.

2180
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,280
That's all they can say.

2181
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:32,960
Okay, dummy.

2182
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,640
You can't see that these cells over here

2183
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,860
are for the big toe

2184
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:39,740
based on their serial number.

2185
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,080
And these cells over here are for the eye.

2186
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,120
And this one's for the earlobe.

2187
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,280
And this one's for the rectum.

2188
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:46,980
You don't see that?

2189
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:47,920
No, we don't see that.

2190
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,260
They see it just random red blood cells.

2191
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,000
Is this the first time you guys

2192
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,400
are hearing this, by the way?

2193
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:54,860
Sure.

2194
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,700
Okay, so now once you develop a system,

2195
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,660
which is not difficult,

2196
01:36:58,760 --> 01:36:59,820
and I'm not going to go public

2197
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,660
with it right now,

2198
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:03,340
on how to determine which red blood cell,

2199
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,760
what part of the body it goes,

2200
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,560
you have a system of what's called coding

2201
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,180
and very specific attachment.

2202
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,000
Now, when you understand this,

2203
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,720
this is part of the information package

2204
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,800
in the code that has to go

2205
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,140
into what's called the med bed.

2206
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:20,040
So you have to have the coding of the cells.

2207
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,420
All of them.

2208
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,360
Holographic.

2209
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,320
Doesn't have to be holographic.

2210
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,580
No, it doesn't have to be.

2211
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,760
It has to be inductive.

2212
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,040
Because remember, you're going from energy

2213
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,060
to a super gas to a liquid.

2214
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,100
Okay, here's an example.

2215
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:35,340
Water.

2216
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,880
Water is the least understood.

2217
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,260
Water is not H2O.

2218
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,640
It's very easy to prove that.

2219
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,760
I prove it all the time.

2220
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,620
Okay, before I get into what water is,

2221
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:47,060
you ever see little children,

2222
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,380
they drink a lot of water,

2223
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:49,520
or maybe you've done it.

2224
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,560
You drink a quart of water

2225
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,160
and you jump up and down

2226
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,580
and you feel it slushing in your stomach.

2227
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,420
You can actually hear it,

2228
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,300
just like shaking a container of orange juice

2229
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:57,980
or something, right?

2230
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,660
Okay, you wait two minutes,

2231
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,500
jump up and down.

2232
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,360
Is there any more slushing?

2233
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:02,400
None.

2234
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,380
Because the water went into,

2235
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,520
became a gel state

2236
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,580
by the inductive energy in the body,

2237
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:08,460
turned into a gel.

2238
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:11,540
It's not hard to produce water as a gel.

2239
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:12,020
I did that.

2240
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:12,800
I got in big trouble.

2241
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,960
I said, if you do this again,

2242
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,640
you're in big trouble.

2243
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,580
Go ahead.

2244
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:18,140
They're now finally starting to realize

2245
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:19,980
that there are multiple states of water.

2246
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,800
They're calling it coherent water.

2247
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,320
At least these dissident doctors.

2248
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,200
What you refer to as the vacuum,

2249
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,760
otherwise what keeps healthy,

2250
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,280
they refer to as your water being coherent,

2251
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,620
which if you mess with that,

2252
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,140
that's what upsets everything else.

2253
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,860
Well, this is what I do with people

2254
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,220
because I also have a few with Ocellio,

2255
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,260
private calls and others on how to,

2256
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:48,580
I've worked in industry and I've made a pipe.

2257
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,560
There's a farm, for example,

2258
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,120
that has discharge of nitrates,

2259
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,640
you know, nitrates from the fertilizers.

2260
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,580
And they will not let them discharge

2261
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,460
the runoff water

2262
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,840
because it has over 180 parts per million

2263
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,860
of nitrates, right?

2264
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,100
It has to be below 40.

2265
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,100
So I built this pipe.

2266
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,320
It's about six feet long

2267
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,020
and you hold it up

2268
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,940
and you look right through it.

2269
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,100
There's nothing in the guts,

2270
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,660
just a straight pipe right through.

2271
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,780
I said, put this pipe in your section.

2272
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,200
It's just not any pipe.

2273
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,700
It's something that took me a while to build.

2274
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,140
I put it in the section of the irrigation,

2275
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,760
the 180, actually,

2276
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,740
it was 400 parts per million sometimes,

2277
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,540
usually 180 parts per million nitrates,

2278
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,700
various types of nitrates

2279
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,460
coming through the water.

2280
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,440
It runs through the pipe

2281
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,920
and it's anywhere between

2282
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,240
15 to 20 parts per million.

2283
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,620
It has to be below 40 to be acceptable.

2284
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,140
And they took the pipe,

2285
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,400
I came back late and it was,

2286
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,680
where's the night, what was going?

2287
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,460
There's no filtering.

2288
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:39,820
There's nothing,

2289
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,300
just going through a special pipe

2290
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:43,700
and it reduced it by 90%.

2291
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:46,520
I came back later on to check on it

2292
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,980
and they removed the pipe

2293
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,120
and they didn't know where it was.

2294
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,220
It was another group of people

2295
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:51,920
running the farm

2296
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,300
and they called the original person

2297
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,180
who I did this for

2298
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,420
and I said, what happened to it?

2299
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,620
He says, well, the university came here

2300
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,540
and they told me it could never work

2301
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,780
and they told me to take it out.

2302
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,620
So I bought this $250,000 chemical refining.

2303
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:08,860
It's called flocculation

2304
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,540
to remove the water.

2305
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,320
It's almost as good as what you had here.

2306
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,520
I'm like, are you an idiot?

2307
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,880
So the university could not explain it

2308
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,940
and I think they took the pipe, right?

2309
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:23,100
So imagine you had a free energy device

2310
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,920
in your house

2311
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,460
and you left it there

2312
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,120
and you came back

2313
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:27,860
and your roommate said,

2314
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:28,720
I don't know, some people came

2315
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,580
and took it, right?

2316
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,060
Of course, some people.

2317
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,160
So anyway, okay, water is not H2O.

2318
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,840
Level of prosperity though, Greg.

2319
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:40,280
You know, when Tesla has these breakthroughs,

2320
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,280
I don't know,

2321
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,360
when any of these doctors

2322
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,940
have these breakthroughs,

2323
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:46,200
why can't they just prosper?

2324
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:46,880
Why can't-

2325
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,300
Well, this is very simple.

2326
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,120
Okay, the biggest mistake you can make,

2327
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,720
anyone who says we have to make the world

2328
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,960
a better place is screwed.

2329
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:56,200
Why? Because you have evil forces

2330
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:56,980
on the planet,

2331
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,780
both corporeal and non-corporeal

2332
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,000
that do not want to see the world

2333
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,500
to become a better place, agreed?

2334
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,320
Why do they not want to do that?

2335
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,840
Well, because that's just their lot in life.

2336
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,780
They harvest the negative energy,

2337
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,840
for example, okay?

2338
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,880
Then also, but you're at a point

2339
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,220
in this history right now

2340
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:14,540
that the good forces

2341
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,120
are ready to come and clean it up

2342
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:17,740
and mop it up.

2343
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,300
It's very brutal when they do that.

2344
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,240
And you saying to make the world

2345
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,200
a better place, it's too late,

2346
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:25,740
and now you're part of the problem also.

2347
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,040
So when you say to make the world

2348
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,800
a better place,

2349
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,540
you're going to have the good side

2350
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,040
and the bad side against you.

2351
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,560
So the way you do that is not by saying it,

2352
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,200
but by actually doing it by example.

2353
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:36,720
Okay, you don't advertise

2354
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,980
and you don't wish it

2355
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,420
because you know it's going to,

2356
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,760
the good forces are going to come.

2357
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,440
They're going to apply

2358
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,080
a very high level of brutality,

2359
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:45,700
but it's going to be different this time.

2360
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,160
Okay, I want to just jump back to the water.

2361
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:49,960
They tell you water is H2O.

2362
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,180
Go ahead.

2363
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,140
You're glossing over something

2364
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:56,700
that seems like we're all about

2365
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,920
to get destroyed or something.

2366
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,800
You know, and now-

2367
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,540
No, no, there's going to be

2368
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,600
a good representative sample left over.

2369
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,700
Usually before they destroy

2370
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,540
mostly everyone and the ones

2371
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:06,840
that are worth keeping that are good,

2372
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,520
let's say righteous, they keep,

2373
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,580
but this time they're going to do it differently.

2374
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,120
They're going to destroy about 95%

2375
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,820
and there's only a few thousand people

2376
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,540
that they would consider keeping

2377
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:18,780
out of the billions.

2378
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,160
What's that?

2379
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,280
Who are these people?

2380
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,480
Well, if you know enough,

2381
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,720
you'll be able to recognize them.

2382
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,520
I think there were a group of ETs

2383
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,720
that are sometimes nicknamed the parents

2384
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,320
and they communicate with the very elite people

2385
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,720
that you would never know the names of.

2386
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:34,440
Am I right?

2387
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:35,320
Sure, sure.

2388
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,640
But the elites are also okay.

2389
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,760
There's two types of elites

2390
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,580
who haven't gotten into.

2391
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,400
There's the ones that are there

2392
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,020
as the ones you hear about

2393
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:43,920
and then there's the ones

2394
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,180
that are actually hybrids.

2395
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,000
Like, you know how everyone's talking

2396
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,980
about the Anunnaki, Anunnaki.

2397
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:51,220
I'm just sick of that word.

2398
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,320
They're just part of it.

2399
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,020
Yeah, I'm sick of it

2400
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:55,660
because it's like the biblical stuff.

2401
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,720
Anybody who uses the J-E-S-U-S is a code.

2402
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:01,360
The elites love to hear you use that word.

2403
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:02,820
God, you believe in G-O-D.

2404
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,400
They love to hear you say that

2405
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,600
because that means you know nothing

2406
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,500
about the subject, right?

2407
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,900
That's like, they love to hear people say,

2408
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,860
oh, that God damn Osama bin Laden.

2409
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,180
He sent 19 Arab hijackers

2410
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,580
that vaporized the towers with box cutters.

2411
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,740
See, so it's a code.

2412
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:22,140
If you read the,

2413
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,200
if you have any comprehension

2414
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,640
of the Sumerian texts,

2415
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,620
the Anunnaki, yes, are there,

2416
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,640
but they're sidebar.

2417
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,340
The main feature in the Sumerian texts

2418
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,360
are the Apkallu

2419
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,040
and no one's talking about the Apkallu

2420
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,440
because everyone's brainwashed.

2421
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,060
Are these the guys that have it

2422
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:40,280
within them to reset the civilization?

2423
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,020
Yes, no, they're hybrids.

2424
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,000
They are the hybrids.

2425
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:46,320
In other words, the Anunnaki

2426
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,560
don't come here to,

2427
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,740
they couldn't care less.

2428
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,440
We're like on a long laundry list

2429
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,980
of things they have to do today, right?

2430
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,740
What they do is they come here

2431
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:59,880
and they plant, they form the Apkallu.

2432
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:01,860
The Apkallu are hybrids.

2433
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,860
In the Bible, they're referred to as the Nephilim.

2434
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:07,800
You'll see, when you look at Sumerian artwork,

2435
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,440
Assyrian artwork,

2436
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,000
and they show an 18 foot tall guy

2437
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,720
that has a lion under his arm.

2438
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,760
It's a 400 pound lion.

2439
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,960
He holds it like a house cat.

2440
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,360
They're not making,

2441
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,740
and they have winged creatures

2442
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,340
and chimera and hybrids.

2443
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:21,860
They're not making those things up.

2444
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,460
They've carved in stone what they saw

2445
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,980
and what was there, you see.

2446
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,700
And they're also a little more intelligent than humans.

2447
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,480
They don't muck about on the surface

2448
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,340
because they're intelligent.

2449
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,540
They don't walk around the surface.

2450
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,580
Why, if you ask him,

2451
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,560
why are you not on the surface?

2452
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,380
Well, because we could get hit by an asteroid

2453
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,180
because I don't like the weather today.

2454
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,300
The sun burns my skin.

2455
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:47,960
Are they hybridized with something like 50-50 human?

2456
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,380
Yeah, a special type of human.

2457
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,520
Again, you can't just grab a human.

2458
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,720
You have to breed the human to be hybridized.

2459
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,200
The reason why I ask is because

2460
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,360
the way I understood it from,

2461
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,480
he mentioned Penny Bradley.

2462
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:01,800
She is, in my opinion,

2463
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,680
the most credible person in this SSP.

2464
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:09,040
And she says that the hierarchy does not end with the hybrids.

2465
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,640
They are the highest on earth,

2466
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:15,000
but it goes first to the Draco who own this planet

2467
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:15,720
and lease it out.

2468
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:16,980
And then to galactic authority,

2469
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,020
who are the people who truly reset every era of man

2470
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:24,000
and decide whether to let it be destroyed or not.

2471
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,700
I'm just relaying.

2472
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,020
There's some truth in that.

2473
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,400
Some truth, no.

2474
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,620
What I found out is different.

2475
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,860
But yes, I would keep it in a...

2476
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,480
There's no ownership.

2477
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:37,520
You've heard of the term,

2478
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:39,940
first in time is first in line

2479
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,560
or first in line is first in time.

2480
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,800
The first one to show up.

2481
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,420
Sense of discovery.

2482
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:46,340
Okay.

2483
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,580
Let me give you an analogy what's going on.

2484
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:52,520
You're in a particular universe.

2485
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,960
These beings come from a different universe,

2486
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,860
which we're in one dimension.

2487
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:58,680
Everything is in this one dimension.

2488
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:01,540
Within this single dimension,

2489
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,020
you have the perceivable and the imperceivable

2490
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:05,780
based on, like I said earlier,

2491
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,140
the best person with the best eyesight

2492
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:11,400
sees less than 1% of what can be seen, right?

2493
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,940
So why aren't these things being discussed

2494
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,080
by quote unquote, experiencers?

2495
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:17,080
Okay, this is, let me just say this.

2496
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,940
So far, I'm not convinced.

2497
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,340
What I see is a quote unquote,

2498
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:24,220
I'm not knocking anyone is that they lie

2499
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,440
and you swear to it.

2500
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,020
Somebody lies and the other person swears to it.

2501
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,440
This is what I feel about experiencers and no.

2502
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,700
I have an auditorium with 500 people

2503
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,000
and there's a guy on stage that cuts a woman in half

2504
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,140
and puts her back together.

2505
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,940
I'm gonna go to all those 500 people

2506
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,160
and sitting in the audience and they experienced that

2507
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,040
and they're gonna swear with a legal affidavit

2508
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,880
that they saw a woman being cut in half

2509
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,100
and being put back together on stage at the show.

2510
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:52,760
Yes, they will swear that they saw that.

2511
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:53,660
Are they lying?

2512
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:55,720
No, they're not.

2513
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:56,720
They're telling their truth.

2514
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,400
It's just that after a certain point,

2515
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,860
it exceeds anyone's ability to make up.

2516
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,140
So the only other option

2517
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:04,960
is that it's some kind of simulation,

2518
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,840
but yes, even scenario purpose

2519
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,220
and they intertwine with each other,

2520
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,400
all these testimonies

2521
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,940
and they sometimes spend hundreds of interviews

2522
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,820
and they confirm so many things

2523
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:17,100
that are happening on earth.

2524
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,860
And you know, it's sure.

2525
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,740
But everything they confirm has something in common

2526
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,460
that screams that it's a scenario

2527
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,060
that's being played on them, a prank.

2528
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,160
When I watch them to me,

2529
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:29,980
it's like going to,

2530
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,400
if you're anyone that has young children,

2531
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:32,420
six, seven year old,

2532
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,220
and they do the play,

2533
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,100
they get on stage.

2534
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,320
Look at me, I'm an elm tree.

2535
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,920
Look at me, I'm a, right?

2536
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,380
To me, when I watch all this stuff on YouTube,

2537
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,540
it's like five, six year old mentality.

2538
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,580
Tops, maybe eight year old.

2539
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:49,660
Obviously an eight year old has a higher pitch voice,

2540
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:50,340
smaller, you know,

2541
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,320
these are adults with adult voices or whatever.

2542
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,440
But if you do a transcript

2543
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,200
and you go to a little school play

2544
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,260
where they have the kindergarten,

2545
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,000
second year, it's no different to me.

2546
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,700
But that's my perception.

2547
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,940
And I see what's going on.

2548
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,160
I see what they're being put through.

2549
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,460
But they're not lying.

2550
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,160
But they're not competent enough

2551
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,600
to know what's going on.

2552
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:13,060
So do you think it's something happening

2553
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,960
as a simulation, like an advanced form of VR?

2554
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,540
Okay, that's why I said earlier,

2555
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,880
I don't, we live in a reality.

2556
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,620
Okay, you know,

2557
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,160
you ever run into someone who's broke

2558
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,780
and they say as analogy,

2559
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,860
I want a Ferrari.

2560
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:28,560
And five years later, you see him,

2561
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,360
he's like, he has a Ferrari.

2562
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:30,000
How'd you get the Ferrari?

2563
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:30,640
I don't know, man.

2564
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:31,860
Last time we talked, we were broke.

2565
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,240
I don't know.

2566
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:33,780
I just really wanted it.

2567
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:36,000
And somehow all these events happened

2568
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,600
and it felt, you know, I got one, right?

2569
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:39,240
Anyone that's in business,

2570
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,380
if you have a really good business plan

2571
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,360
for five years,

2572
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,060
you will accomplish it in less than three.

2573
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:44,820
Every time.

2574
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,600
If you have a good plan,

2575
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,900
it usually happens much faster.

2576
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:50,360
Your intent and your desire

2577
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:53,160
actually affects your surroundings enough

2578
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,640
to make things happen.

2579
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,500
In other words, the impedances are removed

2580
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,380
and a vacuum or, you know, it comes to you.

2581
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:01,300
Like it's not law of attraction.

2582
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:01,840
It's different.

2583
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,180
There's no law about this.

2584
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,660
But there's an overarching picture.

2585
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,920
Okay, imagine people get on a cruise ship

2586
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,560
in England to go to New York.

2587
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:15,100
Everyone on the cruise ship

2588
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,560
is going from England to New York.

2589
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:18,980
But while you're on the cruise ship,

2590
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,140
which is like a small city,

2591
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,440
you have free will to do whatever you want.

2592
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,380
They have theaters.

2593
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:24,840
They have restaurants.

2594
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,800
They have, you could sleep in your cabin, right?

2595
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,280
So what happens is we have intentions and desires

2596
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:32,060
and we can manifest tremendous amount.

2597
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:33,620
But then there's the really big picture,

2598
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,420
which does not change for everyone.

2599
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:35,980
You see?

2600
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,220
So within, between those two,

2601
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,280
there is a group of people

2602
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,060
that have been here for a very long time.

2603
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:44,700
Just like I've said to Zen recently,

2604
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,460
the SSP is like this,

2605
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,560
whether you believe it or not.

2606
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,600
When 500 years ago in the 14 and 1500s,

2607
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,040
when Columbus was doing his exploration,

2608
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,620
Magellan, there was no exploration,

2609
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:59,880
they knew Vasco da Gama goes to the Cape,

2610
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,880
Magellan sails around the world and all that.

2611
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:04,500
500 years ago, if you went out to the public,

2612
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,000
anyone and talked about this,

2613
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:06,880
they say, get out of here.

2614
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:07,980
No one's doing that.

2615
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,900
That didn't make it to the history books

2616
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,580
till two or 300 years later.

2617
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,440
So right now, when you're talking about

2618
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,640
kilometer long spaceships

2619
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,220
that are out in the solar system

2620
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,160
and all these other beings,

2621
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,480
you go tell the public, get out of here.

2622
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,200
Because 200 years from now,

2623
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,380
that'll be in the history books.

2624
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:24,300
Do you see what I mean?

2625
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,080
As fact.

2626
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,000
But it'll be twisted.

2627
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:31,220
I don't see SSP as conflicting with anything

2628
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,620
because it's just kept under wraps.

2629
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,420
It comes from every angle

2630
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,900
and it's simply too huge.

2631
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:39,180
Yeah, it is huge.

2632
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,840
Ben, the reason why it's really huge

2633
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,360
is let me just give you a little bit

2634
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,480
of something on this.

2635
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:45,240
Do you guys remember a few years ago,

2636
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:47,580
as I'm getting older,

2637
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:48,380
I say a few years ago,

2638
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:49,400
it could be 10 years ago.

2639
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:50,880
There was an article

2640
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,620
in one of these archaeological magazines

2641
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:54,800
and it said that they found a cloned mummy.

2642
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,040
And someone sent it to me.

2643
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:58,360
It says, look, they're going to clone a mummy.

2644
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,020
And I said, no,

2645
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,880
it doesn't say they're going to clone a mummy.

2646
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,620
It says that they found a mummy in Egypt

2647
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:05,240
and this mummy is a clone.

2648
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,440
There's a difference.

2649
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,820
In other words, they had cloning technology

2650
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:10,900
3000 years ago.

2651
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,100
Do you see where I'm going with this?

2652
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,000
They are after genetics.

2653
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,040
Are you referring to this group of people

2654
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,020
that have been here for a long time?

2655
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:20,180
You said, please, let me just,

2656
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,400
let me bounce around a little bit here.

2657
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,200
You know, when you're going to go run a race,

2658
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,000
you should warm up.

2659
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,140
You shouldn't do it cold, right?

2660
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,980
So I'm not going to get into the cloning cold

2661
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,180
because it's just too much.

2662
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,000
I love that analogy.

2663
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,120
Okay, so you'll warm up a little bit.

2664
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:32,840
So this person,

2665
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,580
nine out of 10 people saw this article.

2666
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,620
So they're going to clone mummies.

2667
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,080
I said, no, that's not what it says.

2668
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,460
According to the DNA, this is a clone.

2669
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:40,640
Okay.

2670
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:41,600
All right.

2671
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,100
Just like, for example,

2672
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,300
if I have an original picture

2673
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,820
and I go to a Xerox copy machine

2674
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,440
and make a copy,

2675
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,780
you can tell it's a copy.

2676
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,300
Right? Of a copy.

2677
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,240
Let's say it gets even more obvious, right?

2678
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:52,300
Okay.

2679
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,720
We can get into how that's noticeable.

2680
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:57,480
This, don't be baffled by the bullshit.

2681
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,280
The technical terms in medicine,

2682
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,080
DNA and all this other stuff is all,

2683
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,560
it's going to be done in simple terms

2684
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,560
that everyone can understand,

2685
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,900
but they don't do it

2686
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,500
because they want to keep everything separate.

2687
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:07,700
Okay.

2688
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,720
Another thing.

2689
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,400
There was a, also a few years ago,

2690
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,500
there was a thing about skin grafting for burn victims.

2691
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,500
A university got all this money to develop it, right?

2692
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,160
So when people lose a tremendous amount of skin,

2693
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,020
it could be fatal.

2694
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:23,400
Actually, you can grow it back with light,

2695
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,440
by the way, and no scars,

2696
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:25,580
but that's another discussion,

2697
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:26,680
if you understand that.

2698
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,220
They're not hard to do.

2699
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,020
But anyway, skin grafting was,

2700
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,220
I don't know if you guys remember,

2701
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,860
there was, it was a little bit in the media

2702
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,340
about five, six years ago.

2703
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:35,940
Okay.

2704
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,880
So this news crew goes to this business

2705
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,260
that was doing the skin grafting.

2706
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,140
So they walk in

2707
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:44,640
and the camera shows this table,

2708
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,480
a white table, about eight feet long,

2709
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,200
four feet wide.

2710
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,760
And it has several hundred flasks on it,

2711
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,900
glass flask of liquid.

2712
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,540
And the table is rocking back and forth, moving.

2713
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,240
And they only show it for like a second.

2714
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,720
And the guy goes up to one of them with a tweezer

2715
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,020
and he pulls it out,

2716
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,640
a piece of skin.

2717
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,640
It looks like chicken skin.

2718
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:04,000
And he puts it on a,

2719
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,080
something that looks like a cutting board

2720
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,420
and he scrapes away a layer

2721
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,000
and he holds up a translucent layer

2722
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,260
and he says, this is what we want.

2723
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:10,760
And he says, well, how did you get that?

2724
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,180
He says, we took some genetic material

2725
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,180
and we grow the skin.

2726
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,340
Now, let me just go back to what I just said.

2727
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:17,860
How do they grow the skin?

2728
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:20,920
It's just a table that you can go to anywhere,

2729
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,020
your grandma's table.

2730
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,660
And you put four hydraulic arms in each corner

2731
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,040
so it rocks it in a certain way,

2732
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:27,940
just so everything's moving,

2733
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,600
with some glass flasks,

2734
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:32,800
with some plasma-based water type material,

2735
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:33,680
with genetic material,

2736
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,040
and it starts to grow.

2737
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:38,060
Where's the high technology in that?

2738
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:41,200
You can take tissue, genetic material,

2739
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:43,920
and have it in a certain fluid.

2740
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,220
I could get into the fluid.

2741
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:46,600
I was going to with the water,

2742
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,700
but that's another thing.

2743
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,140
As long as you have it moving,

2744
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,680
it will start to grow.

2745
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,020
Do you think a society 3,000 years ago

2746
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:58,100
knew how to put liquid in a container

2747
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:00,140
and just keep it moving and grow tissue?

2748
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:00,860
Of course.

2749
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,860
That's how simple the skin grafting,

2750
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,700
the skin is grown.

2751
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:05,900
Of course, there's more to it.

2752
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,260
It's very subtle energy, right?

2753
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:09,180
That has to be applied.

2754
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,900
But basically, this is going to be found recently,

2755
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,600
I was having a discussion on cloning

2756
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,780
about a year ago with someone

2757
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:17,700
I found the skin grafts,

2758
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:18,580
and you can find it's a video,

2759
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,020
and they show you how they're making it.

2760
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:20,520
It's just like,

2761
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:21,340
in other words,

2762
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,500
you can do this in your kitchen, right?

2763
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:25,680
You notice how

2764
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,160
whenever they show you technology,

2765
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,280
they always show you things

2766
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,740
that you cannot get yourself.

2767
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,760
Like I said, you can't be a regular string.

2768
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,260
It has to be medical approved, right?

2769
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:36,200
They make it all special and seem so elusive,

2770
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,540
like we're this just underclass

2771
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:39,760
that we never get it.

2772
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,940
They want to make it seem

2773
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,380
like there's this bar to entry,

2774
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,420
which is all subject to licensure.

2775
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,000
Which is what the Rockefeller,

2776
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,220
people who worship death.

2777
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,180
Well, yeah.

2778
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:50,000
Also, people say the bankers are on the road.

2779
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:50,960
Those are the clerks.

2780
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:53,080
They're the clerks, like at a low level.

2781
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:54,340
Who are they the clerks of?

2782
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,680
Okay, if you've ever heard of them,

2783
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:57,720
or saw them,

2784
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,080
or an article in history,

2785
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,540
or heard their voice on TV,

2786
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:01,620
they have no,

2787
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,480
they're not the power.

2788
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,060
They're the ones that the people in power

2789
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,060
put in front, right?

2790
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:09,280
So the cloning has been around always,

2791
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,680
as long as mankind has been.

2792
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,640
It's very, very, very simple technology.

2793
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,000
It's okay.

2794
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:16,860
One way to do it,

2795
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:17,820
you have to understand

2796
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,040
how the natural system works.

2797
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,060
It wants to live.

2798
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,780
It wants to,

2799
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,820
like, for example,

2800
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,540
you can go to a suburb in America

2801
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:27,800
and tell everyone to leave their house

2802
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,460
and come back.

2803
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,620
You know how the suburbs look

2804
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:31,460
with concrete sidewalks and driveways.

2805
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:32,920
And yeah, but you know,

2806
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,840
there's regrowth.

2807
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:35,780
And then, you know that.

2808
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:37,660
Yes, if you leave that any city,

2809
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:39,140
you don't do anything for 10 years,

2810
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,680
you'll come back and look like a forest.

2811
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:41,780
Right?

2812
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:43,540
There's so much life teeming.

2813
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:44,860
All planets,

2814
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:46,760
all planets, not just here.

2815
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:47,560
Everything.

2816
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:48,500
We're not, we're,

2817
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,460
we're allowed to know that

2818
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,520
weeds will come back,

2819
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,960
which will bring bigger plants,

2820
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:53,120
which will move between the bug

2821
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,000
momentary down the valley.

2822
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,500
But we're not allowed to know that

2823
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,920
this like you're harping on

2824
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,780
with this skin will grow back

2825
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:00,080
or this, this, I guess,

2826
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,320
gel state water will grow back.

2827
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,220
We're allowed to know it in this capacity,

2828
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,840
but not that capacity.

2829
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,500
Right?

2830
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:07,500
The gel state water,

2831
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:11,120
39.4 or 4.2 Celsius

2832
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:12,780
is the anomaly point of water.

2833
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,060
Meaning if you go above or below

2834
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,620
that temperature,

2835
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,900
the water expands, right?

2836
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,680
Water is, as you warm it,

2837
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:18,160
it expands.

2838
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:19,220
And as you cool it below

2839
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:20,340
that temperature, it expands.

2840
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,340
And I told this to a professor once.

2841
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,200
He said, no, it doesn't.

2842
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:23,620
I said, Oh yeah.

2843
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,960
Put a glass of water in a freezer.

2844
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:25,560
What happens?

2845
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:25,820
Right?

2846
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:26,560
Oh yeah.

2847
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:26,840
Yeah.

2848
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:27,120
Yeah.

2849
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:30,020
39.4 degrees Fahrenheit

2850
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:31,420
or 4.2 Celsius.

2851
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,200
You put that in an ovoid shaped vessel

2852
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,400
and you rotate the water

2853
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,520
with a silver impeller

2854
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,500
and you draw a vacuum.

2855
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,280
The vessel is sealed.

2856
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,800
You draw a vacuum,

2857
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,760
two inches of mercury, not much.

2858
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,900
Actually draw about six inches of mercury

2859
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:47,200
minus, you know, vacuum.

2860
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:48,420
And then you inject some

2861
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,380
very high quality CO2 gas

2862
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,240
that has not come from

2863
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,400
the petroleum industry.

2864
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,400
So you end up still in a vacuum.

2865
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,260
So it goes from minus six to minus two.

2866
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,900
And when you rotate that

2867
01:56:58,900 --> 01:56:59,600
and you pulse it

2868
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,480
with a certain type of UV light

2869
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,340
that is not powered by two wires,

2870
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,160
only one wire,

2871
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,880
you release the water

2872
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,360
and you open the valve

2873
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,820
and the water's not coming out.

2874
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:10,680
And you start shaking it

2875
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,700
and something that looks like

2876
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,040
soft cheese comes out of the vessel.

2877
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:14,980
You put it in a glass

2878
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:16,000
and you hold the glass sideways

2879
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,440
and the water like jello

2880
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,960
wants to flow out and it doesn't.

2881
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,680
And then once it hits the air

2882
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:22,800
and the light and you look at it,

2883
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,340
poof, it flows out on the table.

2884
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:25,300
Okay.

2885
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,020
So you drink this water,

2886
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:27,960
this gel water.

2887
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,480
You can actually, well,

2888
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,960
everybody close your ears.

2889
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,620
You can breathe this water too.

2890
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,460
You won't drown in it.

2891
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:33,740
Okay.

2892
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,300
Let me go back then.

2893
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:38,360
Anyway, I've had people

2894
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,800
that have had this

2895
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,300
and they said,

2896
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,600
I have to call a cab.

2897
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:42,680
I can't drive home.

2898
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,160
I feel totally high and drunk.

2899
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,000
I'm hallucinating.

2900
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:46,400
Right?

2901
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,860
Are they being facetious

2902
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,240
because they can't handle reality

2903
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:51,280
or it has some sort of effect?

2904
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,320
No, it has that effect

2905
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,140
because that's what the body did

2906
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:55,460
on the inside.

2907
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:56,600
You did it on the outside

2908
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,220
and the body's like,

2909
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:57,760
wait a second.

2910
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,160
That's not supposed to happen

2911
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:00,520
until it passes the duodenum

2912
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,640
or the duodenum in the stomach.

2913
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:03,020
The duodenum is the drain hole

2914
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:03,480
in the stomach.

2915
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:04,780
That's what we're told.

2916
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,420
That's what we're told, you know.

2917
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:06,940
Right, right.

2918
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,020
So I had a guy,

2919
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,840
there was a guy very,

2920
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,240
he was an Israeli Masada from Tokyo.

2921
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,940
By the way, the Tokyo Yakuza

2922
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,340
is the Israeli Masada

2923
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,640
and the Persian mafia

2924
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,440
that run all the underworld in Japan.

2925
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,260
Anyway, it's just another story.

2926
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:24,340
But he got some of this water

2927
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:26,020
and he jumped up and he says,

2928
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,360
you guys, you're lying.

2929
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:28,580
You're a liar, Greek.

2930
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:30,220
I said, why?

2931
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:32,360
He says, you put cocaine in this water.

2932
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,100
I said, well, first of all,

2933
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,280
how do you know what cocaine is like?

2934
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,900
But anyway, I was like, no, no.

2935
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:39,320
There's no cocaine in this water.

2936
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:40,920
So why would he say that?

2937
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,540
Everyone has a slightly different reaction, right?

2938
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,060
So we put this equipment in storage,

2939
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,380
you know, like a storage locker

2940
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:50,000
and we came back and it was all gone.

2941
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:51,140
And I asked the people what happened.

2942
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,080
There was triple, anyway, double padlocks.

2943
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:55,480
No one ever came here.

2944
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,720
They looked in the camera.

2945
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:57,900
There's nobody in the camera.

2946
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,280
How come all the equipment's gone?

2947
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,260
Doesn't matter.

2948
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:01,720
That's the same with the med bed.

2949
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:03,920
If you don't know how to fish

2950
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,780
and I give you fish,

2951
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,360
you're in trouble.

2952
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:06,720
You might eat for a day, right?

2953
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:09,820
If you don't know how the human body works,

2954
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:10,720
forget about med beds.

2955
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,800
Forget about super drugs.

2956
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,800
You know, there are drugs.

2957
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,640
There are sprays, injections and pills

2958
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,180
you could take that will repair your body

2959
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,000
in a few hours.

2960
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:18,960
Like what?

2961
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:19,900
Can we go over some?

2962
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,560
Well, we just mentioned what happens

2963
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,540
with the water on the outside.

2964
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:25,140
No, that's a boring introduction.

2965
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,700
What I want to do is go back

2966
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,020
to the existential question.

2967
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:31,340
We can go over it, but it's okay.

2968
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:34,660
Can I just try to bring it around

2969
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,260
because this is a common thread

2970
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,780
between what I've heard from you

2971
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:40,860
and Penny Bradley and Radu Chinamar.

2972
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:43,520
It's that you all kind of hint

2973
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,340
to the fact that, well,

2974
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,860
everyone on earth is insane.

2975
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,360
And that Radu Chinamar says

2976
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,360
that the influence of the reptilians

2977
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,160
something like 100,000 years ago

2978
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,560
led to our DNA being super specific

2979
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,560
and very, the most, you know, physical.

2980
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:04,660
And this allowed other species

2981
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,300
to incarnate here to figure out

2982
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,180
for their own what they did wrong.

2983
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:11,600
And Penny adds the fact that

2984
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,540
initially it was just baby souls,

2985
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:15,400
but because species noticed

2986
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,780
they could drop in their criminal souls

2987
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,920
just as an exploit.

2988
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:19,620
So they did that.

2989
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,060
And now it's a 50-50 split.

2990
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:21,840
Does this resonate?

2991
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:24,740
No, no, not at all.

2992
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,660
Because I can give much more.

2993
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:28,700
In other words, yes, it's very broad.

2994
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:31,180
It's just like saying apples are red.

2995
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:33,620
But I've seen apples that are green.

2996
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,800
I've seen apples that are yellow.

2997
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,720
But your apples are red

2998
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:37,980
is not incorrect, right?

2999
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:39,760
So it's more than just baby

3000
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:40,660
and criminal souls then.

3001
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,000
Yes. Okay.

3002
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:43,120
Where you are, for example,

3003
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,160
if you're in a submarine,

3004
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,680
it's really, really bad

3005
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:47,460
to fire a projectile weapon.

3006
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,500
If you're in outer space

3007
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,960
in a thin capsule,

3008
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,120
it's very bad to fire a projectile weapon

3009
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,240
for obvious reasons, right?

3010
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:55,320
You could damage the environment.

3011
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:56,980
When you're on earth

3012
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:58,080
and you murder someone,

3013
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,200
you must be taken out.

3014
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,180
You must, in other words,

3015
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:01,000
blood for blood,

3016
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,720
eye for eye on earth.

3017
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,580
Other places, not so.

3018
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,680
So where you are,

3019
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,260
your environment has its laws

3020
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:10,220
and its rules by whoever created it.

3021
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:10,960
Right?

3022
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,600
It is. Who created us?

3023
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,100
Okay, well, that's even further

3024
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,800
down the line.

3025
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:17,780
You know, I would rather you ask me

3026
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,680
if you got any candy.

3027
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:20,060
I'm just, I'm not being facetious.

3028
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,040
But I don't know exactly.

3029
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,180
We're not, at this point,

3030
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,320
we can't, I don't know.

3031
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,560
But I have a really good idea

3032
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:26,740
based on the claimants.

3033
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,660
There's a big difference

3034
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:30,480
between creation and formation.

3035
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,140
And also, there's a big difference

3036
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:34,400
between the soul and the spirit.

3037
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,920
You must define those things.

3038
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,800
If you lack the definition,

3039
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:39,260
you will be going around

3040
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,500
in circles like a child

3041
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:43,040
that one day wants a red fire engine

3042
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,440
and then wants a teddy bear

3043
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:46,700
and low level, immature things.

3044
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:49,560
Can you tell us the distinction between them?

3045
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,480
Yes, it's in your language.

3046
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,040
Everything is in your language.

3047
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:55,260
One of the codes, for example,

3048
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:56,360
is the word nice.

3049
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,920
Look up in etymology

3050
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,100
what the word nice means.

3051
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:00,340
Does anybody know what it means?

3052
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:02,100
Yeah, somebody can have me look this up, yeah.

3053
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:03,840
Have a nice day.

3054
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:04,720
You're a nice guy.

3055
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:06,960
Aren't we having a nice conversation?

3056
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,340
The word nice, look it up.

3057
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,120
It means foolish, stupid, senseless.

3058
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,860
It's like the word J-E-S-U-S.

3059
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,360
People who use that do not know.

3060
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,520
The elite love that.

3061
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:17,720
They love it when you say,

3062
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,360
I'm taking blood pressure medication.

3063
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:22,420
You know, they love to hear

3064
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:24,240
that they're reptilian shapeshifters.

3065
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:25,340
They love that.

3066
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,200
They're laughing at it, right?

3067
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,700
Okay, so the same with the soul and the spirit.

3068
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:31,540
It's in the language.

3069
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,740
Okay, let's go very simple.

3070
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,520
The English language is no such thing.

3071
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:37,340
You know, there is,

3072
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,480
but it's made up of a lot of other cognates

3073
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:40,980
like Greek, a lot of Greek words.

3074
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,300
Do you guys speak Greek?

3075
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,540
No, but you know, you know,

3076
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,020
at least 100 Greek words

3077
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:47,280
without knowing it if you speak English, right?

3078
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,140
It's kind of like President Bush.

3079
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,260
They asked him, for example,

3080
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:53,600
the French cannot be good at business

3081
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,640
because they don't have a word for entrepreneur.

3082
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,740
Which entrepreneur is a French word, you see?

3083
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,000
So don't be like that.

3084
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:06,980
So for example, the Greek psyche is the spirit, the mind.

3085
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:11,700
That's where you get the word psyche, psychology, psychopath.

3086
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,360
It has to do with the mind.

3087
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,880
What the mind is pure information.

3088
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,540
There is no physical counterpart.

3089
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:20,380
For example, if you have, let's say,

3090
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,260
a CD with the Beatles' White Album

3091
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:25,660
and you give that to a CD to a materials analyst

3092
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,180
and 400 bucks a week later,

3093
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:28,740
he'll give you a report, three pages,

3094
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,420
and he'll give you the diameter,

3095
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:32,300
the materials in the disc and all that.

3096
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:34,340
You say, do you see the Beatles' music in there?

3097
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:34,900
He says, no,

3098
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,500
but you have to put it in an appropriate CD player.

3099
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:40,140
And now you hear the Beatles' music, right?

3100
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,560
He cannot see the music.

3101
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:45,400
So the physical part is the body, right?

3102
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:47,520
So the spirit is the information.

3103
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,420
Just like if you take apart a hard drive,

3104
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,640
you don't see anything in there.

3105
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:55,860
Or a vinyl record, you see dips and peaks, right?

3106
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,100
You don't see that.

3107
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:58,900
You need to play it on appropriate things.

3108
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,820
So it's information.

3109
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:02,900
The spirit, the human spirit is information.

3110
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:04,460
It's what makes you, you.

3111
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,620
And without the appropriate body,

3112
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:09,340
it goes into disanimation.

3113
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:12,120
Disanimation is like being asleep or in a coma.

3114
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:16,680
The soul is the animate part of the body.

3115
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,540
In Greek, the soul is the pneuma, the P-N-U prefix.

3116
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:22,660
So when you, it means moving air,

3117
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:24,000
but it's not just moving air.

3118
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,960
It's the entire metabolism.

3119
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:28,860
Because if you choke, suffocate someone,

3120
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:31,440
stop the air, they start to suffocate

3121
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:34,140
and the rest of the metabolism eventually shuts down.

3122
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:36,820
So the pneuma is where you get pneumatic,

3123
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,020
moving pneumonia, right?

3124
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:41,880
Whenever you see the P-N-U, that's the soul.

3125
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,600
And then you have the carne, which is the body

3126
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,560
to incarnate, reincarnate, discarnate.

3127
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:50,020
Okay, so you have a physical body,

3128
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,260
which in stasis does not have to have a metabolism

3129
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,500
because it's in stasis.

3130
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,480
Once it's out of stasis and it's animated,

3131
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:58,960
it must have a metabolism.

3132
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:01,660
Depending on the body, fluids flowing,

3133
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:04,100
intake, outtake, food, nutrition,

3134
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,020
all these other things,

3135
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:06,700
depending on the environment and the being.

3136
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,700
Because there are beings that don't have to eat.

3137
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:12,060
Okay, actually here on earth,

3138
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:14,800
there are salamanders that don't have mouths.

3139
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:16,740
Are you familiar with them in the deep caves?

3140
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:20,120
Yes, they just sort of gills just, yeah, out like that.

3141
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:20,840
Yeah, they expend it.

3142
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,040
Okay, so, all right.

3143
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:24,160
So your soul is your metabolism.

3144
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:26,020
So, and your body is the physical part

3145
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,220
and your spirit is who you are.

3146
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:30,760
So this is what happens.

3147
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,600
You're a physical body, carne, material,

3148
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,180
induction, inductive being, electrical,

3149
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:40,080
not electromagnetic, no, inductive,

3150
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,900
in a biological vacuum with a metabolism,

3151
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:45,940
which is the soul and then that has a spirit.

3152
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,760
So let's go back to the soul.

3153
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,600
Also, anything that's alive, the soul is interchangeable.

3154
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:53,900
Like, for example, there was a dog

3155
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,480
that a gardener hit on the head.

3156
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,820
It was bothering, it was playful.

3157
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,900
And this gardener hit the dog on the head with a shovel

3158
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:02,060
and the dog passed out, unconscious.

3159
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,220
I said, that's terrible.

3160
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:03,980
And they drove away.

3161
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,860
I go up to the dog, it's not breathing.

3162
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,960
So I put my hands around the dog's muzzle

3163
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:11,100
and I blew air into its mouth.

3164
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,540
Still not breathing.

3165
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,180
I did it two, three, four times.

3166
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:17,500
And then the dog went, and it started breathing.

3167
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:20,220
It got up, walked in a circle and ran away.

3168
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:24,920
What I did was I put my soul, my breath into that dog

3169
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:28,180
until its soul rejuvenated.

3170
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:28,760
Do you see?

3171
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:31,100
Your breath is your soul and your metabolism.

3172
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:34,440
If you have to do resuscitation,

3173
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:36,340
you're putting your soul into their body

3174
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:39,220
until their soul is running their own self.

3175
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,720
And now your spirit is your mind.

3176
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,840
Your spirit is what makes you, your personality.

3177
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,780
You, that is distinct to you.

3178
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,300
That is like your serial number.

3179
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:49,360
There's no one else or nothing else in the universe.

3180
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:53,080
Even if you met a copy of yourself in another universe,

3181
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:55,480
just like in Star Trek, they went to a parallel universe.

3182
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:57,560
You had the good Spock and the evil Spock, right?

3183
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,660
It's not you, exactly.

3184
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,560
It's a version of you, like a splinter.

3185
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:03,380
I think they call that a shard of you.

3186
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:04,920
And those can be created, by the way.

3187
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,180
Alters, yes.

3188
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,060
The spirit can be broken off,

3189
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:12,920
but just like you can break off a piece of a tree,

3190
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:13,820
let's say, right?

3191
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:16,240
And all these things and graft it, right?

3192
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,260
You could break off a branch.

3193
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:20,360
Like I knew a lady, she had a really green thumb

3194
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:21,280
when I was in New York City.

3195
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,040
We walked through some of these lobbies,

3196
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:24,240
they had these exotic plants.

3197
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,920
And she goes up to the plant,

3198
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,500
she breaks off a little piece with a twig,

3199
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:28,120
just the right amount.

3200
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,760
She goes home and she grows her own plant.

3201
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,080
If I did it, I couldn't do it.

3202
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:33,740
I don't know how to, it would just die.

3203
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:35,800
But she had the ability to do that, you see?

3204
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,900
So to break off alters is not every,

3205
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,060
it is a specific way it has to be done.

3206
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:43,500
And through a certain psychic type, anyway.

3207
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:47,680
And that too is kind of a fractal of the way

3208
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:50,920
that we are parts of higher beings, right?

3209
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:52,540
The way that we split.

3210
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:56,020
Yes, let's say you go out and buy a Beatles white album CD

3211
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:57,680
and you make a copy for your friend.

3212
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,540
There's a code in there, first of all,

3213
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,820
that they don't let you copy the CD, right?

3214
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:04,160
Sometimes.

3215
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:06,260
Now, if you can hack that code,

3216
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:07,280
when you make a copy,

3217
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:10,080
that CD will sound identical like the first one.

3218
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:12,340
Very slight variation because of the over,

3219
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,280
depending on the oversampling rate.

3220
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:17,700
If you have a good digital format reader,

3221
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:19,100
you can see that it was a copy

3222
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,520
because the sampling is different,

3223
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,460
but almost identical.

3224
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:25,720
And you could keep making copies digitally like that.

3225
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:27,200
Or analog is worse.

3226
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:29,160
Analog is much worse.

3227
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:30,300
When you have a tape from a tape

3228
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,260
after the third generation, it's unlistenable.

3229
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,800
That's why most people on this planet are unlistenable

3230
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,200
because they're analog copies of an oppressive culture.

3231
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,340
Not government, not society.

3232
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,280
And I hate when I hear, by the way,

3233
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,100
this is not to go,

3234
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:46,500
I want to go back to several topics.

3235
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:48,000
The government did this.

3236
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:48,800
The government is abducted.

3237
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:49,960
No, no, no, there is no government.

3238
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:50,820
It's the state.

3239
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:52,980
Xana, we went over this with you.

3240
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:53,260
Yes.

3241
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,060
Do you know the difference

3242
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,160
between the state and the government?

3243
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:56,580
There's not the same thing.

3244
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:58,660
The state hijacks the government.

3245
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,880
Right, every time.

3246
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:03,540
And does that have to do with the fringe around the...

3247
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:05,880
No, that's the army.

3248
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,640
The fringe around the flag is just the army flag.

3249
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:09,940
So when you go into a court,

3250
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,180
a lot of these patriots complain about the fringe.

3251
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:13,920
They shouldn't be complaining about the fringe.

3252
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:16,200
They should be complaining that the judge is in a black robe

3253
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,100
and he's out of uniform.

3254
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,700
He should be wearing a military uniform.

3255
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:20,880
That's the army issue.

3256
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,880
The army issue flag is a different proportion

3257
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:23,960
than the civilian flag.

3258
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:27,000
It's in title five of the US code,

3259
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,200
or don't hold me to the titles.

3260
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,660
Just like I don't quote Bible verses,

3261
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:31,160
I don't quite...

3262
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:33,560
Just recently, I have to, you know,

3263
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,320
people that leave all these comments,

3264
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:36,480
they're like, do you know what that fringe

3265
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,740
around your American flag means?

3266
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,040
Yeah, I just told you, it's the American army flag.

3267
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:40,680
That's all it is.

3268
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:41,560
Army regulation.

3269
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,460
Other different, yeah, version.

3270
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,940
But yeah, people just know all of them.

3271
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:47,100
Yeah, the civilian, if you want to know

3272
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:49,040
what the civil flag of the United States looks like,

3273
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:49,980
go to the airport.

3274
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:51,920
It's red and white stripes,

3275
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:55,200
and it doesn't have a blue background with white stars.

3276
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:56,160
It's a symbol.

3277
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:56,760
It's a crest.

3278
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:57,380
It's a seal.

3279
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:58,680
It's white.

3280
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:00,880
You look up the civil and it's hung vertically.

3281
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:02,560
And the reason they do it in airports

3282
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,160
is because they don't hang the US flag

3283
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:06,480
because that's a flag of war.

3284
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:09,500
And the last thing you want is an international airport,

3285
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,700
airplanes coming in to basically a militarized airport.

3286
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:13,440
They're not going to land.

3287
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:15,380
You have to fly the civil flag.

3288
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:17,780
You can see it at all the American airports.

3289
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:19,380
Oh, okay.

3290
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,780
Wait, so is it this flag right here?

3291
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:22,340
Let's see.

3292
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:23,960
Just put in civil flag.

3293
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:24,660
There's several of them,

3294
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,120
but there's the main one that has the seal

3295
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,060
instead of the stars.

3296
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:28,440
Oh, seal.

3297
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,000
It's basically an eagle, yeah,

3298
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:32,500
which is another thing.

3299
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:33,960
While he's looking,

3300
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,420
can I ask you if you think

3301
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:37,740
that there are infinite amount of timelines

3302
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:40,900
or just the one that keeps resetting itself?

3303
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,340
It might have options,

3304
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:43,640
but eventually it's going to decide

3305
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,380
and it's going to lead to the same thing.

3306
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:46,620
Both.

3307
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:47,820
And there's more.

3308
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:51,040
When we talk about the gods and all that,

3309
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,480
they are beings like us,

3310
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:55,680
but much higher security.

3311
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,260
We would be like a three-month-old baby

3312
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:01,140
and they would be like Arnold Schwarzenegger

3313
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:01,720
in his prime.

3314
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,500
But how do we reach that level, sir?

3315
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:04,520
You are.

3316
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,120
You are.

3317
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:06,740
You can't do it in this incarnation

3318
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,780
because the DNA will not allow it.

3319
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,920
What kind of DNA will allow that, though?

3320
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:11,840
You'll see.

3321
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:14,320
It will be a light-based DNA.

3322
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,040
For example, let me get into this.

3323
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:17,300
I'll say it anyway.

3324
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,600
Remember years ago,

3325
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,480
there's a lot of talk about

3326
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:20,740
people getting the chip, right?

3327
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:21,740
Right.

3328
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,320
Well, then there was talk about

3329
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:25,480
they don't have to inject you

3330
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:26,860
with a grain of rice size.

3331
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,600
It could just...

3332
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:28,760
You can inhale it, right?

3333
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:30,920
Well, do you know that there are chips

3334
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,860
that are gaseous?

3335
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:33,920
It's just a field of energy

3336
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:36,400
that they can imprint on your body

3337
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:38,620
with a cell phone tower

3338
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:40,980
and you have an air bubble in your body.

3339
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,180
It's a gaseous field

3340
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,520
and you don't even know it's there.

3341
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,800
And that's a chip.

3342
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,120
It records all information.

3343
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,220
You know how people talk about

3344
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:49,620
the Akashic Records, right?

3345
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,140
Yes, I hear that all the time.

3346
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:51,480
Okay.

3347
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:53,360
One possibility,

3348
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,920
the Akashic Records are actually

3349
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,520
stored in the noble gases,

3350
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,520
you know, the helium and the argon,

3351
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:00,880
xenon.

3352
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,180
Those gases are noble.

3353
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:04,920
They do not react with anything else.

3354
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,240
The Akashic Record is stored

3355
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:09,380
in the noble gases and elements

3356
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:11,180
that do not have any chemical reaction

3357
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:12,780
with anything else to be corrupted.

3358
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:14,060
Right.

3359
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:15,920
Are you familiar with this or no?

3360
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:16,640
Wow.

3361
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,940
Once you understand transmutation,

3362
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,740
now we can go to the next level

3363
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,340
and discuss what these SSP people

3364
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,880
are trying to allude to.

3365
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:25,720
Yeah, I agree.

3366
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:27,560
It's about getting the basics right first.

3367
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:29,920
Once you understand the soul and the spirit,

3368
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:31,360
right?

3369
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,240
Like, for example,

3370
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:34,320
if I tell people your soul is interchangeable

3371
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,500
with a dog, they get offended

3372
02:12:36,180 --> 02:12:37,760
because they don't know what it means.

3373
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:40,400
If I tell someone you're not nice,

3374
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:41,080
they get offended.

3375
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:41,880
I'm not nice.

3376
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:43,100
I hope I'm never nice.

3377
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:44,760
Do you see?

3378
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:45,820
Yes.

3379
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:47,880
And you also,

3380
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,140
you stress this seven-year cycle

3381
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:51,700
and then there are many other cycles

3382
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:53,740
and then something will...

3383
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:54,420
Yes.

3384
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,080
Okay, hold on.

3385
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:57,340
There's a difference between a seven-year cycle

3386
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:58,420
and a seven-year period.

3387
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:00,420
I don't use the word cycle.

3388
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,440
I talk about periods.

3389
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,100
In other words,

3390
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,860
because we're in the credits portion,

3391
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,620
the time ended around 1998

3392
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:08,680
and you have a five-year period

3393
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:10,760
and then four seven-year periods

3394
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,600
ending with a three-and-a-half-year period.

3395
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:13,860
And we're,

3396
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,580
the end of this seven-year period is 2025,

3397
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:17,800
which you're going to see

3398
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,600
a Middle East Union take over the world.

3399
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:22,060
Basically, it'll be the hub of power.

3400
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,120
That's what all this is about.

3401
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,780
I talked about this a long time ago.

3402
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:27,580
Starting in 2018 to 2025,

3403
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:29,500
by the middle of just 2022,

3404
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:31,200
we'll be very clear that the West

3405
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,400
is going to be brought down.

3406
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:34,640
I talked about this a long time ago.

3407
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:35,760
It's on the Ocelli stuff,

3408
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:36,720
if you've heard it, right?

3409
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,860
Are we referring to that?

3410
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,800
Yes, and you mentioned something

3411
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,660
about the Antichrist.

3412
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:44,940
Well, that's a different story.

3413
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,080
The Antichrist is not what people think he is.

3414
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:49,460
He's actually going to be very popular

3415
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:50,860
He's right now,

3416
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,840
he was born in September of 1998.

3417
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:54,540
So how old is he now?

3418
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,080
24.

3419
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,980
The main characteristic about him,

3420
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:59,780
genealogically, he's Assyrian.

3421
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,380
Not Syrian, Assyrian descent,

3422
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:03,740
but he always claims to be of Judean descent.

3423
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,620
He has a false identity.

3424
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,220
Where's this coming out?

3425
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:08,220
He's just living?

3426
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:09,100
It doesn't matter.

3427
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:10,420
You want to be like the movie, The Omen,

3428
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,380
where the priest is looking

3429
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:13,660
for the son of the devil, right?

3430
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:14,420
You remember that movie?

3431
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,120
Anyway, to hunt him down.

3432
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:16,740
It doesn't matter.

3433
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:17,720
He's, if you met him,

3434
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:18,900
he would be your best friend.

3435
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:19,600
You'd love him.

3436
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,560
And if you met the biblical Messiah,

3437
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,500
you would hate the guy.

3438
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:24,900
I could hardly wait till this guy leaves.

3439
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:26,860
Right?

3440
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,080
It's everything is backwards and inverted, right?

3441
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,480
What's going to be happening

3442
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,740
in the 2025, 2027 period

3443
02:14:33,740 --> 02:14:35,440
is a group of young people

3444
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:37,200
are going to start ruling older,

3445
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:37,920
younger and younger.

3446
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,900
And I said this in the chat 10 years ago.

3447
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:41,960
You're going to see younger and younger rulers.

3448
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,880
Look at like Marcon and Trudeau

3449
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,740
and all these, except for Biden.

3450
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:46,880
They're all very young.

3451
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:48,160
And Putin, most of them

3452
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,100
are very young people.

3453
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,860
They're going to get even be

3454
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:52,740
in their late twenties, early thirties rulers.

3455
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,540
I mean, the whole UN will be filled.

3456
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:57,440
Anyway, in the, after 2025,

3457
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,340
they're going to say,

3458
02:14:58,520 --> 02:14:59,940
you know, the world's been in shambles.

3459
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:01,420
The system doesn't work.

3460
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,480
We need a new system.

3461
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,160
I talked about this by the recent,

3462
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:06,580
years ago, decades ago.

3463
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,080
We need a new system,

3464
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:11,760
but in order we have to embrace

3465
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,220
some of these new laws,

3466
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,000
which are not new laws,

3467
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:14,980
they're very old laws.

3468
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:17,400
And I know in order

3469
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:18,240
to make things better,

3470
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,540
it's going to be a little drastic

3471
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:20,160
in the beginning,

3472
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:21,600
but everyone has to participate.

3473
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,060
Okay.

3474
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:23,220
And everyone will say, okay.

3475
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:24,240
And they're going to be doing

3476
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:25,800
some crazy drastic stuff.

3477
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
There's also going to be

3478
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,640
a time reset, a year zero.

3479
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,800
This is another conversation, right?

3480
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:32,620
What is the source of this?

3481
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:33,700
If I may ask?

3482
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,800
Biblical, biblical, Hopi, Sumerian,

3483
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,340
the Rig Vidas.

3484
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:41,640
They're all talking about the same thing.

3485
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:43,400
Similar, but the biblical

3486
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:44,680
has the most information.

3487
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:48,480
I don't promote anyone

3488
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,200
to read the Bible.

3489
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:49,720
You know why?

3490
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,620
Because after the word the,

3491
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:52,520
you're not going to understand

3492
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:53,220
anything in it.

3493
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:54,660
I assure you.

3494
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,680
Well, Trudeau and Macron

3495
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:57,320
and all these people,

3496
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,220
they all went to Klaus Schwab's

3497
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:00,460
Young Global Leader School.

3498
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:02,140
Yes. Well, that's going to go away.

3499
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:03,040
That's temporary.

3500
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:05,660
That's what, remember,

3501
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,060
if you know about it,

3502
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:08,640
it's a front.

3503
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:12,200
Is it true or to your knowledge,

3504
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:13,780
this whole Queen Beatrix

3505
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:14,360
of the Netherlands

3506
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,800
that's the person who props up,

3507
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:17,980
this Klaus Schwab guy?

3508
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:19,260
That doesn't matter.

3509
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,660
That's like talking about,

3510
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:21,980
I don't know, McDonald's new,

3511
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:23,080
I don't mean to,

3512
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:25,200
you know, McDonald's

3513
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,680
bringing back the McRib, you know?

3514
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:27,740
Yeah, I'm not offended.

3515
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:29,220
Look, I know half the shit I say,

3516
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:30,180
if not more, just.

3517
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:32,059
That's really, that's for the pot.

3518
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,680
That's surface,

3519
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:34,780
that's surface level stuff.

3520
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:36,420
You have surface level stuff,

3521
02:16:36,980 --> 02:16:38,680
which is physically on the surface

3522
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,100
and then mentally on the surface

3523
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:42,100
that you can, other people can relate to.

3524
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:44,480
Yeah, here's the thing.

3525
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:45,879
We're having this interview

3526
02:16:45,879 --> 02:16:47,200
and I've done other interviews

3527
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:48,780
and did the thing with Ocelli.

3528
02:16:49,219 --> 02:16:50,660
I'm not a public speaker.

3529
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:52,000
I'm not a public person.

3530
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,600
I do what I do with materials

3531
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:55,559
and to help people

3532
02:16:55,559 --> 02:16:57,120
and certain types of sciences

3533
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:59,139
and things that are not known

3534
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,360
on the surface, by the way.

3535
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:03,780
I'm not one to be speaking

3536
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:05,100
about alternative matters

3537
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:06,400
and tell people what's going on.

3538
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:07,860
What I would rather do

3539
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:10,420
is have someone point to someone

3540
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,559
in the alternative media

3541
02:17:11,559 --> 02:17:12,740
or even mainstream or academic

3542
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,100
and tell other people

3543
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,580
when they ask me, go listen to them.

3544
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:16,200
They've got it.

3545
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:16,920
But you know what?

3546
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,740
No one had, I assure you,

3547
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,040
nothing that we spoke here

3548
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,459
or heard is being mentioned

3549
02:17:22,459 --> 02:17:24,260
by anyone else anywhere, anywhere,

3550
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:25,299
other than references.

3551
02:17:25,959 --> 02:17:26,840
It's pathetic.

3552
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:28,620
Bits and pieces.

3553
02:17:29,719 --> 02:17:31,080
Yes, a little bits and pieces.

3554
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,700
Someone needs to go back

3555
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:35,600
and make like a best of compilation

3556
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:36,520
of all the Ocelli

3557
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,600
because I think it's something

3558
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:39,020
like 30, 40 hours.

3559
02:17:39,639 --> 02:17:41,440
Yeah, I know it's too much.

3560
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:43,000
Someone needs to go back.

3561
02:17:43,059 --> 02:17:45,180
I have three banker boxes of notes

3562
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:46,360
and the problem with it is

3563
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:48,340
one page will have like a,

3564
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:50,059
let's say something biblical

3565
02:17:50,059 --> 02:17:50,799
on the other side.

3566
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,040
It'll talk about how to do

3567
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:54,260
gold transmutation in your kitchen.

3568
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:55,340
And the next one

3569
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:56,740
is completely different subjects.

3570
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,360
So it's very hard to go through my notes

3571
02:17:58,360 --> 02:17:59,320
for someone else too.

3572
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:00,900
I had someone doing it

3573
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:02,440
and they were Xerox copying all my notes

3574
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:03,660
and then the copies became

3575
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,639
single-sided pages

3576
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:06,680
that went categorical much easier, right?

3577
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:07,879
Right.

3578
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,540
Because I tend to think parallel.

3579
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:12,219
Uh, there was a film documentary

3580
02:18:12,219 --> 02:18:13,000
on Napoleon.

3581
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:15,379
It was in French a long time ago

3582
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:18,000
and someone sent me a clip of that

3583
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:18,719
said this is you

3584
02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:19,799
and it was Napoleon.

3585
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:22,020
He had, he was dictating four letters

3586
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:24,100
to four secretaries at the same time.

3587
02:18:25,139 --> 02:18:27,180
One was to a general that left him.

3588
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:28,040
He wanted him back.

3589
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,740
The other one was two generals in the field

3590
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:31,080
and one of them was to his sweetheart.

3591
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:32,760
And he looks at one person.

3592
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,440
He gives a sentence.

3593
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:34,820
He's dictating four letters

3594
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:36,520
to four secretaries at the same time.

3595
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,280
Very confusing

3596
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:40,219
to most people, right?

3597
02:18:41,299 --> 02:18:42,059
On that note,

3598
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:44,680
I heard that in the near future

3599
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:47,040
humans will be able to do stuff

3600
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,660
such as write sentences

3601
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:50,320
at the same time upside down.

3602
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:52,240
There's a skill that we'll acquire.

3603
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:53,299
Yes.

3604
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:55,320
I was speaking with Zan personally

3605
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:56,980
and I said if you're driving down the road,

3606
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:58,639
let's say at a good speed

3607
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:00,240
and you see a big billboard on the right

3608
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:01,360
that has a company name,

3609
02:19:01,799 --> 02:19:02,580
what they're offering,

3610
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,740
a phone number and address.

3611
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:05,400
Can you look at that for half a second

3612
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,920
and then look the other way

3613
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:07,959
and read that billboard?

3614
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:10,379
In other words, photographic memory,

3615
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:11,040
can you do that?

3616
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:12,540
See, most people have that ability,

3617
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:13,480
photographic memory,

3618
02:19:13,559 --> 02:19:15,700
just that they're out of film, right?

3619
02:19:16,059 --> 02:19:16,980
So how do you do that?

3620
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,959
I teach that to young children all the time.

3621
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:20,660
We're driving down the road pretty fast

3622
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:22,160
and you see that real estate sign coming up.

3623
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:23,200
Yeah, I can't read it.

3624
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,280
We'll just pass it.

3625
02:19:24,299 --> 02:19:24,860
Did you get it?

3626
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,700
And the one person will get it.

3627
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:27,240
Yeah, I got it.

3628
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:28,299
It's Rob Lamb.

3629
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,540
The number is this, this, this,

3630
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:30,620
this, this, this, this, that.

3631
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:31,260
Is it very good?

3632
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:32,600
In the beginning,

3633
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:34,139
you only get like the first word.

3634
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:35,340
In other words,

3635
02:19:35,379 --> 02:19:36,639
imagine I show a flash card

3636
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:37,680
with 10 words on it

3637
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:38,820
for half a second.

3638
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:39,420
I put it down.

3639
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:40,400
You're going to get something.

3640
02:19:40,799 --> 02:19:41,200
In the beginning,

3641
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,320
you're just going to get the color,

3642
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:44,200
then maybe a letter or two,

3643
02:19:44,299 --> 02:19:45,320
maybe a word, right?

3644
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:47,459
But if we keep practicing like martial arts,

3645
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:49,500
you'll be able to see the whole thing.

3646
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:52,520
And then what we could do eventually

3647
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:53,940
after a few years of this,

3648
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:54,620
I could have two.

3649
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:56,720
Okay.

3650
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,380
So we're at a thought.

3651
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,140
I was saying about

3652
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:00,900
everyone has a photographic memory.

3653
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:02,600
It's just most people are out of film, right?

3654
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:03,280
Yes.

3655
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:04,520
Okay, let's,

3656
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,020
I want to go back to one more thing

3657
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:07,200
because what's very important

3658
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,640
is the understanding how biology works,

3659
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,200
especially the human body,

3660
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,600
because I found out that most people

3661
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:14,520
spend most of their time in their body, right?

3662
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:16,500
And I mean that seriously.

3663
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:20,160
The ability to transmute,

3664
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:22,140
also the ability to understand water

3665
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:25,280
can be also proven outside of the body

3666
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,740
by certain understanding intelligences

3667
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:29,500
of creatures around us

3668
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:30,920
all the way down to the microbe.

3669
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:32,420
Give you an example.

3670
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:34,600
I used to go on calls and tell people

3671
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:36,180
how to grow gold in their kitchen.

3672
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,740
G-O-L-D-A-U.

3673
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,300
You know the substance gold?

3674
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:40,220
Yes.

3675
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:40,520
Okay.

3676
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:41,900
It's a biological gold,

3677
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,500
but it goes to the next level.

3678
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:46,820
Like when gold is formed on the earth,

3679
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:48,640
if anyone goes gold mining,

3680
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:51,180
other than when it's in the hard rock,

3681
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:53,340
you could see it's a crystalline structure,

3682
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:54,260
almost looks organic,

3683
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:56,040
like upside down melted wax,

3684
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:58,100
let's say with tendrils and fingers.

3685
02:20:58,260 --> 02:20:59,620
It grows off of the quartz

3686
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:01,680
in the presence of copper and silver.

3687
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:03,660
That's one way in the earth.

3688
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,800
That's how the earth does it.

3689
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,720
The way it's done biologically is very simple

3690
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:08,300
that you can,

3691
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:10,240
I'm going to give this procedure

3692
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,900
and you will succeed every time.

3693
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:13,780
This doesn't make any sense

3694
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:15,260
to give only what you can do

3695
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:17,000
because that's your personal talent.

3696
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:17,420
You don't,

3697
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:18,980
you always want to share things

3698
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,480
that anybody can technically access, right?

3699
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:22,980
Like giving you a,

3700
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:24,780
if I give you a recipe

3701
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:26,420
for a certain cookie that I have,

3702
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:28,260
it won't be exactly like mine

3703
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:29,700
because no two loaves of bread

3704
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:30,700
are baked alike anyway,

3705
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:31,620
even in a factory,

3706
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:33,300
but it'll be very, very similar.

3707
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:33,720
Okay.

3708
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,400
The same with this gold recipe.

3709
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,100
So what we do is we go

3710
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:40,180
and we acquire some baker's yeast

3711
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:41,860
that they use to make bread.

3712
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:43,540
And that species of yeast

3713
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:44,760
is a very common yeast.

3714
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:45,220
It's called,

3715
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,020
it's a Saccharice cervaceae

3716
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:47,780
is the species.

3717
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,820
It's in a powdered form.

3718
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:51,640
So what you do is you want to create

3719
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:54,020
a liquid colony of the yeast.

3720
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:55,200
So you put it in some water,

3721
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:56,660
warm water with some sugar,

3722
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,000
maybe to feed the colony.

3723
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:59,780
And after a few hours,

3724
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:00,920
it starts to foam up.

3725
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,180
You can imagine brewer's yeast

3726
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:03,700
works well,

3727
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,980
but not as well as the Saccharice

3728
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:05,620
cervaceae,

3729
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:06,700
which is the baker's yeast.

3730
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:09,220
So, so far you've invested

3731
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,300
50 cents or a dollar.

3732
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:11,700
Okay.

3733
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:13,240
And the water and the sugar.

3734
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,520
So once the colony is formed,

3735
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,220
well, we know that silver

3736
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:20,320
is a fungicide and bactericide.

3737
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:21,280
Okay.

3738
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:22,060
The metal silver.

3739
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:23,380
It doesn't have to be pure silver.

3740
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,520
And I could also talk about

3741
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,180
how to make aqueous argentum

3742
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:27,580
after this.

3743
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:28,080
Remind me,

3744
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:29,400
because the colloidal silver

3745
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,000
they sell on the internet is a joke.

3746
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:32,320
You don't want a chemical one.

3747
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:33,500
You want an ethereal one.

3748
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:35,220
Okay.

3749
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:37,240
So we have the yeast in the jar.

3750
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,020
You want to keep it warm.

3751
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:40,100
You want to keep it at about

3752
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:41,540
108 degrees Fahrenheit.

3753
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:43,580
Because that's a high fever.

3754
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:44,500
If a human,

3755
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:45,380
the most,

3756
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,100
the highest fever a human can stand

3757
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:47,960
is about 108.

3758
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:49,540
If you have more than that

3759
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:50,480
for a long time,

3760
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,460
you get rheumatic fever,

3761
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:51,920
you die.

3762
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:53,240
So 108,

3763
02:22:53,560 --> 02:22:54,640
the top high fever

3764
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:56,700
is a good temperature for this.

3765
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:58,080
So you take a piece of silver,

3766
02:22:58,180 --> 02:23:00,340
a coin or anything,

3767
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:03,020
and you hang it inside the jar,

3768
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,100
the vessel somehow

3769
02:23:04,100 --> 02:23:05,060
with a piece of string

3770
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:06,340
so it's completely submerged

3771
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:07,640
in the liquid with the yeast.

3772
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,160
Now we know the silver is a fungicide

3773
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:10,980
to the yeast.

3774
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:13,120
The yeast colony then

3775
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:14,240
has an intelligence

3776
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:16,140
and it sees that silver metal

3777
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:17,000
has been introduced

3778
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,860
to the yeast colony in the liquid.

3779
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:21,300
And it says,

3780
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:23,300
wow, this is going to kill us all.

3781
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:25,440
So we need a group of volunteers,

3782
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:26,900
maybe a third of the yeast

3783
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:29,220
to go and bond themselves

3784
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:30,600
on a suicide mission

3785
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:32,040
to the silver.

3786
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:34,240
And when they bond their bodies

3787
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:35,080
to the silver

3788
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:37,080
inside of their nucleus,

3789
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,960
they will start to produce gold

3790
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,160
and plate the silver with gold

3791
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:43,000
because the gold is inert to us.

3792
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:45,600
I'm going to stop right there.

3793
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:48,520
Is that the...

3794
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,360
That's how you make gold in your kitchen.

3795
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,380
Have you done it?

3796
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:53,100
Yes.

3797
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,140
I have another computer

3798
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:57,400
that has over 500 photographs.

3799
02:23:57,740 --> 02:23:58,940
We've had it analyzed

3800
02:23:58,940 --> 02:24:01,960
and there was a guy that says,

3801
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:03,400
my daughter, she's in the eighth grade,

3802
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:04,680
want to do a science project.

3803
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:06,180
So we did that

3804
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,480
and she did it in the science project.

3805
02:24:07,580 --> 02:24:08,480
She even went and had

3806
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:10,120
the materials analysis at its goal.

3807
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:11,060
She gave the whole procedure.

3808
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,000
They failed her

3809
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:14,220
because the whole school, of course,

3810
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:15,640
does that you cannot do something

3811
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,160
that is not in our physics books.

3812
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:20,940
And they decided to keep the failing grade

3813
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,100
for the whole year.

3814
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:23,620
She had to make it up.

3815
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:24,580
But at the last minute,

3816
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:26,220
they didn't put it on the report card.

3817
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:27,480
They gave her the regular grade.

3818
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:28,760
In other words, to shame her.

3819
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:30,300
But they didn't punish her, ultimately.

3820
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:33,120
This is the society you live in.

3821
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:34,700
Yeah, it's a grand shame.

3822
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,840
Yeah, anyone can do this.

3823
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:38,400
And hopefully, the thing is,

3824
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:40,120
when you tell people how to do things

3825
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,300
or how things can be done,

3826
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:42,420
only one out of 100,

3827
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,500
1% will actually do something, right?

3828
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,020
100% of that 1% came back

3829
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:49,040
and said, Greek, it works.

3830
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,480
I've had people visit me here.

3831
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:53,400
They've traveled from all over the world

3832
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:54,780
and they get on a Skype group

3833
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,640
and they said, the Greek,

3834
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:56,680
everything he says is true.

3835
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:57,300
I've seen him do it.

3836
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:58,460
Now, the only people on the Skype group,

3837
02:24:58,460 --> 02:24:58,940
yeah, we know.

3838
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:00,260
We didn't have to go there to see it.

3839
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,680
You see the difference?

3840
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:05,320
And some people have to see it.

3841
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,520
Is this the first time you've shared?

3842
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:09,440
No, I've been sharing this

3843
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:11,000
for 15 years, publicly.

3844
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:13,100
We're only 1% of the people.

3845
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,060
How do you know all this stuff?

3846
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:14,920
Who is your teacher?

3847
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:16,180
Several.

3848
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:17,240
Most of them are dead.

3849
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:19,520
Why were you chosen

3850
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:20,560
if you don't want me asking?

3851
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:22,680
I can't disclose that publicly.

3852
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:24,720
Because it's not time yet.

3853
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,000
Like, give you an example.

3854
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,660
When the Ocelli stuff that was done

3855
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,400
between 2015 and 2017?

3856
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:30,300
Yes.

3857
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:31,620
Okay.

3858
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:34,320
I was told around 2010

3859
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:36,760
to wait until that time.

3860
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,000
Now I'm being told I have to wait

3861
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,240
till before 2025 for the next round.

3862
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:42,940
There was a couple of people

3863
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:44,740
that approached me around 2010, 2011

3864
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:47,740
to do what I did in 2015, 2017.

3865
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:48,900
I said, no, it's not time yet.

3866
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:49,960
I'm not even going to mention them.

3867
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,020
I think I mentioned one of them.

3868
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:51,860
I don't want them mentioned.

3869
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:53,080
They're very popular.

3870
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:54,340
Everyone, if I mentioned their name,

3871
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:55,160
everybody knows them.

3872
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:57,120
Million followers.

3873
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:58,380
And there are some people...

3874
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:00,260
Anyway, you have to...

3875
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:01,560
Okay, you have to give things

3876
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,520
at the right time.

3877
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:02,860
Okay.

3878
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,920
Give you the analogy on this.

3879
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:07,360
And then remind me about the silver

3880
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,580
because this really helps.

3881
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:09,500
How to make...

3882
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:10,520
It will destroy anything

3883
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:11,800
that the body creates.

3884
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,880
By the way, there's no such thing

3885
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:13,640
as a contagion.

3886
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:14,160
You induce...

3887
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,860
Even if you look at health documents,

3888
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:18,940
the disease, it's contracted

3889
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:20,260
because you have a contract

3890
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:21,640
with the medical corporation.

3891
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:22,080
Get it?

3892
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:24,040
That's what the AIDS is, by the way.

3893
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:26,360
If you have, like they said,

3894
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:28,000
something spread out of a lab or whatever,

3895
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:28,620
it's impossible.

3896
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:29,160
If you...

3897
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:31,060
It doesn't matter if you had 10,000 vials

3898
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:31,520
of whatever.

3899
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:33,460
You could spread it on the people.

3900
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:34,580
A few people will get sick.

3901
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:35,720
It will never spread, whatever.

3902
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,800
It's the same thing as vomiting

3903
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:37,640
or shitting on them.

3904
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,160
That's not how it works.

3905
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:41,760
You have to have an induction thing.

3906
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:43,300
And I'm not going to get

3907
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:44,100
into that publicly.

3908
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:46,400
I will in the future, let's say.

3909
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:48,200
And no one wants to know

3910
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,260
how to create a plague.

3911
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:51,440
Call, email me either, please.

3912
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:52,980
But I can discuss it.

3913
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:55,880
The silver is the same way.

3914
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:56,680
There's a tonic.

3915
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,980
You can make several tonics

3916
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:59,580
that will just...

3917
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:01,960
There's no measurable material in there,

3918
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:03,660
but it has the effect

3919
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:05,180
kind of like homeopathic medicine

3920
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:06,080
if it's done right.

3921
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:07,600
By the way, the homeopathics

3922
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:08,320
that are put out there,

3923
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:09,120
none of them work.

3924
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,240
It doesn't mean homeopathic...

3925
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:12,760
I'm going to say it this way.

3926
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:14,960
If you put out homeopathic medicines,

3927
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:18,100
they do work, but 1%, 5% max.

3928
02:27:18,380 --> 02:27:20,780
If you put out a real homeopathic tonic,

3929
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,700
you would be dead in three days.

3930
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:23,520
If they found out,

3931
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:25,060
the establishment found out,

3932
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:26,600
you'd be in very big trouble.

3933
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:27,580
It would be like,

3934
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:28,780
there's plenty of people

3935
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:30,120
that run their cars on water,

3936
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:31,160
but they don't tell anyone.

3937
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:32,440
But if you went out

3938
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:33,820
and started telling one how to do it,

3939
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:35,360
not with hydrogen electrolysis

3940
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:37,040
and other things like that,

3941
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:38,720
you would be very big trouble

3942
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,920
very quickly or free energy machine, right?

3943
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:42,460
It's very big.

3944
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:43,160
Free energy machines

3945
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:44,600
are very easy to do, by the way.

3946
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:46,140
Not very easy.

3947
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:46,680
They're simple.

3948
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:47,920
They're actually not easy

3949
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:50,540
because it's much more reliable

3950
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:51,400
to be on the grid

3951
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:53,120
because certain devices

3952
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:57,020
rely on certain aspects of cosmology

3953
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:57,940
and they stop working

3954
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:00,540
at three in the morning, right?

3955
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:02,400
And then you might be able

3956
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:03,180
to start them again

3957
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:04,100
by 10 in the morning,

3958
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,700
but sometimes you have to wait a month.

3959
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:08,660
That's why I,

3960
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:09,620
Xan, you and I said,

3961
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:10,700
everything on the internet's bullshit.

3962
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:11,760
Not everything,

3963
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:13,420
but if to find the stuff

3964
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,560
that is not BS,

3965
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,040
you really,

3966
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:17,400
you know how you find a needle

3967
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:20,060
in a haystack with a magnet

3968
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:22,020
really fast, right?

3969
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:23,760
You don't have to keep

3970
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,420
moving everything, right?

3971
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,180
What would be our magnet?

3972
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:29,080
Not an analogous form.

3973
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,880
Well, when someone shows you

3974
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:33,140
an asshole made of paper,

3975
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:34,680
you show up with a blowtorch.

3976
02:28:34,740 --> 02:28:35,300
What happens?

3977
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,220
Shows you an asshole.

3978
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,080
The asshole disappear.

3979
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:40,320
Anyway, when you put paper

3980
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,120
and fire together,

3981
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:43,680
they burn really quickly, right?

3982
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,780
But if you wrap up a piece of metal

3983
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:46,860
or gold in paper

3984
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:48,260
and you don't know what's in it,

3985
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:49,200
you just put the fire

3986
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,040
and the metal shows right away, right?

3987
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:52,360
In other words,

3988
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:53,580
it's a brutal process.

3989
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:55,400
To find out what's true

3990
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:55,880
on the internet,

3991
02:28:56,020 --> 02:28:56,920
you have to be brutal,

3992
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:58,360
intellectually brutal.

3993
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:00,580
Does that make sense?

3994
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:01,820
Yes.

3995
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:03,420
You also have to know the codes.

3996
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:05,580
They put out codes all the time

3997
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:06,320
on what's BS.

3998
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:09,080
The people doing it don't know,

3999
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:11,380
but they don't know any better,

4000
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,020
right?

4001
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:13,240
Right.

4002
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:14,080
You go to,

4003
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:15,440
let's say you go to a society,

4004
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,600
we're going to talk about the silver

4005
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,340
and a few other things.

4006
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,840
We go to a society of headhunters.

4007
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:22,320
And they have,

4008
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:23,240
their shrunken head

4009
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:24,440
is the most valuable possession.

4010
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:25,640
The way you make a shrunken head

4011
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:27,220
is when the person is killed,

4012
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:29,320
you remove this facial skin very carefully

4013
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:31,520
and the skin shrinks

4014
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,360
and without a skull,

4015
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:34,000
it's very small

4016
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
and it still has the likeness

4017
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,720
of the individual.

4018
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:36,980
It's a shrunken head.

4019
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:38,880
So these headhunters cannibals,

4020
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:41,180
they have prized these shrunken heads.

4021
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:42,680
So we go there with a translator,

4022
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:43,900
us three,

4023
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:45,080
and we grab a headhunter

4024
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:45,480
and we say,

4025
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:46,380
does it bother you

4026
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:48,620
that you have three shrunken heads in a bag?

4027
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:50,760
And he looks at you

4028
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:51,220
and he says,

4029
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:51,500
you know,

4030
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:52,780
nobody's ever asked me that question,

4031
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:53,180
but yes,

4032
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:54,200
it does bother me.

4033
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:55,160
You say,

4034
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,220
why does it bother you?

4035
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:57,560
Because my brother,

4036
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:59,940
he has 20 shrunken heads in the bag.

4037
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:01,680
Oh my goodness.

4038
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:03,340
If you brought that person

4039
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:04,600
in this society,

4040
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,420
he would be criminal,

4041
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:05,900
wouldn't he?

4042
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:08,900
But if we went over there,

4043
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,920
we would be criminal

4044
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,340
because we want to bury the dead.

4045
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:12,260
We don't want to eat them.

4046
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,180
So what are you doing?

4047
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,240
Throwing away good food.

4048
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:16,340
So which one is right?

4049
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:17,140
Which one is wrong?

4050
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:18,240
It's all subjective.

4051
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:20,380
Yes.

4052
02:30:20,380 --> 02:30:21,560
There is a high,

4053
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:22,260
the one who,

4054
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:24,300
the creators and the formers

4055
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:25,200
give you the law.

4056
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:26,800
For example,

4057
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:27,940
when you go buy a car

4058
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:29,080
and the manual says

4059
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,900
use 89 octane only

4060
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:33,580
or use 10w30 only.

4061
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:34,780
Oh, it doesn't matter.

4062
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,360
They made the car.

4063
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:37,320
They engineered it.

4064
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:37,900
I don't care.

4065
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:39,440
I'm going to put whatever I want in it.

4066
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:40,100
You could live,

4067
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:41,100
you can do that too,

4068
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,120
but there will be consequences, right?

4069
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:44,900
Like when Mitsubishi

4070
02:30:45,450 --> 02:30:46,600
in the early 90s started,

4071
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,320
the first mass production company

4072
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,480
to put out synthetic only vehicles,

4073
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:51,680
oil only,

4074
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:53,560
people were taken to Jiffy Lube,

4075
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:54,560
the cheap oil places

4076
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:55,300
and putting crappy oil

4077
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:56,520
and they're all burning oil

4078
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:57,540
and blowing smoke.

4079
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,640
And so these cars are no good.

4080
02:30:58,760 --> 02:30:59,280
After two years,

4081
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:00,440
there's black smoke that comes out.

4082
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:02,060
It's because no one read the manual.

4083
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:03,740
You see?

4084
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:04,860
Yes.

4085
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:06,960
So what you want to do,

4086
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:08,320
let's give you an example.

4087
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:10,120
Let's say we want to rent an apartment

4088
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:11,860
and it's 20 of us as roommates.

4089
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:12,780
It's a big apartment.

4090
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:13,940
Okay.

4091
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,240
And we're going to go meet the landlord

4092
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:17,360
to sign the lease.

4093
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:19,380
But not all of us are going to go.

4094
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:21,200
We're going to send Daniel.

4095
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:22,860
He's the smartest here.

4096
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:24,740
So he's going to go sign the lease.

4097
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:26,640
So the lease is really this long agreement

4098
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:28,000
and he comes back

4099
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,860
and he doesn't tell us like 90,

4100
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:30,980
he leaves out 90%

4101
02:31:30,980 --> 02:31:32,080
of what's in the lease agreement.

4102
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:33,880
And we start living there

4103
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:34,600
and doing these things

4104
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:35,240
that the lease says

4105
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:36,020
we shouldn't be doing,

4106
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:36,600
but we don't know

4107
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:37,560
we shouldn't be doing them.

4108
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,020
And we find that the landlord's coming in

4109
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:41,000
and saying, what the hell are you doing?

4110
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:41,560
You got to leave.

4111
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:42,120
And we're like, why?

4112
02:31:42,900 --> 02:31:43,480
What's wrong with you?

4113
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:44,120
Well, it's in the lease.

4114
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:44,660
I don't know.

4115
02:31:45,140 --> 02:31:46,480
See, Daniel didn't tell us that.

4116
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:48,000
That's what the priesthoods

4117
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:48,960
didn't do to the people.

4118
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,640
You see, when they communicate

4119
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:52,660
with these higher beings,

4120
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,580
they didn't tell the people

4121
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,460
what the rules were.

4122
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:56,440
And then it got so bad

4123
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:58,360
that they have to be evicted.

4124
02:31:59,040 --> 02:31:59,640
That's another.

4125
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:01,500
This is like the mothership show up

4126
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:02,920
and everybody makes peace analogy.

4127
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,700
This is like the headhunter analogy.

4128
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,620
You see?

4129
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:11,340
Although there is such thing as karma

4130
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:12,940
and there isn't.

4131
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:13,820
I disagree.

4132
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:14,940
I'm going to stop you there.

4133
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:16,400
There is no karma.

4134
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:18,400
Karma is a terrible thing.

4135
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:19,280
It's dharma.

4136
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:21,340
Well, that is a low level

4137
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:23,260
spiritual application.

4138
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:24,340
There is none.

4139
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:27,680
No, I disagree with that personally.

4140
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,080
And actually, if you go back

4141
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:30,500
and look where that comes from,

4142
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:32,460
it is not the way that

4143
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:33,720
it's popularly accepted.

4144
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:36,240
Well, karma would signify balance, right?

4145
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,620
And I mean, bad things

4146
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:38,700
that happen to good people

4147
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:40,420
and good things that happen to bad people.

4148
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:41,360
I mean, like, look who's

4149
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:42,500
controlling us right now.

4150
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:44,460
There's a cosmic momentum.

4151
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,480
There's a cosmic momentum.

4152
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:47,600
If you're a bad person,

4153
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,600
I know this is very harsh.

4154
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:49,560
I'm going to say it anyway.

4155
02:32:50,020 --> 02:32:50,560
Say it, damn.

4156
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:51,920
If you're a really bad person

4157
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:52,660
doing bad things,

4158
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:53,520
you better just do that

4159
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:54,540
to the end of your life.

4160
02:32:54,860 --> 02:32:56,440
You could repent right before you die.

4161
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:57,460
But the moment you stop

4162
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,400
doing those in the middle,

4163
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:00,680
all those things you did before

4164
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:02,080
are going to fall down on your head

4165
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:02,980
and you're going to end

4166
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:03,820
your life right there.

4167
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:06,300
There's no karma.

4168
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:08,520
What's the karma for a piranha

4169
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,080
that goes and eats all the creatures

4170
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:12,540
and viciously or whatever?

4171
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:13,680
Yeah, I always thought that

4172
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,500
people would always say

4173
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:15,240
there's karma.

4174
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:16,460
And Daniel, I'm not saying this

4175
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:17,440
to gaslight you at all.

4176
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,420
I just felt this way.

4177
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:20,320
And also, when people want to say,

4178
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:21,060
I hate you,

4179
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:22,460
everything happens for a reason.

4180
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:23,900
No, it fucking doesn't.

4181
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:24,500
Or like...

4182
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:26,140
No, the reason is the same reason

4183
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:27,880
it happens that everyone on the boat

4184
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:29,500
is going from London to New York.

4185
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:31,300
You cannot change that.

4186
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:32,640
But everyone in the boat,

4187
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:34,120
you're free to do what you want there.

4188
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,180
But it depends on who

4189
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:36,260
you have allegiance to.

4190
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:36,900
That's another.

4191
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:39,460
This is more on a spiritual side.

4192
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:41,500
The spiritual, the mind,

4193
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:42,600
the way the mind works,

4194
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,260
there's many levels to it.

4195
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:45,940
There's a low-level mind,

4196
02:33:46,060 --> 02:33:46,980
there's a mid-level mind,

4197
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,180
and there's a high-level mind.

4198
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:49,880
The high-level mind

4199
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:52,120
can tolerate the mid-level mind,

4200
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:53,980
but cannot tolerate

4201
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:55,220
the low-level mind at all.

4202
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:56,840
The low-level mind

4203
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:58,660
can tolerate the mid-level mind,

4204
02:33:58,760 --> 02:34:00,380
but cannot tolerate the high level.

4205
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:01,280
If you put a person

4206
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,080
who is very spiritual or whatever

4207
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,560
and is very knowledgeable

4208
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:07,100
in the middle of the Super Bowl,

4209
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:08,600
everyone there would want to kill them.

4210
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,140
You know, the audience.

4211
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,360
Because the low-level mind...

4212
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:14,120
Yes, I'm saying that

4213
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:15,580
people that go to football games

4214
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:16,340
are a low-level mind.

4215
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:17,520
Yeah, there's very few exceptions.

4216
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:19,120
Never been into football, yeah.

4217
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:19,900
Yeah, okay.

4218
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:21,100
So the low-level mind

4219
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:22,500
despises the high level

4220
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,000
and the high despises the low.

4221
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:24,760
The mid-level

4222
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:27,160
is resistance on both sides

4223
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:27,860
and the middle

4224
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:29,680
stays in the middle as a buffer.

4225
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:32,860
If you read where karma and dharma come from

4226
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:34,440
in the original notions,

4227
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:37,380
it's basically this.

4228
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:38,760
If you grew up in a family

4229
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,220
where you're a shoemaker,

4230
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:43,240
you have to be a shoemaker.

4231
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,080
If you go outside of that

4232
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:46,120
and become a farmer,

4233
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:47,880
you have bad karma now.

4234
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:50,480
This is in the original text.

4235
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:53,900
This is like what the word nice means, right?

4236
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:55,400
This is like the things

4237
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:56,580
we discussed in the human body.

4238
02:34:56,660 --> 02:34:58,080
You can do whatever you want.

4239
02:34:58,180 --> 02:34:59,100
You could say that,

4240
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:00,100
whatever, whatever.

4241
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:02,100
Yeah, people do that all the time.

4242
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,440
You're free, but it has nothing to do

4243
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:05,460
with the origin and the fundamental,

4244
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:07,380
you know, what's been preserved about it.

4245
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:10,180
There are bad beings that do bad

4246
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:11,520
and they should keep doing bad

4247
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:13,640
as long as they exist.

4248
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:15,940
Not because it's good for them to do bad,

4249
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:18,140
but it's good for them to be that way

4250
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:20,020
because that's how they're supposed to be, you see.

4251
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:23,220
But why is it bad for them

4252
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:24,220
to stop being bad?

4253
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:26,760
Because the repercussions

4254
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:27,960
are going to be even worse.

4255
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:30,020
From whom?

4256
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,520
Depending on the environment, again.

4257
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:34,080
Like, for example, on the earth,

4258
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:36,540
if you murder, if you spill blood

4259
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:37,800
because you're on the earth,

4260
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:39,120
your blood has to be spilled.

4261
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,060
Otherwise, the earth stacks up

4262
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:43,900
a negative retaliation towards you later.

4263
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,020
Now, if you're on the moon,

4264
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,080
it's probably different.

4265
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:49,560
But on the earth, it's that way.

4266
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,560
Just like if you're in a submarine,

4267
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:53,880
not only are the weapons locked,

4268
02:35:54,020 --> 02:35:54,760
but they're empty

4269
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:57,300
and the ammunition is locked away

4270
02:35:57,300 --> 02:35:58,860
because you don't want to start

4271
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:01,300
shooting machine gun

4272
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:02,740
in the side of a submarine, right?

4273
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:04,760
It's very, very bad, right?

4274
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:06,280
But it's different.

4275
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:07,440
If you live on the farm,

4276
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:09,060
you can have your gun loaded

4277
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:10,240
everywhere you want, anywhere.

4278
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,260
It's okay if it goes off, right?

4279
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:12,780
It's all right.

4280
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:13,560
You're on a farm.

4281
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:15,260
So the good and the bad

4282
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:16,480
depends on who you are,

4283
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:19,440
when you are, and where you are.

4284
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:21,520
Like, let me just go back

4285
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:22,980
to the biblical stuff real quick.

4286
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:25,220
People think there's a different god

4287
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:25,980
from the New Testament

4288
02:36:25,980 --> 02:36:26,780
to the Old Testament.

4289
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:27,540
That's a moron.

4290
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:29,220
It's an idiot that just follows

4291
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:30,740
whatever religion they put on

4292
02:36:30,740 --> 02:36:31,980
whatever out for you.

4293
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:34,160
A lot of people use that

4294
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:35,640
the Old Testament god was evil

4295
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:36,580
because they went and killed

4296
02:36:36,580 --> 02:36:37,380
all the Canaanites.

4297
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:38,120
Oh, hell yeah.

4298
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:40,080
Hell yeah.

4299
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:42,480
Of course they would.

4300
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:43,760
You had to.

4301
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,700
Let's say the three of us

4302
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:47,300
went into an old Canaanite village

4303
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:48,080
when the Israelites,

4304
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:49,160
before they went in.

4305
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:52,380
We're walking in the village, right?

4306
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,320
And you see a shop.

4307
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:58,240
And those animals are tied down.

4308
02:36:58,460 --> 02:36:59,060
This is a regular,

4309
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:00,380
this is a rated G.

4310
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:01,200
Everyone goes,

4311
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:02,420
everybody can see this.

4312
02:37:02,940 --> 02:37:04,000
Why are these animals tied down?

4313
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:05,100
Oh, that's a sex club.

4314
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:06,880
In the middle of the day, yeah.

4315
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,100
They have donkeys tied down.

4316
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:08,820
Sheeps, chickens,

4317
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:09,800
any animal you want.

4318
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:10,720
You pay and you go ahead

4319
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:11,460
and do it with the animal.

4320
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:12,780
Okay, let's go further over.

4321
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:15,960
These little dirty children,

4322
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,100
they're not kept at all.

4323
02:37:17,140 --> 02:37:18,160
They're naked in cages.

4324
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,020
What are these for?

4325
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,560
Oh, these children here,

4326
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:22,300
they're for sale for the sacrifice

4327
02:37:22,300 --> 02:37:23,800
because if you don't want to sacrifice,

4328
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:24,940
you buy one.

4329
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:26,460
The poor people give them up

4330
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:27,040
all the time.

4331
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,460
Oh, what's that smoke

4332
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:30,660
at the end of the street

4333
02:37:30,660 --> 02:37:31,500
with the bells?

4334
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:33,200
Oh, that's molek.

4335
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,620
So the people that can afford the child,

4336
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,580
they put the molek

4337
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:38,240
as a statue.

4338
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:39,000
It's red hot.

4339
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:40,140
It's got a big belly.

4340
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:40,620
It's red.

4341
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:43,180
And the child sits in its lap

4342
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:44,260
and it burns alive.

4343
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:47,060
And you make a wish of prosperity

4344
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:48,420
like Santa Claus is red.

4345
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:48,980
And you ask Santa,

4346
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:49,820
what do you want for Christmas?

4347
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:50,920
Right?

4348
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:53,140
And remember,

4349
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:54,340
this is an open market.

4350
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:56,060
So the child being burned alive

4351
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:57,380
is a blood curdling scream.

4352
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,520
So they're ringing bells

4353
02:37:58,520 --> 02:37:59,580
to drown out the scream.

4354
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:00,400
Jingle bells.

4355
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:02,640
You see where I'm going with this?

4356
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,960
You see how sick the society is?

4357
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:08,340
Yeah, Santa Claus.

4358
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,060
You're talking about our Christmas tradition.

4359
02:38:10,220 --> 02:38:10,940
It's not mine.

4360
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:12,840
Hell, that's another code.

4361
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:13,820
That's code again.

4362
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,240
January 1st, Christmas.

4363
02:38:16,540 --> 02:38:17,600
All right, let's go back to it.

4364
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:19,480
Remember we said timekeeping

4365
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:20,400
should be astronomical.

4366
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:22,020
So in the biblical text,

4367
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:23,660
if you want to put something,

4368
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:25,360
you can't use a calendrical system

4369
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:25,800
because, you know,

4370
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,240
Stalin had a 20 day month

4371
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:28,440
and a 20 hour day.

4372
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:29,680
Actually, on eBay,

4373
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,400
you could still go buy watches

4374
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,320
with 20 hours and calendars

4375
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:34,000
for 20 days

4376
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,420
from the Stalin Soviet period.

4377
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,860
You could still get those.

4378
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:40,800
The Mayans also had a crazy calendar

4379
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:41,520
like that was not,

4380
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,460
none of that was lawful.

4381
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:42,920
But anyway,

4382
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:44,620
if you want to restore

4383
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:46,540
a calendrical date,

4384
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:47,120
you have to do it

4385
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,540
using astronomical bodies.

4386
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:50,360
So the biblical Christ,

4387
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:51,780
it gives a vision.

4388
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:52,560
It's in Revelation.

4389
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:54,400
It's the constellation Virgo.

4390
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:55,200
It's in the West.

4391
02:38:55,660 --> 02:38:57,460
The sun in the middle,

4392
02:38:57,580 --> 02:38:58,420
the moon at her feet.

4393
02:38:58,500 --> 02:38:59,600
We know it's a crescent moon

4394
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:00,540
the middle of the month

4395
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:02,780
and the draconian stars at her head.

4396
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,620
Well, if you have two objects,

4397
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,240
you can get the year and the month.

4398
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,520
Three objects,

4399
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:08,420
you can get the year,

4400
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:09,440
the month and the day.

4401
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:12,020
This case, you have seven or eight objects.

4402
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:13,180
If you count the stars

4403
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:13,840
in the constellation,

4404
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:15,440
you can get it down to the minute

4405
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,260
when the Christ was born.

4406
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:20,860
So we know that constellation happens

4407
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:22,940
roughly every 14 or 17 years.

4408
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:24,700
And we know according to history

4409
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:25,680
in the biblical texts,

4410
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:27,080
that was when Augustus Caesar

4411
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:29,980
did the census of the Roman Empire.

4412
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:31,640
And the current record show

4413
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:34,040
it was between 8 BC and 6 AD.

4414
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,420
So we have to look astronomically

4415
02:39:36,420 --> 02:39:38,240
that that astronomical alignment,

4416
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:40,100
the constellation Virgo in the West

4417
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:41,180
with the moon at her feet

4418
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:42,960
and the sun in the middle

4419
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:44,660
and the draconian stars at the head.

4420
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:46,160
Did it happen around that time?

4421
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:48,420
Ah, so we go to

4422
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:49,720
the astronomical observatory

4423
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:50,720
and he says, yes, it did.

4424
02:39:50,820 --> 02:39:51,460
So he shows you,

4425
02:39:51,560 --> 02:39:52,200
he does the alignment

4426
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:53,940
and he shows it happened 3 BC

4427
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:56,100
on the month of September

4428
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:58,240
on the day of 11 at 640 PM.

4429
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:01,540
Oh, September 11th.

4430
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:03,700
So that was a birthday party for,

4431
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:04,860
I get it.

4432
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:06,500
Why was it a birthday party

4433
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:07,720
for the biblical Messiah?

4434
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:09,060
Because when they ask him,

4435
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:11,560
are you coming to bring peace?

4436
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:12,300
What did he say?

4437
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:13,440
The Christ, biblical Christ,

4438
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:15,220
think not I come to bring peace.

4439
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:17,640
I come to bring the sword

4440
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:19,600
between father and son,

4441
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:21,280
daughter and mother-in-law,

4442
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:22,320
brother and brother.

4443
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:24,400
I am here to bring terror amongst you.

4444
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:27,460
That's the biblical Christ

4445
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:28,380
and the historical one,

4446
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:29,360
not the Christian one.

4447
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:31,820
Now the Illuminati or the elite

4448
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:33,020
that did not know this,

4449
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:35,060
that was a birthday gift,

4450
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:36,400
that birthday thing that they did.

4451
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,520
How many people are saying,

4452
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:39,120
how many people?

4453
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:39,940
Because they don't know

4454
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:40,560
how to keep time.

4455
02:40:40,660 --> 02:40:41,320
They don't know anything.

4456
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:42,840
Right?

4457
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:46,040
And it's too much sense, doesn't it?

4458
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:47,160
Yeah.

4459
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:49,860
This is just something I heard.

4460
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:52,260
But regarding the karma thing,

4461
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:54,360
what kind of soul is that

4462
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:56,300
going back to the SSP that

4463
02:40:56,300 --> 02:40:59,260
I heard there is such a thing as a court

4464
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:00,980
from the galactic authority

4465
02:41:00,980 --> 02:41:02,660
who is far above

4466
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,580
even the Draco.

4467
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:05,760
And they try people

4468
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,140
in the case of the solar system,

4469
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:08,280
it happens on Saturn.

4470
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,480
And even like Marduk,

4471
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:12,240
they have to answer.

4472
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:14,180
And the way they are judged

4473
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:16,360
is based on whether they went

4474
02:41:16,360 --> 02:41:17,740
against the consent of others.

4475
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:19,380
So that's how I saw karma

4476
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:21,240
as a go against consent.

4477
02:41:21,740 --> 02:41:23,120
But I don't know if you even believe

4478
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:24,240
they've been consented,

4479
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:25,980
judging from the fact that you said

4480
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:27,360
that we hardly have any free will.

4481
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:29,100
No, you do have free will

4482
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:30,400
depending on the setting.

4483
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,280
For example, you know that

4484
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:33,740
we have a lot of free will

4485
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:34,400
on the cruise ship.

4486
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:35,460
We could do anything we want.

4487
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:37,020
But everyone on the cruise ship

4488
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:38,360
is going from London to New York.

4489
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:40,540
You see, that free will you do not have.

4490
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:42,100
But the captain of the ship,

4491
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:43,460
he can turn the ship around, right?

4492
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:46,300
So he has a higher level of free will.

4493
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:47,540
It has to be free.

4494
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,500
For example, let's go back

4495
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:49,380
to the biblical text.

4496
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:50,320
There's no conversion.

4497
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:51,940
You know how the Christians go around

4498
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:52,920
and try to convert people?

4499
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:54,540
No, no, that's a big no, no.

4500
02:41:56,820 --> 02:41:58,660
The Elohim work on all free will.

4501
02:41:58,800 --> 02:41:59,760
The word free will

4502
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:01,680
and a volunteer and offering

4503
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:03,120
has to be free will offering.

4504
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:04,820
Well, you have to come to it freely

4505
02:42:04,820 --> 02:42:06,420
as hundreds of times

4506
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:07,320
in the biblical text.

4507
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:08,840
It's also hundreds of times

4508
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:09,620
in the Rig Vedas.

4509
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:11,920
And then you have to

4510
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:13,160
understand selflessness.

4511
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:14,400
Even the Buddha Zappa,

4512
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:15,380
when he attains,

4513
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:17,080
let's say perfection,

4514
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:19,140
he must, the Buddha Zappa

4515
02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:21,780
turns around to come back

4516
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:22,580
and help others

4517
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:23,520
instead of continuing

4518
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:25,140
being selfish on his own, right?

4519
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:26,760
So there's two,

4520
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,360
there's different types of free will.

4521
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:30,180
There's the free will

4522
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:31,040
if you're selfish,

4523
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:31,960
and there's the free will

4524
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:32,760
if you're selfless

4525
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:34,060
to help others, right?

4526
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:34,980
Right.

4527
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:35,300
You see?

4528
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:37,560
So there's many levels of that.

4529
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:38,840
Yes, there is a very,

4530
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:39,940
very high counsel,

4531
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:42,200
but they're also brutal,

4532
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,600
very brutal when it comes,

4533
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:45,360
in other words,

4534
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:46,500
when judgment is cast

4535
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:47,860
and it's time for sentencing,

4536
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:49,600
it's very brutal.

4537
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:51,000
Black and white.

4538
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:52,600
It's black and white

4539
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:54,180
and it could mean destruction,

4540
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,220
but it's usually

4541
02:42:55,220 --> 02:42:57,160
not complete destruction.

4542
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:59,380
Some, it's possible,

4543
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:01,240
but things seem to be recycled

4544
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:02,000
and brought back.

4545
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:02,300
Yes.

4546
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:04,620
This one person's account

4547
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:05,960
goes into detail

4548
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:07,800
about how this galactic authority

4549
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:09,420
is actually banishing

4550
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:10,620
a trillion Germans

4551
02:43:10,620 --> 02:43:12,160
that have used time travel

4552
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,280
to colonize a lot of planets

4553
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:15,900
in the Sagittarius arm of the galaxy.

4554
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:18,860
Okay, you can't travel in time.

4555
02:43:18,980 --> 02:43:20,100
You can travel to past

4556
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:21,520
and future events somewhat,

4557
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:22,800
because time is just

4558
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:23,860
the recordation of events.

4559
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:24,640
It's just what you have

4560
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,320
on your logbook, right?

4561
02:43:27,420 --> 02:43:28,960
So when you hear time travel,

4562
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,000
you have to think of going

4563
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,640
to past and previous events.

4564
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:34,700
There are several levels to that.

4565
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,220
Do you know how we discussed earlier,

4566
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:38,500
you know, when the bicycle wheel

4567
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:39,080
is not moving,

4568
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:40,000
you could put your hand

4569
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:40,640
through it anywhere,

4570
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:41,540
but once it's moving,

4571
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,400
it'll cut your fingers,

4572
02:43:42,480 --> 02:43:44,140
it'll seem solid, right?

4573
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:46,580
Okay, that's how time travel works.

4574
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:47,400
It's the same way.

4575
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,500
You're manipulating the thing

4576
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:51,320
that is stitching our reality together

4577
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:52,860
to show you what it has

4578
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:53,720
in its memory banks.

4579
02:43:53,780 --> 02:43:54,780
You know how you have a history

4580
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:55,560
on your computer,

4581
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:56,700
you could see all the websites

4582
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:57,440
you went to

4583
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:58,560
unless you clear it?

4584
02:43:59,400 --> 02:44:00,400
So when you're going

4585
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:01,180
through time travel,

4586
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:02,200
you're accessing that,

4587
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:03,440
but just physically.

4588
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:04,980
Do you know the Mandela effect?

4589
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:05,660
That's real,

4590
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,080
but it's happening on a bigger level

4591
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:09,200
than people are discussing.

4592
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:11,680
Most of the Mandela effect discussions

4593
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,020
are people coming to awareness

4594
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,440
of things that were always there.

4595
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:16,240
I've seen, I said,

4596
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:16,980
no, I remember that.

4597
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:18,780
That's if you were just not aware of it,

4598
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:19,540
because our awareness

4599
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:20,800
is being heightened right now.

4600
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:22,980
Our awareness is being heightened

4601
02:44:22,980 --> 02:44:24,720
for the same reason that,

4602
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:25,980
do you know when you have an accident

4603
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:27,160
while the accident is happening,

4604
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:28,500
time seems to be slowed down

4605
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:29,620
and everything's in slow motion.

4606
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:30,380
Oh, yeah.

4607
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:32,320
The reason why awareness

4608
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:33,880
is going up is because

4609
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:37,100
your DNA, let's just say,

4610
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:38,080
your essence,

4611
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:39,940
you know it's over

4612
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:42,500
and you're going to get a baseball bat

4613
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,800
across your head in the next,

4614
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:45,080
I'm not going to say,

4615
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:46,380
well, it's less than a decade now.

4616
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:47,720
So all of a sudden,

4617
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:48,780
everything's slowing down

4618
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:49,940
and you notice a lot more.

4619
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,040
When you're falling or in an accident,

4620
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:53,220
you're noticing everything

4621
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:54,820
that's happening in real time,

4622
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:55,760
but it's slowing down.

4623
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:57,580
That's what's happening for society.

4624
02:44:57,580 --> 02:44:58,400
It's very typical.

4625
02:44:59,540 --> 02:45:01,900
So, Greg, we have this horrible event

4626
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:02,760
that's about to happen

4627
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:04,780
to the surface population here soon

4628
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:05,480
that you're keen on.

4629
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:06,340
No, not soon.

4630
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:08,920
In other words,

4631
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:10,900
if you know it's happening, it's soon,

4632
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:12,960
but if you don't know the specifics,

4633
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:15,140
it's never going to happen

4634
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:16,260
and you're going to deny it.

4635
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:19,680
Because you're going to fall

4636
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:21,720
for the propaganda, the rhetoric,

4637
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:23,780
that we all have to get together

4638
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:24,820
to do these things.

4639
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:25,580
They're a little harsh

4640
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,820
to set us on a new foot

4641
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:28,620
and we're going to have a thousand years

4642
02:45:28,620 --> 02:45:29,680
of peace and prosperity

4643
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,400
and they're going to produce it also.

4644
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:33,120
They're going to produce things

4645
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,000
to show peace,

4646
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:36,920
to show the poor being helped,

4647
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:39,480
to show certain technologies, right?

4648
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,900
And the people are going to fall for it,

4649
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:42,520
just like they fell for this last thing, right?

4650
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:44,920
Well, Greg, how do I not be part of the problem?

4651
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:48,780
How do I usurp just a life of meaning?

4652
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:49,820
No, no, there is no problem.

4653
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:52,100
It's how do you change your destiny?

4654
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:52,780
It's possible.

4655
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:53,580
Like there's something called

4656
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:54,920
the Book of Life and it's edited.

4657
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:56,880
There's people's names

4658
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:58,020
that are put in there, right?

4659
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,580
To be part of the spiritual elite.

4660
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:01,400
And then, but they could also be taken out, right?

4661
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:02,440
Are you familiar with that, Daniel?

4662
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:05,580
There's a list of people that are incarnated

4663
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:07,740
to have a certain position here.

4664
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:08,520
And but they could be,

4665
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:10,020
it gets edited constantly.

4666
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:11,580
It's called the Book of Life.

4667
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,640
Those that would be granted high privilege later.

4668
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:15,640
You could be before you were born in there

4669
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:17,240
to be granted high privilege later

4670
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:18,880
when you're reincarnated.

4671
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:20,980
But if you can do things here

4672
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:22,200
or they change their mind,

4673
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:23,400
they could take you out of it.

4674
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,040
Who's that?

4675
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:26,300
Or those that are not in it

4676
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:29,220
can be put into it last minute, right?

4677
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:31,440
OK, so what you're saying basically

4678
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:32,960
is you don't want to be in the trap.

4679
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:34,100
So, you know, knowledge,

4680
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:35,620
avoidance of a trap

4681
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:37,020
is knowledge of its existence.

4682
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:40,060
The only way a trap is a trap

4683
02:46:40,060 --> 02:46:41,460
is if you don't know that it's there.

4684
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:43,460
But if you know that it's there

4685
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:45,520
and you go into it, it's not a trap.

4686
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:46,200
It's a tragedy.

4687
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:48,820
See the difference between

4688
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:49,920
misfortune and tragedy.

4689
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:50,840
See, that's why all these

4690
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,740
false flag events are called tragedies

4691
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:54,420
because they knew they were coming.

4692
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:57,540
A tragedy means you knew it was bad,

4693
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:59,580
but you went ahead with it anyway, right?

4694
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,320
Like the Greek tragedies.

4695
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:03,240
Why are they called the Greek tragedies

4696
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:04,320
with Medea and all that?

4697
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:05,480
Because when you read

4698
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:07,100
the old Greek tragedy stories,

4699
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:08,020
it's like, let's say,

4700
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:09,660
50, 60 page story.

4701
02:47:10,140 --> 02:47:11,040
In the first chapter,

4702
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:11,720
they tell you everything

4703
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:12,560
that's going to go down

4704
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,760
and how they're going to die in the end.

4705
02:47:14,660 --> 02:47:16,400
And everybody in the book knows it,

4706
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:18,480
but they go ahead with it anyway.

4707
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:21,820
Yeah, nine minute warning, by the way,

4708
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:22,560
just so you all know.

4709
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:25,920
But lastly, about this,

4710
02:47:26,340 --> 02:47:27,040
you also mentioned

4711
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:28,780
the people who will depart,

4712
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:31,340
that they will still be around afterwards.

4713
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:32,820
In what form did you mean?

4714
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:37,340
OK, there's a long,

4715
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:38,660
in this physical form,

4716
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:39,500
but different again,

4717
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:40,620
because the Earth will be,

4718
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:42,020
the Earth will be subject

4719
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:43,200
to tremendous changes.

4720
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:44,540
It's going to grow in size.

4721
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:46,720
I'm not going to get into the,

4722
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:48,040
what would you call it, geo,

4723
02:47:48,300 --> 02:47:49,680
when you change the surface

4724
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:50,800
of a planet completely,

4725
02:47:50,920 --> 02:47:51,460
what is it called?

4726
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:52,120
Terraforming.

4727
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:53,000
Terraforming.

4728
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:54,660
Yeah, the Earth is going to be re-terraformed.

4729
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:57,200
It's going to be universe central.

4730
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:57,940
You know how you have

4731
02:47:58,580 --> 02:47:59,760
Grand Central Station,

4732
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:01,760
like a main hub where all the trains go?

4733
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:02,800
In Berlin, there's one.

4734
02:48:02,860 --> 02:48:03,620
In England, there's one.

4735
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:05,760
The Earth is going to be a main hub

4736
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:07,780
for all the cosmic beings

4737
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:09,040
or most of the cosmic beings

4738
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:09,960
in this universe.

4739
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,120
Yeah, but not now,

4740
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:13,380
in a thousand years from now.

4741
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:15,100
But it's going to be

4742
02:48:15,100 --> 02:48:16,480
like a construction project.

4743
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:17,460
But in the meantime,

4744
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,320
the humans are going to be allowed

4745
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:21,580
to develop self-policing

4746
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:22,640
and outside policing

4747
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:24,660
also by high-level spiritual beings

4748
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:25,180
and ETs.

4749
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:26,700
And this is all going to start

4750
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,500
in about a decade.

4751
02:48:29,940 --> 02:48:31,220
And it's going to start

4752
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:31,900
in the Middle East,

4753
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,700
where it, you know how grandma,

4754
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:34,620
you know how people say

4755
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:35,900
what goes around comes around?

4756
02:48:36,500 --> 02:48:38,480
Okay, when you look at a racetrack

4757
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:40,660
of a car or a horse racetrack

4758
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:41,160
or something,

4759
02:48:41,380 --> 02:48:43,120
can you visualize the starting line?

4760
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:44,480
You see where the, right?

4761
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,360
Visualize that,

4762
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:46,820
the starting line or a racetrack.

4763
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:48,020
Let me ask you,

4764
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,020
where's the finishing line?

4765
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:50,900
It's the same place.

4766
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:51,760
Exactly.

4767
02:48:52,660 --> 02:48:54,520
So the known history that we have

4768
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:56,560
and all of the attributes that go back,

4769
02:48:56,660 --> 02:48:57,940
where did everything kind of start

4770
02:48:57,940 --> 02:48:59,180
with the Sumerian gods

4771
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:00,060
and the Akkadians?

4772
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:01,880
It was all in the Middle East.

4773
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:04,180
Where do you think it's all going to end?

4774
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:05,820
Mesopotamia, the Tigris River.

4775
02:49:06,280 --> 02:49:07,440
That's where it's going to end.

4776
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:08,700
This particular cycle.

4777
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,120
Yeah.

4778
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:10,400
And it is a cycle,

4779
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:11,420
but each one is different.

4780
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:13,180
Watch, okay.

4781
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:14,680
How do you know this is going to happen?

4782
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:17,840
There's going to be a civil war in Iraq,

4783
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:19,580
and it's going to split north-south

4784
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:21,560
and a new country is going to be formed

4785
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:22,620
called the new Assyria,

4786
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:24,240
and it's going to take land

4787
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:25,660
from Syria and Turkey.

4788
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:28,020
Before the Syrian conflict started,

4789
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:29,460
years before, I said, watch Syria.

4790
02:49:29,540 --> 02:49:30,760
There's going to be a conflict there

4791
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:32,220
to loosen it up.

4792
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:33,480
So when Assyria is formed,

4793
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:34,820
it'll be easy to grab that land

4794
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:36,760
and also Turkey, right?

4795
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:38,600
Very simple.

4796
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:40,720
So this is all fated.

4797
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:42,160
Yes, it's fated.

4798
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:42,440
Yeah.

4799
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:43,500
And you can't change it,

4800
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,680
but your perception,

4801
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:46,280
you'll ignore it.

4802
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:46,800
So in other words,

4803
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:48,120
if I tell people what's coming

4804
02:49:48,120 --> 02:49:48,860
with accuracy,

4805
02:49:49,940 --> 02:49:52,080
within a pretty accurate also,

4806
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:53,300
they say, that's never going to happen.

4807
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:54,380
And when it happens and I say,

4808
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:55,660
see, I'm not one to say,

4809
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:56,380
I told you so.

4810
02:49:56,740 --> 02:49:57,980
But some of us, remember I talked to us,

4811
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:59,600
oh, so what Greek, it was natural.

4812
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:01,800
You know, you were just lucky.

4813
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:03,540
I said, really, I have 150 things

4814
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,620
I went down with specifics.

4815
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:05,320
I'm just lucky.

4816
02:50:05,620 --> 02:50:06,220
The validation,

4817
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:07,940
because they're dumb and too proud.

4818
02:50:09,400 --> 02:50:10,640
They're cosmically censored.

4819
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:11,860
There's censorship

4820
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:13,280
and there's cosmic censorship.

4821
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:14,660
In other words, it comes from

4822
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:17,540
very, very high up cosmic authority.

4823
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:18,940
If they don't want you to see something,

4824
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:20,220
it doesn't matter what you do.

4825
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:21,000
They cannot see it.

4826
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:21,720
I'm sure you run into

4827
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:22,960
those people all the time.

4828
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:25,920
How come I feel like

4829
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:26,940
I'm one of the very few

4830
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:28,380
that is just dying to hear

4831
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:29,420
everything you have to say?

4832
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:30,280
That's what I don't get.

4833
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:31,500
You have all these answers.

4834
02:50:31,580 --> 02:50:32,600
Well, it's not what I have to say

4835
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:33,780
because I'm dying to hear

4836
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:34,560
what you have to say

4837
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:35,640
once you kind of, you know,

4838
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:36,940
come to this a little bit

4839
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:38,000
and start working it right.

4840
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,420
In other words, what I'm doing is

4841
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:42,080
you guys don't know how to cook

4842
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:43,560
and you go shopping with me

4843
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:44,080
and I show you

4844
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:45,660
and I make this delicious meal.

4845
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:47,120
And you're like, Greek,

4846
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:47,780
this is amazing.

4847
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:48,360
Should you go cook?

4848
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:49,000
Yeah, but you know what?

4849
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:49,920
You can cook too.

4850
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:51,580
You just have to understand

4851
02:50:51,580 --> 02:50:53,100
the properties of celery

4852
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:54,660
or how to make good rice.

4853
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:57,060
By the way, I did a few audios

4854
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:58,440
on how to make delicious food,

4855
02:50:58,640 --> 02:50:59,700
which has nothing to do.

4856
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:01,720
You could watch a million cooking shows.

4857
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:02,360
You're not going to learn

4858
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:03,180
how to cook, right?

4859
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:06,600
So, or buy a thousand cookbooks.

4860
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:07,680
You're still not going to learn how to cook.

4861
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:09,440
I broke down all the missing stuff.

4862
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:12,380
And whoever, I still get emails

4863
02:51:12,380 --> 02:51:14,520
even recently, Greek, it's amazing.

4864
02:51:14,620 --> 02:51:16,340
I went over the food video

4865
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:19,020
that you did and I never made potatoes

4866
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:20,300
and rice and this and that

4867
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:21,860
and meat so delicious.

4868
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,540
I remember the last time we talked,

4869
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:24,880
you said you put in some rosemary

4870
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:25,660
and butter or something

4871
02:51:25,660 --> 02:51:26,560
on some of my porterhouses.

4872
02:51:28,180 --> 02:51:29,900
Rosemary, lavender and thyme.

4873
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:30,940
I have a lavender bush.

4874
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:32,580
Lavender, like lavender shampoo.

4875
02:51:32,740 --> 02:51:33,500
You know, that's a plant.

4876
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:34,740
You know, it looks like a pine needle.

4877
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:36,300
Yeah, just a little bit

4878
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:37,160
combined with some other.

4879
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:38,440
It just opens up.

4880
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:39,540
It's just olfactory.

4881
02:51:39,800 --> 02:51:41,020
And when it hits the taste buds,

4882
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:42,960
it's like it's really delicious,

4883
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:44,640
but people don't know what it is.

4884
02:51:45,500 --> 02:51:46,920
Because they don't think of cooking.

4885
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:49,280
Also soups, like I could make

4886
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:50,480
the most delicious soups in the world.

4887
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:51,060
Very simple.

4888
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:52,640
You just put half of the soup in a blender,

4889
02:51:52,760 --> 02:51:54,860
make a puree, add a little heavy cream.

4890
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:55,960
And people are like,

4891
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:57,060
it's the most delicious soup I have.

4892
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:58,080
Really, it's a real basic soup.

4893
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:59,560
Let me show you how to do it.

4894
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:01,000
Just put half the soup in the blender

4895
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:02,640
or a hand blender and add some heavy cream

4896
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:03,940
and everybody will say it's most delicious

4897
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:05,820
instead of like stuff floating in liquid.

4898
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:08,640
Yes, it's like a vegetable soup

4899
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:09,480
or some sort of soup.

4900
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:10,100
Yeah, but you can do that.

4901
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:10,760
Yeah, it's very simple.

4902
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:11,700
I have very simple product,

4903
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:12,960
you know, baking.

4904
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,500
Do all your baking stovetop.

4905
02:52:14,780 --> 02:52:16,320
You don't have to fire up a big oven.

4906
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:17,120
It's a lot of energy.

4907
02:52:17,300 --> 02:52:18,000
You're wasting time.

4908
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:18,920
Do it on the stove.

4909
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:20,100
I'll show you how to do it on the top.

4910
02:52:21,460 --> 02:52:21,780
Anyway.

4911
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:24,780
Greg, can I ever meet you in person?

4912
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:25,900
Yeah, sure, sure.

4913
02:52:26,940 --> 02:52:28,020
I'm not supposed to...

4914
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:29,900
Okay, let me just share something that...

4915
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:30,760
In three minutes.

4916
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:31,660
I'm not supposed to...

4917
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:33,160
Okay, I'm not supposed to be here.

4918
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:34,560
You're not supposed to be...

4919
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:36,500
I'm not supposed to be talking to you or anyone.

4920
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:37,960
I do feel like it's...

4921
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:38,160
But I am.

4922
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:38,930
Because it's just...

4923
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:42,420
I feel like I'm forever indebted to you, Greg.

4924
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:43,720
Yeah, I'm like...

4925
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:47,820
You know, go to a highway and you have an Amazon truck

4926
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:50,080
that's delivering stuff from the East Coast to the West Coast

4927
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,960
and a box happens to fall off in Texas.

4928
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:52,640
Yeah.

4929
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:53,820
A bunch of people open it up.

4930
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:55,560
That's not supposed to be here.

4931
02:52:55,660 --> 02:52:56,480
It fell off the truck.

4932
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:57,740
It needs to go over there.

4933
02:52:58,960 --> 02:52:59,760
It's out of time.

4934
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:02,140
Yeah, I'm in the wrong place.

4935
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:02,940
I'm the wrong...

4936
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:05,200
It's no different than taking someone from the future

4937
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:06,140
and bringing them here.

4938
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:07,520
By the way, you know what happens

4939
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:09,980
when you bring someone from the past to the future

4940
02:53:10,400 --> 02:53:11,860
here in this time period?

4941
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:14,620
Let's say the three of us are in a room right now

4942
02:53:14,620 --> 02:53:16,060
and I was able to bring someone,

4943
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:17,240
not me, but let's just say,

4944
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:19,080
from 500 years ago.

4945
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:21,460
What's the first thing they're going to be freaked out about?

4946
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:22,260
Not the elect...

4947
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:23,880
You'll show them the wall and the switch,

4948
02:53:23,960 --> 02:53:24,900
the microwave and the radio.

4949
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:26,980
They'll be amazed for about two minutes.

4950
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:28,580
But when they go outside,

4951
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:29,640
they're going to see something

4952
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:31,540
that for days and days and days,

4953
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:32,500
they will never get over.

4954
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:33,220
What is it?

4955
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:34,560
How dumb people are?

4956
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:38,580
No, asphalt on the roads.

4957
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:40,520
Okay.

4958
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:42,300
Why are you taking asphalt?

4959
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:44,620
Why are you taking pitch that comes from the earth

4960
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:46,380
and spreading it all over the ground?

4961
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:48,740
It's a bad thing to do.

4962
02:53:49,660 --> 02:53:51,000
They'll never get over that.

4963
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:53,040
Okay, two minutes.

4964
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:54,400
Why is asphalt so bad?

4965
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:56,780
Because in the older cultures,

4966
02:53:56,920 --> 02:53:59,880
it had a very stark representation of certain things.

4967
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:03,100
Let me give you an example.

4968
02:54:03,460 --> 02:54:06,780
Many environmentalists say,

4969
02:54:06,860 --> 02:54:08,420
if you dump toxic things down the drain,

4970
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:09,340
you get in trouble, right?

4971
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:09,920
You get a fine.

4972
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:10,900
Yes.

4973
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:14,100
Do you know how much dioxins and formaldehydes

4974
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:16,380
and things drain off the asphalt road when it rains?

4975
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,760
You drink that water,

4976
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:21,040
you will die off the asphalt road.

4977
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:23,380
It's super toxic,

4978
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:24,720
and you're spreading it everywhere.

4979
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:25,900
That's great.

4980
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:26,520
That's the first thing.

4981
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:28,700
That's how you know if someone's been in the presence

4982
02:54:28,700 --> 02:54:30,800
of someone that's been plugged from the past into the...

4983
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:31,420
I'm not going to...

4984
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:32,880
Anyway, stop.

4985
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:33,360
Well, yeah.

4986
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:34,620
Look, let's just wrap things up.

4987
02:54:34,740 --> 02:54:35,160
Let's wrap it up.

4988
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:37,160
Daniel, great.

4989
02:54:37,320 --> 02:54:38,520
Thank you all so much.

4990
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:38,860
Great.

4991
02:54:38,940 --> 02:54:39,280
Thank you.

4992
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,340
Appreciate it, man.

4993
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:42,160
Now, Grieg, real quick.

4994
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:45,140
I have your permission to put these five interviews on YouTube.

4995
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:45,800
Am I correct?

4996
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:46,620
Yeah, sure.

4997
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:49,740
Also, too, I'm sure Daniel wouldn't mind going through

4998
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:52,260
and consolidating all of the interviews you've done

4999
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:54,020
to just have like a chronological...

5000
02:54:55,320 --> 02:54:56,100
I'm sure he...

5001
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:56,640
I've done that.

5002
02:54:57,180 --> 02:54:58,180
I've done that before.

5003
02:54:58,280 --> 02:54:58,840
Yeah, I can do that.

5004
02:54:59,240 --> 02:54:59,700
I didn't know.

5005
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:01,420
Wow, you're quite the guy.

5006
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:02,840
For him on his behalf,

5007
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:04,740
but would you be okay if Daniel did that?

5008
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:05,660
Of course.

5009
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,600
Okay, cool.

5010
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:07,260
Then it's settled.

5011
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,540
Grieg, call me whenever.

5012
02:55:09,540 --> 02:55:11,280
I'll post this within a day or so.

5013
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:12,700
And seriously, from the bottom of my heart,

5014
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:13,440
thank you, man.

5015
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:14,940
Okay, you're welcome, guys.

5016
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:15,540
Thank you again.

5017
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:16,320
All right.

5018
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:17,140
Bye, y'all.

5019
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:17,680
Ciao.
