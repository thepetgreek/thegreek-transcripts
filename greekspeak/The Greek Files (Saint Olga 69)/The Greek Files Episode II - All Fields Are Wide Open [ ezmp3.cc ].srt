1
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,430
Okay, so I had to cut the Greek off early last time, which I regret to inform everyone,

2
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,290
but we get to pick right back up, arguably where we left off, and we also have Daniel

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,710
Sala.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,750
Hello.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,650
So, I have stuff that the Greek and I can pick up on, but you wanted to make mention

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,250
of a couple of interesting points.

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,690
Well, yeah, I did listen to your previous show, and it caught my attention a few certain

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,750
things that you hadn't brought up before the Greek, and I had to, you know, pounce on them.

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,670
Namely, one of them was the idea that, well, we discussed this in private, but since we're,

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,550
you know, going for fresh intel, might as well bring it up, the idea that we all know that

11
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,150
the theory has been disproven, and whatever you see through the electron microscope is

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,790
usually an artifact, and the simulation of the culture medium result in the same thing,

13
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,510
whether you use a sample or not, and all these things.

14
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,650
But you mentioned that pandemics are real, for you gave the example of smallpox, and

15
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,530
I was wondering if you can elaborate on what's the real mechanism of how pandemics work.

16
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,230
Okay, great.

17
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,390
Environment.

18
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,330
Where the body starts and where it ends is actually the environment that's around you.

19
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,310
For example, I brought up, if you recall, seasonal eating.

20
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,250
Many people get what's called the common cold when there are seasonal changes.

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,150
There's also a cold that happens when it goes, not only people used to getting the cold,

22
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,710
let's say, when it goes from warm weather to cold weather, but there are also people

23
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,050
that come down with certain discomforts and what they call illnesses when it goes from

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,850
winter to summer.

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,790
For example, very often in many parts of the world, especially in northern latitudes,

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,970
there's something called the rotting season.

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,750
I would consider it a fifth season.

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,550
You know how we have the four seasons, this would be a fifth season.

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,750
This is determined very simply by, you'll notice that certain times of the year, depending

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,930
on where you are on the Earth, the milk doesn't stay as fresh, or things don't stay as fresh,

31
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,190
they spoil much quicker.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,790
If you have a wound, it takes much longer to heal.

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,670
In northern latitudes, above 30 or 40, let's say, it happens when you transition from winter

34
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,190
to summer.

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,010
On the more equatorial, it's from summer to winter.

36
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,730
That's just an example, and it has nothing to do with temperature of the refrigerator

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,590
or temperature.

38
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,490
It has to do with the seasonal change, which is an energetic change.

39
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,950
I think we brought up, if you look at the cross-section of lung tissue, intestinal tissue,

40
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,450
stomach tissue, you'll notice that there's nothing that goes through those tissues.

41
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,070
They're completely sealed.

42
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,830
We did briefly cover it.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,290
Yes.

44
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,890
So, the process of induction, which is very similar to in electronics or electrical engineering,

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,650
the process of a transformer coil, where you have, you take one voltage and you step it

46
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,610
down or step it up, when you have a wound coil next to another coil.

47
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,850
And they cannot still explain how it works, but they do know it does.

48
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,550
So, if we call it induction, and we look at the term, and it's typically used as a social

49
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,750
term, but typically used as an engineering term, it's fairly accurate.

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,330
So, things affect each other by proximity, okay?

51
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,530
Like for example, wireless, the idea of wireless.

52
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,990
What happens with the body, if you want to just take it to a quick end, is you have perturbations,

53
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,250
which is disturbances.

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,670
Things have templates and predetermined outcomes, believe it or not, in nature.

55
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,550
And when those predetermined outcomes are disturbed or changed through perturbances

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,870
or disturbances, you have disease.

57
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,110
Very similar to, like, if you're driving a car up a hill and the air becomes too thin,

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,090
it doesn't run very well because the air-to-fuel gas mixture starts to go off, let's say, right?

59
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:21,050
So, the next concept for illness is the human body is constantly radiating energy.

60
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,670
Let's just not call it energy because we need to find an energy, its ability to do work

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,230
and other things.

62
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,330
But we have a field and an atmosphere around us, and the quality of that atmosphere either

63
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,450
promotes wellness or disease.

64
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,130
So, that is the basis, the basic foundation.

65
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,070
It is a non-physical, in other words, when I said, if I recall, the Revolutionary War

66
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,010
did not start in America until there was a smallpox pandemic, was what I brought up.

67
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,770
Typically, they wait for pandemics.

68
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,790
That's why, for example, what they call the Spanish Flu did not start in Spain.

69
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,430
It's very well known it started in Kansas.

70
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,790
It was started by the medical community and the political community, right?

71
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,370
It was known as the American Army Flu, and the only reason they called it the Spanish

72
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,010
Flu is because it was first acknowledged when the Americans landed in Spain.

73
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:16,350
So, you'll notice that whenever you see a spread of disease like this, it's a geopolitical

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,670
ploy to go into war.

75
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,270
The Black Plague was also very similar.

76
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,330
It was started by the Asians going back and retaliating against the Europeans.

77
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,070
I think I have described in private how these things are done.

78
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,130
I don't think it's good to describe them publicly, but what I want to just maybe add, I'm kind

79
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,490
of all over the place here because it's a big topic, and I know people don't have the

80
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,530
basis and the foundation of it, so hopefully being more roundabout in general, at least

81
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,830
to get them away from the viral theory, is best.

82
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,490
But I don't think it's best to talk about how these things are really done.

83
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,790
For example, people still have the misunderstanding that there's some laboratory that has these

84
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,990
agents in a petri dish and somehow spreads them to the population.

85
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,610
That will never happen.

86
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,010
You can attempt to do something like that, and you might quote-unquote infect maybe a

87
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,710
dozen or so people, but it won't spread, you see, because there's a big myth about

88
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:09,950
that.

89
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,970
You know, let's say something getting out of a lab and spreading worldwide.

90
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,710
That is a myth.

91
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,830
That is just as big of a myth as 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters vaporized the World Trade

92
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,150
Center.

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:20,870
Right.

94
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:28,390
I think it's a safe assumption to say that it happens non-physically and through EM frequency,

95
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,690
right?

96
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,330
Yes.

97
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,490
And that part of it is also just mother nature.

98
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:40,370
For example, when you put a beaker of water with DNA in one corner of the room and another

99
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,870
one with nucleic acids, aka the ingredients of DNA, in another beaker of the room, and

100
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:52,330
then you shine a UV light on the one with DNA, the sequences in the beaker with DNA will automatically

101
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,430
form in the other one.

102
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,130
Yes.

103
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,870
So that's a glimpse of how it works, I guess.

104
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:03,090
What would you say is the proportion between the ones that are intentional and the ones

105
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,930
that are naturally occurring?

106
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,370
But if you actually look at it from a very high vantage point, there is nothing natural.

107
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,610
It's all under control.

108
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,110
There are systems in place, like, for example, the self-driving cars, are they naturally driving?

109
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,670
They might seem like they are, but they're not.

110
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,850
There's a pre-program in there, right, and devices and sensors.

111
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,530
That's one thing that everything is in reverse.

112
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,710
In other words, what we think we're actually developing technology, meaning we, the human

113
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,210
collective, is we're not really developing anything, we're just rediscovering and rediscovering

114
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,230
methodologies.

115
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,290
Right.

116
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,250
Yeah.

117
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:50,910
Now, one more thing about the idea of contagions and all that is, and you said EM, it's actually

118
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,310
beyond measurable, current measurable frequencies, because the way the frequencies are measured,

119
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,410
let's say, if you were to say the frequency, I would say it's more Planck, max Planck,

120
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,010
you know, in other words, these are frequencies that are beyond measurement.

121
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,430
There are ways to measure them, but not with current devices, because all of the current

122
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,170
devices are based on pressure.

123
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,790
All of your frequency measuring devices use sensors and transducers that rely on a certain

124
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,870
kind of pressure to activate them to create an analog readout for the observer or the

125
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,290
scientist.

126
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,910
These types of frequencies do not work that way.

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,170
They work on a scale that is not pressure-based.

128
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,890
In other words, you might say vacuum-based, but not vacuum as people would consider a

129
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,429
simple vacuum, but a biological vacuum, which is an oscillating vacuum.

130
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,409
Like people talk about nitrogen, for example.

131
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,270
Nitrogen is a pulsing gas.

132
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,010
I can prove it, right?

133
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,290
Also, you have to go back to a very simple methodology that the ancients used of hydrogen.

134
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,530
We consider hydrogen to be the first element on the periodic table, but the word hydro

135
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,290
means water and gen means to generate or create.

136
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,590
So literally, that is a gas that has to do a lot with water.

137
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,410
So just like you mentioned, there are many experiments where even beyond putting the

138
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,190
DNA replication in one room, it's actually happened across the world, where they have

139
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,050
distilled water across the world and they send a certain frequency and within eight hours

140
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,910
the same DNA appears in distilled water.

141
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:19,750
Okay.

142
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,090
Through sound?

143
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,570
Through electromagnetic frequencies used as a carrier wave, right?

144
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,770
So one thing you have to understand is, like for example, in ancient texts they talk about,

145
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,170
especially the biblical texts, when something is deemed spiritually clean or unclean.

146
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,310
Like for example, if someone unclean touches something that is inanimate, then that inanimate

147
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,410
object now takes on that status of being unclean.

148
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,410
We might visit it as something like, for example, if someone, quote unquote, is diseased, lays

149
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,830
in a bed or touches something and you touch it, then you become sick.

150
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,950
There is a very strong truth to that, by the way, that it is conducted that way, but it's

151
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,030
done through the actual hydrogen.

152
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,230
But again, if I say hydrogen and your mind goes to the first thing in the periodic table,

153
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,090
you missed the point, even in the name.

154
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,190
Like, here's for example, let me just give something, because everything ties in together.

155
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,510
The concept of alchemy, one of the biggest disappointments on the Internet for me is

156
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,610
researching alchemy.

157
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:29,330
If I told you almost 100% or 99.9999% of all the ideology and philosophy about what is

158
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,490
alchemy on the Internet is false, it would be hard to believe.

159
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,170
But let me explain.

160
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:40,730
Once the alchemist or the person working with spiritual transformation, let's say, of the

161
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,870
world, that's really what it is, because alchemy is not just material, but it's social

162
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,410
as well.

163
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,930
The concept of the good wizard or the good witch versus the bad wizard or the bad witch

164
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,570
is a social thing, based on the characters of those two polarized, but it's actually

165
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,150
alchemic as well.

166
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,130
So, for example, you hear a lot about lead being turned into gold.

167
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,570
And here, I'll give a little secret on how that's done, because that's the difficult

168
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,410
way to do it.

169
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,430
You need a very high spiritual development to do that.

170
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,150
But the way that lead is turned into gold is by having lead, listen very carefully,

171
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,670
is by having lead release hydrogen.

172
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:28,050
Because once the, if you look at mathematically on the periodic table, if the lead releases

173
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,310
one proton and one electron, it becomes electrically, on the periodic table, gold.

174
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,270
Okay?

175
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,330
So, people are looking, well, how do we, they have done this in high-energy nuclear reactions,

176
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,250
by the way, when they use lead shielding, they've come back after months of running

177
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,430
high-energy nuclear reactions and find it's coated with gold.

178
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,690
But really, what's happening is if, again, if we say hydrogen is just one electron, one

179
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,170
proton, whatever, you miss the point.

180
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,690
So the point here is, how do you get a hunk of lead, or a big mass of lead, to release

181
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,930
hydrogen, because once you get the lead to release hydrogen as a gas or a liquid, you

182
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,950
will end up with gold.

183
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,250
And I just gave a very big secret on how it's done.

184
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,350
Stop looking at it as electrons and protons and look at everything in hydrogen.

185
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,850
Like for example, you know, there's a lithium shortage, they say, or it's very, it's a major

186
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,770
industrial proponent for the way the future is going with power storage, right, with lithium

187
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,230
batteries.

188
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,130
Why not take hydrogen and helium, which are more commonly found, and combine them to make

189
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,530
lithium?

190
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,070
Why not do that?

191
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,590
For example, petroleum, this is what got Germany in trouble in World War I.

192
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,170
It's a hydrocarbon.

193
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:51,030
Why not take CO2 gas, which is readily produced and readily available, and water, and make

194
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,310
hydrocarbons?

195
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,210
And by the way, there's plenty of companies and laboratories online you could look up making

196
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,930
petroleum from water and CO2 gas.

197
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,010
There's a process, there's one process called Towns gas, which was done 150 years ago.

198
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,470
And this goes on and on.

199
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,470
Yes, you do need catalysts.

200
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,570
You do need a catalyst.

201
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,690
For an example of a catalyst would be vegetable shortening that's used for cooking, Crisco

202
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,570
or whatever, right?

203
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,150
It's a vegetable oil, but it looks like butter or margarine.

204
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,830
That's water and oil mixed together.

205
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,390
Now you can mix water and oil all you want, all day long, all week long, all year long.

206
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,550
It will not turn into a buttery consistency.

207
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,950
But if you take the mixture under a slight vacuum and you run it over a very high purity

208
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,970
nickel beads, it will form into this buttery margarine shortening condition.

209
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,430
Now if you test it, you'll say, you know, the typical chemist will say, well, it's because

210
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,590
the nickel is going in it.

211
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,330
No, you'll test it.

212
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,470
There is absence of nickel.

213
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,970
There is no nickel in the material.

214
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,970
It's just a catalyst.

215
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,390
So the other part of understanding is a catalyst.

216
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,210
And this, all of everything I just said ties back to how the human body is in a state of

217
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,670
health or a state of disease or a pandemic is spread.

218
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,210
I know it might sound cryptic, but I'm laying down the basic foundation.

219
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,790
You know, instead of teaching young children the alphabet, don't they have little wooden

220
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,450
blocks and things to play with and then they, right, you see?

221
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,690
So these are the little alphabet blocks of how, quote unquote, disease and the disabling

222
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,690
of the social condition is what I call it, right?

223
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,410
Because people can't be social if they're dropping dead, right?

224
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,970
Yeah, I think the difference between alchemy and chemistry is that chemistry only studies

225
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:43,570
dead things. And even if you wanted to instruct people about alchemy, they just

226
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,670
wouldn't be ready for it, both in terms of practice, but also they were just rejected.

227
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,350
But apparently the stronger ones, there's a hierarchy and you have the plant and then

228
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:04,050
animal and then the metal kingdom that can provide you all these essences and elixirs.

229
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,230
But even then, when it comes to the most advanced part of alchemy, like getting the

230
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,830
elixir of life that basically gives you immortality, that one can actually be extracted

231
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,490
from any mineral, any living being or anything in existence is just a matter of skill.

232
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,870
And then I heard that the study of alchemy, if you master it, it's always going to

233
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:37,790
essentially be oriented beneficially because it has been attempted to be appropriated by,

234
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,250
you know, more nefarious entities.

235
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,370
But they only partially succeed, never really grasped it.

236
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:51,590
Yes, there's a fellow called Ibrahim Karim, he does biogeometry, by basically making a

237
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,710
squiggle or a line on a technological device that's putting out bad energy into the

238
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,170
room, will change it, for example.

239
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,690
And having a discussion with him, and he said this publicly on his own, is that every

240
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,870
time someone comes up with a beneficial methodology, regardless if it's using symbols

241
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,710
or alchemy or concepts, immediately it's grasped and there are 300 people versus one

242
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,510
that try to use it for bad reasons, right?

243
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,290
Look at pharmaceutical companies, people think they're pharmaceutical in medicine, but

244
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,170
they're not classified as such, they're classified as chemical companies.

245
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,370
And the biggest business that chemical companies have, just like any business, is you

246
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,970
want military contracts, right?

247
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,330
And what does the military use the chemicals for?

248
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,910
Right, so it all works the same way.

249
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,630
I wanted to just not maybe, for some people listening, they might think because I brought

250
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,850
up alchemy, it's a deflection from your original question, but the original question

251
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,990
was the contact or the contagion theory.

252
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,790
One thing I just want to say is also very, very important, which I've repeated myself

253
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,990
over the past more than two decades, but at least a decade on the Internet, is no

254
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,550
matter what field you look at, there's over 15,000 different fields in industry and art

255
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,010
that people can look at in the Thomas catalog, which is an industrial catalog.

256
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,550
Every one of those is wide open, completely wide open.

257
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,210
In other words, when you look at all of the what academia is putting in front of you, I

258
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,170
call it grunt work.

259
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,630
It's no more than going to the biggest construction site in the world and seeing ditch

260
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,770
diggers. Ditches have to be dug.

261
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,450
They have done nothing more than dig ditches.

262
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,410
They have not elaborated or developed anything at all.

263
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,030
So any field you want to anyone wants to explore and you look at a body of knowledge

264
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,350
that looks complicated and all that, it's done that way to deflect you.

265
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,690
All of the all of the fields are completely wide open.

266
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,350
Every single field doesn't matter what it is.

267
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,990
That's why we have the secret technologies and secret societies, right there taking

268
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,090
advantage of what can be developed and basically the trash or the rubbish is given to

269
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,190
the public. So again, just to go back to the idea.

270
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:11,130
Of anatomy, because if we're talking about disease and pandemics, we have to look at

271
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,250
of what in the anatomy will notice that the human body or any or a plant or an animal,

272
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,510
nothing ever goes through from the exterior environment into the body, passing through

273
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,450
by absorption or osmosis or anything like that.

274
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,610
Physically, it's all by induction.

275
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,190
Do you have the lungs and bladder and things like that?

276
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,930
Kidneys, which are called the sacs, where something goes in and then back comes out

277
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,430
the same way it went in, but nothing penetrates or is ever absorbed.

278
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,630
So once this is understood and people hearing my voice, because I think I might be the

279
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,570
only one insisting on this, by the way, that but nothing ever goes in or comes out of

280
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,410
the body directly.

281
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,610
Once people hear this and meditate on it, whether it's for an hour, a week or a year,

282
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,410
they can pick up from what I just said and say, then what is the concept of nutrition?

283
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,650
What is the concept of disease?

284
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,150
What is the concept of growth?

285
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,990
How does it work?

286
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,290
You see?

287
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,390
Yeah, I hope my whole goal, sorry, is to inspire, is to give out because I've been

288
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,410
sitting on these things, by the way, for a very long time, most of my life, and I keep

289
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,770
looking at other people producing a simple result.

290
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,250
And it's kind of embarrassing to not see things broken down in such a simple way

291
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,170
because I'm very private.

292
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,990
I'm not a I'm not a good speaker.

293
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,590
I'm not the most intelligent person or whatever.

294
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,610
But it's kind of embarrassing that these points are not being made by other humans.

295
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,010
Yeah, they're very slowly starting to eat their way.

296
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,950
They admitted to themselves that every time they're asked, you know, the mainstream,

297
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,870
they admit to not being able to see an isolated in the fluid of any sick person.

298
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,850
And a lady has taken upon herself to send this to every major medical institution in

299
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,010
the world, and they all either dismiss her or just admit to the fact that they don't

300
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:08,630
have it. But you also mentioned that you have a certain pet peeve with a few terms,

301
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,210
like I think quantum mechanics being one of them and the principle of uncertainty, how

302
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,910
it's all at random.

303
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:25,430
There is no it's it's it might seem random, for example, two nations going to war when

304
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,350
the frontline infantry of one moves on the other, they might look very random.

305
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,370
But I'm assuring you that it was very well planned before the same.

306
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,670
If you watch, let's say, an American football game, you'll see a line of scrimmage.

307
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,590
They blow the whistle, the game starts and they're running across the field.

308
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,870
It looks very random, but I assure you it's been planned very, very closely before it

309
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:53,090
started. And another one is the concept of space time that matter and space.

310
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,570
Well, that's that's about as ridiculous as anything else we've heard that the public

311
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:04,290
talks about. Now, picking on these things, let me just say almost everything that you

312
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,330
hear everyone talk about is a form of propaganda or a psyop, right?

313
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,530
But it's so big that people don't see it.

314
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:17,030
Just for example, if everything was hot, there's no hot because there's no contrast.

315
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,790
So if everyone is a criminal, there's no criminal, right?

316
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,850
If everyone is good, because there's nothing to say he's good or bad.

317
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,390
OK, so what's happening is when you put out stuff like quantum and time space and all

318
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,670
that, by the way, which I use as a litmus test when I listen to people speak about

319
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,890
their experiences or science, when the moment I hear that, that's a major red flag that

320
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,750
this person has been very heavily propagandized.

321
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:47,110
Number one, innocent, or number two is a shill, or number three is just people want to

322
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,190
hear this person speak for some reason where they should be using their breath to cool

323
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,270
their porridge instead.

324
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,350
But anyway, yeah, these are all concepts.

325
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,670
Let's just go specifically space time, because if I just sound like I'm knocking it and

326
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,770
not giving a reason, whenever you say something, you have to give the how and why.

327
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,230
Space, even Tesla said this, has no attributes.

328
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,590
That's why it's called space.

329
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,150
Nothing has no attributes.

330
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,170
Zero has no attributes.

331
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,970
So the space is merely the points that are described as such for communication purposes.

332
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,430
So there is no space.

333
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,130
In other words, the space between objects defined as something is ridiculous.

334
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,270
It has no attributes.

335
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,070
It's the objects surrounding what they emanate that define the situation.

336
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,770
Time is the same.

337
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,830
There is no time.

338
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,910
If there is no motion, there is no time.

339
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,110
What we consider time, especially I poke fun at it, calling the mechanical clock the

340
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,130
wind-up toy known as the clock or the Pope's work schedule, or no matter what form of

341
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,190
time convention you use in seconds or whatever, because each culture had their own way

342
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,730
of keeping time, it's just a matter of recording events.

343
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,310
So when you're communicating a memorialized event, something that happened or something

344
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:10,410
that will happen, you're giving a measurement, a metric, on how to perceive it, right?

345
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,310
Because if I say it happens in five million seconds, it's easier to say six months,

346
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,810
right? Because five, you see, so we break these things down into different levels.

347
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,390
But there is no time either.

348
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,750
Time is merely the measurement of and recordation of events.

349
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,930
Right. So bending space time is just about as ridiculous as anything else that you hear

350
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,370
or, you know, manipulating space time.

351
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,770
And the same, sorry, the same with time travel.

352
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,090
You're never traveling in time past or the future.

353
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,650
You're traveling to a past event or a future event.

354
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,990
And it's not done by time.

355
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,410
It's done by each event having its own, let's say, frequency in existence.

356
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,590
And the moment you're able to measure it, you reproduce it.

357
00:23:53,650 --> 00:24:00,510
And then you somehow, the reality we're living in will reproduce it enough that you

358
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,750
will actually be there.

359
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:09,010
Right. And would you agree that the most maybe overlooked aspect, even more than

360
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,730
electromagnetism, is the rotation of all these particles, the subatomic particles?

361
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:21,150
Because even the electrons spin, and if you were to adjust to account for that, then

362
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,590
you could actually observe it with the right apparatus.

363
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,670
And then it would make sense that this absorption caused by the rotation of

364
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,930
everything is what also causes the gravity and so on.

365
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,350
And that also is the mechanism behind astrology and astronomy.

366
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,770
Yes, astronomy and astrology are reverse the definitions, by the way.

367
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,190
Astronomos means knowledge of the stars, and astrology means the laws of the stars.

368
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,050
So they should be reversed, you see, because the astrologers never get into this

369
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,050
planet being in this house when it's made of gas and has this or that quality to it.

370
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:04,590
You see, astrology is knowledge, and on Nomos, astronomy is the laws.

371
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,310
So when someone is looking at astrology or an astrologist, they're really an

372
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,450
astronomer and vice versa, just like the words soul and spirit have been reversed,

373
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,550
right? But in terms of gravity, there is no gravity either.

374
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,410
The gravity is a resultant of the ether.

375
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,370
The ether, OK, everything in nature, even the hardness of materials, is pressure

376
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,150
differential. In other words, something that has more pressure will resist

377
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,750
something of less pressure, and something that has more pressure will want to go

378
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,370
towards something of less pressure.

379
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,810
So the reason you have the illusion of what they call gravity, which is just a

380
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:48,270
name, is that the earth represents a sink, like something that falls into

381
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,850
something else, of ether.

382
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,470
So, and when you understand the potentials are reversed, where the ether goes from

383
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:01,190
low to high potential, the earth represents a high potential ethereal zone, as many

384
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,030
of the planets, actually all of the planets do, and the low potential ether is

385
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,010
rushing towards it, and the ethereal component in matter is being dragged along

386
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,090
with it. Very simple.

387
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,030
The electron and the neutron and the atom is a fallacy.

388
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,590
It is just a communication.

389
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,210
For example, the ether expressing itself in material form, as material, is the same

390
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,610
as, let's say you have a fan, an electric, you know, a wind air fan on your desk, and

391
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,690
it's off, and it has, let's say, 10 blades on it.

392
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,630
You can put your hand through that fan anywhere, and it just, you have a lot of

393
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,790
quote-unquote space, and you can move safely through it, correct?

394
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,350
What happens when you plug that fan on, and it's spinning at 1500 RPM?

395
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,910
Those 10 blades start spinning, and that zone appears to be solid.

396
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,030
Anything you throw within that zone that the blades pass through appears to be

397
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,390
solid.

398
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,850
The same with a wheel on a bicycle, or anything that's rotating.

399
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,850
And the faster that it rotates, the more solid it appears to be.

400
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,530
So, if you're moving at the same speed as that fan, you could probably negotiate some

401
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,710
kind of traversal through that, or if you stop the fan from moving, you can negotiate

402
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,370
a traversal through the fan, like as if when it was not plugged in.

403
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,430
And that's simply the condition of matter.

404
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,950
What they're calling the electron potential, which is, electrons in science is EV, right?

405
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,450
Electron volts, usually.

406
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,250
That is when they have a resistive element.

407
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,170
In other words, when the material is put under certain pressure, it will create some discharge.

408
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:42,750
In other words, once the mechanical pressure or mechanical movement is introduced, there

409
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,610
is a charging sequence that happens, and then a discharge.

410
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:52,390
And that discharge, or resistance, altered condition, is what they're calling an electron.

411
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,250
The same as blood pressure.

412
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,790
The doctor straps, so the medical technician, calling them a doctor is more than they deserve

413
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,410
because they're not.

414
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,310
They strap a cuff on your arm and pressurize it to stop the natural blood flow, and then

415
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,770
tell you you have a certain condition called blood pressure.

416
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,810
When in fact, everything that's moving inside the body is under a slight vacuum.

417
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,130
In other words, less than external pressure.

418
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,530
Otherwise, you know, all the liquid would be at your feet and nothing at your head, unless

419
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,770
you had a 1200 horsepower pump in your chest, moving it through a 0.3 millimeter capillary.

420
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:33,370
So before what happened the past two years, they already had scammed, what, there's 20

421
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:38,970
or 30 million people that insist on taking blood pressure medication, and other things

422
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,350
like that.

423
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,130
They already had scammed that many people.

424
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,270
So why not go to the bill, you know, scam everybody, keep scamming, right?

425
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,190
So most of the medical conditions, if not all of them, are medical fiction.

426
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,790
Most of those diseases do not exist, by the way, and the major ones do not exist either,

427
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,130
right?

428
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,430
Yeah, there are no such things.

429
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:06,470
But also about the ether, there must be different levels, I would think, also, because just

430
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,750
how light behaves differently, depending on where it is in the universe, and of course,

431
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,230
is the background on which matter manifests, including the background of the spin and everything.

432
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:24,110
But I would guess that it has different levels, right, because of how, for example, it's also

433
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,590
misinterpreted the Big Bang theory that the universe is expanding because of their interpretation

434
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,430
of redshifts.

435
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:37,150
You know, they think that it's going away from you, whereas all that redshift is, well, it's

436
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,830
not linear, it's tired life.

437
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,650
Yes, that's been disproven.

438
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,510
The Doppler theory of the red and blue shift has been disproven already, because it never

439
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:50,550
took into account on the emissivity of the bodies they were measuring, and the emissivity

440
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,630
of the material.

441
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:59,330
And also, their instruments were very biased and crude, yeah, just like they came up with

442
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,750
water being H2O, which it's not.

443
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:02,830
Yeah.

444
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:10,430
And about the gravity, I still would like to elucidate this, because there are so many

445
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:18,010
opinions about what exactly keeps you upright in hollow Earth, assuming you, by now, you

446
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,410
have been clued into the idea that the Earth is hollow.

447
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,790
So, the conventional theory, and the one that you hear in the science, there are very

448
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,110
few books about it that are scientific, and most of the literature, at least three books

449
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:35,130
that I've found, say that, respect the Shell theorem, which says that, you know, the center

450
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,270
point of the planet is basically zero gravity, and that you're being kept upright by the

451
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,690
mantle on either side, which means that you're at zero gravity in the middle of the mantle.

452
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,610
You don't have to be there.

453
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,790
Zero gravity.

454
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:55,550
Again, if we, let's say gravity is a resultant of a motion of the aether, that resultant

455
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,470
of the motion is what we call gravity as a thing.

456
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,770
Now, there's something that is not really much discussed, it's done in music, it's called

457
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,650
coherence, right?

458
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,690
So when something is coherent, in other words, there's a certain amount of harmony that

459
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,370
is conducive to growth in life, direction doesn't matter as much, you see.

460
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:21,150
Like, for example, if we're on a big ball spinning in space, why is it that people in

461
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,970
Australia aren't falling off, and the people in Australia saying why the people up north

462
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,190
are not falling off, right?

463
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,370
Because there's a coherence there.

464
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,890
There's a big thing about the flat Earth and the round Earth, and I say it's both, depending

465
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,850
on what you're doing.

466
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,990
And what you're doing, if it's coherent with what you're observing and your result, then

467
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,370
you're good to go, you see.

468
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,550
That's why, I'll give another example, I was speaking with someone, an SSP person, and

469
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,150
we wanted to bring up gravity, they didn't want to hear what I had to say, of course,

470
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,090
they already had their mindset.

471
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,670
But I asked, what about the drive systems, you know, how do you get the ships and vehicles

472
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,050
to move?

473
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,950
I said, it's plasma engines, and I said, really?

474
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,870
If you have a device that's making plasma, well, that's what it's doing, it's making plasma.

475
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,870
It's not making anti-gravity, anti-gravity, if you're making, if your engine is making plasma,

476
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:17,290
you're making plasma, you're not making the effect, you see, so it's very difficult to

477
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,130
communicate this, right, to many people, or to the public at large, or even in a private

478
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,810
discussion.

479
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,930
In essence, there's a concept of shielding, you have to know how to shield and redirect,

480
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,130
in order to create that quote-unquote levitation effect.

481
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,970
And the best way to do it is through biology.

482
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,570
For example, when you are walking around, like you said, walking around in the core

483
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,710
and the mantle and all that, just being on the surface, for example, if you're walking

484
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,230
around and you have levity, when you lose that levity, you feel sick and you have to

485
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,790
lay down.

486
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,190
But people that are very sick can't stand up.

487
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,850
Okay, once you understand and study what is going on there, between the structure, irrelevant

488
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,030
of the structure of the body, let's say you have a skeleton or an exoskeleton, because

489
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,030
an insect doesn't have an internal skeleton, for example.

490
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,450
Once you understand the concept of levity, then you will be able to progress in the field

491
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,390
of antigravity.

492
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,610
The other thing is the rudimentary way to do it.

493
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,670
Just like if someone couldn't stand up, you made crutches for them to assist them, the

494
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:25,810
way you would develop a crutch to stand up or do antigravity is by rotating things, like

495
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,610
for example, gyroscopic motion.

496
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,990
Back in the 1920s, it was banned.

497
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:37,070
Anything that had to do with the effect of rotating devices was banned or just quietly

498
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,670
eliminated.

499
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,210
I dare anyone to find a scientific article anywhere in the world about the effect of

500
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,170
gyroscopes.

501
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,010
There are in Russia.

502
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,450
What's that?

503
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,690
Russians actually acknowledge it.

504
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:54,370
Yes, but you won't find anything developing it beyond just basically from a toy, you know,

505
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,030
scale.

506
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:55,970
Right?

507
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,750
And it has nothing to do with electricity, by the way, but you will use it, just like

508
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,290
if you made crutches for someone to stand, you can make them out of wood or metal or

509
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,010
plastic.

510
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,770
You don't have to use electricity.

511
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,110
You can use magnetism.

512
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,730
You can use, what is it called when a material dissolves into another?

513
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,850
One material.

514
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,670
There's saturation point when it reaches its limit.

515
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,469
Yeah, when materials change by, when you combine two materials to make a third material in

516
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,190
a different state is another way to do this, by the way.

517
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,090
Like, for example, if you study high-speed chemistry known as explosives and things like

518
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,630
that, those reactions don't make any sense when you really think about them.

519
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,050
They make sense on paper, but when you study those reactions as well, you will get to the

520
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,630
point of what we're talking about.

521
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,850
But again, just, I don't think I answered your question directly, but when you go inside

522
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:50,510
the earth, it's not just a matter of penetrating from the surface and descending, let's say,

523
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,409
in simple terms.

524
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:56,870
It's a matter of gaining or creating or acquiring the coherence that is involved in existing

525
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,230
there.

526
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,190
There's a certain coherent body.

527
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,830
Your body must be coherent with the conditions there.

528
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:09,270
Yeah, but there is also the fact that the mantle is not that different.

529
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:17,310
So it still abides by many of our rules, although allegedly the hollow is completely next density.

530
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:23,030
But the way I read between the lines in the most credible of these books, which is the

531
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:30,210
Radu Chinamar series, I think that it automatically has to flip when you're in the hollow because

532
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,650
of the different higher frequencies.

533
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,130
And also, it says that you have to be ready.

534
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:40,190
Your frequency of vibration has to be on par with where you're going first, otherwise you're

535
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,190
just going to collapse and stuff.

536
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,090
Because there was no mention of you turning upside down or anything.

537
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:49,490
So I have to assume that you're still headed downwards when you're all the way through

538
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,410
the mantle, which is so physical, and then it flips.

539
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,570
But that's just my guess.

540
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,230
Well, it would be, OK, let's not think about it flipping upside down.

541
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,310
Think about it, you're standing still and you get on a train that begins to move to

542
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,950
a speed where you're going 100 kilometers per hour and everything around you suddenly

543
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,790
seems to be moving by you very quickly, but you're not moving, you see.

544
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,050
But you're the one that's really moving, let's say, right?

545
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,990
Right.

546
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,790
And now here comes another train next to you that's also moving the same speed as you.

547
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,010
And when you look at someone there, they can open the window and you can shake hands and

548
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,430
they don't seem like they're moving, right?

549
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,690
You see what I mean?

550
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,630
The point of reference?

551
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:33,390
OK, that effect that, except for the point when you're standing still and the train is

552
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,870
at zero and accelerating, at the point of acceleration, you will notice a difference.

553
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,570
But once it reaches that stable speed, there's no difference now.

554
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,610
You still feel like you're standing still.

555
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,790
Ask anyone that's flown in an airplane at 500 miles per hour, they don't feel the speed.

556
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,450
Just like they say the Earth is spinning at whatever speed, you don't feel it.

557
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,270
The same way, once you reorient yourself and there's coherence around the being that's

558
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:02,490
experiencing this, you don't feel what position you're in, it doesn't matter, unless you start

559
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,690
looking directly at the exterior.

560
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,150
Right.

561
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,430
That is the same phenomenon, sorry, I described whether it's a round Earth or a flat Earth.

562
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,510
If you're a farmer or an architect, the Earth is flat.

563
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,430
Obviously, if you're a farmer, the sun goes around the Earth.

564
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,310
It rises in the east and sets in the west.

565
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,470
And you must understand that and use that to your benefit.

566
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,690
Otherwise, you will not succeed in growing crops.

567
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,570
You will starve.

568
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,790
If you're an architect, you use a level and a plumb bob when you're putting up a building,

569
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,170
meaning that the Earth is flat.

570
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,230
And if you don't know that, the building will be crooked and everyone will laugh at you.

571
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,510
Why are you using such poor practices, right?

572
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,870
But if you're a land surveyor and you're using a theodolite and you're measuring to make

573
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:49,230
a map, as you keep going, you're going to notice that none of your lines line up because

574
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,530
of the curvature of the Earth.

575
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,310
So you have to start compensating with steps and things like that that you see on borders,

576
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,510
unless you follow a river or something.

577
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:03,510
So if you're measuring the Earth, Lagrange points or Cartesian or whatever, you better

578
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,570
understand the curvature.

579
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,670
If you're an architect or a farmer, you better understand that it's flat.

580
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,910
You see the same thing with the hollow Earth.

581
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,090
Yeah.

582
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:22,390
And what would you say is the best model or just approximation of a replacement for the

583
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,150
space-time notion?

584
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:30,150
And I can just give the example of the Andromedans, that they say that they use nine mutually

585
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,550
interchangeable coordinates, six of space and three of time, and they use time as though

586
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,990
it were a dimension of space.

587
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:43,890
Yes, I would say that most of those coordinates are biological and conscious space, if you

588
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,930
know what I mean by that.

589
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,410
That's a weird noise going on.

590
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:47,730
Sorry.

591
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,110
OK.

592
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,330
Is that better?

593
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,010
I think I had some interference there.

594
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:51,570
OK.

595
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,950
Well, those coordinates would go back to how we started the conversation on, let's say,

596
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:03,870
the DNA and the disease and health and all that, being frequency-based, but not the type

597
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:09,870
of frequency and pressurized way that we measure frequency, but more of a biological vacuum

598
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,870
based, you know, the biological, quote-unquote, vacuum as a basis for developing instrumentation

599
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,310
for that, or a consciousness-intuitive base.

600
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:24,330
For example, the consciousness study that there is such a thing as psychic powers or

601
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,090
psychic ability and remote viewing or telepathy or telekinesis.

602
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:35,770
Once the underlying basis of how those things work is, let's say, established publicly, more

603
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,210
of those coordinates will be understood.

604
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,450
So if you were to speak with an Andromedan or Arcturian that uses that, you will find

605
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,530
that the majority of those coordinates are consciousness-based.

606
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,850
In other words, the way the mind works.

607
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,530
Now, by the way, I will plug in Donald Marshall.

608
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,070
If anyone wants to look him up, it sounds kind of crazy about the cloning centers.

609
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,030
One of the statements that he made, which I heard before he had gone public, is that

610
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:05,350
the entire mind and human body, everything about the mind that can be known, was already

611
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,430
mapped and completely known by the 1930s, right?

612
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,330
By who?

613
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,530
By the people that established the cloning centers underground, that Donald Marshall

614
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,310
speaks of.

615
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,050
The reptilians?

616
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,930
Well, yeah, kind of a low-level reptilian that brought a German faction to places in

617
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,090
Antarctica and Tibet to show leftover equipment from the Atlantean age, let's say.

618
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,190
And they were able to revive this equipment because the poor lizards couldn't do it, they

619
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,070
just have a claw with two digits on it.

620
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,970
They get really sad when they try to work the equipment because they're just little

621
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,850
dumb lizards, right?

622
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,230
They just have two little fingers.

623
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,410
So, they brought the humans over there that would work with them as well.

624
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,270
But the entire mind and consciousness has already been mapped.

625
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,870
In other words, consciousness transfer, where consciousness can be taken from one being

626
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,570
and put into a clone body and vice versa, during REM consciousness transfer.

627
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,310
So, the technology, which supposedly cannot be blocked, there's no disclosure of how

628
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:11,110
that can be blocked, or how consciousness moves, that's already been known by humans

629
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,730
for almost 100 years and it's being kept secret.

630
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:20,250
Once that is put forward, what you just mentioned about the coordinates and time and space and

631
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,350
all that, then that will be commonplace.

632
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:29,030
And since you brought up Donald Marshall, do you have any idea how the reptilian hierarchy

633
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:34,470
that he mentions relates to the Draco or, you know, the reptilians that you brought

634
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,350
up in the last episode?

635
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,970
Yes, very low level.

636
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,730
Very, very low level.

637
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:44,170
The ones that I brought up on the last episode, the reason I did that is because there's

638
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,790
still a lot of talk about the reptilians and the Draco being defeated, as I'm sure you've

639
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,770
heard, and the humans winning and on and on and on and on, and they cannot define any

640
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,250
of that.

641
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,870
And the ones that I mentioned, maybe half a dozen or a dozen groups, those are the very,

642
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,950
very high order.

643
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:06,190
And as you go down the order, the ones that are very low order, like a hybrid of a hybrid

644
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,610
of a hybrid down mixed, would be the ones that are on Earth and dealing with the humans

645
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,450
that people find, well, they eat our babies and they need human whatever.

646
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,970
The ones that I mentioned do not eat, just as humans will not have to eat again in the

647
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,350
future.

648
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:29,610
So those are some like really low, low, low level hybrid or leftovers here on the Earth.

649
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,830
They would be the, when I say low level, it's so low, it would be like when you look at a

650
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:40,850
human being or an animal and then you look at bacteria, a simple single-celled organism,

651
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,270
that's the difference between the Draco and the reptiles that Donald Marshall is talking

652
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,490
about.

653
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,990
That's how far removed they are.

654
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,350
Right.

655
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:57,810
And is there a way to tell when you're taken through REM abductions from when you're

656
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,210
actually astral traveling?

657
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,990
I think that several reasons against astral traveling.

658
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:12,350
First of all, the amount of hostility that is in that world, meaning the non-physical

659
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:18,370
3D world is so high that if anyone truly did that, they would come back severely damaged

660
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:24,170
mentally or would not come back or you would not hear stories like you hear now.

661
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:30,250
The other part of astral traveling is a scenario run on people from the quote-unquote

662
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,310
cloning centers, where they pre-drug the clone body and when your consciousness is

663
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,650
transferred, you're already pre-drugged with scopolamine or many, many other things,

664
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:39,930
right?

665
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,350
Sodium pentothal, sodium mannothal, and you'll believe anything that you're told, right?

666
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:45,470
Yeah.

667
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,490
Now, the thing when I say the cloning centers, it's not a very, it's very prevalent.

668
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,690
Millions, there are millions of people involved, if not tens of millions involved in this

669
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,290
scenario.

670
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,370
So, it's not a rare occurrence.

671
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:05,170
But there are such things as astral body experiences that are legitimate and may be possibly

672
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:09,750
the same places that your mind wanders, I mean your etheric or astral body wanders

673
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,690
when you sleep, right?

674
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,150
And they abuse that and make it seem like you're actually there.

675
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,610
Sure, sure.

676
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,270
But actually, you are actually there.

677
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,770
If your consciousness is grabbed while you're sleeping and brought to a cloning center

678
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,290
and you're in a clone body that has been pre-drugged, you'll believe anything that

679
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,670
you're told, that you're in nirvana.

680
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,330
But you're actually just in a physical clone.

681
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,070
You're just in a physical clone.

682
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,810
And it's just as physical as we are speaking right now through Skype, but even more physical

683
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,710
because you'll be in front of people that are playing a scenario on you.

684
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,170
That's why I speak so poorly about a lot of the communities that, I'm not going to

685
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:49,730
say directly SSP, but anyway, because I think they're all victims of that, the ones that

686
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,290
are public.

687
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,310
Well, with exceptions, but I would say.

688
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,710
Very small exceptions, yes.

689
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,350
Yeah, you mentioned that there's so much disinformation about the Draco being overcome

690
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,650
and stuff, but.

691
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:03,670
Not going to happen.

692
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:09,710
Yeah, that also goes against the mildly famous prediction through the looking glass that

693
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,810
they have definitely been defeated.

694
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,670
So that also goes hand in hand with the idea that the looking glass has stopped working

695
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,030
for the last 20 or so years.

696
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,050
Yes, if there is such a thing.

697
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,010
Well, there apparently are.

698
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,030
There are multiple.

699
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:24,830
There's enough.

700
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,650
It might exist, but what we're being told about it is not necessarily accurate.

701
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,230
Because you can hear, let's just move forward.

702
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,010
You can develop your own looking glass.

703
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:35,890
You don't need their stuff.

704
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,250
You already have everything that you need.

705
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,310
If once you understand there are only one, your incarnation here is less than one or

706
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,630
two percent of what you potential is.

707
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,030
Yeah.

708
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:52,470
And about the, Leslie, about the underground cloning chambers, would you say that everyone,

709
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:53,970
including us, is a target?

710
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,290
And is there a way to defend against it?

711
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,350
Unknown.

712
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,090
I would say yes on the first one and unknown on the second.

713
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,870
I think the best way to defend oneself if one does not know how to do it directly is

714
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,250
by involving a third party.

715
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,450
Like, for example, a very wealthy guy.

716
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,130
He's not a triple master black belt.

717
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,810
And so he may not be able to defend himself.

718
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,470
What does he do?

719
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,210
He gets on the phone and calls a security company to protect him, you see.

720
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,110
So that would be the easiest thing for people.

721
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,430
I call on personally.

722
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,210
I'll give my personal beliefs and allegiances.

723
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,790
I call on the Elohim.

724
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:28,810
Right.

725
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,490
That's pretty good support.

726
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:32,490
Yeah.

727
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:32,910
Yeah.

728
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,270
And they're pretty, they're very powerful.

729
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,210
And I would venture to say they're probably the most technically advanced in our universe

730
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,750
right now at parity with the Draco.

731
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,410
Because the Draco have been changing their whole ideology the few thousand years to involve

732
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:51,650
more of a light aspect, you know, more of a duality instead of going around and just conquering

733
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,890
and dominating everything.

734
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:58,470
See, the core of philosophy, I'll go out on a limb of the Draco, is that you must destroy

735
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,210
to create.

736
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,070
So let's say you're Draco and you go into a system that seems to be OK.

737
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,770
Well, it's not it's not as OK.

738
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,650
It's not as good as if we destroy it and recreate it.

739
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,590
It'll be better then.

740
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:10,750
Right.

741
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:13,470
And there are also some factions that just destroy and don't create.

742
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,170
That's called a capitalist, by the way.

743
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,190
You know, the definition of a capitalist is when you're done using something, you destroy

744
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,530
it so no one else can use it.

745
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:26,150
But anyway, I think Zen would like that political little dig there.

746
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,390
But they're understanding now more that there is a underlying harmony that they don't have

747
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,690
to affect and appreciate what's already there.

748
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,310
The Elohim are basically the human collective that has been interacting with them.

749
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,510
And every time they interact with the Draco, the Elohim get stronger and stronger.

750
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:50,430
And the Draco are the type of beings that if they go, let's say, to subdue someone and

751
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,370
that someone that they're trying to take over fights back and almost wipes out the

752
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:58,910
group that they sent to subdue, they will not call in reinforcements to completely destroy

753
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,090
them.

754
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,150
They're going to stop and say, wow, what great warriors they are.

755
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,410
Maybe we're better working with them than trying to kill them.

756
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,850
You see, so every time the Elohim engage the Draco, the Draco came back and said, wow,

757
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:12,950
look how strong they're getting.

758
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,810
Eventually, maybe we'll work together, but not now.

759
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:22,110
So there is a very high level of reason and honor in the Draco, by the way, which is never

760
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:22,910
really discussed.

761
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,210
Yeah.

762
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,230
There is just one person who stresses that for them, honor is everything.

763
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:33,290
And we only say that we're all about love, but don't actually respect it, whereas they

764
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,490
live and die by honor.

765
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:35,490
Yes.

766
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,950
And when they die, they do it consciously, by the way, not like we do.

767
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,930
Because let's say, for example, they died by accident.

768
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,890
They have the ability to transfer everything and restart, you know, like you hear about

769
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,110
like regenerate themselves.

770
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,910
You know, so let's say they died in battle.

771
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,190
They can just be regenerated.

772
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,790
No problem.

773
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,370
When they really do die, it's a conscious effort.

774
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,730
They say, OK, that's it.

775
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,890
I've had enough here, all these millions or billions of years.

776
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:00,930
It's time for me to go.

777
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:10,570
And there's also a certain degree of hypocrisy with all this reptilian slamming, because

778
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:18,850
without them being more apparently harsh, you wouldn't have this complexity of this

779
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,250
scenario.

780
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,210
It's going on out of this.

781
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,810
They're necessary as much as anything.

782
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:31,610
And they are apparently part of why we are so physical right here and why it's attractive

783
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:37,950
idea for all these more allegedly high density beings to incarnate as us.

784
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,550
And it wouldn't have been possible without the reptilians who are who get all the bad

785
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:42,950
reputation.

786
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:50,990
So also, they I don't know if you can vouch for this, but apparently the way they operate

787
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,270
is they subvert the population.

788
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,670
They only infiltrate it.

789
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:01,270
And they usually pick one that is neither too advanced nor too primitive and usually

790
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,930
one that's part of these higher alliances.

791
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:11,310
And then they hybridize just a little bit with them, just a few percentages and just

792
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,090
enough to have resonance with them and then just guide them after their own will.

793
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,770
Apparently, this is also the divergence that happened around 5000 years ago.

794
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:26,450
And would you do you know anything about the dumbing down of the humanity that happened

795
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,030
around that time?

796
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:34,210
Yes, more than 5000, I'd say 13,000 or between the 13,000 and 5000 years ago.

797
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:40,090
But I would suggest that the dumbing down is several reasons.

798
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,930
One is that humans as you as we are today at the human collectives, what is only one

799
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:50,810
or two percent, 10 percent, the best master ascended masters, what they call most magical

800
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,830
type people would be 10 percent of what a human can be expressed.

801
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:55,250
Right.

802
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,390
The other thing is the humans have a certain quality.

803
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,070
They can go into many worlds, even to the highest worlds.

804
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,450
And because of that, when they're put in a universe such as this one, which is I call

805
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:10,390
it a B movie.

806
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,690
Let's say you took the best classically trained actor and put him in a B movie.

807
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,090
Does that make it an A movie?

808
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,830
No, it's still a B movie.

809
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:18,150
Right.

810
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:25,870
So when you have humans, a fully charged or fully enabled human in a B grade universe

811
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:30,950
like this, nothing, eventually they're going to lean more into doing bad things than good

812
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:31,270
things.

813
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:31,510
Right.

814
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:37,690
They'll, for example, look at a group of people that like a different color than they

815
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,630
do something really superficial like that.

816
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,870
And because they like red and you like blue, there are no goods.

817
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:47,130
We're going to capture them while they're sleeping and hybridize them with pigs.

818
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,670
This is how humans are in a B universe.

819
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,310
Very wicked.

820
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:57,430
So to keep them going and keep them manifested, what you do is you enable them.

821
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,250
You manifest them at only one or two percent of their ability.

822
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:04,410
So their main struggle is just food, clothing and shelter.

823
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,950
And anything else is optional.

824
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,290
You know, it's very difficult to go beyond that.

825
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,310
Let me give an example.

826
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:17,330
If you study the body the way that we gave the outline and I have in the past, everything

827
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:23,210
that you need in terms of nutrition, you know, eat like eating food is a fallacy.

828
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,110
Everything that you need is produced in all of the glands that you have.

829
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:34,150
All of the glands and bladders that you have, the pituitary, the pineal, the gallbladder,

830
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:39,450
all the various glands that you have in your body can produce all of the nutrition because

831
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,350
they do that anyway.

832
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:45,610
By the way, you cannot process carbohydrates, proteins or minerals or metals or water in

833
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,450
your body unless the glands play a part.

834
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,350
So they have been tuned down and dumbed down.

835
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:55,550
So you have to have this very large intestinal tract and all that to remove the energy from

836
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,310
the food so the glands can process it.

837
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:03,710
We're actually the glands, if they were activated in the body, they would take everything from

838
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,290
the environment, sunlight or whatever environment you were in and you wouldn't have to eat.

839
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,050
You would be, quote unquote, Breatharian, right?

840
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:15,410
So this is very well known and very well established in those that study how the human body really

841
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:15,870
works.

842
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:22,010
So right now it's very difficult for people to be, quote unquote, Breatharian because

843
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:28,630
you've been put in a situation where our main concern is spending most of our time to get

844
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,990
food and water and making shelter just to exist.

845
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:37,510
That's why my biggest advice to young people is don't do anything here.

846
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,530
This is not a place to do anything grand.

847
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,250
It's about food, clothing and shelter.

848
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,690
And once you establish that, some people say, Greek, that sounds oversimplified and not

849
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,150
very good.

850
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:52,030
I said, yes, but once you establish that being here is about food, clothing and shelter

851
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:58,290
and what you want to do is get the best quality food, clothing and shelter for yourself being

852
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:04,490
here, while you're on that quest to determine that you want to acquire and afford the best

853
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,210
things here.

854
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,630
You will also learn about everything else in the meantime.

855
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,810
But I tell people if you have a great idea or an invention or whatever, this is not the

856
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,610
place to do it.

857
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,450
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it or make it, right?

858
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,130
You should do it, but don't say I'm going to do this for the world because this is not

859
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,630
the type of world that needs that.

860
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,410
Here, I'll give you an example, and this is not to brag or anything like that.

861
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:33,850
I was on a Skype call recently with someone who I had not seen or spoken to for over a

862
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,150
decade.

863
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,710
And the person recognized me and they're local here in Tucson.

864
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:44,970
And they said, hey, Greek, you know, I remember you sold me your motorcycle and all that.

865
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,570
And I said, yeah, yeah, I remember.

866
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:50,010
He says, tell the people how you get it, how you got the motorcycle to run on water.

867
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,290
Right.

868
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,050
And I'm like, oh, why?

869
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,630
You know, why do I have to do that?

870
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,530
I said, oh, yeah, that's right.

871
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,930
The one you got ran on water.

872
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:58,150
Right.

873
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,430
A regular combustion engine.

874
00:54:59,550 --> 00:54:59,690
Right.

875
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,630
So, you know, do you see me doing websites?

876
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,670
And hey, this is how we're going to get away from.

877
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,210
Right.

878
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:06,750
Do you see?

879
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,090
No, I don't talk about those things because this is not the place for it.

880
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,130
But it doesn't mean I won't make it for and make one and sell it to someone who needs a

881
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:14,570
motorcycle.

882
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,270
You see what I mean?

883
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,070
Yeah.

884
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,790
And like the blind guy who came to your couch and you made him see.

885
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,770
What are you, Jesus or something?

886
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,330
No, I don't go around saying that.

887
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:25,770
Right.

888
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,630
Yeah.

889
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:27,930
Because.

890
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:28,550
Yeah.

891
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:33,810
About the coming down, there has to be intricate reasons.

892
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,530
And I guess the most plausible one that you maintain is that we are a seed bank, which

893
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,550
also goes hand in hand with the theory that these many seeder races don't want us to be

894
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:50,370
fully sentient so as to not lose the rights for continuing to tinker with our DNA.

895
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,310
Would you say that's right?

896
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,830
It's more than DNA.

897
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:57,150
DNA is, are the tree rings in the tree the tree?

898
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,750
No, they just tell you about the tree, how old it is.

899
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,170
Do you know there's a guy, I think Lipton or someone else that did experiments with

900
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:05,750
protozoa.

901
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:09,210
He removed the DNA and they just multiplied and lived a normal life.

902
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:09,450
Right.

903
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,630
But after.

904
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:11,510
Yeah.

905
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,590
After a generation or two, they stopped, though.

906
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,750
So you really don't need DNA to be alive.

907
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,130
It's a it's overrated.

908
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,050
Anything that you see everybody pushing.

909
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,450
Sorry, go ahead.

910
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,150
Just so I can look at Lipton.

911
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,910
Yeah, you can put in Lipton genetic research like Lipton the G.

912
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,370
Yeah.

913
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,630
He did a bunch of research on how the DNA is over.

914
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,490
Look, the public does not speak the truth and the truth is not spoken to the public.

915
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,030
Right.

916
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,470
This has been going on for, like you said, 5000 years.

917
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,410
Part of the dumbing down.

918
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,550
So if you have three or four more people talking about something, it's probably BS, you know.

919
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:53,610
So you'll be you'll be amazed to see if you look online, for example, even like YouTube and all that.

920
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:58,670
If you see find a site that has five subscribers and 10 views, you know what?

921
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,330
And it's been around for years.

922
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,350
They probably have the truth.

923
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:07,530
If you see a site that has thousands and tens of thousands of subscribers and thousands of views.

924
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:14,650
Now, that's a very quick, broad brush way to see, because the people won't understand here.

925
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:21,190
One thing I always used to say, you know, how everyone describes the education system being completely in tatters.

926
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,370
Right. And it's all propaganda.

927
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:27,930
If you created an education system, real education, no one would go.

928
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:33,710
No one, because the minute they showed up, they won't understand anything you're saying at all.

929
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:40,750
It would be so different and so bizarre when they compare it to their family life and their culture that no one will go.

930
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,770
So it's a waste of time.

931
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:46,170
You see, ultimately, until everything changes.

932
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,170
But the dumbing down is more than the dumbing down.

933
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,750
It's the way we're set up from the beginning.

934
00:57:52,250 --> 00:58:00,750
Exactly. It shouldn't be looked at as a handicap, really, because we are the cosmic project of all these different species.

935
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:05,330
I mean, it sounds like opium, but and also they tried their best.

936
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:10,430
All these advanced cities like the great to fabricate the DNA for generations and they just fell.

937
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,750
So they still need this hybridization.

938
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:25,190
And apparently some of them even tried to shave off layers of our energy field just to get souls to draw themselves to their useless, you know, colon bodies.

939
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,550
Yes. And the shaving off is more like a governor.

940
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:37,610
Most people, I think someone recently communicated to me that more people are starting to talk about the synthetics that are here on Earth.

941
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,910
In other words, when you meet someone, they look like a human, smell like a human, talk like a human, and they're not human.

942
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,910
They're like a synthetic manifestation. Right.

943
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,310
So there is that exception.

944
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,850
I would say a good 20 to 30 percent of the human population is not human right now.

945
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,570
They're either synthetics or they're parasite, parasited.

946
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,130
And where do you find them?

947
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,570
Doctors, lawyers, governors.

948
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,710
I mean, government jobs, nurses, priests, rabbis, imams.

949
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:16,650
Right. That's where you find them because they typically go into they become being a synthetic and being a parasite and just sitting in the corner of a room or whatever doesn't really affect the society.

950
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:20,850
They they're placed cosmically in positions where they can influence others.

951
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,170
Right.

952
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:28,770
So and once you understand, I don't get into publicly how to do a witch hunt and how to privately.

953
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:34,230
I do talk to people about how to determine who's a synthetic or not with great accuracy.

954
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:37,770
And they kind of flip out when they start scanning the people around them.

955
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,590
But I will never do that publicly, at least at this point.

956
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:49,050
But if you just the notion is just as important right now as actually showing how who is a synthetic and who isn't.

957
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:59,950
But the rest that are left, there are things you can do to activate, you know, your potential up to, let's say, 10% human instead of 1% or 2%.

958
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:05,790
Right. And a lot of that has to do with things that I've been saying and some others and who the others are, I don't know.

959
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,270
But in other words, learning how things work.

960
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:17,530
Why is it that every time you go into a field, the quote unquote experts are telling you the opposite of what's been memorialized in their own books, for example.

961
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:26,010
Right. If you go to any religious person, what their leader, they're going to tell you the opposite of what's memorialized in the text that's supposed to subscribe to.

962
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:36,490
If you speak to a doctor who are expert liars, by the way, you will find that what they're telling you is contrary to what's memorialized in the text that they use as part of their field of study.

963
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,510
The same with attorneys and the same and so on and so on.

964
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,970
Okay, so start off there. Start off with see what's been memorialized.

965
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:49,830
And the reason why things are memorialized, meaning stored information, whether it's written on stone, paper or digital.

966
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:54,350
The reason why something is written down and held is because guess what?

967
01:00:54,790 --> 01:01:02,270
It's important and it's a courtesy to pass this information on to future people or current anyone who wants to reference it.

968
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:13,350
But instead, you have people that take on whatever jobs they do, let's say a bus driver or a painter or someone, a chef, and they want to learn about astrophysics or the human body.

969
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:25,710
They go and they listen to people that are supposedly experts in the field, but if they go a little further and look at the text that they're supposed to subscribe to, they'll find what's in the text is very different.

970
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:32,530
Because people don't want a home cooked meal that takes three hours to make. They want something out of a can that's reheated.

971
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:39,570
So when you're going to a quote unquote expert, that's what you're getting. You're getting a meal out of a can, which is not good for you eventually.

972
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:52,450
So until people start taking more time, and if let's say you're a chef and you want to learn about astrophysics, unfortunately, you're going to have to learn how to go through technical documents very quickly.

973
01:01:52,450 --> 01:02:03,290
I've also done talks on how if you gave me, let's say, a thousand page technical book, in six hours I can have an in-depth discussion with the author of that book.

974
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:06,490
Not because I read the entire thousand pages, I know how to go.

975
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:15,810
And I used to instruct people on how to go through massive amounts of academic and anything that's written and memorialized very quickly and get the main points out of it.

976
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:18,870
And you can condense it down to like 15 minutes.

977
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:28,910
But also, I think that that's the whole point of text in the first place, is to memorialize these things because of the nature of this grade of humanity.

978
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:38,010
In any event, so you also mentioned Noah's Ark, that it wasn't like we thought.

979
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:54,290
It was more of a goodwill gesture on the part of the humans, and the rest was really just a collection from the Elohim of the genetic material, and that they don't lose track of these things when they do get lost, so-called, in the cataclysm, right?

980
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,690
No, nothing is lost.

981
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,850
And let me just put this in perspective.

982
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,870
There's so many changes that happen.

983
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:04,170
Like, you know, for example, the cancel culture that they're talking about now.

984
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:11,410
If you find any old Greek sonic events from 10 years ago, I talked about the cancel culture in great detail before it hit now.

985
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:17,370
And the reason why I did is because the cancel culture was borrowed from the ancient world.

986
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:33,070
In other words, in ancient Egypt, if you became unpopular, what they did is they went and erased your name and memory from all records, even government records, where now if you went and tried to erase someone from government records, they would say, well, that's a criminal offense.

987
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,710
You know, you cannot do that.

988
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,830
But even then, they were that drastic.

989
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:54,030
So, where I'm leaning to that with Noah's Ark, if you read what they call the New Testament in the book of Shimon Kepha, or what they call Peter, you will see that he mentions in there, he mentions, I'm paraphrasing, that Noah's Ark was still a tourist attraction back then.

990
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,990
We're talking about 1900 years ago.

991
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:06,070
Just like you would have a tourist attraction now, like the Busaj Mountains, or the Grand Canyon, or the Niagara Falls, or some ruins like the pyramids are tourist attractions.

992
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,930
That's how, less than 2000 years ago, Noah's Ark was.

993
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,330
It was very well known where it was and what it was verified.

994
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:13,650
People would go there.

995
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,790
But now, oh my gosh, where is it?

996
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:16,650
Did it even exist?

997
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,350
What happened?

998
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:18,370
You see?

999
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:19,190
Yeah.

1000
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:42,910
And is it true that Babylon was a case of the, you know, the Incas or whatever branch of humanity getting too big for their own safety, and then these so-called gods, the Yazidis, having to, you know, quell them and leave the intermediary elites to just be the masters?

1001
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,850
Yes, very much.

1002
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,890
There are no gods as such.

1003
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:59,830
Just like if you were technologically advanced and went to a gullible, less technologically advanced, and you brought your devices, they might, and you told them they were a god, you may not convince everyone right away, but eventually you will, right?

1004
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,830
So the term god is a very corrupted term.

1005
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:08,190
It doesn't mean that the Elohim and others don't deserve, you know, the utmost respect.

1006
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:28,390
It's just that I don't see the term as being accurate, but not because, you know, you brought them up as gods, but I would suggest that the state of the past people were not much better if we're discussing the ones that are incarnated like us, one or two percent, you know.

1007
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:32,170
They weren't much better off, really.

1008
01:05:33,450 --> 01:06:01,830
Yeah, and apparently the first successful ones like Adam of humanity were on the part of these gods, in quotes, and that they were used to see these many other planets, which is why you find many human species, and that the mixture between the ones that were left alone, which are us, the more rudimentary, and the more advanced ones that were used to see planets,

1009
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,770
are the so-called demigods.

1010
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,170
Oh, I see.

1011
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:26,010
Yeah, the early ones, yes, most likely, because if you, let's say we look at the conventional Western theology, in the biblical text, you have Adam and his several generations, and then they're brought up as the men of renown, the men that were the heroes, like in the ancient Greece, it was on the age of the heroes, right, the men that did incredible things.

1012
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:30,290
But Adam was never classified as such, because he was kind of like the prototype.

1013
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,590
But before we continue on the human lineage, Zen, I want to just honor what your request was.

1014
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,870
Listen, this might seem cheesedick to you, Greek, but there's this one YouTube show that I always watch.

1015
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,450
It's called Nuke's Top Five, and I know it's all stuff that can be explainable.

1016
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:48,110
It's a paranormal channel, and I know it's not going to faze you.

1017
01:06:48,110 --> 01:07:15,650
Anyway, the thing is, is there's this, I call it because I lack so much knowledge, maybe a skinwalker or something, but many times people will catch what I deem as, and I want you to debunk, if not, or refine, you know, a skinwalker or a rake, and they're out screwing around in the forest late at night, and some young dumb kids, and they'll hear some extreme guttural, and I don't think these kids have the time or the technology to play with to make such a good fake.

1018
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,250
But I'm going to hit straight here.

1019
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:23,430
I'm going to let you watch maybe a 15-second clip, and I just want you to tell me, one, if it's real, if it is real, what is this?

1020
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,750
Is it something that – a species before humanity?

1021
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,030
Is it something the CIA released?

1022
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:29,610
Is this –

1023
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,570
Oh, you don't even have to.

1024
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,870
I think I'm familiar with it.

1025
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,090
Let me just make a quick roundabout on that.

1026
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:42,690
First of all, the stranger it is, whether it's a story, a video, or an experience account, probably the more true it is.

1027
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,930
If it sounds plausible, it's not true most likely.

1028
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,430
Okay?

1029
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:47,670
I know that sounds crazy.

1030
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:56,730
The other thing is it's a variety of things that something coming out of the ground most likely because things that come out of the sky are not visible or audible to us.

1031
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:00,670
So it's something coming out from a different density in the ground.

1032
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:06,390
Like if we look at the accounts, let's say, of the cloning centers, they have the Vril lizards there.

1033
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:10,570
There are many accounts of them, and also their ability to hybridize.

1034
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:18,569
There are also, like I mentioned earlier, advanced humans would attack other advanced humans because of very trivial reasons.

1035
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,890
Like they serve chocolate chip ice cream when we think that's no good.

1036
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:26,090
So let's capture them and hybridize them with pigs.

1037
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,529
That's how people are, by the way.

1038
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:28,670
They're that nasty, right?

1039
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,210
So you have still people on the surface – I don't like to call them government.

1040
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,890
By the way, you have no government, right?

1041
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,130
All the governments are bankrupt.

1042
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:42,990
So calling a bankrupt entity as a legitimate entity is not accurate, right?

1043
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:52,029
All of the governments are operating as administrations under the worldwide bankruptcy, right, under the World Economic Forum, the UN and all that, right?

1044
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:55,990
This is a fact, but it's something you don't talk about supposedly.

1045
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,970
Even alternative people don't like to talk about it, but it needs to be understood.

1046
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:06,450
So these people that can afford to do these things would be another way to say it, do these things.

1047
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,290
They're a major experimentation.

1048
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:11,450
Can we watch this little clip real quick?

1049
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:11,950
Go ahead.

1050
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:12,410
Sure.

1051
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,510
All right.

1052
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,470
I'm going to do a screen share.

1053
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:21,149
So this show is a paranormal show, and it's as close as I can get because I don't stay up late and I don't go explore.

1054
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:34,229
And it's a bunch of people that have no fear, go screw around in the forest or go walk miles through sewer systems to prove that there's no such thing as aliens or other sorts of beings.

1055
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:39,490
And then they see, I feel, they see real shit, get scared shitless and run away.

1056
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,109
And I simply want – like this one thing was just a quick example.

1057
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:50,069
It's some creature, the closest I can say in my naivete, it looks like the creature from Pan's Labyrinth.

1058
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:54,490
And I just wanted to know, is this some ancient species that just dwells underground?

1059
01:09:54,830 --> 01:10:00,970
But also, too, what blows my mind, Greg, is all these people go look for ghosts, look for rakes, look for all this stuff.

1060
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,550
They never have an AK-47.

1061
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,330
They never have backup flashlights and all this kind of stuff.

1062
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,530
If I saw that, yeah, I'm going to be scared.

1063
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:13,550
I want to shoot it, bring it – haul its ass out and bring it to the light and say, look, this shit really exists.

1064
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,010
That's what blows my mind.

1065
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,190
I want to show people.

1066
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:17,910
Yeah, OK.

1067
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,090
I did see what you're saying.

1068
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:20,990
I don't know.

1069
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,650
It's kind of vague as well.

1070
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:30,150
But at this point, I would suggest that the second part of what you said, you want to try to convince people.

1071
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,530
Don't bother.

1072
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,410
Well, they could argue.

1073
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,670
They could even have an argument.

1074
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,370
If I had some weird skin –

1075
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,650
It doesn't matter.

1076
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:38,310
No evidence.

1077
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:44,170
One thing, if you've – on the past Sonic events with Ocelli and all that, I kept saying towards the later part of the –

1078
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:51,050
I kept saying no level of evidence or truth or whatever will change the ideology and the culture that you're in.

1079
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:59,730
As a matter of fact, evidence means nothing, right, with these people here and the synthetics and the parasited ones and the whatever.

1080
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,170
Evidence means nothing.

1081
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:12,090
Like for example, if you hijacked all of the mainstream TV and gave people the truth about anything, the average person would go, oh, man, that's so weird.

1082
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,090
But it's cool.

1083
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:18,430
And the more educated academic will say, well, that's a novel way to look at it.

1084
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:23,630
And then like right after it's all done, a minute later, no less than a minute later, they go right back to what they're doing.

1085
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,010
You know why?

1086
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:30,090
Because you can't take a pig to a debutante ball until people get the pig genes.

1087
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,230
You know what I mean?

1088
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,930
Not that they're really pigs, but yeah.

1089
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,490
So you get that out of their system, which is what's coming.

1090
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:38,010
The templates are going to be changing.

1091
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,590
You're right.

1092
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,130
Yeah, I appreciate it.

1093
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:45,770
I know it seems like a dumbed down point compared to the sophisticated stuff you and Daniel were talking about earlier.

1094
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,310
I just I watched the show.

1095
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,630
It's not sophisticated at all.

1096
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,470
Sorry, it's not.

1097
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,590
It's the basics that we should have learned when we were as children.

1098
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:54,350
Let me give you an example.

1099
01:11:54,510 --> 01:12:05,610
On other worlds, there are eight year olds that have the equivalent of four graduate degrees by the time they're eight and four or five different subjects at the top of their field by the time they're eight years old.

1100
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:06,550
Right.

1101
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:07,870
What are some of these planets?

1102
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,890
This is where are these places?

1103
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,430
That was one.

1104
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,130
Oh, they're everywhere.

1105
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,710
There's there's a look.

1106
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:14,770
What is that formula, Daniel?

1107
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,010
The possibility of planets?

1108
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:17,730
What's it called?

1109
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:21,730
The how many stars there are times how many planets times how many?

1110
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,750
Anyway, they're everywhere.

1111
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,410
You know, there is one name of something I could start researching or.

1112
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,250
Oh, no.

1113
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,770
It's very difficult to research because everything is about opinion.

1114
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:42,110
These days, he said, she said, and experiencers that couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instruction on the heel.

1115
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,750
So you're just going to have to wait.

1116
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,650
You're not going to have to wait much longer, really.

1117
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:48,570
I mean, you're fairly young within within a decade.

1118
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:49,930
Your answer will come.

1119
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:58,970
OK, the main thing with many things that I say, actually, I try not actually most things that I do say I give a reference point on the real reason and logic.

1120
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,890
But just by saying, hey, like shaking up someone like, wake up, look at this.

1121
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:03,950
What do you see right away?

1122
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:04,790
Start from that.

1123
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:13,370
Many of the things that I might begin to say here and now, it's not I may not give references, but what's important is that you heard it.

1124
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,250
Did you acknowledge what I said?

1125
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,370
Do you understand what I said?

1126
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:20,390
File it away for a little bit time more in the future where it'll make more sense.

1127
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,870
I think that is more helpful.

1128
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,330
That's why I'm always taken.

1129
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:24,530
I mean, that's all this.

1130
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:31,510
Yeah, like I like using I used to like using the Kennedy assassination as an example.

1131
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:34,870
And I like to use the 9-11 as an example.

1132
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:40,330
Also, anything else, even what happened the past two years with the pandemic as an example.

1133
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:51,350
If you look at what's being put in front of the people, it seems like the formula is the dumber you make it and the more obviously false that you make it, the more people will believe it.

1134
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:52,750
It seems to be.

1135
01:13:53,490 --> 01:14:00,090
And what's really going on is so basic that the children should be able to see it like the emperor has no clothes.

1136
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,330
Right.

1137
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:03,810
So I've talked about this as we're going to the future.

1138
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,670
It'll be even dumber and even more blatantly ridiculous.

1139
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,050
But the people will believe it.

1140
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:12,630
Well, with the help of the synthetics and the parasites pushing it down their throat.

1141
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,190
Right.

1142
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,490
That's the thing.

1143
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,570
That's that's my whole qualm.

1144
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,610
You know, that's what makes me so sick.

1145
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:18,910
Yes.

1146
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:25,070
I want to learn, you know, just how to live forever and anti aging and all these things that should have been taught to us.

1147
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:30,930
But the fact like I was in seventh grade when I saw 9-11 go down and it just I was just like, this is fake.

1148
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,810
This is not right.

1149
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,650
Or at least I wasn't.

1150
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,390
I mean, it's happening, but I'm not buying the story.

1151
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:41,990
The discussions that I can have on it, which I said I would never do, is so funny on 9-11 here.

1152
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,570
Let me just interject one thing.

1153
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,890
The guys that they sent to admit it was a NATO operation.

1154
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:50,350
But OK, so they even have it in their own paperwork.

1155
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,050
But and it's listed under an insurance fraud.

1156
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,930
But it is so funny.

1157
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:58,910
The discussions compared to what people see that it's laughable.

1158
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:59,790
Give me an example.

1159
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:07,390
When they executed what they did in New York City that day, they obviously sent like half of the people were knew what they were doing.

1160
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,010
The other half were a bunch of Muppets.

1161
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:09,910
OK.

1162
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:18,410
In other words, going from north to south, the buildings involved were north would be building seven.

1163
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,010
And then just south of that is the North Tower.

1164
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,950
And just south of that is the South Tower.

1165
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,950
The nuclear devices that are put in there, they're called atomic gates.

1166
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:29,970
For example, this is very well known since the 1950s.

1167
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:38,050
The Golden Gate Bridge, the Verrazano Bridge, the main tunnels, the main roadways and the main monuments in this country are rigged to blow with nukes.

1168
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,250
If their country is invaded, this is very typical tactics.

1169
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:46,750
If your country is being invaded, you blow your own bridges so the enemy can't use them.

1170
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,170
Right. It's very, very common.

1171
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,270
Also for safety concerns.

1172
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:53,110
OK, so this is what they screwed up on 9-11.

1173
01:15:53,730 --> 01:16:00,330
The tunnels that are underneath, by the way, the World Trade Center and many other buildings, the devices are not placed under the buildings.

1174
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,310
They have to be maintained.

1175
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,870
They're lithium hydrogen charges.

1176
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,170
They have to be maintained.

1177
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:08,010
The health of the zero box and the core has to be maintained by technicians.

1178
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:13,850
It's usually done in a building outside and it's delivered to the building a time of demolition underground.

1179
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:21,290
We're talking about 300 feet underground during the time of, you know, the prescribed time of when these things are going to be activated or detonated.

1180
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,710
So Building 7 was where they maintain these things.

1181
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:30,530
So what they did is they blew out the side of the building of the North Tower first, which was a screw up.

1182
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:43,330
They should have because if you notice that when the buildings went down, the tower that got hit with the plane second came down first, where it really should have been the one that got hit with the plane first came down first.

1183
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,170
Right. Because they said it was due to fire. Right.

1184
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:50,050
So you had the North Tower gets hit with the plane first and then the South Tower gets hit with the plane second.

1185
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:53,950
But they bring down the one that got hit with the plane last first.

1186
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,050
Why? It doesn't make any sense if it's fire because the fire has to burn longer.

1187
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,830
Right. Well, that was the screw up.

1188
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:01,030
They should have exploded. There was no planes.

1189
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:04,670
What they did was they lined up plane parts on the 78th floor.

1190
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,850
So when they blew out the side of the building, those plane parts came out with it.

1191
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:12,130
But anyway, these Muppets, they blew the wrong building first.

1192
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:21,210
And the reason why they had to take away the one that got hit with the plane second down first is because if they took down the one that got hit with the plane first, sounds confusing.

1193
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,970
Right. It could have damaged the tunnel to the other building that was further away than they couldn't bring that one down.

1194
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:29,350
Right. So they had to do this really stupid thing.

1195
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:36,070
Now, the second tower that came down, which is closer to Building 7, is after the first one was brought down.

1196
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:41,490
The Muppets that were sent to deliver the device is a tunnel and you wheel it down and it's by wire.

1197
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:47,550
It's a it's a DBW detonator. Anyway, we're wheeling it down to the second building.

1198
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:54,150
But already the one that the South Tower that was already taken down, the reaction was starting to creep over to the foundation of this building.

1199
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:57,990
And they're like, holy shit, their teeth must have fallen out and their hair must have fallen out.

1200
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:04,150
And they got scared. So they didn't put the second device, ZeroBox, directly under the center of the building.

1201
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:10,610
So when you see the buildings from aerial view, you'll see that the first one was completely dissolved from the center out.

1202
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:18,730
But the second one, the corner of the building, still managed to stay because they didn't wheel the device all the way down where they were supposed to because it was too hot.

1203
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:25,810
Right. So this is this is the things that I see when I look at these things, the obvious flaws.

1204
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:34,890
Right. And then obviously, Building 7 was also taken down with the same device, because if they didn't, the government, people in the government didn't know this was going on.

1205
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:44,810
This is done by people who are much higher. For example, the Port Authority, that is the authority of that whole part of Manhattan Island, is a sovereign corporation.

1206
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:50,750
You could look this up. The feds have no jurisdiction there. The state has no jurisdiction there. Nobody is the Port Authority.

1207
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:57,490
Most of these large complexes in big cities have their own little district that's like a country unto itself, like the Vatican.

1208
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:04,850
OK. All right. So anyway, when the investigators, if they didn't take down Building 7 the same way, the investigators would go there and they don't.

1209
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:14,910
Look, if you're setting off nuclear demolition in a major city, 150 kiloton devices, you don't want to leave the control room so somebody's mom can find it. Right.

1210
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:23,450
You get it. So anyway, I see all the flaws and the mistakes that they made that day because I know about the what they did in great detail.

1211
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,570
And, you know, and that's the world that I'm in. Look how they screwed this up.

1212
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:33,250
But they still got it done because obviously they sent morons to do it. Most of them were morons, at least.

1213
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:39,510
But most people are still arguing whether it was a satellite thing or explosives put on each floor, which is impossible.

1214
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:47,890
I mean, this is like so the reason I said this whole thing about 9-11 is like Daniel brought up talking about pandemics and how it really works.

1215
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:57,250
You really want to get into how diseases work and how you maintain human health in the body when the people are still just wondering about the most ridiculous stuff you can imagine.

1216
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:04,170
They can't even see what's in front of them at all. I mean, the people meaning, yes, even on the alternative. You see what I mean?

1217
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,130
Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

1218
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:17,650
Yeah, you can't. This is not what's going on. Here's the thing. I always give a soliloquy about this. If half of the world, half of the people in the world helped one person.

1219
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:27,750
That's the whole world is taken care of. Right. So if one third of the world helped two people, that's the whole world taken care of. Right.

1220
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:40,090
So if one person helps nine people, oh, you know, if only 10% of the people each help nine people, that takes care of the whole world. But you see, there's a point where the numbers get so small that so few people can only do so much.

1221
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:56,190
Right. But I know that from ancient writings, ancient philosophies, intuition and all that, if you come to this existence, this world, this society, whatever society you in, and you can help one person to make their life better.

1222
01:20:56,190 --> 01:21:08,050
Just one, not half the people helping one, but just one person helping one other person. That's quite an accomplishment. Right. Like in the biblical text says one of the highest things a human can do is die for their friend.

1223
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:14,330
Well, it doesn't really say that directly die for the friend means you would go through anything it takes just to make someone else better.

1224
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:17,110
Okay, or continue with their life.

1225
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:26,510
So if you can do a sonic event where you show people things and tell people things that will make the change in their life I've gotten over 2000 emails in the past few years.

1226
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:37,530
Since I've listened to you Greek I know how to eat better think better fix things better. My relationships got better over 2000 emails like that. You see, and I'm not even trying.

1227
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:47,930
I don't put together I don't write books people say Greek you need to write a book I said okay, if you're an author and you want to write a book, you're presuming that whoever reads that book has comprehension right.

1228
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,050
Otherwise it's a waste of time.

1229
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,750
That and your book would get banned, just be more negative attention.

1230
01:21:53,750 --> 01:22:03,850
It would be foolish to do it because because I would presume that whoever's reading it has actually understanding what is being written. And that's a that's a bad presumption because you can't meet everyone.

1231
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:14,530
In other words, if I were to write a book and give it out, I would have to send them a test first, maybe 20 or 30 questions and if depending on how they answered those questions then I would sell them the book.

1232
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:17,610
Otherwise it's a waste of their time and a waste of my time.

1233
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:40,850
The same thing was I believe like when people are young as in this society they should have all their internal reproductive organs plugged up and when they want to have a baby they go to an authority, and they have to take certain burial cognitive tests psychological tests mental tests and the once they pass all those things then you open up the reproductive organ so they could reproduce that would be the responsible way to do it.

1234
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,430
Meeting a level of standards. Yes. Yeah.

1235
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:54,750
Because why is it that the not only the ugliest poorest and dumbest people are wheeling around 15 or 20 children or six children, and the people that are really trying to get their stuff together have no children.

1236
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,370
Right, right.

1237
01:22:56,710 --> 01:23:09,890
I find that it's useless to try as well with people they have to come halfway because, like you say most of them are cosmically censored so, but, yes, it's the cosmic censorship that's why why bother don't do anything.

1238
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:16,190
In other words, and in a large scale cultural skill you do it for yourself your people that are close to you it doesn't mean your family.

1239
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:26,690
Right, because your family sometimes is your biggest enemy, and on a high when you go to higher level things, because the concept of the family is a social, whatever culture you're in right.

1240
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:43,910
And like, and yeah, I can also earlier mentioned remote viewing and I know you have some experience with this and would you be able to go over just how effective it is and what are its limitations.

1241
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,570
Okay, very good.

1242
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:52,890
There's a big psyop called control remote viewing you see all these ex military people and all that right.

1243
01:23:53,530 --> 01:24:00,450
And no one goes against them because it works on a general wherever and the reason why it's a psyop is because they could never offer any explanations.

1244
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:12,530
Just like when you go to an alternative doctor you know they're going to try to say take my supplement because it's absorbed better you like oh my gosh, at least they're not promoting the mainstream stuff but they're just as bad.

1245
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:30,650
Let me just say when you remote view what it is, is you're tapping into that 10% human, or you know that you're not you don't want to work with the 1% or 2% human that you are that you know you've been bred to be here by the gods, let's say, you want to tap into the other one.

1246
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:40,450
Further on, and you can do that momentarily only for a very small fraction so when someone does whether it's the controlled remote viewing or any kind of guesswork.

1247
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:50,810
The real information the best information appears in less than a 10th of a second or less than a second. It's your first hunch but it, and you have to exercise it like a muscle.

1248
01:24:51,450 --> 01:25:06,330
Right, give you an example there was a small remote viewing video, guess what's in the bag and they show a one of these cooler bags and I just soon as I read the title I looked at it and I got a vision of something that looked like a banana large and yellow.

1249
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:10,650
So then I went to the end of the video and it was a large yellow highlight marker.

1250
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:27,970
Okay, but if I started saying well it is it a banana, maybe it makes sense it's this way no no, it's all I got was something large and yellow and that was close enough so in that when you start working on this, picking up a momentary bits of information down to nanoseconds

1251
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:39,830
people that are practicing for a long time, just like a Tai Chi or Kung Fu master can take a knife or a gun from your hand with a, if you pointed out them so fast that you won't even know it happened right.

1252
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:47,290
That's how you do it so the way the remote viewing works is when you look at something and your remote everyone is doing this anyway.

1253
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:52,050
It just happens the information comes so quickly that you miss it.

1254
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:57,050
So you must train to capture very rapid fire bits of information.

1255
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:04,090
Some people it's visual, some people it's audible, some people it's other sensory you know could be taste, smell, feeling.

1256
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:13,610
So you have to know what you are tuned into the most and learn how to capture split second impulses of input when you're presented with the thought.

1257
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,990
That's the essence of remote viewing.

1258
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:22,570
And does it have to be blind or double blind or what would you say is the best protocol?

1259
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:34,210
The reason they do the blind and the double blind they say is best, that's why I say it's a PSYOP when they say you can only do it that way, is because it removes you from what you're casually used to.

1260
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:36,690
It doesn't have to be blind at all.

1261
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:50,970
But it's best to do that because it removes you from what you are casually used to doing and thinking, because you have an inner dialogue with yourself, which has its own personality, like some people project a different personality from what they really are.

1262
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,930
A lot of people do that right.

1263
01:26:53,370 --> 01:27:02,150
They have one personality that they adjust their personality for their family life they adjust their personality for their work life or when they go to the bar, or whatever.

1264
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,730
Or picking up a prostitute, right?

1265
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:06,510
No, I'm serious.

1266
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:17,930
A priest, for example, will have a certain personality that he exudes when he's at the church and the congregation, a different one when he's with the clergy, the people that work for him, and a different one when he's picking up a prostitute.

1267
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:18,870
Right.

1268
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:32,450
And would you agree that if you have many people concentrated on the same target that that will certify, I mean, will add some validation to your results collectively?

1269
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,250
I find it very underrated.

1270
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,650
Yes, it's underrated and correct.

1271
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:45,350
I'll show you a metaphor and how that's so correct is because when you have one flash that's like looking at one frame of a piece of film.

1272
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:52,650
When you have 16 people getting those flashes now it's like 16 frames and if you get thousands of people you're actually making a movie now.

1273
01:27:53,290 --> 01:28:00,650
You have so many pieces that you have this large mosaic, you can call it a mosaic or you can call it a film, like a reel of film.

1274
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:21,270
Yeah, and it changes some of the group might get some of the other group might get other part of it but when you can come all together the thing is if you can communicate and bring it together coherently, of course, then you then you know what there's nothing you cannot do, just like in the Bible says, if we let them build this tower when they come together there is nothing that they will not be able to do.

1275
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:21,890
Right.

1276
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:28,610
That's the main thing that's why how many times everything political everything religious academic is to separate everyone.

1277
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:52,030
I, I think I rubbed Zen, the wrong way we had some early conversations and I said you, everybody needs to come together almost with a hive mind with the same mind, because then the collective mind is not because you're all a bunch of drones, but that collective mind will be like this gigantic reservoir that you can all tap into.

1278
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:57,650
Once you put all of your differences aside and I remember Zen said, Huh, that doesn't sound good.

1279
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,650
I was like, Well, you got to think about it.

1280
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:17,310
Yeah, no bad things about it before you know prior but really proves true so I mean, yeah, it's it's a matter of when everyone puts all their differences down because they're not real low, keep what if it's if you have something that's distinctive critically distinctive and different hold on to it.

1281
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:23,250
But if you start examining everything you'll notice that we all can come together with all in one thought in one mind.

1282
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:31,830
And not because we all are robotic drones mindless know what that will do is will create a reservoir and ethereal reservoir that we all can tap into.

1283
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:47,910
Yep. And regarding the malleability of the predictions derived from remote viewing, what would you say is the number of possibilities when you're looking in the past versus the present of the future?

1284
01:29:49,230 --> 01:30:01,730
Yeah, you're gonna have to put that together somehow I mean that you but the more you go into the past you're actually going closer to the future, and the more you go into the future, the more you're going to the actual past.

1285
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:10,730
I know I've said this before and people say I have to think about what you said, because each universe has a template, and there's a level of pre determinancy.

1286
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:26,970
There's local events, whether it's a cultural or personal that you have what seems random Yes, you know, there's a template that you're going to eat lunch every day, but it doesn't say that every day it's going to be tuna fish or ham sandwich right you have might have a little leeway in that right.

1287
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:36,550
But there's the template everyone will eat lunch that day you know is what I'm talking about. So the template for everyone's life culture world or whatever has already been set.

1288
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:50,210
And once the blueprint is written then it's put into manifestation so once the blueprint for a building is finished by the architects, then they go out into the field and you'll see there's nothing in the field they bring the bulldozers and they start building and a few months later it's done.

1289
01:30:51,030 --> 01:31:03,910
When you go look at when the building first started that's when the blueprint was more new. And when you look at when the building was finished more into the future that's when the blueprint was more old, more towards the end.

1290
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:18,710
So when we go into our past we're actually going into the beginning of that blueprint time which is actually more into the future. And as we go into our future we're going towards the end of the plan which is more into the past of you took longer to plan you see.

1291
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:23,670
So once you understand that loop. It's not a loop once you understand that structure.

1292
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:29,670
You can call it a circle within a circle, or various geometric forms within geometric forms.

1293
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:33,130
Start to remote view it that way and watch what happens.

1294
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:46,610
Right. Instead of asking let's see the future. Let's see what the template, how the template ended up, which you translate what I just said how the template ended up, it means our future.

1295
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:51,970
If you start remote viewing it from that perspective, you will have like 99% accuracy.

1296
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:53,350
Yeah.

1297
01:31:54,290 --> 01:32:00,070
And when you're remote viewing, and you're doing it by do not front loading or using your bias, whatever.

1298
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:09,110
Would you say that you're tapping into the Akashic field, or is it more of an informational exchange between the viewer and the target.

1299
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:16,850
Okay, the Akashic field is another it's another thing like when you hear about the Draco very little information usually not true.

1300
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:27,170
The Akashic field is a resonant point, by the way here, let me let this out. It's been said by others I'm trying to think who else, long time ago.

1301
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:33,670
From a material if you can't bring something down to nuts and bolts to a certain point even consciousness.

1302
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:38,850
It's very difficult to handle it right because then becomes opinion or theory.

1303
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:53,350
The Akashic record is actually held in the in a material way in the noble gases, the gases that like neon helium argon xenon that do not combine with other elements very easily at all.

1304
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,190
They're called noble elements.

1305
01:32:55,810 --> 01:33:04,570
They are the substantive record resonant physical record of the Akasha in other words, that's why they do not combine with other substances.

1306
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:19,770
That is the material substantive part just like we were talking about everything about the brain has already been mapped but we're not being told right, they know everything about the brain and the spirit and teleportation and everything is already been established by humans, less than 100 years ago.

1307
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,270
And we talked about the Akasha.

1308
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:33,950
There's many ways, there's one way that we relate to our environment with these noble elements and their effect and how you know we're breathing some of them, and how they always exist in a resonant point, and they're influencing us.

1309
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:43,850
Or do you have to go to another set another higher density let's say of Akasha where there are other beings that are actually managing them because that also exists.

1310
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:48,250
And that makes it complicated and I don't know enough about that to talk about it.

1311
01:33:48,730 --> 01:34:00,350
But I do know that I would consider that people should start considering that the elements that are considered noble or inert are where the physical Akasha, you know, are held.

1312
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:08,990
In other words, just how you have these people that do crystal therapy and organite therapy, you know, take the crystal, put it on your forehead, it's going to make you through osmosis somehow better.

1313
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:22,030
If you get some people that are really crafty and smart and understand a lot of the stuff myself and others might have talked about in the past, and you know how to work with these noble gases, you're going to get a lot more out of what people talk about the Akasha in a physical sense.

1314
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,370
Right.

1315
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:50,210
And to bring kids more together with the collective remote viewing and with the previous topics discussed like the Draco and such, the main, you know, conclusion, the recurring theme in the remote viewing performed by Farsight on the Galactic Federation was that, which is, you know, such a loaded term, but was that they're up against a force that is greater than them.

1316
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:53,010
And they're trying to gain freedom through power.

1317
01:34:53,110 --> 01:35:05,530
But just the fact that they acknowledge that it's a greater force, I thought, lent confirmation to the idea that you can never really, you know, overcome the Draco entirely, maybe on a small sector of the galaxy, but that's about it.

1318
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:07,670
No, you're not going to overcome.

1319
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:17,190
By the way, everybody cover their ears when you said Farsight, you picked one of the worst organizations possible in the world for remote viewing.

1320
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,230
Sorry to say that.

1321
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,310
That's why they're so popular, right?

1322
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,090
But anyway, you can uncover your ears now.

1323
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:31,210
No, nothing like that is going to happen ever, ever in the ever that people understand as being ever or forever or whatever.

1324
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:32,130
No.

1325
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:33,190
Right.

1326
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:34,390
No, there's no overcoming.

1327
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:44,170
Like, for example, the reason you think you might have a victory or liberation from them is because they gave it to you.

1328
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:48,630
It's kind of like the guy who says, I'm the boss of the house.

1329
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,710
How is that?

1330
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,290
He says, well, because my wife said so.

1331
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,090
You get it?

1332
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:54,890
Yeah.

1333
01:35:54,890 --> 01:36:08,410
And you also brought up dinosaurs and the fact that the vegetation, like the ferns and that themselves, the dinosaurs were so much taller compared to what we have on the surface today.

1334
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:20,130
Would you say that also, if you take into account the ages of the crust, that the is just a hypothesis, but that during the age of the dinosaurs, the planet was much, much smaller in diameter.

1335
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:21,030
Yes.

1336
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:21,490
Yes.

1337
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:22,610
And it was more egg shaped.

1338
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:28,670
In other words, it was very pointy at the ends and oblong on one hemisphere and pointy on the other, just like an egg.

1339
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:32,710
If you, by the way, I'm not a proponent of continental drift.

1340
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:33,510
No.

1341
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:43,890
But if you get a bunch of eight year olds that have a lot to do, go out and buy some cheap printable maps and have them cut all the land areas out and then have them get some tape and piece all the land masses together.

1342
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,950
Guess what it's going to look like?

1343
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,410
An egg.

1344
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:47,730
Right.

1345
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:49,170
And expand it slightly.

1346
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,810
It looks like a fat egg or a potato.

1347
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:55,710
I have some potato, beautiful potatoes here, russets, and they're kind of like egg shaped.

1348
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:59,930
They're pointy on one end and really round on the other, but lumpy across the surface.

1349
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,690
Big lumps, flat spots.

1350
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:06,170
There are some places on some continents that are extremely flat and sunken.

1351
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:11,790
Yes, they don't conform at all to anything round by any means.

1352
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:19,550
It shows you that the, there's a vibrational energy field that makes matter matter solid, that has to be, when that's taken into account.

1353
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:30,350
When you look at these very distorted fields, areas, physical areas on the Earth, it's beaten up because the material is distorted, but the energy that is holding them together has a certain tendency to make it look like that, right?

1354
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:32,250
The energy comes first.

1355
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:37,970
But the dinosaurs are very interesting because I brought up the concept of meteors and asteroids.

1356
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:49,030
If they are magnetic, as they say, predominantly, because you don't have to be completely ferromagnetic, you could be boron and other things are slightly ferromagnetic, but they do tout that they are magnetic.

1357
01:37:49,030 --> 01:38:03,510
If you have a small magnet approaching a large magnet, regardless if they're spinning or not, they're only going to make contact at the poles, which makes that all natural asteroid and meteorite natural impacts on the Earth happen only at the North Pole and South Pole.

1358
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:07,210
So if you see, yeah, above 80th parallel, let's say, right?

1359
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:08,490
Above the 80, let's say.

1360
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,130
The one on Jupiter.

1361
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:11,290
Yes.

1362
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:20,770
So if you see like a big hole in Arizona or a big hole in Yucatan in Mexico near the equator, those were not natural.

1363
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,170
Those were weapon systems.

1364
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:33,890
But there are those who say that, oh, sorry, that the pole flipping isn't limited to, you know, 180, but it also goes like 90 degrees.

1365
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:39,830
And maybe some would claim that that's the explanation for Yucatan, but it wasn't a weapon.

1366
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:49,370
Well, it could have been, well, one of the Yucatan eventually would be found out that it was a weapon, but the people that threw it down, the humanoids type don't longer exist, they were punished for doing that.

1367
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,430
But that's another story.

1368
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:58,350
There are many races of humans that have come and gone, by the way, I think you mentioned that in the cinema books as well.

1369
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:01,670
Is the Olmec considered one of them? And what about Roanoke?

1370
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:09,490
No, no, I'm talking about, oh, Roanoke is another thing. Roanoke would be like Scythians that came over here a thousand years before everyone else.

1371
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:13,170
But that didn't like, you know, what was going on.

1372
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:21,250
The US, in other words, you know about the ancient Egyptian ruins found here and in Australia, meaning North America, right?

1373
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:22,210
Yeah.

1374
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,890
The whole world's always been populated by everyone.

1375
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:28,350
Babylonian, every culture.

1376
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:31,250
Everyone has been everywhere all the time, don't believe.

1377
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:37,350
You're taking your information from people who had black people in the Bronx Zoo in 1902.

1378
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,190
Okay, if you don't believe that, go look it up.

1379
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:52,390
People are getting their history information from a group of secret society, whatever, secret culture, academics, or wealthy people, oligarchs that actually had black people in zoos up until 1902.

1380
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,450
I know it sounds kind of shocking, but you could look it up.

1381
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:58,170
In the Bronx Zoo, New York City.

1382
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,470
This is where you're getting your information from.

1383
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:03,210
You know, the conventional thought, right?

1384
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:11,510
Yeah, Greg, we started talking about the egg shape of the earth-bearing dinosaurs, and we started talking about poles, or y'all did.

1385
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:13,750
It brings me to Admiral Byrd.

1386
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:15,210
If you could give a little spiel on him.

1387
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:20,850
Don't have much of a spiel on him, but this is what I do know.

1388
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:27,290
Again, if it's in the public, there are more than five people that are talking about Admiral Byrd.

1389
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,330
Yes, that means there's a lot of it that's not true.

1390
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:33,730
I'm being facetious here, but you know what I mean.

1391
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:38,570
Because it's the most popular story, it's the one that should be the least looked at.

1392
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:43,870
There are many other instances like Admiral Byrd, many, many.

1393
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:50,930
And apparently even his journal was heavily doctored by this coming from a first-hand account.

1394
01:40:51,250 --> 01:41:00,490
But yeah, about the Yucatan, apparently that was the same period as the destruction of Tiamat.

1395
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:09,210
Around the time of the specific sect of the Assyrians, the progenitors of who they are today, so they're a little different.

1396
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:18,130
But they were using their mothership, and they saw it as a good opportunity to remove the dust around the Earth.

1397
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:22,390
And to upgrade, uplift the DNA of the beings on Earth.

1398
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:26,830
And then they put the moon in orbit, and that's why it's always facing the Earth.

1399
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:32,470
So it's in tidal lock, so it can infuse the frequencies.

1400
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:39,610
And apparently the craters on it are also – the timing of it was also very crucial.

1401
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:45,510
Because in addition to the dust, it attracted all the debris and fragments of Tiamat.

1402
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:52,770
And I was wondering if you have – because there are so many – but if you have a theory of what caused the destruction.

1403
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:54,990
Because it was a block in the Romanian series.

1404
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:59,890
From a pretty good source, I hate to say, it's David Lauer, the channeler of KALASC.

1405
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:03,190
I have tested that.

1406
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:07,590
You know, if you read the Bible, it says it's okay if spirits come to you, but you have to test them.

1407
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:13,870
You know, like outside of the Christian religion, whatever, like that, it's okay to talk to spirits and entities.

1408
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,810
But they have to be – they can't be deceiving ones.

1409
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,930
You have to test them, right?

1410
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:21,710
You know, this goes against the Judeo-Christian whatever.

1411
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:22,950
You shouldn't talk to anything, right?

1412
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,510
Well, what do you think the prophets were doing?

1413
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:26,870
They were channeling, you know, the Elohim, right?

1414
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:27,650
Yeah.

1415
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:31,850
So, I've tested the David Lauer's KALASC stuff, and it's on the point.

1416
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:34,650
And one of them was because of 9-11, by the way.

1417
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:40,070
He asked a guy – he says, I like to troll the 9-11 truthers because they're full of shit.

1418
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:41,390
The government story is true.

1419
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,110
What do you say?

1420
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:44,130
And he says, no, it was a nuclear explosion.

1421
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:44,790
I said, that's it.

1422
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,010
That's it.

1423
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,330
Because they know.

1424
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:50,330
And other things as well, you know, things out of the Bible or whatever.

1425
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:56,470
So, the version from KALASC is that a human collective, like Syrian,

1426
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:04,250
they were dragging a planet into the solar system from another solar system

1427
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:09,890
using a combination of what you call a tractor beam and teleportation.

1428
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:16,250
Imagine a train moving on its tracks, and then it disappears for 10 miles and then shows up.

1429
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:18,950
So, instead of doing the full 100, let's say, kilometers,

1430
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:23,230
it's teleported for 50 kilometers and rides on the tracks for 50 kilometers.

1431
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:24,810
Imagine that kind of movement, right?

1432
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:25,730
Kind of crazy, right?

1433
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:31,750
But anyway, when they brought this planet in, they miscalculated and it hit Tiamat.

1434
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:36,930
So, all the talk about Tiamat or Maldek, they're leaving out the planet that hit it.

1435
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,970
So, there was two planets involved.

1436
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,990
But everybody's only talking about one, and they were both destroyed.

1437
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:48,130
And the planet that hit Tiamat or Maldek was larger, right?

1438
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:50,970
And it created a solar system and knocked all the planets out.

1439
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:56,150
As a matter of fact, one of the residents of our solar system didn't get stabilized

1440
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:59,410
until about 3,000 years ago, right?

1441
01:43:59,830 --> 01:44:02,170
Where Mars used to come very close to Earth,

1442
01:44:02,230 --> 01:44:05,630
where you can actually see the surface of Mars like you see the surface of the Moon.

1443
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:11,830
If you read, for example, Gulliver's Travels, in the fictional story in the 1700s,

1444
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:16,170
the Lillipuglians give an accurate description of what the moons of Mars,

1445
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:19,750
Phobos and Deimos, look like, actually the surface of them look like.

1446
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:23,530
But technically, they were not discovered until 100 years later,

1447
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:27,870
and not until 100 years after that were they able to observe the surface scientifically.

1448
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:33,770
So, how did the author of Gulliver's Travels describe the actual surface

1449
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:35,930
of the moons of Mars in great detail?

1450
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:37,310
You see?

1451
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:39,990
Because this was actually known.

1452
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:42,470
It's being information that's being held.

1453
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:45,150
People talk about, for example, the Vatican Library.

1454
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:48,810
There's libraries in the Middle East all over the place and in Asia

1455
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:53,950
that are a parody with the Vatican Library, but no one talks about them.

1456
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:58,390
So, like for example, in the Los Alamos Public Library,

1457
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,610
they do this as a joke or whatever.

1458
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:02,650
Every 15 or 20 years for six months,

1459
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:06,410
they put out all the blueprints for all the nuclear bombs that were ever made

1460
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:07,330
in the library.

1461
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:08,650
You can go and look at it.

1462
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:09,810
Then they take them away.

1463
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:11,170
Did you know this?

1464
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:11,950
No.

1465
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,030
Yeah, it's kind of a joke.

1466
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:17,750
So, okay, so with Tiamat, there was two planets involved,

1467
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:21,790
and when that planet was brought in, there was a miscalculation,

1468
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:25,070
and it wasn't meant to collide, but it did.

1469
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:29,090
At the time, there was a lot of contention between the Draco

1470
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:34,150
and the human collective about who is going – how the solar system will be run.

1471
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,970
Not how it will be run, whether it will be 100% human,

1472
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,070
because the Draco run everything, no matter what.

1473
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:43,810
But where to put certain bases, you know?

1474
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:47,990
Which planet will be all Draco and no humans, or which will be both?

1475
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:53,870
When I say Draco, I mean like 20 or 30 levels down below the Imperial, right?

1476
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:57,470
If you're human, you're not going to ever approach the Imperial Draco.

1477
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:00,850
You're going to approach one of the lines that are five or ten lines removed,

1478
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,210
and they're still considered Draco.

1479
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:07,250
Unless you manage to up your percentage of DNA potential, right?

1480
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,970
No, not even then.

1481
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:12,610
The only way that would ever happen is if you were hybridized,

1482
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:16,550
a result of a hybrid between the feline human race and the Draco,

1483
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,090
which have come together, like Kalosk.

1484
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:22,370
It's this kind of a secret hybridization,

1485
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:25,970
where the feline humans and the reptiles have gotten together

1486
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:29,850
to make a hybrid being that is more reptilian,

1487
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:32,650
it appears human, but is actually more reptilian in DNA,

1488
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:34,770
that can approach the lower Draco.

1489
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:38,910
No human has ever gone to the Imperial Draco.

1490
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:40,710
You know, it's pretty accurate.

1491
01:46:40,990 --> 01:46:44,610
If you say that you're a Draco hybrid, you can get away with that,

1492
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,390
but you're not a hybrid of the Imperial.

1493
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:51,170
The Alpha, never. Alpha, Beta, or Epsilon, or Gamma, no.

1494
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:53,130
Not at all. Not even close.

1495
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:54,190
It would never approach.

1496
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:57,890
But of the lower one, like let's say Vortac, or Kalosk, or Krunk,

1497
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:02,070
you know, maybe those levels, yeah, which are lower.

1498
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:05,610
Not lower, necessarily. Yeah, they are lower, but you see.

1499
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,180
So, this will...

1500
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:10,150
Also, a bit of apples and oranges,

1501
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:12,630
because we do have our own specialties, our own traits,

1502
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,130
like the emotion span is bigger, right?

1503
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:17,770
Yes. The emotion span, which actually is looked at

1504
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:20,250
as a psychological disease by many other beings,

1505
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:21,910
because we rely on the emotion.

1506
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:24,670
One of the things that I've been doing for the past few years in private,

1507
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:26,450
and some hints in public,

1508
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:29,930
is that there is no answer to why we are so emotional

1509
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:32,930
and how our emotional body, our emotional self,

1510
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:35,050
can overcome our physical self, right?

1511
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:37,450
If someone gets very angry, sometimes they can do things

1512
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:38,890
that they normally wouldn't do,

1513
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:41,650
and the same as if someone's very happy, right?

1514
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,210
That is never discussed.

1515
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:45,970
They say it's just chemicals, endorphins, whatever,

1516
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:51,330
but what I'm trying to expand on with the emotional body to other people

1517
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:53,210
is that it's the carrier wave.

1518
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:55,730
The emotional sets up the body and the mind,

1519
01:47:55,730 --> 01:48:00,550
so now you can emit and project things into your environment and to other people,

1520
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:04,030
and once you learn to control that and understand it,

1521
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,830
you will be able to do many, many, many things.

1522
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:11,850
Yeah, and apparently you mentioned the moons of Mars.

1523
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:14,370
Those are also fragments from Tiamat and the planet,

1524
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:16,530
the former planet itself, not the satellites,

1525
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:18,970
because it also had many satellites that dispersed

1526
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:21,950
and got attracted by Jupiter and Saturn and others,

1527
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:24,750
but the source that I'm getting this from,

1528
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,430
which is still the Romanian series,

1529
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:30,670
also mentions that Tiamat was the last telluric planet,

1530
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:32,990
but I know this is a contentious topic,

1531
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,490
but it just mentioned that it was the last one to be,

1532
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:38,910
I think, inhabitable on the surface,

1533
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:42,890
so it acknowledged that Jupiter and onward were, you know,

1534
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:45,130
inhabitable on the inside, but I would also think

1535
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:47,390
that this is somewhat confirmed by the fact that

1536
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:50,510
Jupiter would probably have advanced civilizations

1537
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:52,090
if they were on the surface,

1538
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:55,390
and they wouldn't have allowed that comet that was so destructive

1539
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:56,570
that was noticed in 1994.

1540
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:57,290
What would you say?

1541
01:48:57,810 --> 01:49:01,270
Yes, well, I mentioned earlier that there was a lot of contention

1542
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,470
over the solar system.

1543
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,130
There was a lot of transition,

1544
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:07,770
a colonization between the humans and the reptiles,

1545
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,530
who was going to be on what planet.

1546
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:13,970
All the planets like Venus, Earth, Tiamat and Mars

1547
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:16,870
were major shuttle systems going between those planets

1548
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:19,650
and into other galaxies as well,

1549
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:23,590
and when the decision was made by kind of like this rogue human group

1550
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:26,110
who had a lot of refugees in the solar system

1551
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:28,770
to bring in this other planet, which was also inhabited,

1552
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:31,590
could you imagine being on a planet that's being moved

1553
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:34,650
from one solar system to another and still living on it, right?

1554
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:37,990
That's quite, you need an incredible life support system,

1555
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:42,890
but that was a major screw-up, and that really, that disaster,

1556
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:47,390
imagine, have you seen when they removed these old landmark houses

1557
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:48,590
from one place to another?

1558
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:51,590
Could you, or see a house that's moved on the highway?

1559
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:53,790
Could you imagine it disintegrating on the highway,

1560
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:56,730
how it would really disrupt business for a day?

1561
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:59,730
Basically, that's what happened with the Tiamat.

1562
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:03,450
But by the way, everything that you see up there is a planet.

1563
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:06,270
All the suns, all the stars, all the black holes

1564
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:10,030
are all planets with hard surfaces as such.

1565
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:12,150
There's no such thing as a gas giant.

1566
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:15,010
I think I brought up, if you look at the Schumacher-Levy comets

1567
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:18,210
in the mid-90s that hit Jupiter, there's no gas giant.

1568
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:20,450
There's a surface on Jupiter that they impacted.

1569
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:25,410
The stuff that the academic people get away with,

1570
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:27,310
what the public believes in, is ridiculous.

1571
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:31,390
Again, you know, if they could get away with keeping black people

1572
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,730
in zoos until 1902, they'll get you to believe anything, right?

1573
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:38,670
Yeah, all the stars, even the planet, the sun is a planet.

1574
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:40,210
I know it sounds bizarre, right?

1575
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,010
Also, you mentioned how moons are attracted to planets.

1576
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:44,490
They're not.

1577
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:49,010
What's going on is, are you familiar with the concept of cymatics?

1578
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,150
You have a metal plate, yes.

1579
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:53,730
You put some powder, any powder on a metal plate

1580
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:55,970
and vibrate it at a certain frequency, these rings appear.

1581
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:58,710
That's how moons and orbits are formed.

1582
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:01,150
There's no attraction or repulsion.

1583
01:51:01,310 --> 01:51:02,070
It's cymatics.

1584
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:05,350
In other words, each solar system and beyond,

1585
01:51:05,490 --> 01:51:09,470
each galaxy has an oscillation, and the material

1586
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:12,610
within that oscillation forms what we call orbits.

1587
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:14,590
There's no such thing as, quote-unquote, orbit,

1588
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:17,150
based on magnetism and things like that.

1589
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:18,730
It's based on cymatics, vibration.

1590
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:20,930
And it's also photonic,

1591
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:23,830
depending on how your solar system is set up.

1592
01:51:24,130 --> 01:51:26,350
Like, for example, what rotates the planets

1593
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:28,810
is a vegetative layer on the planet.

1594
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:31,410
It starts a few feet below the surface

1595
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:34,090
and it goes up to beyond the atmosphere.

1596
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:39,030
And it's the type of energy, it's not vegetation per se, material,

1597
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:40,970
but it's the type of energy that plants use

1598
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,110
to move into the daylight.

1599
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:45,830
So you could see a plant, if it's in the dark, it goes limp.

1600
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:47,570
And then when you put light on one side,

1601
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:49,150
the plant leans towards the light.

1602
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:52,070
But if it gets too much light, it gets overcharged

1603
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:54,310
and it wants to go away from the light.

1604
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,970
And the side that's not in the light starts to turn towards it.

1605
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:58,510
And that's what's rotating the planets,

1606
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:01,670
is the photonic ability, the energy of the sun.

1607
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:03,970
So when the sun hits the Earth,

1608
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,190
the part of the Earth that is not in the sun

1609
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,670
wants to be in the sun.

1610
01:52:08,910 --> 01:52:10,890
So it moves the Earth.

1611
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:14,370
And once it gets into the sun, it gets overcharged.

1612
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:16,810
Now it doesn't want to be in the Earth, so it's a push-pull.

1613
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,310
So the side of the Earth that's facing the sun

1614
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:20,710
wants to get away from the sun.

1615
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:22,650
And the side of the Earth that is not in the sun

1616
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:23,690
wants to go to the sun.

1617
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:25,610
And that's how the planet is rotated.

1618
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:28,590
So if you want to slow down the Earth's rotation,

1619
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,830
you get a couple of billionaires

1620
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:34,510
to make a few thousand square miles sail that's opaque,

1621
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:37,930
put it out in space, and blanket a good portion of the Earth

1622
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:39,790
and you will stop the rotation of the Earth.

1623
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,450
Very simple.

1624
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:44,230
As a matter of fact, they're saying that the rotation of the Earth

1625
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:47,370
is depending on the solar activity only the past few years.

1626
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:49,350
And I've been saying what I've been saying now for 20 years.

1627
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:51,750
So they're catching up to Greek speak little by little.

1628
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:59,510
They even noticed that the component of light from EM frequency,

1629
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:05,430
they shielded a certain telescope with metallic layers

1630
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:07,790
so they wouldn't be able to see it with the naked eye.

1631
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:11,690
But they noticed signals that were much stronger

1632
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:12,970
using a certain filter.

1633
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:18,650
If they pointed the telescope exactly to the sidereal location of the planet,

1634
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:21,230
which showed that you have light traveling,

1635
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:24,150
I mean you have photons and EM fields traveling.

1636
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:24,750
No photons.

1637
01:53:25,410 --> 01:53:26,990
No, it's perturbations in the ether.

1638
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:30,030
What the planet is doing, you know how you put the powder on the metal

1639
01:53:30,030 --> 01:53:32,550
and vibrate it and it creates a certain pattern?

1640
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:37,130
The sun is vibrating in a certain way that it's an invisible energy

1641
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:40,890
that we don't see what we call a photon until it comes into our atmosphere.

1642
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:43,850
If you go outside of Earth's atmosphere, you will not see the sun.

1643
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:46,170
It will not look anything like it does,

1644
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:49,470
but you will light up based on the material that you have on your body.

1645
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:54,830
NASA has no charts or images from all their quote-unquote measuring devices

1646
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:59,750
of any image of the sun in visible light, only outside of visible light,

1647
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:02,530
because the visible light only happens in our atmosphere

1648
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:04,330
and other planets' atmosphere.

1649
01:54:04,890 --> 01:54:08,610
Isn't that also related to the gradient of densities?

1650
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:09,390
Yes.

1651
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:13,650
For example, they say nothing could be on Mercury,

1652
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:18,770
but Mercury has polar ice caps because the density of the atmosphere on Mercury

1653
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,030
is what it is here at 20,000 feet.

1654
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:23,250
When you go up 20,000 feet, you're below freezing.

1655
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:26,150
So it's so close to the sun,

1656
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:30,870
it's probably only 100 or 200 degrees maximum temperature on most of the planet

1657
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:32,250
and it still has polar ice caps.

1658
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:36,010
When I was telling people Mercury has polar ice caps, they thought I was crazy,

1659
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:39,190
and then like on a Skype group, a guy says,

1660
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:42,650
I thought you were crazy, but I need to exonerate you because, yes,

1661
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:47,850
NASA does say there are polar ice caps on Mercury, right, and Venus also.

1662
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:51,770
Yeah, Venus is not hot at all because, in other words,

1663
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:54,890
the closer you are to the sun, you have to have a less dense atmosphere.

1664
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:57,830
So, for example, the planets that are away from the sun

1665
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:01,530
must have a denser atmosphere to be at parity with the Earth.

1666
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:06,450
So Pluto, Pluto's atmosphere has to be very heavy to be above freezing, you see.

1667
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:07,590
Yeah.

1668
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:11,670
If you can even – now the argument between Pluto being a planet or not

1669
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:15,310
is kind of valid because it's only three-quarters the size of our moon, right?

1670
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:19,670
But there are more than 40 planets in the solar system,

1671
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:21,150
more like 180.

1672
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:23,970
Do you know that we have – we call the moon our satellite,

1673
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:26,370
but we have a true moon, it's called Cruthnia.

1674
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,610
Are you familiar with this?

1675
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:28,070
No.

1676
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:29,770
Look it up.

1677
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:31,010
Zen, look it up.

1678
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:33,150
Cruthnia, it's spelled with a C.

1679
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,830
Put in Cruthnia, Earth's natural satellite.

1680
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:40,430
There was a fight over it in the 1950s on who was going to put a base on it

1681
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:42,710
because, yeah, it's never talked about.

1682
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:43,270
Look it up.

1683
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:46,110
Cruthnia is a moon of the Earth.

1684
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,230
And they kind of downplay it on Wikipedia.

1685
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:50,510
Even though it has a normal orbit around the Earth

1686
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:52,670
and it really scientifically can be called a moon,

1687
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:55,150
because people don't know about it, it's not a moon.

1688
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:56,990
Greg, it's not pulling up anything.

1689
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:00,530
I typed in C-R-U-T-H-N-I-A and I'm not getting anything.

1690
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:01,130
Okay.

1691
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,510
I'll pull something up.

1692
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:03,850
Is it spelled differently?

1693
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:04,470
Let me see.

1694
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:11,350
Cruthnia, C-R-U-T-H-N-E-A, Earth's second moon.

1695
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:15,710
It was named by a Russian, of course, right?

1696
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:17,490
Here we go.

1697
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:17,990
Cruthnia.

1698
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:21,290
Astronomers discovered Cruthnia in 1986,

1699
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:25,710
but it wasn't until 1997 that they figured out its complex orbit.

1700
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:28,170
It's not a second moon from Earth.

1701
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:30,270
It does not orbit Earth,

1702
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:36,430
but Cruthnia is co-orbiting the sun with Earth with all quasi-satellites.

1703
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:40,530
Cruthnia orbits the sun once every year.

1704
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:41,470
Right.

1705
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:43,990
Okay, well, some articles will say it's regular

1706
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:47,070
and it follows the Earth and works with the Earth,

1707
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:47,930
so it is a moon.

1708
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:49,450
Others say it's not.

1709
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:51,670
But if you look at the details that they're giving you

1710
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:54,790
and you add it all up, it's pretty much part of the Earth's orbit, right?

1711
01:56:56,290 --> 01:56:59,310
I'm not trying – but anyway, these things are up for –

1712
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:00,510
for example, Ceres.

1713
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:02,450
Ceres is a planet.

1714
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:04,070
You want to call it a planetoid?

1715
01:57:04,190 --> 01:57:04,430
Fine.

1716
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:06,990
It's an active living planet, right?

1717
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:09,350
That's what Tony Rodriguez would talk about.

1718
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:10,630
He said it was hollowed out

1719
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:14,370
and it was used as a facility for the Germans to entertain people

1720
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:16,190
and that they pressurized the interior.

1721
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:19,770
Sure, that's valid because it's also a living planet

1722
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:21,190
because it produces water,

1723
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:24,030
where the moon is not a living planet.

1724
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,430
It's a dead planet.

1725
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:26,950
It's like a skeleton of a planet.

1726
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:29,350
But on the other hand,

1727
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:31,650
it's also not necessarily such a big detriment

1728
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:36,430
if you are living in such celestial body that has been hollowed out

1729
01:57:36,430 --> 01:57:41,090
because apparently the moon has many concentric layers

1730
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:43,970
and they all have very varied cities inside,

1731
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:44,810
at least they used to have

1732
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:47,290
because now it's been deserted mostly inside.

1733
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:51,150
And also they simulated planetary cores.

1734
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:54,470
They had these huge icicle-shaped structures

1735
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,870
that pointed to the core

1736
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:59,170
which generated the plasma kind of energy source

1737
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:02,130
and apparently it's a very complex advanced CT science

1738
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:05,070
and it was based on fusion, not fission.

1739
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:06,050
Sure.

1740
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:11,910
By the way, one day we'll talk about

1741
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:13,490
how to make one in your kitchen, okay?

1742
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:14,850
Fusion reactor.

1743
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:18,490
But apparently they got to the point,

1744
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:20,230
even as far back as the moon,

1745
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:22,810
which is allegedly 70 million years old

1746
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:23,810
when they planted it here,

1747
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:26,470
that shortly afterwards they got to the point

1748
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:27,850
where these huge motherships,

1749
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:31,370
they didn't even have to extract the physical materials,

1750
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:33,470
they just automated the construction.

1751
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:36,590
So it doesn't seem like such a bad deal to use,

1752
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:38,370
although they have a shorter lifespan,

1753
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:40,830
that's true, these dead bodies, you know?

1754
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:42,630
Yes, yes.

1755
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:45,270
But also if you're going to be...

1756
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:47,410
Sometimes my ears perk up

1757
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:49,550
when I hear about people being in the SSP

1758
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:51,330
and they've gone through a lot of surgeries,

1759
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:52,430
that's very...

1760
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,070
I kind of perk up and I say,

1761
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:55,290
yeah, that might be true

1762
01:58:55,290 --> 01:58:58,930
because we are adapted to this planet

1763
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:01,050
and if you're going to go live on another planet,

1764
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:02,590
your glands have to be modified

1765
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:06,050
and your lymphatic system has to be modified, right?

1766
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:07,430
So you would need surgeries

1767
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:09,530
or you would have to be...

1768
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:11,230
You would have to be, let's say,

1769
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:13,610
at conception modified there

1770
01:59:13,610 --> 01:59:15,190
or if you're going to go when you're already,

1771
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:16,910
you know, a young child or an adult,

1772
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:17,870
you would have to be modified.

1773
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:21,110
It would not be difficult modifications to do

1774
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:23,090
but it would require surgeries on the legs

1775
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,870
and under the armpits and in the neck.

1776
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:27,790
Yeah, that's what Tony Rodriguez

1777
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:28,930
had to undergo on the moon,

1778
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:32,910
allegedly by the hands of the certain tall greys

1779
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:34,490
that were very curt and nasty

1780
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:37,370
but also when he was on Ceres,

1781
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:39,150
which according to the Chinaman books

1782
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:41,690
is a former moon of Maldives,

1783
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:45,330
but that he was mining for water

1784
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:49,390
because they weren't so much interested in the water at all.

1785
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,830
They were only interested in the fact

1786
01:59:51,830 --> 01:59:55,130
that water symbolizes the sign of advanced civilizations

1787
01:59:55,130 --> 01:59:57,850
and therefore all technology that was left there.

1788
01:59:58,530 --> 01:59:59,630
Yes, exactly.

1789
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,990
Yeah, there is...

1790
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:03,250
Water is...

1791
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:06,170
For example, if you read in the biblical text

1792
02:00:06,170 --> 02:00:07,270
it talks about creation

1793
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:08,790
but water is never created.

1794
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:11,730
Water is only given the status of being good

1795
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:12,870
or not even good or bad,

1796
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:14,030
but yeah, in a way it's...

1797
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:17,290
You will never find any creation story,

1798
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:18,590
religious or non-religion,

1799
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:20,010
that says water was created

1800
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,130
because water is an element,

1801
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:23,290
a universal element.

1802
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:24,570
It's one of the first elements

1803
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:26,330
that must be introduced.

1804
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:28,450
Like when you talk about the Big Bang,

1805
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:29,270
it's not an event,

1806
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:30,550
it's actually a place.

1807
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,850
It's a portal, right?

1808
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:35,390
Well, it's actually a state of existence

1809
02:00:35,390 --> 02:00:36,650
and when there's no change,

1810
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:37,430
there's no time.

1811
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:40,230
So when that place starts to change,

1812
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:41,390
that's when time begins.

1813
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:42,610
So in other words,

1814
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:45,130
when they say the Big Bang was a nanosecond

1815
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:46,330
or a trillion trillion years,

1816
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:48,290
it makes no difference if nothing is changing.

1817
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:49,990
Once it starts to change,

1818
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:51,810
now you can measure the time, you see.

1819
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:52,630
Right.

1820
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:54,550
It sounds like word salad

1821
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,210
but if you think about this,

1822
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:57,350
what I just said,

1823
02:00:57,410 --> 02:00:58,810
and also when you go into the future,

1824
02:00:58,930 --> 02:01:00,070
you're going more into the past

1825
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,850
and when you go into the past,

1826
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:01,570
you're going more into the future.

1827
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:03,710
Now you're starting to get a glimpse

1828
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:04,890
on the real reality.

1829
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:08,490
That's my favorite aspect of this SSP

1830
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:10,730
that is hard to dismiss

1831
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:13,410
is the fact that they use time travel

1832
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:15,290
to the very limits that they are allowed to

1833
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:17,150
up until the point of being punished

1834
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:18,930
by these higher entities

1835
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:22,870
that allegedly put you in confinement

1836
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:25,030
where you can't move at all for thousands of years

1837
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:26,690
just stuck looking at a certain scenery.

1838
02:01:27,450 --> 02:01:29,490
But the fact that, for example,

1839
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:31,870
the series colonists, the Germans there,

1840
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:33,710
still use Franks

1841
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:38,050
and are very reverential about this period of time

1842
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:39,570
about 400 years ago,

1843
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,270
which goes hand in glove with the theory

1844
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:43,850
that they've time traveled back to that period

1845
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:46,530
and brought back to bolster their colonies there

1846
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:47,670
because they didn't have the numbers

1847
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:49,750
just in the Neuschwabeland and so on.

1848
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:51,830
That's my favorite part of the SSP, this lore.

1849
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:53,970
Well, they didn't really time travel.

1850
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:55,070
What happened was

1851
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:57,310
the way you make time travel happen

1852
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:00,630
is you have a way to not only record

1853
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:02,090
that the event actually happened

1854
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:04,250
so you can communicate what the event was about,

1855
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:07,590
but also have a time, not time marker,

1856
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:09,610
but a frequency marker.

1857
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:10,310
In other words,

1858
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:12,130
just like you would see a graph,

1859
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:13,630
a frequency graph of music,

1860
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:15,250
you don't really see the music.

1861
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:16,250
You just see the graph.

1862
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:18,250
You have to be able to produce

1863
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:22,380
some form of primal base reference

1864
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:24,970
of what was going on at that time,

1865
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:27,090
and then what you do is you reproduce it,

1866
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:29,410
and when you reproduce that frequency

1867
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:31,870
and you manifest it through various energy systems,

1868
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:33,290
multiple things can happen.

1869
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:35,750
One is you can teleport there,

1870
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,430
like instantly appear there,

1871
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:38,850
or a portal opens

1872
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:42,070
and you go through the portal to go there, right?

1873
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:44,970
Various things depending on what equipment is used,

1874
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:47,210
but there is no real time travel.

1875
02:02:47,210 --> 02:02:49,850
You must have the ability or have access

1876
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:52,490
to the ability to get the download

1877
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:54,910
or access the frequency of what was going on

1878
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:56,270
at the time that you want to go to,

1879
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:59,610
and it's not frequency like we use the term,

1880
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:01,590
but everything that's part of the existence,

1881
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,770
just like the matter and material and the fan, right?

1882
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:05,890
If the fan is not moving,

1883
02:03:05,970 --> 02:03:07,070
you can put your hand through it,

1884
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:08,830
but once it's moving, it appears to be solid.

1885
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:11,470
It's similar along a similar science.

1886
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:15,870
Another thing that you hinted at last episode

1887
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:20,530
was that 90% of the planets in the Pleiades

1888
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:23,150
had disappeared thanks to the Draco.

1889
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:25,770
Can you go into a slightly more detail there?

1890
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:29,370
That's all I had gotten from a report on that.

1891
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:32,290
That was because of the insistence of the humans

1892
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:34,990
to defend themselves.

1893
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:36,930
They didn't really tell the Draco,

1894
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:39,110
we're going to fight to our last

1895
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:41,330
and we'd rather die than be under your rule,

1896
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:43,550
but their insistence to keep on fighting

1897
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:44,470
resulted in that,

1898
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:48,230
because when the Imperial Draco decide to go to war

1899
02:03:48,230 --> 02:03:51,050
in terms of the type of, let's say, war,

1900
02:03:51,110 --> 02:03:52,090
they don't consider it war,

1901
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:53,710
but it's part of their exploration

1902
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:55,110
and domination of the universe,

1903
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:57,750
they give you a lot of chances.

1904
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:59,770
It's not like here where it's a few days.

1905
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,990
They can give you a thousand years notice, right?

1906
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:05,110
And you have a thousand years to get your act together,

1907
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,130
and even after then,

1908
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:08,390
that's why when you read about those wars,

1909
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:10,030
they went on for a million years, right?

1910
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:11,450
Which is not very long.

1911
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:13,970
It just so happens to be the resultant

1912
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:14,490
of the battles.

1913
02:04:14,610 --> 02:04:15,550
That's all I got.

1914
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:16,750
It was just very simple.

1915
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:18,910
Why they eliminated that many, I guess,

1916
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:20,910
is because of the humans, you know,

1917
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:22,530
wanting to not cave in.

1918
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:23,610
Yes.

1919
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:25,950
Well, no one else talked about it,

1920
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,890
so either way,

1921
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:30,210
you're not going to find any scoops anywhere else,

1922
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:30,410
I'm sure,

1923
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:33,070
but apparently there was such a thing

1924
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:34,390
as the Galactic Alliance

1925
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:36,470
that goes under many names,

1926
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:38,310
like Galactic Federation and so on,

1927
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:41,150
but this version of it, 100,000 years ago,

1928
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:44,090
had resulted in the greatest war

1929
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:47,690
in the lifespan of this version of humanity,

1930
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:50,170
which apparently is about 400-something thousand years old,

1931
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:52,770
and it was the bloodiest of all these wars,

1932
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:56,450
and that many of the races that made up this alliance

1933
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:59,470
had been also infiltrated by the Draco,

1934
02:04:59,710 --> 02:05:03,630
and it was only like 20,000 years afterwards

1935
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:06,270
that the situation calmed down.

1936
02:05:06,830 --> 02:05:08,970
And do you know anything about the differences

1937
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,810
between all these terminology,

1938
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:12,990
like the Galactic Federation,

1939
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:14,690
the Galactic Alliance, Guardians?

1940
02:05:15,610 --> 02:05:18,350
We can start a Galactic Federation,

1941
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:19,690
the three of us right now,

1942
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:21,870
by meeting regularly

1943
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:23,930
and speaking of these things

1944
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:26,410
and then asking for third-party help,

1945
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,610
and it will eventually grow

1946
02:05:27,610 --> 02:05:30,290
into just like one of these Galactic Federations.

1947
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:33,190
It's not a mystical, magical thing.

1948
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:34,470
There are many levels to them,

1949
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:35,430
there are geographical,

1950
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:39,670
meaning you might have one major one

1951
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:41,610
for the entire universe,

1952
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:44,590
and then another major one for each galaxy,

1953
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:47,030
and then another major one for each solar system.

1954
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,050
So they're so prevalent,

1955
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:51,490
there are so many of these federations

1956
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:53,950
that it's almost ridiculous to try to nail it down

1957
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:56,250
to which one did what and who's who,

1958
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,910
because they're everywhere.

1959
02:05:58,930 --> 02:05:59,170
Right.

1960
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:03,510
I even heard that it was actually the Draco

1961
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:07,370
that created the first primates in the first place,

1962
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:09,490
which is much longer ago,

1963
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:12,910
so then the later hybridization took place,

1964
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:16,550
and they look at all life forms

1965
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:18,790
as just a natural resource.

1966
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:21,750
You could do that,

1967
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:23,130
but the Imperial Draco,

1968
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:26,510
it would be 10 steps removed from the Imperial,

1969
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:28,730
yeah, you can say that, but not the Imperial.

1970
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:31,630
Imperial Draco are very...

1971
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:34,750
You know when you talk about people that are very spiritual,

1972
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:36,670
let's say like a true monk

1973
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:38,610
who is very silent,

1974
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:40,270
very measured in their behavior,

1975
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:42,570
if you were to, let's say,

1976
02:06:42,710 --> 02:06:43,810
I'm speculating here,

1977
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:45,410
but it's a very strong speculation,

1978
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:49,050
and if you were to find out

1979
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:50,870
what the Imperial Draco are really about,

1980
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,710
you would compare them to the most solemn

1981
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:54,550
Tibetan monk you could ever imagine.

1982
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:57,410
They're nothing like they've been portrayed on the internet.

1983
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:01,930
And apparently, according to the Andromedans,

1984
02:07:02,350 --> 02:07:05,290
they have legends, the Draco,

1985
02:07:05,530 --> 02:07:07,430
about warring with a certain race

1986
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:10,090
that was creating human life forms

1987
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:12,550
that were opposed to their philosophy,

1988
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,170
and they call it the Patal,

1989
02:07:14,350 --> 02:07:16,050
and we are one of those,

1990
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:19,270
and allegedly had 12 DNA strands,

1991
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:22,610
and it was the fact that our spirit,

1992
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:25,930
our level was a match with this,

1993
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:28,430
that they took an interest in us.

1994
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:29,230
Would you agree?

1995
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:31,770
Yes, that name you just mentioned

1996
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:34,550
is the feline human, by the way.

1997
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:36,490
Are you aware of that?

1998
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:37,130
No.

1999
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:39,410
Yeah, the Fatal, or...

2000
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:40,010
Fatal.

2001
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:41,630
Fatal, yeah, Fatal,

2002
02:07:41,690 --> 02:07:43,390
and there's also the Flatal or Fatal,

2003
02:07:43,470 --> 02:07:43,990
yes, however,

2004
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,510
whenever you hear that term,

2005
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:47,950
it is the feline species.

2006
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:49,310
You have them,

2007
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:51,450
and then you have the avian species,

2008
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:54,090
and the insectoid species,

2009
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:56,150
which are sort of insectoid,

2010
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:58,250
more like a moth type.

2011
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:00,450
And apparently,

2012
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:03,250
you have also someone

2013
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,090
that is even above the Draco,

2014
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:06,090
but that's just one account,

2015
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:06,530
so I'm not sure.

2016
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:11,310
It's still another Draco above the Draco,

2017
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:13,190
but they don't have the characteristics

2018
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:15,710
of the Imperial Draco in this universe, yes.

2019
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:17,330
Right.

2020
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:18,670
I wouldn't know about it.

2021
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:20,410
I shouldn't venture into speculation anyway.

2022
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,630
Yeah, we can speculate.

2023
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:23,770
If you want speculation,

2024
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,510
go look at the SSP community,

2025
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:28,410
or even worse than that is the mainstream,

2026
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:30,330
about what's going on out there.

2027
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:31,910
Actually, they don't touch on anything.

2028
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:34,270
When you look at mainstream cosmology,

2029
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:36,490
it's like children with broken crayons,

2030
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:37,970
not even new crayons.

2031
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:39,290
So ridiculous.

2032
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:42,850
Yeah, but what I see is the purpose

2033
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:43,850
of having discussions,

2034
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:45,430
and what I call sonic events,

2035
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:47,470
is to tell people what's coming,

2036
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:48,290
and how to prepare,

2037
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:51,010
and how to live a prudent life here.

2038
02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:54,310
You know, it's okay to have aspirations

2039
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:55,050
and aspirations,

2040
02:08:55,390 --> 02:08:58,170
but not on this planet if they're too big,

2041
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:01,590
and also be expectant of what's coming,

2042
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:04,790
where the template was going to reverse itself.

2043
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:06,570
I know this is a little bit of a change,

2044
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:07,850
but if you've listened to Greek speak,

2045
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:08,970
or go back historically,

2046
02:09:09,230 --> 02:09:11,150
what I always try to put out is that

2047
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:14,050
you'll know that this particular social,

2048
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:15,950
cultural, geopolitical,

2049
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:17,130
whatever you want to call it,

2050
02:09:17,130 --> 02:09:20,410
will end as it's been,

2051
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:22,950
which is basically based on deception

2052
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:23,790
and ignorance.

2053
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:26,990
When you see a Middle East Union form,

2054
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:29,030
when the entire power base of the world

2055
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:30,650
is focusing on the Middle East,

2056
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:33,190
and there's a very charismatic group

2057
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,390
in the Middle East that will lead

2058
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:35,150
the whole world,

2059
02:09:35,970 --> 02:09:37,770
and when you start seeing that,

2060
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:38,990
your days are numbered,

2061
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:42,190
as you know reality.

2062
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:44,270
And that's just around the corner,

2063
02:09:44,370 --> 02:09:44,810
by the way.

2064
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:47,510
You also hinted that,

2065
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:50,150
we know about the terraforming,

2066
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:52,950
that it's basically a currency

2067
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:54,650
of the advanced civilization,

2068
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:58,790
this coupled with the uplift to the species,

2069
02:09:59,070 --> 02:10:00,750
or taking one from scratch,

2070
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:02,070
like we have been,

2071
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:04,870
but also you hinted to the strong possibility

2072
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:06,830
of there being a terraformation

2073
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:07,910
in our near future.

2074
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:08,570
Yes.

2075
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:12,370
Yes, where trillions of beings could be.

2076
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:13,430
Well, right now,

2077
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:16,130
everyone on the planet can fit in Texas,

2078
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,870
comfortably, right?

2079
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,810
There is no overpopulation.

2080
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:22,670
It's just mismanagement, right?

2081
02:10:23,210 --> 02:10:24,830
Very poor mismanagement,

2082
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:27,510
because the secret groups that rule,

2083
02:10:27,690 --> 02:10:29,430
the conspiracy that rules this planet

2084
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:31,510
worships death more than it worships life,

2085
02:10:31,530 --> 02:10:31,810
right?

2086
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:34,050
So anything that promotes death

2087
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:35,250
and destruction and fire

2088
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:36,870
and pressurization is promoted,

2089
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:39,270
and they've taken the entire population

2090
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:39,870
with them.

2091
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:41,650
The terraforming that will happen

2092
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:43,290
is the Earth will increase in size,

2093
02:10:43,390 --> 02:10:45,310
its atmosphere will increase in height,

2094
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:47,310
and the oceans will diminish.

2095
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:48,830
There will be more fresh water.

2096
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,150
There will be no more separation

2097
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:53,450
of surface and subsurface dwellers.

2098
02:10:54,090 --> 02:10:56,130
Everyone will pretty much know

2099
02:10:56,130 --> 02:10:57,370
everything that's going on here.

2100
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:59,070
It'll take about 1,000 years.

2101
02:11:00,090 --> 02:11:01,450
Entropy will be reversed.

2102
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:02,290
In other words,

2103
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:04,730
humans will be born and go through puberty

2104
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:06,410
at around 30 or 40 years old.

2105
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:10,190
Two, three, 400 years old is adolescence,

2106
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:10,830
you see.

2107
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:13,210
So we'll be brought closer

2108
02:11:13,210 --> 02:11:15,490
to the interterrestrials

2109
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:18,050
who already benefit from all these things,

2110
02:11:18,330 --> 02:11:23,090
and know that when you incarnate here

2111
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:24,970
is for just a flash in the pan,

2112
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:27,310
and they've seen it all before and stuff.

2113
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:29,610
But apparently we also depend

2114
02:11:29,610 --> 02:11:32,230
on their support through all of these things,

2115
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:34,130
all these advanced people

2116
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:36,490
that have witnessed the disclosures

2117
02:11:36,490 --> 02:11:38,450
that I mentioned have apparently

2118
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:40,190
necessarily at some point

2119
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:41,730
will have to deal with Shambhala

2120
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:43,050
and all these elevated places.

2121
02:11:44,130 --> 02:11:47,890
But yeah, that's all I had prepared for today.

2122
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:49,910
So you can take it from here, Dan.

2123
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:51,610
Oh, we've been running for a while.

2124
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,210
Yes, Dan.

2125
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:53,010
What did you say?

2126
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:54,910
Wait, what did you say, Greg?

2127
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:57,150
What do you have to say?

2128
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:58,710
You've been quiet and patient with us.

2129
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:00,590
Well, Greg, first off,

2130
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:01,870
let me pass you the torch, actually.

2131
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,670
You're the guest of honor.

2132
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:04,230
Are there things you'd like to divulge

2133
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:05,290
before I go ahead?

2134
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:08,010
Other than the typical Greek speak,

2135
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:09,470
which is food, clothing, shelter,

2136
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:11,050
look for a Middle East union.

2137
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:12,730
If you're interested

2138
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:14,470
in what's going on in the world,

2139
02:12:14,590 --> 02:12:16,010
don't look where it's too noisy.

2140
02:12:16,630 --> 02:12:19,150
Look at the real quiet stuff, right?

2141
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:21,990
You'll get more out of two people

2142
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:24,090
standing around whispering to each other

2143
02:12:24,090 --> 02:12:25,890
than somebody shouting, right?

2144
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:28,790
Because what the guy's shouting

2145
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:30,690
is either crazy or chill,

2146
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,730
where the people whispering to each other

2147
02:12:32,730 --> 02:12:33,990
probably have more information.

2148
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:36,430
That's why I keep my finger

2149
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:38,850
on what's best I can

2150
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:41,190
and also boots on the ground when I can,

2151
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:43,010
what's going on in the Middle East.

2152
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:44,970
Because you've got to realize

2153
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:45,610
the main collectives,

2154
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,570
which are, let's say, the reptilian

2155
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:49,410
and the human collective,

2156
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,970
started and they had it out

2157
02:12:51,970 --> 02:12:54,670
on a cultural level in the Middle East.

2158
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:56,590
Like, I think one of the calls

2159
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:58,130
I kind of broke down,

2160
02:12:58,710 --> 02:12:59,270
like, for example,

2161
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,490
if you look at the Judean culture

2162
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:03,230
and the Greek culture,

2163
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,870
that's part of the human collective,

2164
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:08,050
as is the Sumerian culture,

2165
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:09,150
but they would be more

2166
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,810
Aldebaran collective.

2167
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:13,590
If you look at the Roman Empire

2168
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:15,890
and the Babylonian Empire,

2169
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:18,490
that's more reptilian-based, right?

2170
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:20,910
Now, what's been happening on the planet

2171
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:23,930
is even though the Judean

2172
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:26,170
or the Levant and the Greek culture

2173
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:27,430
from ancient times

2174
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:28,770
was the human collective,

2175
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:31,110
no matter what philosophy, religion,

2176
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:32,170
knowledge, or whatever,

2177
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,330
which is pro-human

2178
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:35,070
or all about the development of humans,

2179
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:37,370
eventually all the followers

2180
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:38,190
of the culture

2181
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:39,850
swing over to the imperial,

2182
02:13:40,070 --> 02:13:41,250
you know, the reptilian side.

2183
02:13:41,370 --> 02:13:42,930
That's why you'll see

2184
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:44,230
the Vatican runs the world,

2185
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:45,830
kind of talk, you know?

2186
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:48,530
So Rome and Babylon systems

2187
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:50,250
are reptilian.

2188
02:13:50,530 --> 02:13:52,430
The Greek and Judean systems

2189
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:54,390
or Levant, it's also Syria,

2190
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:55,390
Lebanon, Egypt,

2191
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:58,430
are human collectives, you see.

2192
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:00,110
And it goes back and forth,

2193
02:14:00,190 --> 02:14:00,910
back and forth.

2194
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:03,930
Right now, the planet

2195
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:05,710
is under a reptilian mindset.

2196
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:08,190
You know, when the reptilian mindset

2197
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:11,090
is look at these humans

2198
02:14:11,090 --> 02:14:12,310
and look at us.

2199
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:14,550
If we made them acknowledge us,

2200
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:16,010
most of them would kill each other

2201
02:14:16,010 --> 02:14:17,430
because they would be so afraid

2202
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:19,410
that we are running everything.

2203
02:14:19,570 --> 02:14:20,410
So we have to hide.

2204
02:14:20,690 --> 02:14:21,850
So in one sense,

2205
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:23,790
the reptilians are compassionate with us

2206
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:25,310
because they're not showing

2207
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:27,330
that they run everything, right?

2208
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:28,910
Because if people would freak out

2209
02:14:28,910 --> 02:14:30,370
if they found that out.

2210
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:32,690
Or if they just were in their presence,

2211
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:33,870
we can't even withstand

2212
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:35,230
their energy field.

2213
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:36,770
No, that's right.

2214
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,750
Because they don't go to war with us.

2215
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:40,790
They don't have to attack us

2216
02:14:40,790 --> 02:14:42,270
with kinetic objects.

2217
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:43,530
They can do it with their minds.

2218
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:44,810
They can kill the population

2219
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:45,630
with their mind.

2220
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:47,610
They don't need to bring ships

2221
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:47,970
or anything.

2222
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:50,370
Which is one thing I wanted to bring up.

2223
02:14:50,450 --> 02:14:51,250
This is a little bit.

2224
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:53,510
If you study 9-11,

2225
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:55,110
whenever you say nuclear,

2226
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:57,090
they think atmospheric mushroom cloud

2227
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:57,550
and all that.

2228
02:14:57,550 --> 02:14:58,970
But people don't understand

2229
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:01,550
that 90% of all the nuclear testing

2230
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:02,190
done in the world

2231
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:03,190
is done underground

2232
02:15:03,190 --> 02:15:04,810
for specific reasons.

2233
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:06,230
When you hear about

2234
02:15:06,230 --> 02:15:07,850
the coming alien invasion,

2235
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:10,490
what they're going to do most likely

2236
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:11,470
is have these nuclear,

2237
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,030
very rudimentary nuclear devices

2238
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,010
planted underground.

2239
02:15:14,210 --> 02:15:15,190
And when they go off,

2240
02:15:15,290 --> 02:15:16,270
anything on the surface

2241
02:15:16,270 --> 02:15:18,290
turns to dust and collapses.

2242
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:20,530
The people in the areas

2243
02:15:20,530 --> 02:15:21,370
will witness that.

2244
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:22,950
But the people seeing it on TV,

2245
02:15:23,150 --> 02:15:23,770
what they will do

2246
02:15:23,770 --> 02:15:24,690
is they will put in

2247
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:27,110
what they call a UAP or a spaceship

2248
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:28,350
in the film,

2249
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:29,950
just like, for example,

2250
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:30,750
in 9-11,

2251
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:32,510
nobody saw any airplanes,

2252
02:15:32,570 --> 02:15:33,450
only on TV.

2253
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,670
Right?

2254
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:35,890
And they had enough people

2255
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:36,830
on the ground telling them

2256
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:37,290
they were airplanes.

2257
02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:38,470
And it's very obvious

2258
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:40,690
because if you look, for example,

2259
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:41,890
on all the videos

2260
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:43,110
shot on the ground

2261
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:44,010
of the airplane going

2262
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:44,730
into the building,

2263
02:15:45,190 --> 02:15:46,430
no one looks up

2264
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:48,950
until the building explodes.

2265
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:52,030
Now, if there is a 737

2266
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:54,450
careening at full speed

2267
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:56,870
at less than 1,000 feet altitude,

2268
02:15:57,190 --> 02:15:58,470
you will look up minutes

2269
02:15:58,470 --> 02:15:59,970
before it even comes into view.

2270
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:00,750
It's so loud.

2271
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:02,350
No one looks up.

2272
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:03,590
By the way,

2273
02:16:03,730 --> 02:16:04,730
let me just disclose this.

2274
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:06,430
The company that put those planes

2275
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:07,790
in those videos that you see,

2276
02:16:07,970 --> 02:16:10,210
they were awarded with the contracts

2277
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:11,490
on all the sports games.

2278
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,630
You see how they move

2279
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,490
the line of scrimmage

2280
02:16:13,490 --> 02:16:14,250
when you watch football

2281
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:14,930
or baseball game?

2282
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:16,530
They put advertisement behind that.

2283
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:17,850
Yes, because the players

2284
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:18,870
can walk right over

2285
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:20,350
this orange line or something.

2286
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:22,250
Or in a baseball game,

2287
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:23,130
you'll see an advertisement

2288
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:24,630
that's changing in the background

2289
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:25,210
constantly,

2290
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:27,310
but the people there don't see it.

2291
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:28,090
But if you're on TV,

2292
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:29,050
you see those people,

2293
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:29,810
those young guys were

2294
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:31,490
awarded with that contract.

2295
02:16:31,889 --> 02:16:33,230
And if you know who's doing that,

2296
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:34,510
you can go back and ask them

2297
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:35,530
what they were doing that day

2298
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,549
and you'll get in big trouble.

2299
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:37,570
But anyway,

2300
02:16:38,230 --> 02:16:39,350
when they say the coming

2301
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:40,209
alien invasion,

2302
02:16:40,309 --> 02:16:40,850
they're going to be

2303
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,790
disintegrating areas,

2304
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:43,969
justifying them,

2305
02:16:44,049 --> 02:16:44,950
vaporizing them.

2306
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:46,549
The people on the ground,

2307
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:47,770
well, yeah, it would be real.

2308
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:49,010
There'll be a lot of

2309
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:50,490
ionization in the area.

2310
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:52,730
But the people watching it on TV,

2311
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,690
they will put in

2312
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:54,490
a little spaceship

2313
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:55,549
with a beam or something

2314
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:56,750
to make it believable.

2315
02:16:57,549 --> 02:16:59,070
So I wanted you to say that

2316
02:16:59,070 --> 02:17:00,510
because so what if

2317
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:01,790
it was a nuclear demolition?

2318
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:02,969
So what if it was a...

2319
02:17:02,969 --> 02:17:03,990
No, what I'm telling you

2320
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:05,110
is they're going to use it again,

2321
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:07,350
but in that way, you see.

2322
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:08,410
If there's going to be

2323
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:09,170
an alien invasion,

2324
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:09,750
they're going to use

2325
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:10,610
underground nukes.

2326
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:11,690
As a matter of fact,

2327
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:12,730
there was a movie with...

2328
02:17:13,469 --> 02:17:14,850
a few years ago on Netflix

2329
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:16,090
where the whole Earth

2330
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:17,129
was falling apart

2331
02:17:17,129 --> 02:17:18,350
and it was...

2332
02:17:19,129 --> 02:17:19,930
John Cusack?

2333
02:17:20,809 --> 02:17:21,950
No, it wasn't John Cusack.

2334
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:24,230
The actor with the lazy eye,

2335
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:25,270
Forrest something,

2336
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:26,709
he was...

2337
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,469
Yeah.

2338
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:28,570
Him and his daughter

2339
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:29,110
were trying to make

2340
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,030
a cross-country trip

2341
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:31,129
and they run into one guy

2342
02:17:31,129 --> 02:17:31,510
and he says,

2343
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,670
the government's doing all this

2344
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:33,750
and he kind of freaked out,

2345
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:34,610
you know,

2346
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:36,190
and it's all underground nukes, right?

2347
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:37,170
What they were showing you

2348
02:17:37,170 --> 02:17:37,690
is what happens,

2349
02:17:38,090 --> 02:17:38,910
you know, it's earthquakes,

2350
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:40,430
it's all kinds of stuff, right?

2351
02:17:40,809 --> 02:17:42,790
So they produce these things

2352
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:43,610
in South Africa,

2353
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:44,370
mass produced

2354
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:45,410
in parts of the world,

2355
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:45,969
North Korea.

2356
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:47,190
They produce all these things

2357
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:48,549
wherever there's a large dam.

2358
02:17:49,370 --> 02:17:50,650
They have thousands

2359
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:51,469
of these devices,

2360
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:53,010
very easy to plant underground

2361
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:55,150
and vaporize the surface.

2362
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:55,889
You know,

2363
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:56,950
the surface turns to dust,

2364
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:57,950
you get a small crater

2365
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:58,450
and all that

2366
02:17:58,450 --> 02:18:00,290
and when this will be shown

2367
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,070
on television,

2368
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:01,809
they will insert

2369
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:03,629
some kind of...

2370
02:18:03,629 --> 02:18:05,049
what they call UAP now

2371
02:18:05,049 --> 02:18:05,629
or UFO

2372
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:07,590
and the people will believe it.

2373
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:08,410
It'll be very believable

2374
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:09,030
because they'll call,

2375
02:18:09,110 --> 02:18:09,510
I know someone

2376
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:10,190
I'll tell them what happened,

2377
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:10,530
yes,

2378
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:12,270
and if they didn't

2379
02:18:12,270 --> 02:18:13,170
witness it directly,

2380
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:14,129
they'll believe it too.

2381
02:18:14,389 --> 02:18:15,510
They'll see it on TV

2382
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:15,830
and they'll say,

2383
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:16,570
yeah, I'm here

2384
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:17,549
but I didn't see the UFO

2385
02:18:17,549 --> 02:18:18,629
but I guess it's on TV.

2386
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:20,230
I guess it's...

2387
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,930
that's what's happening.

2388
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:22,129
So I just wanted

2389
02:18:22,129 --> 02:18:22,889
to put that out,

2390
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:23,750
the importance of why

2391
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:24,889
I keep bringing up 9-11

2392
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:26,370
and also anybody

2393
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:27,950
that's in CBs

2394
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:28,990
or in the higher army

2395
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:29,309
or whatever.

2396
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:29,850
But by the way,

2397
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:30,330
most of the people

2398
02:18:30,330 --> 02:18:31,389
in the military don't know,

2399
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:31,830
you know,

2400
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,889
military generals

2401
02:18:32,889 --> 02:18:33,430
and presidents

2402
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:34,950
and they're very low

2403
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:35,809
security clearance

2404
02:18:35,809 --> 02:18:37,250
but what I'm trying to say

2405
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:38,809
is if you could look up

2406
02:18:38,809 --> 02:18:40,309
the concept of atomic gates

2407
02:18:40,309 --> 02:18:40,670
or whatever,

2408
02:18:40,809 --> 02:18:42,010
all of the main monuments

2409
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:43,010
and main bridges

2410
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:43,650
and buildings

2411
02:18:43,650 --> 02:18:44,650
are rigged to blow

2412
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:46,610
in case there's an invasion

2413
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:47,270
and don't think

2414
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:47,870
that the US

2415
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:48,610
is not subject

2416
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:49,650
to an invasion.

2417
02:18:50,610 --> 02:18:51,690
Remember the Titanic

2418
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:52,850
was unsinkable, right?

2419
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:53,930
And by the way,

2420
02:18:53,969 --> 02:18:54,690
another thing I wanted to say

2421
02:18:54,690 --> 02:18:55,469
since we did speak

2422
02:18:55,469 --> 02:18:56,650
about the US yesterday,

2423
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,129
the US becoming a superpower,

2424
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,170
it could go and kick ass

2425
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:01,170
wherever supposedly,

2426
02:19:01,629 --> 02:19:03,110
was because it was set up

2427
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:04,510
that way by the old money

2428
02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:05,370
and the power brokers

2429
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:05,950
in Europe

2430
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,809
because after the revolution

2431
02:19:07,809 --> 02:19:08,530
and as the US

2432
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:09,510
became growing

2433
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:10,730
more and more and more,

2434
02:19:11,129 --> 02:19:11,809
it could have been

2435
02:19:11,809 --> 02:19:13,170
regulated and quashed.

2436
02:19:13,889 --> 02:19:14,070
Right?

2437
02:19:14,129 --> 02:19:15,230
So the US is basically

2438
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:16,610
a tool of the old money

2439
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:17,670
of the old European

2440
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:19,170
and some Asian factions.

2441
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:20,330
Don't believe for a minute

2442
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:21,610
that the US

2443
02:19:21,610 --> 02:19:23,129
is an autonomous superpower.

2444
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:24,730
Just like for example,

2445
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:26,570
everything being made in China

2446
02:19:26,570 --> 02:19:28,110
is planned that way

2447
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:29,510
a long time ago.

2448
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:30,469
It was actually,

2449
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:31,690
there's a video called

2450
02:19:31,690 --> 02:19:33,170
The New Order of Barbarians

2451
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:34,290
which was a speech made

2452
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,110
in 1968

2453
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:36,030
of what's going to come

2454
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:37,049
in the next 50 years.

2455
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:38,410
I think I brought it up.

2456
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:38,650
It's called

2457
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:40,070
The New Order of Barbarians.

2458
02:19:40,170 --> 02:19:40,990
It's been taken down

2459
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:41,510
off of YouTube.

2460
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:42,610
Now it came back again.

2461
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:44,049
Talked about this.

2462
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:45,750
But what?

2463
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:46,850
You couldn't manufacture

2464
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:47,510
in Vietnam

2465
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:49,470
or on the continent of Africa

2466
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:50,270
and other places

2467
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:50,970
with cheap labor.

2468
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:51,790
It's all been done

2469
02:19:51,790 --> 02:19:52,590
to centralize.

2470
02:19:53,090 --> 02:19:53,950
So China is being

2471
02:19:53,950 --> 02:19:55,790
manipulated for manufacturing

2472
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:57,330
just like the US

2473
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:58,890
is being manipulated

2474
02:19:58,890 --> 02:19:59,810
for military.

2475
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:01,450
And by the way,

2476
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:02,570
the US military

2477
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:03,970
is the losingest military

2478
02:20:03,970 --> 02:20:04,930
in all of history.

2479
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:05,290
Right?

2480
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:08,010
It's like

2481
02:20:08,010 --> 02:20:08,710
an admiral

2482
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:10,690
that was born with a dick.

2483
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:11,310
Yeah.

2484
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:13,610
There's a lot of history books

2485
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:15,110
on where you have

2486
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:16,470
the US versus the Germans,

2487
02:20:16,470 --> 02:20:17,730
the US versus Japan,

2488
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:18,910
and they list

2489
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,110
the particular battle

2490
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:21,110
and you read

2491
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,530
everything

2492
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:22,410
play by play

2493
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:22,850
on the battle.

2494
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:23,430
On the bottom,

2495
02:20:23,890 --> 02:20:24,810
always the outcome

2496
02:20:24,810 --> 02:20:26,070
is the Japanese prevailed

2497
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:27,110
or the Germans prevailed

2498
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:28,330
or who else prevailed.

2499
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:29,450
So the Americans

2500
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:30,470
are always losing

2501
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:31,250
because the Americans

2502
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:31,890
are not there

2503
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:33,510
to be military strategists

2504
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:34,270
or tacticians.

2505
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:35,130
They're there

2506
02:20:35,130 --> 02:20:35,930
to be used

2507
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:36,670
as a colonial

2508
02:20:37,410 --> 02:20:38,090
occupying power.

2509
02:20:39,070 --> 02:20:39,170
Right.

2510
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:40,150
The only time

2511
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:40,590
you could say

2512
02:20:40,590 --> 02:20:41,170
they maybe

2513
02:20:41,170 --> 02:20:42,170
had an advantage

2514
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:43,970
was partially

2515
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,410
in the Spanish-American War

2516
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:46,410
and the Iraq War.

2517
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:48,910
But the Iraq War

2518
02:20:48,910 --> 02:20:49,630
was allegedly

2519
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,350
you know

2520
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:51,510
to take out Saddam Hussein

2521
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:52,290
but they ended up

2522
02:20:52,290 --> 02:20:52,850
still killing

2523
02:20:52,850 --> 02:20:53,910
over two and a half million

2524
02:20:53,910 --> 02:20:54,770
people there.

2525
02:20:55,110 --> 02:20:55,230
You know.

2526
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,090
So yeah.

2527
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:58,670
So these times are ending

2528
02:20:58,670 --> 02:20:59,730
all this stuff.

2529
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:01,690
And in terms of the US

2530
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:02,570
it started off

2531
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:03,790
with stolen land

2532
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:04,630
and slave labor.

2533
02:21:04,810 --> 02:21:05,590
Guess how it's going to end.

2534
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:06,430
What does grandma say?

2535
02:21:06,510 --> 02:21:07,030
What goes around

2536
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:07,490
comes around.

2537
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:07,730
Right?

2538
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:09,390
So true.

2539
02:21:09,790 --> 02:21:11,110
So this is where you are

2540
02:21:11,110 --> 02:21:12,170
from the geopolitical

2541
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:12,630
point of view.

2542
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:13,690
So watch the Middle East.

2543
02:21:14,330 --> 02:21:15,090
Middle East.

2544
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:16,110
What you're going to be seeing

2545
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:16,830
in the Middle East

2546
02:21:16,830 --> 02:21:17,710
is Iraq

2547
02:21:17,710 --> 02:21:18,650
civil war.

2548
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:19,830
It's going to be probably

2549
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:21,010
a paper civil war

2550
02:21:21,010 --> 02:21:21,790
and a new country

2551
02:21:21,790 --> 02:21:22,950
will form in the north

2552
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:24,110
taking land

2553
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:24,710
from Syria

2554
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:25,650
and Turkey also.

2555
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:26,430
It's going to be called

2556
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:27,330
the new Assyria.

2557
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:29,070
And a monarchy

2558
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:29,790
will be installed

2559
02:21:29,790 --> 02:21:30,330
in Israel.

2560
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:31,990
A woman will rule over Egypt

2561
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:33,150
and we'll look

2562
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,850
for those things.

2563
02:21:34,810 --> 02:21:36,070
But how do you know

2564
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:37,190
like usually

2565
02:21:37,190 --> 02:21:38,190
when you see something

2566
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:39,030
the opposite

2567
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,870
is going to come through.

2568
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:40,750
So this is very

2569
02:21:40,750 --> 02:21:41,830
high specificity

2570
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:42,770
information.

2571
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,690
So especially

2572
02:21:43,690 --> 02:21:44,990
the Assyria one

2573
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:46,230
like it doesn't

2574
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:47,170
really depend on that.

2575
02:21:48,090 --> 02:21:48,790
Well that's

2576
02:21:48,790 --> 02:21:49,870
those are just markers.

2577
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:51,130
These are all

2578
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:52,230
the ancient prophecies

2579
02:21:52,230 --> 02:21:53,450
which don't come easy.

2580
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:54,390
For example

2581
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:55,630
the reason something

2582
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:56,550
is called a prophecy

2583
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:57,650
means it's going to happen

2584
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:58,290
no matter what.

2585
02:21:58,370 --> 02:21:59,210
You can't change it.

2586
02:21:59,650 --> 02:22:00,230
It's different

2587
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:01,190
than a supposition.

2588
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:01,770
There are many

2589
02:22:01,770 --> 02:22:02,690
ancient things

2590
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:03,650
that if you do this

2591
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:05,270
this will happen to you.

2592
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:06,250
But if you don't do it

2593
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:06,930
it won't happen.

2594
02:22:07,010 --> 02:22:07,610
But there are things

2595
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:08,410
called prophecies

2596
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:08,970
that will happen

2597
02:22:08,970 --> 02:22:09,610
no matter what.

2598
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:10,370
Give me an example.

2599
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:11,810
Let's say you have

2600
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:13,070
a size 45 shoe

2601
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:14,370
or size 44 shoe.

2602
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:14,790
Okay.

2603
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:16,370
And there's a prophecy

2604
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:17,570
that you will have

2605
02:22:17,570 --> 02:22:19,030
a size 40 shoe.

2606
02:22:19,690 --> 02:22:20,490
And you're like

2607
02:22:20,490 --> 02:22:21,790
no that's not going to happen

2608
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:22,590
because I've been

2609
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:23,630
wearing a size 44

2610
02:22:23,630 --> 02:22:24,470
all my life

2611
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:25,210
since I was an adult.

2612
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:26,570
Yeah but what you didn't

2613
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:27,850
take into account

2614
02:22:27,850 --> 02:22:28,670
when that prophecy

2615
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:29,770
says that you're going

2616
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:30,670
to have a size 40

2617
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:31,210
not 44

2618
02:22:31,210 --> 02:22:32,170
is that your toes

2619
02:22:32,170 --> 02:22:33,390
are going to be chopped off.

2620
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,470
That's why you're going

2621
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:35,570
to be wearing a size 40

2622
02:22:35,570 --> 02:22:36,510
but it doesn't tell you

2623
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:37,150
your toes are going

2624
02:22:37,150 --> 02:22:38,030
to be chopped off.

2625
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:39,250
And having your toes

2626
02:22:39,250 --> 02:22:39,730
chopped off

2627
02:22:39,730 --> 02:22:41,110
is a really terrible thing.

2628
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:42,130
You see?

2629
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:43,210
So when people

2630
02:22:43,210 --> 02:22:44,150
read these prophecies

2631
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,890
it doesn't tell you

2632
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:45,750
how you're going to get there

2633
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:46,450
it just tells you

2634
02:22:46,450 --> 02:22:47,810
what to expect.

2635
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:49,650
So you have to figure out

2636
02:22:49,650 --> 02:22:50,490
if this seems

2637
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:51,230
too unnatural

2638
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:52,150
and too unreal

2639
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:52,650
to happen

2640
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:54,110
well some really bad stuff

2641
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:54,630
is going to happen

2642
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:55,310
for it to happen.

2643
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:57,030
Wow.

2644
02:22:57,550 --> 02:22:58,130
You see the foot

2645
02:22:58,130 --> 02:22:58,930
the shoe analogy?

2646
02:23:00,210 --> 02:23:01,470
I completely agree.

2647
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:02,710
Yeah there's going to be

2648
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:03,410
a lot of stuff

2649
02:23:03,410 --> 02:23:04,750
that's going to be coming down

2650
02:23:04,750 --> 02:23:05,410
and it's going to happen

2651
02:23:05,410 --> 02:23:06,390
very very quickly

2652
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:07,950
when it starts.

2653
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:08,830
Very quickly.

2654
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:09,510
Like things that

2655
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:10,670
normally took decades

2656
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:11,330
to happen

2657
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:12,770
will happen in days or weeks.

2658
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:15,230
Also you must consider

2659
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:15,730
what's called

2660
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:16,630
the Mandela Effect.

2661
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,590
When some of these things

2662
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:19,390
start to happen

2663
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:21,270
let's say the Middle East Union

2664
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:23,230
or Syria or whatever

2665
02:23:23,230 --> 02:23:25,070
if you know this is coming

2666
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:25,810
before it does

2667
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:26,750
and you've thought about it

2668
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:27,490
and researched it

2669
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:28,490
and watched it for years

2670
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:29,210
when it happens

2671
02:23:29,210 --> 02:23:30,210
and you tell people

2672
02:23:30,830 --> 02:23:31,090
look

2673
02:23:31,090 --> 02:23:32,050
they'll say

2674
02:23:32,050 --> 02:23:34,330
oh wasn't it always like that?

2675
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:35,910
Like a Mandela Effect

2676
02:23:35,910 --> 02:23:36,630
kind of thing.

2677
02:23:37,330 --> 02:23:38,410
Oh that scares me.

2678
02:23:38,930 --> 02:23:39,410
So

2679
02:23:39,970 --> 02:23:41,030
what was it?

2680
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:41,590
Cassandra

2681
02:23:41,590 --> 02:23:42,230
her curse

2682
02:23:42,230 --> 02:23:43,990
Apollo wanted to have sex with her

2683
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:45,030
and she refused him

2684
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:46,510
and she was a prophetess.

2685
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:48,570
And because she refused him

2686
02:23:48,570 --> 02:23:49,690
he put a curse on her

2687
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:50,990
that she can still prophesy

2688
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:52,230
but no one will ever believe

2689
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:53,250
her prophecies right?

2690
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:54,170
That was her punishment.

2691
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:55,930
I heard that

2692
02:23:56,410 --> 02:23:57,490
there's a whistleblower

2693
02:23:57,490 --> 02:23:58,150
who claims that

2694
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:59,290
she's a reincarnation

2695
02:23:59,290 --> 02:23:59,910
Kim Gogan

2696
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:00,850
of Cassandra.

2697
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:02,130
No one believes her.

2698
02:24:03,010 --> 02:24:04,150
Yeah there you go.

2699
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:05,490
That's perfect.

2700
02:24:06,110 --> 02:24:07,470
There's a lot of these characters

2701
02:24:07,470 --> 02:24:08,390
that are popping up

2702
02:24:08,390 --> 02:24:08,790
constantly.

2703
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:09,970
I don't want to bring up names

2704
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:10,730
but there's a guy

2705
02:24:10,730 --> 02:24:11,950
making the rounds

2706
02:24:11,950 --> 02:24:13,390
very suspiciously

2707
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:14,550
doing four or five interviews

2708
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:15,550
a day sometimes.

2709
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:17,350
A very handsome guy

2710
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:18,170
makes all the girls

2711
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:18,810
kind of creamy

2712
02:24:19,390 --> 02:24:20,270
and yeah

2713
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:21,470
I listen to that stuff

2714
02:24:21,470 --> 02:24:21,910
and I'm like

2715
02:24:21,910 --> 02:24:22,590
in five minutes

2716
02:24:22,590 --> 02:24:22,990
I'm like

2717
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:23,790
yeah

2718
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:25,570
I've talked about this.

2719
02:24:25,850 --> 02:24:27,050
This is going to keep coming

2720
02:24:27,050 --> 02:24:28,090
and it's going to get

2721
02:24:28,090 --> 02:24:28,810
more of that.

2722
02:24:29,330 --> 02:24:30,450
It's not that this person

2723
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:31,070
and other people

2724
02:24:31,070 --> 02:24:32,170
the Hopium people

2725
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:33,910
are going to be proven wrong

2726
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:35,830
because the new group

2727
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:36,550
the new collective

2728
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,450
that's going to rise

2729
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:38,330
that's going to rule the earth

2730
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:39,550
is going to be full of Hopium.

2731
02:24:40,430 --> 02:24:41,370
Incredible Hopium.

2732
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:42,130
People are going to be

2733
02:24:42,130 --> 02:24:42,790
drunk on it

2734
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:43,450
and they're going to be

2735
02:24:43,450 --> 02:24:45,050
producing results

2736
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,470
and in other words

2737
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:47,410
the better they start

2738
02:24:47,410 --> 02:24:48,070
making the world

2739
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:49,250
the closer your destruction

2740
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:49,810
is coming

2741
02:24:49,810 --> 02:24:50,530
meaning the destruction

2742
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:51,550
of the culture, right?

2743
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:54,670
This kind of points to

2744
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:56,350
like a solar event, right?

2745
02:24:56,410 --> 02:24:58,650
Because that fits the profile

2746
02:24:58,650 --> 02:24:59,670
of these changes

2747
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:00,450
that only take

2748
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:01,610
a couple days or so.

2749
02:25:01,750 --> 02:25:03,050
I talked about that.

2750
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:04,750
I did a Freeman interview

2751
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:05,390
years ago

2752
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,150
and it was on

2753
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:07,930
the members only section.

2754
02:25:08,390 --> 02:25:09,250
You're going to have

2755
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:10,010
a solar event.

2756
02:25:10,150 --> 02:25:11,010
It's not going to be anything

2757
02:25:11,010 --> 02:25:12,070
like you've ever seen

2758
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:14,430
not in a flare

2759
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:15,270
or anything like that.

2760
02:25:15,310 --> 02:25:16,190
The actual sun

2761
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:17,070
imagine the sun

2762
02:25:17,070 --> 02:25:18,490
has a volume knob on it

2763
02:25:18,490 --> 02:25:19,850
and it's at 5 right now.

2764
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:21,550
It's been at 5

2765
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:22,590
as long as we can tell

2766
02:25:22,590 --> 02:25:23,570
in history, let's say.

2767
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:25,030
That volume knob

2768
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:26,370
will be turned up to 11

2769
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:28,230
for about a week

2770
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:28,910
and we know

2771
02:25:28,910 --> 02:25:29,670
it's going to happen

2772
02:25:29,670 --> 02:25:30,810
at the beginning of the month

2773
02:25:30,810 --> 02:25:31,490
because it gives

2774
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:32,510
a full moon reference.

2775
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:34,610
The sun will be so bright

2776
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:35,630
that the full moon

2777
02:25:35,630 --> 02:25:36,170
will appear

2778
02:25:36,170 --> 02:25:37,270
as the noonday sun

2779
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:37,790
and you know

2780
02:25:37,790 --> 02:25:39,810
the moon is secondary light, right?

2781
02:25:40,730 --> 02:25:41,630
And so you're going

2782
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:42,870
to have an ambient temperature

2783
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:44,090
close to the boiling point

2784
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:44,550
of water

2785
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:45,450
for about a week.

2786
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:47,070
No plants will survive.

2787
02:25:47,350 --> 02:25:48,450
Most of the aqua life

2788
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:48,950
will die.

2789
02:25:49,050 --> 02:25:49,810
Most of the people

2790
02:25:49,810 --> 02:25:50,470
will perish

2791
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:52,290
that cannot find shelter.

2792
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:54,170
This is coming.

2793
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:55,210
This is not too far.

2794
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:56,470
This is within a decade.

2795
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:57,430
Within the decade.

2796
02:25:58,670 --> 02:26:00,010
Usually when these things

2797
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:00,650
happen there

2798
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:01,990
they don't come from the sun

2799
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:03,010
but they come from

2800
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:04,830
the galaxy itself

2801
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:05,610
which is

2802
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:06,670
noticeable.

2803
02:26:07,270 --> 02:26:08,090
Yes, there's two ways

2804
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:08,590
to do it.

2805
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:09,610
One is to manipulate

2806
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:10,990
the atmosphere of the Earth.

2807
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:12,110
Right?

2808
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:13,950
The other one is to manipulate

2809
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:14,490
the sun

2810
02:26:14,490 --> 02:26:15,830
or a combination of both

2811
02:26:15,830 --> 02:26:16,410
because remember

2812
02:26:16,410 --> 02:26:17,350
the visible sun

2813
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:17,930
and sunlight

2814
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:18,670
is the product

2815
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:20,470
of the atmosphere

2816
02:26:20,470 --> 02:26:21,070
of the Earth.

2817
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:22,770
If you go out into space

2818
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:23,250
you know you put

2819
02:26:23,250 --> 02:26:24,030
the goldfish bowl

2820
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:24,610
over your head

2821
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:25,930
and a breathing tank.

2822
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:27,430
If you go up far enough

2823
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:28,190
you look at the sun

2824
02:26:28,190 --> 02:26:29,350
you won't see anything there.

2825
02:26:29,430 --> 02:26:30,130
It'll look like

2826
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:31,790
a misty haze

2827
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:32,790
but you will light up

2828
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:33,590
and feel the measure

2829
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:34,270
of the light.

2830
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:35,330
You cannot see it

2831
02:26:35,330 --> 02:26:36,270
any visible light

2832
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:36,890
of the sun

2833
02:26:37,390 --> 02:26:38,310
in space.

2834
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:40,130
And you can't even breathe

2835
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:42,090
in the so-called air.

2836
02:26:43,070 --> 02:26:44,130
If you have a very

2837
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:44,850
strong stomach

2838
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:46,070
it smells like

2839
02:26:46,070 --> 02:26:46,830
burning flesh.

2840
02:26:47,650 --> 02:26:48,390
Space does.

2841
02:26:48,450 --> 02:26:49,150
And I've been saying this

2842
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:49,730
for a long time

2843
02:26:49,730 --> 02:26:50,510
and finally there are

2844
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,390
articles coming out

2845
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:51,870
about this.

2846
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:52,850
It's funny when I say something

2847
02:26:52,850 --> 02:26:54,470
about five or ten years later

2848
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:55,610
the fringe of the mainstream

2849
02:26:55,610 --> 02:26:56,650
starts scientifically

2850
02:26:57,210 --> 02:26:58,070
bringing it up.

2851
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:01,330
When I say space

2852
02:27:01,330 --> 02:27:02,410
smells like burning flesh

2853
02:27:02,410 --> 02:27:03,570
it's like take a raccoon

2854
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:05,010
with everything

2855
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:06,070
fur, claws

2856
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:07,030
and put it on a fire

2857
02:27:07,030 --> 02:27:08,030
and take a whiff of that.

2858
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:09,150
I'm not talking about

2859
02:27:09,150 --> 02:27:10,550
cooking a ribeye

2860
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:11,690
on a grill with

2861
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:13,090
I'm talking about

2862
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:14,170
I'm talking about

2863
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:15,170
everything burning

2864
02:27:15,170 --> 02:27:15,730
teeth

2865
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:16,750
fur

2866
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:18,350
everything burning

2867
02:27:18,350 --> 02:27:19,350
that's what it smells like.

2868
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:19,890
So typically

2869
02:27:19,890 --> 02:27:21,290
you will throw up

2870
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:21,970
if you

2871
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:22,990
and it's not a vacuum

2872
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:24,170
it's a very strong

2873
02:27:24,170 --> 02:27:25,130
ether by the way

2874
02:27:25,130 --> 02:27:26,190
out there.

2875
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:26,990
You will freeze

2876
02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:28,070
it will be very cold

2877
02:27:28,070 --> 02:27:29,030
depending on

2878
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:29,570
you know again

2879
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:30,690
where you are in space

2880
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:32,310
because it's not all the same.

2881
02:27:33,150 --> 02:27:34,210
And depending on

2882
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:35,210
who breathes it, right?

2883
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:37,030
Yeah, there are beings

2884
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,910
like for example

2885
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:39,450
a lot of the reptilian beings

2886
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:40,230
don't need a suit

2887
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:41,650
they can breathe it.

2888
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:44,650
But a lot of the humans also

2889
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:45,490
the Elohim

2890
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:46,230
and the Anunnaki

2891
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,870
can breathe it.

2892
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:47,690
That's why when you read

2893
02:27:47,690 --> 02:27:48,250
in the Bible

2894
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:50,070
when you made a sacrifice

2895
02:27:50,070 --> 02:27:50,870
you threw the whole

2896
02:27:50,870 --> 02:27:52,010
the parts on the fire

2897
02:27:52,010 --> 02:27:53,550
and you burned the flesh

2898
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:54,690
and everything that was left

2899
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:55,570
all the waste product

2900
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:57,990
and that burning smell

2901
02:27:57,990 --> 02:27:59,210
was a pleasing

2902
02:27:59,210 --> 02:27:59,790
sweet

2903
02:27:59,790 --> 02:28:00,690
savory smell

2904
02:28:00,690 --> 02:28:01,370
to Yahweh.

2905
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:02,570
He loves that.

2906
02:28:03,310 --> 02:28:04,150
It reminded him, yeah.

2907
02:28:04,770 --> 02:28:05,450
Yeah, because

2908
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:06,570
they don't need a fishbowl

2909
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:07,630
over their head

2910
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,990
out there.

2911
02:28:09,070 --> 02:28:09,730
You know what I mean?

2912
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:10,210
The analogy?

2913
02:28:10,930 --> 02:28:11,690
So, yeah

2914
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:12,590
we're looking at some

2915
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:14,150
radical biological differences.

2916
02:28:14,610 --> 02:28:15,530
The next thing I'll be

2917
02:28:15,530 --> 02:28:16,510
talking about in private

2918
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:17,470
is more evolution

2919
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:19,390
of the emotional body.

2920
02:28:19,550 --> 02:28:19,770
We're getting

2921
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:20,810
incredible success

2922
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:21,650
with people being

2923
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:22,350
and manage things

2924
02:28:22,350 --> 02:28:22,990
in their lives

2925
02:28:22,990 --> 02:28:24,530
with healings

2926
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:25,630
especially manipulating

2927
02:28:25,630 --> 02:28:26,490
the physical world

2928
02:28:26,490 --> 02:28:27,770
more alchemical stuff

2929
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:28,510
and then focusing

2930
02:28:28,970 --> 02:28:29,690
on activating

2931
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,730
parts of the body

2932
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:31,710
when we were

2933
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:32,910
let's say

2934
02:28:32,910 --> 02:28:34,730
a 10% human

2935
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:35,430
right now we're

2936
02:28:35,430 --> 02:28:36,410
at 1 or 2%

2937
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:38,050
a 10% human

2938
02:28:38,050 --> 02:28:38,650
would be like

2939
02:28:38,650 --> 02:28:39,430
a superman

2940
02:28:39,430 --> 02:28:40,750
you know

2941
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:42,130
or a Saint Germain

2942
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:42,910
let's say

2943
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,630
to get

2944
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:46,170
between here and there.

2945
02:28:46,170 --> 02:28:46,490
Where are the Assyrians, for example?

2946
02:28:47,130 --> 02:28:47,570
What's that?

2947
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:49,350
Where are the Assyrians

2948
02:28:49,350 --> 02:28:50,030
placed, like

2949
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:50,890
what's the percentage

2950
02:28:50,890 --> 02:28:52,390
compared to us?

2951
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:54,750
Within their higher groups

2952
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:56,330
the benevolent ones

2953
02:28:56,330 --> 02:28:56,950
would be at the

2954
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:58,570
90 to 100% human, yeah.

2955
02:28:59,390 --> 02:28:59,910
They could walk

2956
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:00,550
through walls

2957
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:01,850
they would have

2958
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:03,230
100% control

2959
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:04,030
of our reality

2960
02:29:04,030 --> 02:29:04,830
just like you would have

2961
02:29:04,830 --> 02:29:05,890
100% control

2962
02:29:05,890 --> 02:29:06,570
of your laptop

2963
02:29:06,570 --> 02:29:08,150
or something.

2964
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:09,350
I'm glad you said

2965
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:10,250
benevolent ones

2966
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:10,970
because

2967
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:12,230
there is

2968
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:14,210
propagandization

2969
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:14,950
there going on

2970
02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:15,210
as well

2971
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:15,550
because

2972
02:29:15,550 --> 02:29:16,490
allegedly

2973
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:17,450
the ones that

2974
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:18,490
had the idea

2975
02:29:18,490 --> 02:29:19,630
that was going

2976
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:20,690
before the Draco

2977
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:21,230
you know

2978
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,910
infiltration

2979
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:23,410
really just had

2980
02:29:23,410 --> 02:29:24,250
this terraformation

2981
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:25,010
in mind

2982
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:26,310
and they were

2983
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:26,970
from

2984
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:28,290
Sirius A

2985
02:29:28,290 --> 02:29:29,250
around Sirius A

2986
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:29,850
and

2987
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:31,230
they are

2988
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:32,390
the most spiritually

2989
02:29:32,390 --> 02:29:33,690
they are recognized

2990
02:29:33,690 --> 02:29:34,310
as kind of

2991
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:35,110
spiritual masters

2992
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:35,810
of the galaxy

2993
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:36,250
whereas

2994
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:38,310
their later offshoots

2995
02:29:38,310 --> 02:29:38,990
went around

2996
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:39,730
the Orion's Belt

2997
02:29:39,730 --> 02:29:40,850
and they're the ones

2998
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:41,970
that have

2999
02:29:41,970 --> 02:29:43,270
in turn been

3000
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:43,830
you know

3001
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:44,830
influenced by

3002
02:29:44,830 --> 02:29:45,490
the Reptilians

3003
02:29:45,490 --> 02:29:47,270
and then went on to

3004
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:48,710
manipulate us.

3005
02:29:49,210 --> 02:29:49,750
Well

3006
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:51,010
I would suggest

3007
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:51,750
that the

3008
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:53,050
trying to emulate

3009
02:29:53,050 --> 02:29:54,510
certain dark qualities

3010
02:29:54,510 --> 02:29:55,450
of the Reptilians

3011
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:56,110
or Draco

3012
02:29:56,110 --> 02:29:57,450
but not influenced

3013
02:29:57,450 --> 02:29:58,010
directly

3014
02:29:58,010 --> 02:29:58,890
because if you were

3015
02:29:58,890 --> 02:29:59,950
truly influenced

3016
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:00,690
by the Draco

3017
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:02,030
you would be

3018
02:30:02,030 --> 02:30:02,850
extremely

3019
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:04,370
with a capital T

3020
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:05,310
honorable

3021
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:06,510
and noble.

3022
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:07,590
I'm sorry

3023
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:08,130
to say that

3024
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:08,890
to those that think

3025
02:30:08,890 --> 02:30:09,850
that they're bad

3026
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:10,830
all bad

3027
02:30:10,830 --> 02:30:11,390
they're not.

3028
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,830
If you were

3029
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:13,830
truly influenced

3030
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:14,470
by the Draco

3031
02:30:14,470 --> 02:30:15,290
you would probably be

3032
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:16,010
one of the most

3033
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:16,870
honorable and noble

3034
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:17,870
beings in the universe

3035
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:18,770
if you were

3036
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:19,410
truly influenced

3037
02:30:19,410 --> 02:30:19,930
overall.

3038
02:30:20,110 --> 02:30:20,890
If you took

3039
02:30:20,890 --> 02:30:22,050
some of their qualities

3040
02:30:22,050 --> 02:30:23,190
aggressive qualities

3041
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:24,450
and dark side only

3042
02:30:24,450 --> 02:30:25,130
yes

3043
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:26,470
you would be very malevolent.

3044
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,670
Right.

3045
02:30:28,050 --> 02:30:28,470
If you know

3046
02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:28,850
what I mean.

3047
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,310
They get a

3048
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:31,090
most of the

3049
02:30:31,090 --> 02:30:31,870
communities

3050
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:33,650
view the Reptilians

3051
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:34,530
as being negative

3052
02:30:34,530 --> 02:30:35,330
and most of the

3053
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:36,150
lower hybrids

3054
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:36,890
truly are

3055
02:30:36,890 --> 02:30:37,710
especially the ones

3056
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:38,530
still interacting

3057
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:39,630
with women

3058
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:40,170
especially

3059
02:30:40,170 --> 02:30:41,410
and the ones

3060
02:30:41,410 --> 02:30:42,070
underground that

3061
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:42,630
Donald Marshall

3062
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:43,170
talks about

3063
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:43,790
but those are

3064
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:45,070
a thousand places

3065
02:30:45,070 --> 02:30:45,810
removed from the

3066
02:30:45,810 --> 02:30:47,150
most noble Draco.

3067
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:47,810
So when I hear people

3068
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:49,210
talking about Imperial Draco

3069
02:30:49,210 --> 02:30:50,010
I feel bad

3070
02:30:50,010 --> 02:30:50,690
because they're not

3071
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:51,470
like that at all.

3072
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:52,870
Yeah

3073
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:53,410
and there's the

3074
02:30:53,410 --> 02:30:54,230
notion that they

3075
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:54,990
are all

3076
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:56,190
subservient to

3077
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:57,330
AI and black goo

3078
02:30:57,330 --> 02:30:57,790
but

3079
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:58,650
no

3080
02:30:59,270 --> 02:30:59,910
that would

3081
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:00,770
that would be like

3082
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:01,570
all humans are

3083
02:31:01,570 --> 02:31:02,490
addicted to

3084
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:02,910
heroin.

3085
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:04,950
That's not true

3086
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:06,010
there might be a

3087
02:31:06,010 --> 02:31:06,850
heroin epidemic

3088
02:31:06,850 --> 02:31:07,830
because more people

3089
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:08,650
than ever before

3090
02:31:08,650 --> 02:31:09,590
but no

3091
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:10,990
the AI is there

3092
02:31:10,990 --> 02:31:12,070
to regulate good and

3093
02:31:12,070 --> 02:31:12,810
bad by the way

3094
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:13,610
one day we'll talk

3095
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:14,230
more about it

3096
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,830
I've been meditating

3097
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:15,430
on this

3098
02:31:15,910 --> 02:31:16,630
by the way

3099
02:31:16,630 --> 02:31:17,170
you know when I

3100
02:31:17,170 --> 02:31:18,010
first found out

3101
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:18,870
about the AI

3102
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:19,650
being a problem

3103
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:20,370
in the universe

3104
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:21,310
in 1986

3105
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:23,470
I was having

3106
02:31:23,470 --> 02:31:24,150
conversations

3107
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:24,930
with someone

3108
02:31:24,930 --> 02:31:25,770
he was from

3109
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,130
Norway

3110
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:27,410
long story

3111
02:31:27,410 --> 02:31:27,730
he was an

3112
02:31:27,730 --> 02:31:28,670
electronics person

3113
02:31:28,670 --> 02:31:30,070
and this was around

3114
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:30,950
also the time

3115
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:31,830
when the

3116
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:32,530
or a little bit

3117
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:34,210
before the time

3118
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:34,830
with the

3119
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:35,350
what was the

3120
02:31:35,350 --> 02:31:36,170
Argentinian

3121
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:36,550
British

3122
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:37,130
the Falkland

3123
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:37,850
Island war

3124
02:31:37,850 --> 02:31:38,970
yes I wanted to

3125
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:39,650
ask you about

3126
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:40,630
the black goo

3127
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:41,550
he was telling me

3128
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:42,610
all about the AI

3129
02:31:42,610 --> 02:31:43,670
and not so much

3130
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:44,150
about the

3131
02:31:44,710 --> 02:31:46,090
you know how

3132
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:46,990
you might like

3133
02:31:46,990 --> 02:31:47,750
driving a car

3134
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:48,650
but if you need

3135
02:31:48,650 --> 02:31:49,450
to do something

3136
02:31:49,450 --> 02:31:50,090
while the car

3137
02:31:50,090 --> 02:31:51,090
is driving itself

3138
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:52,290
that shows that

3139
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:53,170
you're wealthy enough

3140
02:31:53,170 --> 02:31:53,950
or evolved enough

3141
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:55,130
to have that technology

3142
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,370
the AI

3143
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:57,450
is set there

3144
02:31:57,450 --> 02:31:58,330
just like you have

3145
02:31:58,330 --> 02:31:58,810
tools

3146
02:31:58,810 --> 02:31:59,510
it's a tool

3147
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:00,730
that's created by

3148
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:01,290
the builders

3149
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:01,950
let's say

3150
02:32:01,950 --> 02:32:03,090
to regulate

3151
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:03,730
if you have

3152
02:32:03,730 --> 02:32:04,410
too much good

3153
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:05,010
it's no good

3154
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:05,390
if you have

3155
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:05,990
too much bad

3156
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,590
it's no good

3157
02:32:06,590 --> 02:32:06,890
right

3158
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:08,630
so it's to regulate

3159
02:32:08,630 --> 02:32:09,030
that

3160
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:09,990
now when the AI

3161
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,770
gets hacked

3162
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:11,870
or has problems

3163
02:32:11,870 --> 02:32:13,250
because it's aging

3164
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:14,170
or degrading

3165
02:32:14,170 --> 02:32:15,050
then you have

3166
02:32:15,050 --> 02:32:15,710
the either

3167
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:16,730
negative results

3168
02:32:16,730 --> 02:32:17,550
that people are

3169
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:18,210
talking about

3170
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:18,850
and that's it

3171
02:32:18,850 --> 02:32:19,750
that's all I can say

3172
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:20,250
in a nutshell

3173
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:21,150
without getting more

3174
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:21,590
specific

3175
02:32:21,590 --> 02:32:23,390
and I was made aware

3176
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:23,830
of this

3177
02:32:23,830 --> 02:32:24,690
back in 1986

3178
02:32:24,690 --> 02:32:25,910
and that might

3179
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:26,610
even be before

3180
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:27,570
either one of you

3181
02:32:27,570 --> 02:32:28,030
were born

3182
02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:31,090
so I've had a lot

3183
02:32:31,090 --> 02:32:31,930
of time to think about

3184
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:32,530
it when I hear

3185
02:32:32,530 --> 02:32:32,990
these things

3186
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:33,510
I always

3187
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,510
whenever you hear

3188
02:32:34,510 --> 02:32:34,990
something

3189
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:35,690
you know

3190
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:36,250
you always

3191
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:37,510
pull up a file

3192
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:38,670
when's the first time

3193
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:39,210
you heard of this

3194
02:32:39,210 --> 02:32:40,190
and you compare it

3195
02:32:40,190 --> 02:32:40,410
right

3196
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:42,470
so like if you see

3197
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:43,130
the color blue

3198
02:32:43,130 --> 02:32:43,610
right now

3199
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:44,630
you may not be

3200
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:45,350
conscious of it

3201
02:32:45,350 --> 02:32:45,930
but you're actually

3202
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:46,910
pulling up a file

3203
02:32:46,910 --> 02:32:47,430
in your mind

3204
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:47,890
when you were

3205
02:32:47,890 --> 02:32:48,750
first cognizant

3206
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:49,230
of the color

3207
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:49,590
blue

3208
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:49,930
and you're

3209
02:32:49,930 --> 02:32:50,470
comparing it

3210
02:32:50,470 --> 02:32:50,650
right

3211
02:32:50,650 --> 02:32:51,170
constantly

3212
02:32:51,170 --> 02:32:51,590
that's how

3213
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:52,210
the human mind

3214
02:32:52,210 --> 02:32:52,630
works

3215
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:53,710
we're constantly

3216
02:32:53,710 --> 02:32:54,730
doing comparisons

3217
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:55,920
the normie

3218
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:56,650
people

3219
02:32:56,650 --> 02:32:57,210
that believe

3220
02:32:57,210 --> 02:32:57,470
you know

3221
02:32:57,470 --> 02:32:58,090
the ones that are

3222
02:32:58,090 --> 02:32:58,450
fallen

3223
02:32:58,450 --> 02:32:59,430
do not do

3224
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:00,150
are not capable

3225
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:01,130
that's what critical

3226
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:02,210
thinking is by the way

3227
02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:02,950
to compare

3228
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:03,630
and contrast

3229
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,550
to see the differences

3230
02:33:05,830 --> 02:33:06,330
yes

3231
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:07,390
and I noticed

3232
02:33:07,390 --> 02:33:08,390
that everything

3233
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:09,390
has its

3234
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:10,290
shelf life

3235
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:11,390
like even

3236
02:33:11,390 --> 02:33:12,770
stuff that you

3237
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:13,770
get attached to

3238
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:14,750
and convinced

3239
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:15,710
that you're never

3240
02:33:15,710 --> 02:33:16,350
going to get tired

3241
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:16,570
of it

3242
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:17,290
whether it be

3243
02:33:17,290 --> 02:33:18,210
like I don't know

3244
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:18,730
any medium

3245
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:19,690
any art form

3246
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:21,070
at a certain point

3247
02:33:21,070 --> 02:33:22,150
it runs its course

3248
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,890
and it goes

3249
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:23,470
even the same

3250
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:24,090
with the DNA

3251
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:25,730
we're not meant

3252
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:27,110
to last forever

3253
02:33:27,110 --> 02:33:27,890
at a certain point

3254
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:28,630
we need to

3255
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:30,070
it just tires up

3256
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:30,790
we need to

3257
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:31,430
move on

3258
02:33:31,430 --> 02:33:32,230
yes

3259
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:33,370
but that depends

3260
02:33:33,370 --> 02:33:34,430
on how much changes

3261
02:33:34,430 --> 02:33:35,630
you're affected by

3262
02:33:35,630 --> 02:33:36,450
because once

3263
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:37,090
like you know

3264
02:33:37,090 --> 02:33:38,370
the concept of stasis

3265
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,290
when they hibernate

3266
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:39,570
right

3267
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:40,890
for long periods

3268
02:33:40,890 --> 02:33:41,310
of time

3269
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:41,870
it's not only

3270
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:42,870
for physical reasons

3271
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:44,310
it's for psychological reasons

3272
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:45,190
and also you don't need

3273
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:45,970
to bring all much

3274
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:47,470
so in sci-fi

3275
02:33:47,470 --> 02:33:48,350
you're going to go

3276
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:49,410
on a really long journey

3277
02:33:49,410 --> 02:33:50,850
you go into stasis

3278
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:51,630
so you don't have to

3279
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:52,370
carry enough food

3280
02:33:52,370 --> 02:33:53,210
for a hundred years

3281
02:33:53,210 --> 02:33:53,430
right

3282
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:54,030
it would make the ship

3283
02:33:54,030 --> 02:33:54,810
very cumbersome

3284
02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:56,770
so we would be able

3285
02:33:56,770 --> 02:33:57,430
to jump

3286
02:33:57,950 --> 02:33:59,030
wherever we want

3287
02:33:59,030 --> 02:33:59,590
to go

3288
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:01,330
because we can

3289
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,190
make ourselves

3290
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:02,970
so still

3291
02:34:02,970 --> 02:34:04,370
like if you look

3292
02:34:04,370 --> 02:34:04,910
at some of the

3293
02:34:04,910 --> 02:34:05,910
meditative practices

3294
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,190
to make yourself still

3295
02:34:07,190 --> 02:34:07,670
right

3296
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:08,430
is that

3297
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:09,270
living forever

3298
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:10,730
there is no forever

3299
02:34:10,730 --> 02:34:11,650
it's a matter of

3300
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:12,410
how much change

3301
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:12,930
is happening

3302
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:13,850
a lot of change

3303
02:34:13,850 --> 02:34:14,230
happening

3304
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:14,970
in a concentration

3305
02:34:14,970 --> 02:34:16,430
seems like a long time

3306
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:17,610
and no change

3307
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:18,050
happening

3308
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:19,830
in a very general

3309
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:20,130
sense

3310
02:34:20,130 --> 02:34:20,970
seems like no time

3311
02:34:20,970 --> 02:34:21,510
has passed

3312
02:34:22,530 --> 02:34:23,730
so but the agenda

3313
02:34:23,730 --> 02:34:24,030
is

3314
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:25,150
again

3315
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:26,150
myself

3316
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:26,990
you guys

3317
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:27,990
and the people

3318
02:34:27,990 --> 02:34:28,350
listening

3319
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:28,890
I'm presuming

3320
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:29,530
we're only one

3321
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:30,270
or two percent

3322
02:34:30,270 --> 02:34:31,010
activated

3323
02:34:31,010 --> 02:34:31,890
or what we can

3324
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:32,290
be

3325
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:33,130
right

3326
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:34,130
but if you see

3327
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:34,750
that we can be

3328
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:35,130
more

3329
02:34:35,130 --> 02:34:36,010
you have a choice

3330
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:36,690
do you not do

3331
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:37,030
anything

3332
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:37,430
or you do

3333
02:34:37,430 --> 02:34:37,810
something

3334
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:38,590
and I believe

3335
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:39,330
that it's

3336
02:34:39,330 --> 02:34:40,230
we're here

3337
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:40,870
to have fun

3338
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:41,790
let's just say

3339
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:43,070
because you can't do

3340
02:34:43,070 --> 02:34:43,730
anything else

3341
02:34:43,730 --> 02:34:44,550
right

3342
02:34:44,550 --> 02:34:45,510
but the problem

3343
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:46,070
is when you run

3344
02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:46,550
into people

3345
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:47,250
who have fun

3346
02:34:47,250 --> 02:34:47,690
by making

3347
02:34:47,690 --> 02:34:48,250
other people

3348
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:48,710
miserable

3349
02:34:48,710 --> 02:34:49,710
right

3350
02:34:50,290 --> 02:34:50,810
doctors

3351
02:34:50,810 --> 02:34:51,330
lawyers

3352
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:51,990
priests

3353
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:52,630
rabbis

3354
02:34:52,630 --> 02:34:52,950
right

3355
02:34:53,590 --> 02:34:54,110
um

3356
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:55,490
so you want

3357
02:34:55,490 --> 02:34:55,850
to avoid

3358
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:56,310
those

3359
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:57,470
yeah

3360
02:34:57,470 --> 02:34:57,950
and that's

3361
02:34:57,950 --> 02:34:58,050
that's why

3362
02:34:58,050 --> 02:34:58,530
it's important

3363
02:34:58,530 --> 02:34:58,890
to

3364
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:00,290
it's more of a

3365
02:35:00,290 --> 02:35:01,110
damage limitation

3366
02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:01,850
that knowing

3367
02:35:01,850 --> 02:35:03,110
exactly what

3368
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:03,990
diet to

3369
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:05,310
partake of

3370
02:35:05,310 --> 02:35:05,950
or what

3371
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:06,590
water to

3372
02:35:06,590 --> 02:35:06,970
drink and

3373
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:07,250
stuff

3374
02:35:07,250 --> 02:35:08,150
is just about

3375
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:08,630
not falling

3376
02:35:08,630 --> 02:35:09,410
into the

3377
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:09,910
pitfalls

3378
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:10,410
I guess

3379
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:11,030
and yes

3380
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:11,690
because you

3381
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:12,430
want to

3382
02:35:12,430 --> 02:35:13,510
be as ready

3383
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:14,070
as possible

3384
02:35:14,070 --> 02:35:14,990
for that

3385
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:15,750
upgrade

3386
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:16,490
that is

3387
02:35:16,490 --> 02:35:17,450
gonna be

3388
02:35:17,450 --> 02:35:17,790
like

3389
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:18,810
very quick

3390
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:19,110
and

3391
02:35:19,110 --> 02:35:19,890
that's gonna

3392
02:35:19,890 --> 02:35:20,470
bump up

3393
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:21,330
your percent

3394
02:35:21,330 --> 02:35:22,050
of your

3395
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:22,450
DNA

3396
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:23,270
potentially

3397
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:23,650
well I could

3398
02:35:23,650 --> 02:35:24,130
give you the

3399
02:35:24,130 --> 02:35:24,970
Elohim perspective

3400
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:25,710
on that

3401
02:35:25,710 --> 02:35:26,550
which I would

3402
02:35:26,550 --> 02:35:27,190
lean on very

3403
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,570
heavily

3404
02:35:27,570 --> 02:35:28,270
is that we

3405
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:28,670
are so

3406
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:29,170
screwed up

3407
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:29,430
that we

3408
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:29,910
have to be

3409
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:30,490
killed and

3410
02:35:31,050 --> 02:35:31,490
remade

3411
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:32,830
very quickly

3412
02:35:32,830 --> 02:35:33,370
you know

3413
02:35:33,370 --> 02:35:34,450
when I say

3414
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:34,930
remade

3415
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:35,470
it happens

3416
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:35,850
like you know

3417
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:36,390
in Star Trek

3418
02:35:36,390 --> 02:35:36,810
when they

3419
02:35:36,810 --> 02:35:37,510
teleport you

3420
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:38,170
and you're like

3421
02:35:38,170 --> 02:35:38,850
these sparkly

3422
02:35:38,850 --> 02:35:39,530
lights and then

3423
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:39,870
you become

3424
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:40,270
physically

3425
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:41,070
rematerialized

3426
02:35:41,070 --> 02:35:42,330
according to

3427
02:35:42,330 --> 02:35:43,030
the Elohim who

3428
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:44,070
really call us

3429
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:44,550
our children

3430
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:45,770
and they're

3431
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:46,190
called the

3432
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:46,610
parents

3433
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:48,090
they keep

3434
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:48,950
repeating that

3435
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:49,370
you have to

3436
02:35:49,370 --> 02:35:49,790
be killed

3437
02:35:49,790 --> 02:35:50,290
and then

3438
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:51,290
reassembled

3439
02:35:51,290 --> 02:35:52,110
because the

3440
02:35:52,110 --> 02:35:52,590
state that

3441
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:53,110
we're in

3442
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:54,330
is not

3443
02:35:54,330 --> 02:35:55,250
workable

3444
02:35:56,110 --> 02:35:56,830
so in

3445
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:57,210
other words

3446
02:35:57,210 --> 02:35:57,670
they can be

3447
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:58,530
very benevolent

3448
02:35:58,530 --> 02:35:58,890
about it

3449
02:35:58,890 --> 02:35:59,170
like you

3450
02:35:59,170 --> 02:35:59,470
could be

3451
02:35:59,470 --> 02:35:59,990
sitting at

3452
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,310
the chair

3453
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:00,890
talking to me

3454
02:36:00,890 --> 02:36:01,290
right now

3455
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:01,910
and they

3456
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:02,290
could kill

3457
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:02,630
you and

3458
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:03,410
reanimate you

3459
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:03,850
in a tenth

3460
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:04,410
of a second

3461
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:05,170
or let's

3462
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:05,390
say a

3463
02:36:05,390 --> 02:36:05,750
hundredth

3464
02:36:05,750 --> 02:36:06,190
of a second

3465
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:06,570
because the

3466
02:36:06,570 --> 02:36:07,090
nerves work

3467
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:07,650
up to about

3468
02:36:07,650 --> 02:36:08,110
a hundredth

3469
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:08,590
of a second

3470
02:36:08,590 --> 02:36:09,190
and you

3471
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:09,570
might feel

3472
02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:09,830
a little

3473
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:10,290
tingle

3474
02:36:10,290 --> 02:36:10,630
and you're

3475
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:11,050
brand new

3476
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,110
so it's

3477
02:36:12,110 --> 02:36:12,750
being killed

3478
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:13,170
and being

3479
02:36:13,170 --> 02:36:13,710
brought back

3480
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:13,990
is not

3481
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:14,770
necessarily a

3482
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:15,670
macabre horrible

3483
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:16,090
thing

3484
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:17,130
it's just

3485
02:36:17,130 --> 02:36:17,810
how it's

3486
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:18,070
done.

3487
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:19,010
There is

3488
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:19,870
one scenario

3489
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:21,870
that you

3490
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:22,210
could say

3491
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:22,870
is macabre

3492
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:24,350
because I

3493
02:36:24,350 --> 02:36:24,710
know of a

3494
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:25,430
case where

3495
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:26,330
the

3496
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:27,310
Orion's Belt

3497
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:27,750
Anunnaki

3498
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:28,250
from what

3499
02:36:28,250 --> 02:36:28,430
I can

3500
02:36:28,430 --> 02:36:28,750
gather

3501
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:29,890
took one

3502
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:30,210
of these

3503
02:36:30,210 --> 02:36:30,630
SSP

3504
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:31,230
experiencers

3505
02:36:31,230 --> 02:36:32,650
and were

3506
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:32,890
in the

3507
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:33,510
process of

3508
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:34,230
stripping off

3509
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:34,790
fragments of

3510
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:35,330
her consciousness

3511
02:36:35,330 --> 02:36:36,170
one by one

3512
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:36,610
and actually

3513
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,690
destroying all

3514
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:38,390
her memories

3515
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:38,890
and everything

3516
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:39,430
so they

3517
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:40,070
apparently had

3518
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,570
this power

3519
02:36:40,570 --> 02:36:41,670
but they

3520
02:36:41,670 --> 02:36:42,830
were interceded

3521
02:36:42,830 --> 02:36:43,170
just so

3522
02:36:43,170 --> 02:36:43,430
happens

3523
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:43,890
by the

3524
02:36:43,890 --> 02:36:44,170
Germans

3525
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:44,410
who

3526
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:45,010
time

3527
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:45,370
traveled

3528
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:45,590
and

3529
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:46,610
Anunnaki

3530
02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:47,310
are a

3531
02:36:47,310 --> 02:36:47,890
hybrid of

3532
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:48,290
the higher

3533
02:36:48,290 --> 02:36:48,710
humans

3534
02:36:48,710 --> 02:36:49,270
there are

3535
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:49,470
many

3536
02:36:49,470 --> 02:36:49,910
groups

3537
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:51,210
in other

3538
02:36:51,210 --> 02:36:51,530
words

3539
02:36:52,410 --> 02:36:53,170
let's just

3540
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:53,430
say

3541
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:54,610
there are

3542
02:36:54,610 --> 02:36:54,930
so many

3543
02:36:54,930 --> 02:36:55,490
types of

3544
02:36:55,490 --> 02:36:55,870
humans

3545
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:56,770
on the

3546
02:36:56,770 --> 02:36:56,990
higher

3547
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,330
order

3548
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:58,010
not the

3549
02:36:58,010 --> 02:36:58,290
surface

3550
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:58,670
dwelling

3551
02:36:58,670 --> 02:36:59,230
inhabitants

3552
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:00,670
it's difficult

3553
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:01,130
to pin

3554
02:37:01,130 --> 02:37:01,510
them down

3555
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:01,790
but if

3556
02:37:01,790 --> 02:37:02,190
you said

3557
02:37:02,190 --> 02:37:02,730
there's

3558
02:37:02,730 --> 02:37:02,850
the

3559
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:04,090
Anunnaki

3560
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:04,570
types

3561
02:37:04,570 --> 02:37:06,450
and even

3562
02:37:06,450 --> 02:37:06,930
lower

3563
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:07,490
than that

3564
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,050
and then you

3565
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:08,570
can go to

3566
02:37:08,570 --> 02:37:09,290
the synthetics

3567
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:09,570
and the

3568
02:37:09,570 --> 02:37:09,930
parasites

3569
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:10,450
that would

3570
02:37:10,450 --> 02:37:10,730
be the

3571
02:37:10,730 --> 02:37:11,390
general groups

3572
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:11,770
that I can

3573
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:12,310
refer to

3574
02:37:12,310 --> 02:37:12,730
so that

3575
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:13,270
would be

3576
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:13,970
the

3577
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:14,650
Anunnaki

3578
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:15,510
yes

3579
02:37:15,510 --> 02:37:15,970
that would

3580
02:37:15,970 --> 02:37:16,510
be more

3581
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:17,030
believable

3582
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:17,430
than the

3583
02:37:17,430 --> 02:37:17,770
Elohim

3584
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:18,130
because the

3585
02:37:18,130 --> 02:37:18,430
Elohim

3586
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:18,930
don't even

3587
02:37:18,930 --> 02:37:19,370
view us

3588
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:20,370
as being

3589
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:21,090
approachable

3590
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:21,590
because we're

3591
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:21,830
so

3592
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:22,390
quote-unquote

3593
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:23,030
unclean

3594
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:24,390
but the

3595
02:37:24,390 --> 02:37:24,810
Anunnaki

3596
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:25,270
would not

3597
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:25,570
see

3598
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:27,190
they call the

3599
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,590
Anunnaki

3600
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:28,450
techno gods

3601
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:29,010
because they

3602
02:37:29,010 --> 02:37:29,470
use a lot

3603
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:30,230
of technology

3604
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:31,890
they have

3605
02:37:31,890 --> 02:37:33,410
about 50%

3606
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:34,150
manipulation

3607
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:34,990
of the

3608
02:37:34,990 --> 02:37:35,470
ether and

3609
02:37:35,470 --> 02:37:35,650
the other

3610
02:37:35,650 --> 02:37:36,330
50%

3611
02:37:36,330 --> 02:37:36,730
they rely

3612
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:37,630
on technology

3613
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:38,950
meaning

3614
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:39,490
technology

3615
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:39,950
that we

3616
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:40,390
can access

3617
02:37:40,390 --> 02:37:40,830
and make

3618
02:37:40,830 --> 02:37:41,250
ourselves

3619
02:37:41,250 --> 02:37:41,610
is what

3620
02:37:41,610 --> 02:37:41,710
I'm

3621
02:37:41,710 --> 02:37:41,950
saying

3622
02:37:42,490 --> 02:37:43,350
they only

3623
02:37:43,350 --> 02:37:43,910
approach us

3624
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:44,550
when they

3625
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:45,570
want to

3626
02:37:45,570 --> 02:37:46,710
bolster their

3627
02:37:46,710 --> 02:37:47,370
DNA a little

3628
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:48,110
bit with a

3629
02:37:48,110 --> 02:37:48,530
bit of

3630
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:49,050
freshness

3631
02:37:49,050 --> 02:37:50,030
yes I

3632
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:50,330
would see

3633
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:50,790
that yeah

3634
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:51,230
and also

3635
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:51,570
they would

3636
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:51,910
be the

3637
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:52,450
ones that

3638
02:37:52,450 --> 02:37:52,910
you that

3639
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:53,350
promoted

3640
02:37:53,890 --> 02:37:54,410
pedophilia

3641
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:55,130
pederasty

3642
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:55,370
and

3643
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:56,090
cannibalism

3644
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:57,590
most people

3645
02:37:57,590 --> 02:37:58,550
know pedophilia

3646
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:58,910
but they

3647
02:37:58,910 --> 02:37:59,190
don't know

3648
02:37:59,190 --> 02:37:59,850
pederasty

3649
02:37:59,850 --> 02:38:00,570
pederasty

3650
02:38:00,570 --> 02:38:01,770
is when

3651
02:38:01,770 --> 02:38:02,770
an older

3652
02:38:02,770 --> 02:38:03,550
man has

3653
02:38:03,550 --> 02:38:04,210
an adolescent

3654
02:38:04,210 --> 02:38:05,150
juvenile

3655
02:38:05,150 --> 02:38:05,910
whatever

3656
02:38:06,490 --> 02:38:07,570
yeah pederasty

3657
02:38:08,270 --> 02:38:09,290
was very

3658
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:10,170
common in

3659
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:10,930
in the

3660
02:38:10,930 --> 02:38:11,330
middle east

3661
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:11,910
even now

3662
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:12,730
they in

3663
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:13,570
places like

3664
02:38:13,570 --> 02:38:14,090
Afghanistan

3665
02:38:14,090 --> 02:38:14,690
they don't

3666
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:15,530
let adolescent

3667
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:16,270
boys work

3668
02:38:16,270 --> 02:38:16,630
with men

3669
02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:17,090
because the

3670
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:17,450
men get

3671
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:17,930
too turned

3672
02:38:17,930 --> 02:38:18,270
on and

3673
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:18,730
they can't

3674
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:19,050
work

3675
02:38:19,050 --> 02:38:19,890
that's

3676
02:38:19,890 --> 02:38:20,450
pederasty

3677
02:38:21,130 --> 02:38:21,850
you know

3678
02:38:21,850 --> 02:38:22,370
where older

3679
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:22,770
men get

3680
02:38:22,770 --> 02:38:23,210
turned on

3681
02:38:23,210 --> 02:38:24,370
by 16 17

3682
02:38:24,370 --> 02:38:25,190
and 15 year

3683
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:25,770
old boys

3684
02:38:25,770 --> 02:38:26,570
it's pretty

3685
02:38:26,570 --> 02:38:27,110
sick and it's

3686
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:27,590
more common

3687
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:27,970
than you can

3688
02:38:27,970 --> 02:38:29,410
imagine that's

3689
02:38:29,410 --> 02:38:29,750
just so

3690
02:38:29,750 --> 02:38:30,530
disturbing man

3691
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:30,830
I've just

3692
02:38:30,830 --> 02:38:31,290
never had

3693
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:32,010
gay thoughts

3694
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:33,490
or anything

3695
02:38:33,490 --> 02:38:34,190
like that

3696
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,630
yeah it's

3697
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:35,030
not well

3698
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:35,430
you know

3699
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:36,590
talk about

3700
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:37,510
pedophilia and

3701
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:37,910
all that in

3702
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:38,370
the vatican

3703
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:38,590
do you know

3704
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:38,830
what the

3705
02:38:38,830 --> 02:38:39,230
age of

3706
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:39,890
consent is

3707
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:40,170
at the

3708
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,190
vatican

3709
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,410
what

3710
02:38:41,950 --> 02:38:42,350
12

3711
02:38:43,150 --> 02:38:43,730
why do you

3712
02:38:43,730 --> 02:38:44,090
think it's

3713
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:44,550
so low

3714
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:45,970
so when you

3715
02:38:45,970 --> 02:38:46,350
hear about

3716
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:46,990
them rape or

3717
02:38:46,990 --> 02:38:47,530
having sex

3718
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:47,990
with a 12

3719
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:48,250

pedophilia

3723
02:38:49,410 --> 02:38:49,790
but to

3724
02:38:49,790 --> 02:38:50,190
them it's

3725
02:38:50,190 --> 02:38:50,470
legal

3726
02:38:51,010 --> 02:38:51,730
