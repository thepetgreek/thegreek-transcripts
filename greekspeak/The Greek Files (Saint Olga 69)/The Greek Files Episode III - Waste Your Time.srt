1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,260
Greg, I sincerely appreciate you making time, really.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,260
That's right.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,740
Okay, cool.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,700
My pleasure.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,340
Go ahead.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,300
Oh, my pleasure.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,460
Let's kick it off.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,260
Cool.

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,980
So I basically put together a big list

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,880
of stuff that I've been, I don't know,

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,320
wanting to answer or to revisit with you

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,680
and just go over.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,940
And one thing that I've been hearing some

15
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,300
buzz about, the drone thing brought it up

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,640
recently.

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,920
I know that's a big sigh, but who

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,120
I think behind it, from what I can

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,300
gather, is this whole Northcom entity that came

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,240
around after 9-11.

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,980
Do you know much about that?

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,340
I think it's straight north of you.

23
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,040
Yeah, it could be.

24
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,920
Here's the thing.

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
Let me just bring up a point that

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,800
I'd like to carry over on the rest

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,680
of the conversation.

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,440
And I'll show you how it applies to

29
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,520
anything we discuss.

30
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,180
Because I refer to us as surface-dwelling

31
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,540
earth inhabitants, and we live in a very

32
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,620
toxic environment.

33
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,140
Well, okay.

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,920
Yeah, we do.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, we know it's toxic.

36
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,580
No, I'm not talking about chemicals and pollution.

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm talking about mentally toxic, and I'm going

38
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,900
to mention the premise of everything is the

39
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,360
way society functions.

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,180
There's two categories.

41
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,340
You have the public and you have the

42
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,460
private, and I'll give you a quick example.

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,820
And we'll go back to the drones.

44
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,540
With the banking system, I borrowed money from

45
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,040
the bank.

46
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,300
I have to pay it back.

47
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,780
That's what they tell the public.

48
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,740
That's what everyone thinks.

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,660
But really, what's going on is the bank

50
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,380
has no money to lend you.

51
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,080
They just monetize your signature, and if you

52
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,920
confront them with that, they punish you.

53
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,720
So if you operate in the private, and

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,500
you know what's going on, you have a

55
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,380
much different attitude.

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,600
So what I mean by this is, if

57
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,040
we're going to go back to the drones,

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,100
there's a private side to what's going on.

59
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,380
And when you hear the term black ops,

60
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,000
secret operations, whatever, forget about those terms.

61
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,800
That's private.

62
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,720
It's a bunch of people pulling out some

63
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,960
private stuff that can only be, or organizations,

64
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,860
that can only be interpreted with public knowledge,

65
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,780
which is not compatible, if that makes sense.

66
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,540
No, you're right.

67
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,920
That's the dilemma I have.

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
I know I'm fed artificial feedback, all this

69
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
bullshit, and I try and make sense of

70
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:20,940
it.

71
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,980
I don't necessarily care about the drones, per

72
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,140
se.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,880
The public is allowed this much of a

74
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,820
threshold, a fraction, and then it's to mess

75
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,600
with us and do all these things.

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
But it's like, I don't know where, I

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
just- No, I get it.

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,380
Let me just say it this way, Zen,

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,260
or let me just stop you.

80
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,060
There is no rational way to describe what's

81
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,220
going on, logical, rational, feasible, acceptable way using

82
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,900
public parlance, what the public is told, will

83
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,420
not apply.

84
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,940
It's kind of like 19 Arab hijackers vaporized

85
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,780
the World Trade Center with box cutters.

86
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,040
Wait a second, Greg, that's not the official

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,240
story.

88
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,700
Yeah, tell me the official story and tell

89
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,780
me it makes more sense than what I

90
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,480
just said, right?

91
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,980
So it doesn't work.

92
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,700
It's just, so what I would suggest, in

93
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,640
this case, with this question, with the drone,

94
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,700
is what do you see?

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,820
What data can you gather and compile for

96
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,200
yourself?

97
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,160
And those that you would consider as being,

98
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,480
like Dan Pena would say, high performance people,

99
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,900
not this semi-intelligent tripe shit, and I'm

100
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,340
using the medical term there, right?

101
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,440
I mean, people that you consider to be

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,120
high performance, high functioning people, gather your own

103
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,700
data, put it together, hit the mute button,

104
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,680
look at the pictures, all right, that kind

105
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:33,980
of thing.

106
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,380
But what I've been aware of, what's going

107
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,280
on with the drones, just to segue back,

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,260
what is it?

109
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,720
It's a PSYOP, but what isn't a PSYOP,

110
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:42,960
right?

111
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,160
If you go to the grocery store, the

112
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,340
new packaging on a box of breakfast cereal

113
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,240
is a PSYOP also.

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
So what degree of a PSYOP?

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
I really don't care.

116
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,400
Personally, I think the mothership, you know, I'm

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
talking about like the two mile long mothership,

118
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,240
should enter our atmosphere and vaporize everyone on

119
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,780
the surface.

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,620
So a bunch of drones to me is

121
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,320
just a joke.

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,340
But anyway, that was, take that however you

123
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,120
want to do it.

124
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,300
So it is a joke.

125
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,740
I was just thinking, how do I breach

126
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,120
the surface of these entities that are underground

127
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,899
in Colorado Springs, things like that.

128
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,079
That kind of stuff always.

129
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
Well, how is there, you know, they say

130
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,800
mind your own business or, you know, miners

131
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,520
like to say that, mind your own business,

132
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,760
right?

133
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,820
I would just do that.

134
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,880
I mean, I'm not saying for you, that's

135
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
a bunch of folks that are, are they

136
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
getting away with it?

137
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,160
The answer is yes.

138
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,420
Right.

139
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,280
Because even the administration says, yes, we had,

140
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,940
we've heard about them.

141
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,600
We are aware of them, but we don't

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,340
know what they are.

143
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Isn't that the official answer typically?

144
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,840
So basically, it's a joke.

145
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Yeah.

146
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,300
All right.

147
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,160
But here's the thing.

148
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,160
So my point is here, we know these,

149
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,660
this is a private group, right?

150
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,900
And and they're doing their thing.

151
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,420
And yeah, it's a little inconvenient, psychologically, mentally,

152
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,060
socially or whatever.

153
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,820
But we're going to let them do their

154
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,080
thing.

155
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,140
That's basically it.

156
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,900
So let them do their thing.

157
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,940
Are they affecting you personally or your loved

158
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,280
ones?

159
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,380
The answer is no.

160
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,240
And out of it.

161
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,820
Oh, well, OK.

162
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,580
I think in an abstract way, they are

163
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,280
not to necessarily rebut you, sir.

164
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm just saying, like, they do that stuff

165
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,380
to see how we're going to handle it.

166
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
And then, OK, great.

167
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,160
Now they're going to pass drone legislation so

168
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,860
that they want to completely control the sky.

169
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
And I feel if they get enough pushback

170
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
from us, they I know it's a very

171
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
broad sweeping term.

172
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Well, maybe we should go public on how

173
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
to build a device that could send a

174
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
tennis ball through a brick wall.

175
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,800
I don't think they'll be up in the

176
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
sky for very long.

177
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,940
But anyway, that's another discussion.

178
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,580
Yeah, I'm just tired of being treated like

179
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,260
like a dumbass.

180
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,600
That's all.

181
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
No, you will.

182
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
Well, that's because you're not pursuing.

183
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm just saying, let's just let me say

184
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,540
this.

185
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,260
We're not pursuing high performance or stuff that's

186
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,280
in your category.

187
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,920
And you're actually allowing yourself to be downgraded.

188
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
I mean, just take that as a suggestion.

189
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,380
Right.

190
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,460
Like if I look at alternative whatever.

191
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,140
OK.

192
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,280
The alternative media online is public.

193
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,520
It's public stuff.

194
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,000
It's in public parlance.

195
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,260
It's what the public understands.

196
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
None of it makes sense because all of

197
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,380
this is being done in the private and

198
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,540
it's being shown publicly.

199
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,620
Yeah.

200
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,840
No, you're completely right.

201
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,140
But I think that one can understand if

202
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,300
one can understand that it's all crap and

203
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
then be able to analyze it and understand

204
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,040
to a certain level and realize, OK, what

205
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,980
part of this is a test?

206
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,200
What are they really saying here?

207
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,480
You know, what does this mean about the

208
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,180
powers that be?

209
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,080
You know, is it a front?

210
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
Is it a this or that?

211
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,080
And I think that's worth interpreting, I mean,

212
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,860
if one can.

213
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,820
And that's what I guess the advice I

214
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,640
see from you and I know that there's

215
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,820
many layers to all this.

216
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,720
You know, there's there's a lot.

217
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,940
It depends on what you want to put

218
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,960
your focus on.

219
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,200
Sure.

220
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,760
You know, like, for example, there's, I don't

221
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,460
know, 40 or 50 million people in the

222
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,120
U.S. on blood pressure medication.

223
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,720
And guess what?

224
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,980
Blood pressure is a fiction.

225
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,700
It's a medical.

226
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,640
It does not exist.

227
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
There is no pressure in the blood and

228
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,580
they're and they're dying from this medication.

229
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:46,980
Right.

230
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Same with diabetes.

231
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,580
There's no there's no measurement.

232
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,160
There's no way to measure blood glucose.

233
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,180
It's done by an analog that shows how

234
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,360
much hydrogen peroxide is revealed in the test.

235
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,400
There's no direct way.

236
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,060
So no one has these diseases that people

237
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,840
are succumbing to.

238
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,020
The treatment is the disease.

239
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,580
As they go with these false diagnoses and

240
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,480
get these treatments, it's the treatment that kills

241
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,520
them at a rate at a rate of

242
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,000
three million per year, even though the statistical

243
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,740
number is a million per year.

244
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,760
And I think that's a little bit more

245
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,980
of a concern, because what's going on with

246
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,780
the medical industry is is several fold more

247
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,560
severe than what was going on in National

248
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,120
Socialist Germany or any other, you know, bowl

249
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
pot in Cambodia or Stalin.

250
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,160
What they were doing is going on right

251
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,200
here, right now in the West, not just

252
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
the U.S., Canada as well.

253
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,560
And people are being unnecessarily right.

254
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,420
Destroyed literally.

255
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
I mean, I don't really care to some

256
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,260
example, because it's no one that I know.

257
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
But when I hear it's like, you know,

258
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,480
my dad died of diabetes or whatever, whatever

259
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
at 57.

260
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,100
And my mom is having a hard time

261
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
and I have three brothers and sisters.

262
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,580
I mean, you know, that's kind of shitty,

263
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,080
isn't it?

264
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,360
Right.

265
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,280
And he didn't ever had that in the

266
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,800
first place.

267
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,360
And I can mention like 90 percent of

268
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,580
the stuff they put out is fiction and

269
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,960
they're just killing people with the treatment.

270
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,820
To me, that's a little more on a

271
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,640
social level.

272
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,000
Right.

273
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,220
So but like I said, you know, I

274
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,200
have yeah, I don't have the only input

275
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,500
I have on you on this is start

276
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,800
looking at from a public versus private perspective.

277
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,240
You know, let me just interject this.

278
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,480
You're considered a minor.

279
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,020
I've been doing a lot of research in

280
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,620
this lately and come up with my, you

281
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,020
know, a minor someone less than 18, you

282
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,260
know, incompetent.

283
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,900
You need a custodian or someone over you.

284
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,140
All of the institutions you deal with, all

285
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,039
of the authorities, small or large, administrative, public,

286
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
private or whatever, you as a minor.

287
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,020
And what do you tell?

288
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,300
So let's say, you know, you have a

289
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
minor, a child, and he says, hey, man,

290
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,500
give me ten thousand bucks, your pickup truck

291
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,540
in your house for a week.

292
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,540
You're going to laugh at them, right, because

293
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,600
they can't, you know, handle it right or

294
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,240
anything like that.

295
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
So this is what's going on with information.

296
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,480
They're putting out information that's for a minor

297
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,620
and incompetent.

298
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,400
So you know, so on and so forth

299
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,820
in that vein, not people that are competent.

300
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,080
This is the public.

301
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,540
The public has always been this way.

302
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,060
Very well said.

303
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,600
I agree.

304
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,940
I'm going to ask, move back to something

305
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,420
you said earlier before I kick it to

306
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,860
Daniel, let him ask you some stuff.

307
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,380
But you said that I'm not in search

308
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,360
of anything, and so many words from what

309
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,040
I remember, that matters to, I guess, the

310
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,180
powers that be.

311
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,100
But OK, look, let's touch on, I don't

312
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,740
know if I was trying to design something

313
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,540
that's anti-gravitic or something to master my

314
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,820
environment more, that would be, I'm assuming, a

315
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,360
threat to the environment.

316
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,340
Yeah.

317
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,260
Well, here's the thing.

318
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,360
We live in a very toxic environment, not

319
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,720
chemically toxic, but mentally, socially, spiritually toxic.

320
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,120
And there are powers that be, but they're

321
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,160
not physical as much as we would like

322
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,700
them to be.

323
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,820
And they block us from mastering the physical

324
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,020
world every so often.

325
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,360
And very few are given that power.

326
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,980
And also, let me just put it this

327
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,260
way.

328
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Surface dwelling Earth inhabitants are the lowest form

329
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,880
of human existence on the planet.

330
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,240
In other words, we can get into it

331
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,400
more.

332
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,420
Living on the surface shows that you're very

333
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:21,820
primitive.

334
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,860
You don't know how to deal with your

335
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,360
environment.

336
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,280
All advanced societies do not live on the

337
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,540
surface.

338
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,740
They go underneath.

339
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,100
It's just like, okay, Daniel, I just built

340
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,900
a new house, and I feel like getting

341
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,140
new furniture for the new house.

342
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,740
Sound reasonable?

343
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,160
Sure.

344
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,460
So here comes the moving truck with all

345
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,900
the furniture, and I direct the people unloading

346
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,060
the truck to load my bedroom, living room,

347
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,660
dining room furniture, and put it on the

348
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,380
roof of my house because that's where I'm

349
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,000
going to be living.

350
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,200
What a kooky thing to do.

351
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,580
I'm going to be laughed at, right?

352
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,920
You put it inside the house.

353
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,380
So you do a flyby on the Earth,

354
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,080
and you see all this stuff built on

355
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,560
the surface.

356
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,020
You're like, leave those guys alone.

357
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,020
They're really dumb.

358
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,560
You live in the Earth, not on the

359
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,720
Earth.

360
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,320
So just that premise alone.

361
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,380
Could you imagine someone in your neighborhood living

362
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,480
on the roof of their house?

363
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,340
Would you consider them sane?

364
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,860
No, sir.

365
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,980
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,820
So let's use that premise to anchor your

367
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,940
other questions as well.

368
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,600
You're not dealing with anyone, right?

369
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,340
Let's talk about the guy who lives on

370
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,660
his roof 24-7.

371
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,900
How to transcend all that.

372
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm trying to think of a way to

373
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,240
ease into, without jumping too far.

374
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
I don't want you to slap me down,

375
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
but it's part of the learning process, and

376
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
we came to you with answers.

377
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,360
You're doing us the favor.

378
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,000
Enough kissing your ass and stuff.

379
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,220
I'm just saying, I don't ever want to

380
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,540
be a host that takes you for granted,

381
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,540
but I'm trying to think, how do I,

382
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,420
with this short amount of time on this

383
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,820
Earth, if you will, positively affect and or

384
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,360
elevate humanity?

385
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,160
Got it.

386
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,900
Other subjects.

387
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,180
Yeah, it's just, I don't want to be

388
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,580
- Well, here, this is fine.

389
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
On the sonic that I do, Rated Y

390
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,880
with Ocelli, I keep laughing and say, hey,

391
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,180
I know the meaning of life and you

392
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,980
don't, ha ha.

393
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,060
Meaning of life here, this is not open

394
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,680
for debate, is to have your time wasted.

395
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,700
Everyone wastes each other's time, whether you know

396
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,740
it or not.

397
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,240
It's so hard to get things done, and

398
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,700
there's so many ways it's done.

399
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,140
First way we waste our time is there's

400
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,940
no communication.

401
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,780
Again, advanced, if we were advanced or we're

402
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,240
not here to waste our time, we wouldn't

403
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
use speech for communication.

404
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Because we use speech, there's lying, there's deception,

405
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
there's all this stuff.

406
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,080
We are here, we are designed, we're actually

407
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,560
made or allowed to be bred into a

408
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
situation and developed in a situation where everyone

409
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,620
is wasting everyone's time.

410
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,560
It doesn't matter if it's your parents, your

411
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,140
loved ones, your friends, your work.

412
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,900
Is it all in vain, Greek, analyzing-

413
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,960
It's all in vain, exactly.

414
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,040
No, no.

415
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,640
I was asking you.

416
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,100
It's all in vain, so it is all

417
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,300
in vain.

418
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,260
Okay, so there's no- It's all in

419
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,360
vain.

420
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,640
Lessons can be learned that accumulate later in

421
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,300
some, I don't know, life that we get

422
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,840
to spawn into.

423
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,920
There's no ascendance.

424
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,080
People like Daniel Lyle would just say, human

425
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,920
forever, the soul, if you will, and there's

426
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,820
no elevation.

427
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,340
There's no- No, not with all the

428
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,660
...

429
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,680
If you make a rundown of a list

430
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,640
of let's say an automobile, it stalls at

431
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,140
a red light, it's dripping gasoline, it's dripping

432
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,000
oil, hard to start when it stalls.

433
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,880
You're like, this thing, we're going to leave

434
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,900
it alone and use it like that, right?

435
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,720
Well, you could, right?

436
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,600
You know, a broken down car that just

437
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,080
barely works, or you fix it or get

438
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,640
another one.

439
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,400
There's no ...

440
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,760
The decision has been made to leave everything

441
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,720
as it is alone.

442
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm talking about in the grand scheme, right?

443
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,480
We're just going to truck along this way

444
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,400
and whatever.

445
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,920
That's the main decision.

446
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Like you've heard, don't make waves, right?

447
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,040
Or hey, if you put that in public,

448
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,000
they'll kill you, right?

449
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,140
Or whatever, blah, blah, blah.

450
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,860
Hey, but what if the breakaway civilizations that

451
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,580
have successfully broken away adapted that attitude?

452
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,520
That's why I feel that there's hope.

453
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, well, that's what they do.

454
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,940
They break away, and I agree.

455
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,940
I would come back with the mothership and

456
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,640
vaporize the surface if it were me.

457
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,260
That's not enforce everyone where they should be

458
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,700
underground.

459
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,260
I hate to say it that way, but

460
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,220
there's no alternative.

461
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Here's the thing.

462
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,860
Our bodies biologically can continue.

463
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,220
You know how your body breaks down and

464
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,540
rebuilds itself, apoptosis, all the biological functions, right?

465
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,100
When you sleep, you recover and all that.

466
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,360
The way that works in our body, we

467
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,880
can live for 1,000 years, easy, right?

468
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,840
But we're designed and made.

469
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,760
There's a throttle a governor put on us

470
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,420
that we die out 70, 80, 90, 120,

471
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,300
whatever, right?

472
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,720
That is actually there to help us, the

473
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,260
short life.

474
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,200
I can't tell you for sure all these

475
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
other things that people talk about.

476
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
What happens after this?

477
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,300
I would say that our mentality here is

478
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
not clear enough to understand what happens after

479
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,300
being here, but I would take everything that

480
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,440
we hear as a hint, right?

481
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,260
For example, not to bounce around, but this

482
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,540
stuff about reincarnation, that's not discussed properly because

483
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,600
if we are here for the third, fourth,

484
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,100
fifth, or tenth time, aren't we technically in

485
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,140
the afterlife right now, right?

486
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,900
These things need to be put together a

487
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,340
little better.

488
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,940
I have no desire for anything here.

489
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,900
It's kind of like years ago on Sonics,

490
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,160
I spoke, we're in the waiting room.

491
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,580
You have a dentist appointment, right, Zen?

492
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,200
You go to the waiting room, how much

493
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,700
are you going to complain about being in

494
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,120
the waiting room?

495
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
Yeah, if they should take you at 11,

496
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,320
it's two o'clock and they haven't taken

497
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
you yet, you might reschedule, right?

498
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,620
But you're in the waiting room, so what

499
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,700
are they, they got crappy magazines laying around,

500
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,940
you might have a conversation, play with the

501
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,880
stupid rectangle, whatever, whatever.

502
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,020
That's what we're in.

503
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,000
We're in a waiting, we're in a holding

504
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,400
pattern.

505
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,200
Look, if the powers that be of the

506
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,860
grand scheme, I'm going to use your terms,

507
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,900
the King's language, you know, if they're prerogative

508
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,280
or if just by happenstance, whatever it may

509
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
be, is for our time to be wasted,

510
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,620
why can't I make the best, I mean,

511
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,380
why can't I subsequently in vain try and

512
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,560
make the best of my surroundings, you know,

513
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,860
just for shits and try and, my big

514
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,320
thing, my blanket statement is just elevate humanity.

515
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,280
I really want to do everything I can

516
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,080
to- You might have to rebuild, okay,

517
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,220
here, let me just say it this way.

518
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,520
Okay, in civil engineering, when you design a

519
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,980
highway, like an off ramp or an on

520
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,520
ramp, you have to design it for typically,

521
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
statistically, what would be known as the worst

522
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,040
driver and the worst car taking that off

523
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,540
ramp, right?

524
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,680
So everything around us is designed that way.

525
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
It's for the least educated, the least aware

526
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,620
people and the least physical fitness to function

527
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,440
in this society.

528
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,700
You know about that, you know?

529
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,500
So basically, you're in a low functioning society.

530
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,860
Everything is made, in general, to accommodate those

531
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,180
that are operating on an absolute minimal functioning

532
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,440
level, mentally, physically, et cetera, et cetera.

533
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,500
So how do you make it better?

534
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,640
There's several ways, several approaches, and I'm speaking

535
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,440
strictly, everything you're asking can be fixed from

536
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,500
a strictly nuts and bolts engineering perspective.

537
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,220
You don't even need to ask big spiritual

538
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,240
questions or big social questions.

539
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,960
Okay.

540
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Break away, go underground.

541
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,619
I guess I can come back and visit

542
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,680
that later, but, and can you tell me

543
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,500
about this, okay, this governor on our lifespan,

544
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,220
I'm assuming you're referring to a genetic, something

545
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,460
that- Oh yeah.

546
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:19,940
...

547
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,760
telomeres after a while?

548
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,780
Yeah.

549
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,800
It's more than telomeres.

550
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
The physical is secondary.

551
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,380
It's kind of like, you know, when you,

552
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,520
let's say, do a wifi signal to your

553
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,480
laptop or your television in the living room,

554
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,060
you can discuss the pixels as much as

555
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,440
you want, but I'm telling you there is

556
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,380
a signal that's being piped over, that's being

557
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,640
picked up, that's manifesting.

558
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,300
Those pixels is a little more critical, right,

559
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,320
than the pixels, because what I mean is

560
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,180
you have a high resolution or low resolution

561
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,760
TV, you're still going to see what's being

562
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,300
broadcast.

563
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,220
Can you touch on how we rebut that

564
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,500
governor or what we can do to, you

565
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,000
know- Not here.

566
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,860
Not here.

567
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,500
Not now.

568
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,540
In other words, you have a dentist appointment

569
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,060
at 11 o'clock, it's 12.30, they

570
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,380
haven't seen you yet, you can kick and

571
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,780
scream all you want, that's not going to

572
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,460
make the dentist come out and take you

573
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,940
in his chair.

574
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,700
I'm just wondering if there's any, you know,

575
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,740
right question I can manufacture to relate that

576
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,680
to the dentist to do something in my

577
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,420
best, but I don't know, at least she

578
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,780
has to- Well, use the dentist, because

579
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,280
I have an acquaintance who's a dentist, and

580
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,380
when I want to see him, I call

581
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,820
him on his cell phone, and he's like,

582
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,180
yeah, yeah, we can do that, and you

583
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,760
know, let's meet at eight o'clock at

584
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,360
the office after I play basketball.

585
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
I mean, that's the relationship I have with

586
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,260
him, right.

587
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,980
And the thing about it, I said, hey,

588
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,120
Mitch, when you get your, do you ever

589
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,020
need any dental work?

590
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,440
The dentist, he says, yeah, I do.

591
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,560
I said, do you do it on yourself?

592
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,860
Or he says, no, it's very difficult to

593
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,960
do it on yourself, right.

594
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,500
You see, so you do require a tribe,

595
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
so your questions are requiring that, you keep

596
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,100
saying, what can I do?

597
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,980
And I'm telling you, what you want to

598
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,720
do requires a tribe, a village, a nation,

599
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,500
right?

600
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,660
You're right.

601
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,060
I just, thank you for helping me with

602
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,960
that, understand, yeah, and better.

603
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,200
Anyway, Daniel, please, go ahead, I've eaten up

604
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,660
a lot of time.

605
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,040
Well, I think there's a distinction between wasting

606
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,800
your time, which I agree is the highest,

607
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,060
you know, goal that we can aspire to

608
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,520
in this realm, and between losing your time,

609
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,960
because if you just go by the schedule

610
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,100
and the impositions and the things that are

611
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,040
governed by time, like let's say, watching a

612
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,380
movie or going to a sports game, then

613
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,720
you will be losing your time.

614
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,740
But if you're wasting your time, that implies

615
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,720
a certain openness to something that is mysterious.

616
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
It could be redirected so the same time

617
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
is not being wasted.

618
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,680
Yeah.

619
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,780
As for us living on the surface, on

620
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,460
the roof, still, I think there's something to

621
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,740
be said about Goldilocks planets being inhabitable and

622
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,340
having the ability to be thriving on the

623
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,460
surface, except that we are in the most

624
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,200
precarious position of having all these grids and

625
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,660
all these prison systems governing us.

626
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,700
That's what makes us especially repressed and inside

627
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,260
more of a prison than a university, as

628
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,080
we were supposed to.

629
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,360
Sure.

630
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,560
Or I would say how closely related is

631
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,920
a prison to a farm?

632
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
How close are they related?

633
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,040
The creatures that live in a prison and

634
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,380
the creatures that live in a farm are

635
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,060
both fed and taken care of to a

636
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,740
certain degree, right?

637
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,180
And they're both monetized.

638
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:37,820
Yeah.

639
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,320
I don't think it's a prison as much

640
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,940
as it's an unfortunate situation.

641
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,020
And by the way, some people listening to

642
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,480
this are, oh, this Greek guy is very

643
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,840
negative.

644
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm not into it because I like the

645
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,680
airy fairy woo woo stuff that your intention,

646
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,500
blah, blah, blah, blah.

647
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,160
That's fine.

648
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,820
But what I'm saying, you'll find in every

649
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,740
ancient text, every single text that's been written

650
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
by, you know, those dummies that came before

651
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,460
us, right?

652
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,320
That's what everyone, we're taught to think that

653
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,580
the ancients were dumb, right?

654
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,280
Every ancient text that you'll find, you know,

655
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,240
the holy writs of the world are pretty

656
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,320
much I'm paraphrasing.

657
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,760
And you mentioned the us having the potential

658
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,820
to live a thousand years.

659
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,040
Would you be able to isolate maybe the

660
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,300
biggest poison or the top three or something?

661
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,340
Yeah.

662
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,880
Your skin.

663
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,260
Let's just keep it simple.

664
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,340
Remember that everything is based and we're speaking

665
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,200
publicly, so we're addressing minors, people with a,

666
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,720
you know, under 18 mentality typically.

667
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,780
It doesn't matter if they're 70, right?

668
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,100
This is the way the public is groomed

669
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,620
and they go to their grave as basically

670
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,860
children, a children mentality.

671
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,500
How do you know an old man just

672
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,820
walked into a room or an old lady

673
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,620
walked into the room?

674
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,540
By looking at them, right?

675
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,820
If you put an old man versus young

676
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,220
man, old lady versus young lady on the

677
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,000
internet right now in images, what's the first

678
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,100
thing you're going to notice?

679
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,340
Old people have baggy, wrinkly skin.

680
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,260
That's the first thing that you notice, right?

681
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,200
Typically more than the facial features drooping or

682
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,780
being in large brow bone or large ears,

683
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,020
right?

684
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,300
Well, the reason that happens that, you know,

685
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,300
is your skin as you grow older, parts

686
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,640
of your body keep growing.

687
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm not going to get lascivious, but they,

688
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,220
that does too.

689
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,000
I noticed after 50 anyway, so like for

690
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,320
example, the femur, the brow bone, the ears

691
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,560
keep growing as you get older.

692
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,260
A good example of that is if you

693
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,240
know anyone that's in their forties, fifties or

694
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,620
sixties and was in the military, say, Hey,

695
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,100
go pull out.

696
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,720
Do you still have your military uniform and

697
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,020
your hat?

698
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,200
Yeah.

699
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,720
Pull it out.

700
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,260
And they're in their twenties.

701
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,140
You know, they have their military hat, you

702
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,620
know, what for parade and whatever, right?

703
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,320
Formal hat, dress hat, it's called, Hey, put

704
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,820
your hat on.

705
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,900
And when they put their hat on, you

706
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,220
know, it sits on top of, of their

707
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,000
head, like a, like a toy hat, like

708
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,360
a child's hat doesn't even fit anymore because

709
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,060
that keeps growing top of the cranium and

710
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,560
all that, right?

711
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,260
So you keep growing.

712
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,820
Now the skin grows faster than the rest

713
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,140
of it.

714
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,280
And you know, when you're young, you're a

715
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,180
five pound pork chop in a five pound

716
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,560
bag.

717
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,980
When you're old, you're a five pound pork

718
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,860
chop in a 10 pound bag.

719
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,660
Why not just put it back in a,

720
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,080
right?

721
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,760
So I'm not saying go and get plastic

722
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,380
surgery, right?

723
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
You know how the, you know how that

724
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,700
looks, right?

725
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,260
But so why does the skin keep growing?

726
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,020
Are there chemical attachments, energetic, electrical attachments behind

727
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,300
that?

728
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,020
Yeah, of course.

729
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,200
And you can, can you prevent that from

730
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,500
growing?

731
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,360
And because the skin is an organ in

732
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,080
its own right, you have to take certain

733
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,800
considerations.

734
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,620
But that would be the first thing that

735
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,140
I would do.

736
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,080
But wouldn't it have to be related to

737
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,400
our main fuel, which is a gas of

738
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,840
some type?

739
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,140
Well, yes, I'm glad you mentioned that.

740
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,460
We all have an atmosphere.

741
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,100
You know how you study, let's say, geography

742
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,880
or wherever the earth has an atmosphere, it's

743
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,700
so thick or whatever.

744
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,580
And everything has an atmosphere.

745
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,220
Even if you study Galvani, the early natural

746
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,420
philosopher, you know, scientist, he said that what

747
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,860
conducted electricity across metals was that metal has

748
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,440
an atmosphere, it's not the metal itself.

749
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,480
But anyway, and we have an atmosphere around

750
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,620
us and it's material.

751
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,600
And actually, you can smell that atmosphere on

752
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,940
some people, if you know what I mean.

753
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,360
And we affect that atmosphere by putting on

754
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,240
perfumes and colognes, if that makes any sense.

755
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,180
But also, we have an energetic field, just

756
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,720
like the earth has a magnetic sphere and

757
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,540
that we call the aura, for example.

758
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,500
And just like that aura is very, how

759
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,680
would you say, inconspicuous, like the aurora borealis,

760
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,320
for example.

761
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,540
You know, you only see it in certain

762
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,040
places.

763
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,220
So, we have many conditions that affect us,

764
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,480
right?

765
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,580
And like, for example, I'll give you a

766
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,560
short, you know acupuncture, right?

767
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,340
Where they put pins and needles into people.

768
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,400
Okay, ask anyone who practices that in the

769
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,240
West, how does it really work and why

770
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,660
do we use pins and needles and all

771
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:52,840
that?

772
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,660
They don't know.

773
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,140
They're just doing their job.

774
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,440
Well, you know what a lightning rod is,

775
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,040
right?

776
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,440
You direct the electricity from the atmosphere to

777
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,860
the ground.

778
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,640
When the idea of acupuncture is that you

779
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,580
apply a conductive piece of material into the

780
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,600
body and based on the diagnosis on the

781
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,160
practitioner, what he wants to do is draw

782
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,620
energy from the aura surrounding the human body

783
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,260
and put it back into the body.

784
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,360
Or if there's too much energy in the

785
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,960
body, to send it out to the outer

786
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
field, the magnetosphere of the body, that's what

787
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,920
acupuncture is, right?

788
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,540
So, it's like a lightning rod would be

789
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,200
used on the earth.

790
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,900
But isn't it barbaric a little bit because

791
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,400
it's disturbing the vacuum, first of all, and

792
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,360
second of all, because it's tough to map

793
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,300
out what's the good parts of us.

794
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,320
I'm not condoning it.

795
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,820
I wouldn't do it.

796
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,460
Like, for example, if I had a condition

797
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,280
and someone suggested I go try an acupuncturist,

798
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,240
I'd just laugh it off.

799
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,860
I wouldn't do that.

800
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,700
But I'm just giving that as an example

801
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,720
to help illustrate the condition.

802
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,520
But since our bodies are electric, there is

803
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,780
a beneficial type of electricity, right, as opposed

804
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
to the one we use?

805
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,640
Yeah.

806
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,920
What I would suggest about electricity is their

807
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,900
end result product.

808
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,760
Like, for example, baked goods is an end

809
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,780
result product of using grains, ground-up grains,

810
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,080
right?

811
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
So, the electricity that we...

812
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,180
When we say electricity, people think, oh, I

813
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,520
plug something in a wall or a battery.

814
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,060
That is a very highly pressurized, magnetically or

815
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,480
chemically pressurized ethereal flow.

816
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,880
It's a secondary thing.

817
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,160
When you're dealing with biological, it would be

818
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,020
more the biological vacuum and what we call

819
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,820
the ethereal reaction, which has very different potential.

820
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,540
In other words, the ether goes from low

821
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,560
to high potential, where when we say electricity,

822
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
it always goes from high to low potential,

823
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:42,740
right?

824
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,160
So, we have to understand that there's a

825
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,020
reverse of potential.

826
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,820
In other words, I just did a weather

827
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,260
seminar.

828
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,480
It was three three-hour sections on how

829
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,140
to manipulate the weather around you, you know,

830
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,780
locally and not so locally.

831
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,260
And I broke it down in practical terms.

832
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,820
And basically, every time we discussed something in

833
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,740
the physical reality, when you're working with weather

834
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,380
or ether, it's the opposite.

835
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,180
And the main opposite would be the energy

836
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,420
potentials go from low to high, not high

837
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,780
to low.

838
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
Where can we find that?

839
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm sorry to interrupt.

840
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,540
Is that recorded at all?

841
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,340
I can learn from it?

842
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:19,960
It is.

843
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,920
It's a private group.

844
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,320
I did several seminars on several different subjects,

845
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,520
and they were just open.

846
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,800
I had about 50 people.

847
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,940
But now, I'm going to be doing new

848
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,380
seminars on several subjects, and it'll be fee

849
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,760
-based.

850
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,920
But this one is not fee-based.

851
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,840
If you send me an email at uncommonsenseradio1

852
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,760
at Gmail, that's the number one, uncommonsenseradio1 at

853
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,300
Gmail, I'll send you a link.

854
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,320
And we just reposted everything again, because Skype

855
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,700
takes it down every 30 days.

856
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,140
Thank you.

857
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,620
Sorry, Daniel.

858
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,020
I didn't mean to.

859
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,560
No, it's fine.

860
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,180
It's nine hours.

861
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
It's three three-hour segments.

862
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,380
I do, let's say, every Saturday, we do

863
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,900
three hours for three weeks.

864
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
And that's just barely covering the surface.

865
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,460
But we already have several people making rain

866
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,560
and doing what they want.

867
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,020
Especially where you are, Zan.

868
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,060
My gosh, hurricane's coming.

869
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,640
What do we do?

870
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,380
Run, right?

871
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,340
I'm like, no.

872
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,680
Yeah, not at all.

873
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,820
We have total control over that.

874
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,200
Yes, it's upsetting to know that they just,

875
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,940
I don't know, these lesser men build over

876
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,220
us.

877
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,200
And as you can tell, I'm so buttered,

878
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,640
and I just, I'm relentless in my pursuit

879
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,500
of trying to figure out how to get

880
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,980
ahead of all this.

881
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
But anyway, Daniel, I want you to wrap

882
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,060
up your first point.

883
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,380
You know what I'm saying?

884
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,540
I don't want to take a thunder.

885
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't want to take a thunder, Daniel.

886
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,420
I think the answer to what would you

887
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,580
do if you did find some, let's say,

888
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,200
free energy, which, like you said, all energy

889
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,460
is free, so you shouldn't name it that,

890
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,620
but a free energy device, you should just

891
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,280
keep it for yourself, because what you do

892
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,360
when you're alone will be rewarded by the

893
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,080
world around you.

894
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,900
Right, well, here's the thing.

895
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,300
The operative point here, what you just mentioned,

896
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,840
let's say you just get a free energy

897
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,140
device.

898
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,440
You're pretty new at this, because you just

899
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,020
got it, right?

900
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,120
So it's like when you get, you're five

901
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,460
years old, you get a brand new bicycle,

902
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,020
you say, I'm going to ride to California.

903
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,900
Or do you ride in your neighborhood first,

904
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,140
try it out, make sure, right?

905
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,640
Don't get your, don't get anything caught in

906
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,240
the chain, right?

907
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,960
Get wrapped around the axle kind of thing,

908
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,780
right, until you get used to it.

909
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,880
Yeah, so it would be very difficult.

910
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,900
I mean, we already have devices that it's

911
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,540
just a pipe.

912
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,460
You're aware of it, and you run dirty

913
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,260
water through one side, and the water comes

914
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,040
out clean on the other, and it's like,

915
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,520
what?

916
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,660
That doesn't make any sense.

917
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,820
No filters, no chemicals, right?

918
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,140
Well, that already exists.

919
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,460
We already have that, and they're not for

920
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,680
sale.

921
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,880
I do a 90-year lease.

922
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,380
So if anyone says, how many of these

923
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,020
have you sold?

924
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,680
I can honestly say none, right, because I

925
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,960
lease them out for 90 years.

926
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,660
So anyway, that's the operative thing.

927
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,820
By the way, if you have a free

928
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,380
energy device, don't put it up for sale.

929
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,740
Just do a 90-year lease.

930
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,560
But to tie it together with the drones,

931
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,520
I believe you did foresee this type of

932
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,680
phenomenon back in like 2016 or 15, that

933
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,380
we would see all sorts of lights in

934
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,000
the sky that were supposed to represent a

935
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,280
distraction, a false disclosure, and that if you

936
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,960
want to make, let's say, a baby step

937
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,260
towards understanding that phenomenon, you're supposed to get

938
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,280
behind the actual, the way in which you

939
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,140
cancel mass and weight, which is not inside

940
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,160
the atoms of physical objects, but in the

941
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,400
ether.

942
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,620
Right, it's all, if you're familiar with the

943
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,980
work of Ken Wheeler, I don't endorse him.

944
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,740
It seems like every time he does a

945
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,860
video, he's just rewording everything from his first

946
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
video five, 10 years ago.

947
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,580
But his perspective in nature, and I agree,

948
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,080
there's a book by Gustav Le Bon written

949
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,460
on transformation of elements and materials.

950
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,600
And all the early, quote unquote, physicists, which

951
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,000
were natural philosophers really before the term came

952
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,300
about, it's all about pressure mediation.

953
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,120
Everything in nature is trying to equalize.

954
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,880
So if you create a low pressure here,

955
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,000
out there, that's higher pressure wants to rush

956
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,660
in to the low pressure, right?

957
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,320
And if you create a high pressure here,

958
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,740
it's going to want to rush towards the

959
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,940
low pressure around it.

960
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,860
And that's the basis for everything that works

961
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,700
in the perceivable universe.

962
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,940
And if you're stuck on the atomic side,

963
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,520
meaning everything is material, most ridiculous thing is

964
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
a photon, you know.

965
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,760
How does the photon go through glass, right,

966
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,520
slow down and then speed up again after

967
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,660
it leaves the light bulb, right?

968
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,680
Ridiculous.

969
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,560
If you're stuck on atomic, let's say, model

970
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,160
of the universe, that everything's atoms including light

971
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,080
as photons, you will never, I assure you,

972
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,140
you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever have

973
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,780
anti-gravity or anything that we discuss or

974
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,480
aspire to.

975
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,740
Ever.

976
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,700
You'll never have it.

977
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,580
But once you understand there is an immaterial

978
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,180
substrate, it's completely immaterial that once it's handled

979
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,880
a certain way or manifests into material and

980
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,540
light, and you understand pressure mediation, right?

981
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,260
So, for example, the way, if you understand

982
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,700
what an airfoil is on a wing, on

983
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,940
an airplane, the Bernoulli effect, you have something

984
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,920
that looks like a flat plane of material

985
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,860
like a wing or just a board of

986
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,080
wood.

987
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,640
And if you run it through the air,

988
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,240
it doesn't, you know, it just cuts through

989
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,120
the air, it doesn't lift.

990
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,580
But if you increase the surface area on

991
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,440
the top of the board and keep the

992
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,420
bottom flat, as you run that board horizontally

993
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,920
through the air, the top of the board,

994
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,400
which is like an airfoil now, that's a

995
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,000
longer surface, the air takes a little longer

996
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,040
to rush off and it creates a low

997
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,700
pressure because of the time variance.

998
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,860
And but the air on the bottom of

999
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,920
the board, because it's flat and parallel to

1000
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,880
the air movement, the air moves a little

1001
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,980
faster and you have a high pressure and

1002
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,900
that creates lift, right?

1003
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,660
If you look at every cross-section of

1004
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,100
any airplane or helicopter or propeller, it has

1005
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,700
that feature.

1006
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,980
How simple is that?

1007
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,520
So, what the simplest airfoil will do is

1008
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,600
create a low pressure above, high pressure below,

1009
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,040
the end result is lift.

1010
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,700
Exactly the same with the ether, you know.

1011
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,180
I think there actually were stuff written about

1012
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,300
ether lift and lift, you know, simple lifting

1013
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,780
devices.

1014
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,860
Now, if you're going to go after it

1015
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,080
by strictly using electrical fields and all that,

1016
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,020
that's not going to work either because electricity

1017
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,900
is a byproduct.

1018
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,040
It's kind of like if grandma baked a

1019
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,080
batch of chocolate chip cookies that were made

1020
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,580
of wheat, can you take that chocolate chip

1021
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,400
cookie, plant it in the ground and expect

1022
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,140
a wheat field to grow out of that?

1023
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,720
Never, right?

1024
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,080
So, it won't because it's too processed.

1025
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,300
It's too processed.

1026
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,700
Yeah, so you have to handle the unprocessed

1027
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:53,900
ether.

1028
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,380
Now, here's the thing, what is the ether?

1029
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,320
Before we get into that because that's been

1030
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,820
dabbled with and I believe we know it

1031
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,680
can be explained but it's not really shown,

1032
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
discussed publicly.

1033
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,219
Let's just ask the same question, what is

1034
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:07,620
a bear?

1035
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:09,239
You know, the animal B-E-A-R

1036
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,520
that lives in the woods, black bears, grizzly

1037
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,040
bears, whatever.

1038
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,060
If you ask anyone, even a child, what

1039
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,440
is a bear?

1040
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,199
Do you know what that is?

1041
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,340
Yes, everyone pretty much will say yes.

1042
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,300
Polar bear, doesn't matter.

1043
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,460
Now, I'm telling you, we really don't know

1044
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,060
what a bear is but we know enough

1045
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,040
about bears that we say that we do

1046
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,860
know what bears are.

1047
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,699
And the reason why we say we don't

1048
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,340
really know what bears are or is, is

1049
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,320
because I've never run into anyone or heard

1050
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,840
of anyone who sat down and had an

1051
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,360
eight hour conversation with a bear.

1052
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,800
Have you?

1053
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,780
No, but we know enough about bears and

1054
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,600
their behavior that we can work with them

1055
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,100
and identify them and actually say that we

1056
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,060
know what bears are.

1057
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,739
Can we do that with the ether?

1058
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,400
Absolutely, yes, we can.

1059
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,340
And that's how I operate.

1060
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,960
Do we know enough about it to work?

1061
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,800
Just like, for example, if you speak to

1062
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,780
a physicist, what is electricity?

1063
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,820
You know, really, if you get down to

1064
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,620
it, there's no physicist that knows what electricity

1065
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,060
is but we still, does it mean we

1066
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,780
shouldn't use it?

1067
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,140
Do we know enough about it to make

1068
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,560
it useful?

1069
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,320
Does that make sense, Zion, to you?

1070
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,360
I'm picking up what you're laying down as

1071
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,220
far as I think I know, my subjective

1072
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,280
understanding, yes.

1073
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,360
But as far as ether, okay, what about

1074
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
like in relation to Mel's Hole or something

1075
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,960
like that?

1076
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,700
If that exists, if you can confirm or

1077
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,140
deny it, whatever.

1078
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't know what Mel's Hole is.

1079
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, okay, there was a similar place, I

1080
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,840
think on an Indian reservation.

1081
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,040
Basically, it's, I don't know if you heard,

1082
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,800
it could be urban legend, but I'm assuming

1083
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,180
it's true.

1084
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, a weird place with weird anomalies?

1085
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,480
Well, it's a place that according to this

1086
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,160
urban legend, which I'm assuming is true, there's

1087
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,800
a naturally occurring hole in the ground where

1088
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,820
a dark light would beam out one time

1089
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,120
a day.

1090
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,520
And if you drop things into the hole,

1091
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,160
you never ever hear some sort of noise

1092
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,460
or anything.

1093
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,820
And if you drop something live down and

1094
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,740
pull it back up, it's warped.

1095
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,620
And that coins from with different times and

1096
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,100
different presidents, same countries or stuff like that

1097
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,020
would be found around it.

1098
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,380
And if you park your car close enough

1099
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,960
to these places on earth that there would

1100
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,320
be, I don't know, stuff from, I guess,

1101
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,920
different timelines playing on the radio or alternative

1102
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,520
timelines.

1103
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,580
Maybe this is just a red herring.

1104
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,420
We should forget about it.

1105
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,020
I was just thinking.

1106
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,820
No, no, that's fine.

1107
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,700
I was, I had a, well, somewhat mild

1108
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,780
relation with someone who had gone through New

1109
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,520
Mexico and swore that he went through a

1110
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,580
town that he knew before.

1111
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,360
And when he went through the town, this

1112
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,140
is about five years ago, it looked like

1113
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,260
very 1940s.

1114
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,580
And he sent himself a postcard.

1115
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,320
And when he got home, he got the

1116
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,980
postcard and it was postmarked 1947, even though

1117
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,840
it was five years ago.

1118
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,440
So maybe they really do have aliens in

1119
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,800
the post office, but yeah, weird stuff like

1120
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,040
that.

1121
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,200
We're the aliens, right?

1122
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,360
I mean, how the hell do we just

1123
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,380
pop onto this planet?

1124
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
We are the aliens to some degree.

1125
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,020
I mean, you know, to some, yeah, we're

1126
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,200
the only, you know, we can go into

1127
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,540
so many reasons why we're alien here based

1128
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,040
on, you know, how different we are from

1129
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,020
all the creatures, right?

1130
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,520
Yeah, even on the biblical texts, we're a

1131
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,760
genetic project and all that.

1132
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,560
But, oh, about the dark matter, dark light,

1133
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,440
it must be some residue of the, you

1134
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,740
know, phantom matrices because we're in a side

1135
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,180
of simulation, nested inside of simulation and so

1136
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,360
on.

1137
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,580
So that's probably why he was led to

1138
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,780
an artificial timeline in that one.

1139
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,800
And then, I don't know.

1140
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,300
Events, yeah, yeah, synthetic events or different events.

1141
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,760
There's a very thin transition or veil, I

1142
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,180
should say.

1143
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,420
For example, when some people, very rare, you

1144
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,200
know, the NDE reports, near-death experiences, but

1145
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,100
if some of the more, let's say, if

1146
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
you listen to NDE experiences, they all sound

1147
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,080
pretty much the same with some variance.

1148
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,740
But there's a few out there that are

1149
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,020
interesting that before you transition to the other

1150
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,160
side, you actually go through different realities that

1151
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,880
are like this one, that seem very similar.

1152
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,880
You might look at yourself in the mirror

1153
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,780
and you look very different.

1154
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,540
Or, you know, you might have a green

1155
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,880
car here and when you pass, you go

1156
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,000
out, you walk outside of your house and

1157
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,160
the car is now red.

1158
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,820
And then you go to another reality, which

1159
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,480
is very, very different, and so on and

1160
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,900
so forth.

1161
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,100
Several of them that are all coexisting.

1162
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,260
Yeah, but the fact that each denomination sees

1163
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,120
their own pantheon in their NDEs suggests that

1164
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,480
it's, you know, artificial in that.

1165
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,260
Yeah, they never, yeah, because they never really

1166
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,620
died, because if they did, they wouldn't.

1167
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,100
Look, Woody Allen, I think, or someone said,

1168
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,900
if dying was so bad, how come no

1169
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
one has come back to complain?

1170
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,360
Yeah.

1171
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,800
But about the ether and the drones, I

1172
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,800
think in one of your oldest sonics, you

1173
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,760
explained how come they take those 90 degree

1174
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,260
turns.

1175
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,660
They can go through the veil to an

1176
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:01,940
extent.

1177
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,880
Like when, again, with the NDE, is there

1178
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,680
anything really supernatural happening?

1179
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,280
I mean, death is such a common thing,

1180
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,540
right?

1181
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,480
Where you basically unresolve in this world and

1182
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,520
you resolve into another reality, right?

1183
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,980
So they're able to resolve another reality that

1184
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,740
appears to be a 90 degree turn at

1185
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,000
Mach 10 in this reality.

1186
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,400
Very simple.

1187
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm suggesting that you're gonna be breaking, it's

1188
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,900
not just anti-gravity and those super, let's

1189
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,980
say phenomenal motions that you see in UFOs.

1190
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,640
I believe that they're operating in a slightly

1191
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,680
variance, another reality that you can see in

1192
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,900
this one, like a shimmer on water, right?

1193
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,400
And yeah, they rely on the reorganization of

1194
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,420
energies, which all the energies come from the

1195
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,840
ether, right?

1196
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,520
Pre-energies, yeah.

1197
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,920
Once we identify it as energy, it's finished.

1198
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,940
Just like you can't plant a chocolate cookie

1199
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,660
in the field and expect wheat to grow.

1200
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,340
Yeah, you have to function with the original

1201
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,660
whole materials that come out, quote unquote, naturally,

1202
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,120
because nothing is natural anyway.

1203
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,080
It's everything that's constructed.

1204
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,900
You know how they say, well, without being

1205
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,720
religious, God created everything, right?

1206
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,160
Well, someone who creates things is an artist.

1207
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
And that's where you get the word artificial.

1208
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,680
It's an artificer.

1209
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,900
So everything is artificial.

1210
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,500
If you go that route, you know, that

1211
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,060
someone created all of this, right?

1212
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,880
So an artificer makes things that are what?

1213
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,520
Artificial.

1214
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,920
Yeah, not in the sense, like, for example,

1215
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,800
years ago, I was peddling water.

1216
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,800
I was trafficking high-end water in Los

1217
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,400
Angeles in most elite shops there.

1218
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,320
And I was able to clean and make

1219
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,120
wonderful spring water, like the, even goes against

1220
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,400
the best spring waters in the world from

1221
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,520
LA tap water via implosion.

1222
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,660
And it was called Spring 2.0. And

1223
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,800
the label said, synthesize spring water.

1224
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,100
And we were giving out samples.

1225
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,420
And one lady approached me and she says,

1226
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,980
why does it say synthesized water?

1227
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,180
It sounds artificial, right?

1228
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm like, you know, that's a good point.

1229
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,780
That's a good point because it is, but

1230
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,160
not in the sense, when we say it's

1231
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,220
artificial, it's usually a downplay, right?

1232
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,160
A downgrade, right?

1233
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,200
So by saying we live in an artificial

1234
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,720
environment is not downgraded at all.

1235
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,500
It's just being more objective.

1236
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,720
That makes sense.

1237
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,940
And as a result, you could say that

1238
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,740
the generators are not so much generators as

1239
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,060
pumps.

1240
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,060
That's right.

1241
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,140
No one has ever generated electricity just like

1242
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,000
a water pump has never created water.

1243
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,480
You know, like I say, let's go out

1244
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,320
and buy a water pump.

1245
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,600
Usually has a power cord attached to it.

1246
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,940
Leave it still in the box, plug it

1247
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,040
in to your power.

1248
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,660
Do you expect water to start shooting out

1249
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,260
of the water pump?

1250
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,980
No, because the water pump is designed to

1251
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,100
take a certain static body of water and

1252
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,260
to based on its design to create a

1253
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,480
certain volume or pressure, right?

1254
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,540
So let's go back to the generator.

1255
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,180
It's a group of windings that creates static,

1256
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,640
takes static, right?

1257
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,680
Static electricity and winds it up and pressurizes

1258
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,220
it and reflects it down a conductor known

1259
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,560
as metal.

1260
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,100
Notice I didn't say really conduct.

1261
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,620
It sends it across the wire, just like

1262
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,500
a magnet works, for example, when you put

1263
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,380
a magnet on your, actually magnetizes the ether,

1264
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,180
polarizes it.

1265
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,140
When you put a magnet on your refrigerator

1266
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,940
door, is it, what is it?

1267
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,400
It's just running along the refrigerator door, right?

1268
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,120
That's how electricity works over metals and other

1269
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,160
things and some minerals.

1270
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,840
And once you understand that principle, you might

1271
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,620
want to abandon the whole thing, right?

1272
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,640
Of, you know, having a field coil, you

1273
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,740
know how basic generators work.

1274
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,100
There's various types of ways of doing it

1275
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,620
with magnets or without magnets and where you

1276
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,100
have an exciting current, you know, several, there's

1277
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,960
many ways to do it.

1278
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,540
But I would suggest that if someone wants

1279
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,260
to start getting into this, let's just say,

1280
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,100
I'll say this because I'm in the process

1281
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,420
of working on this right now, is using

1282
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,660
an exciter type generator.

1283
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,140
Instead of winding, spinning a coil around a

1284
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,400
magnet, energize a smaller coil that becomes magnetic

1285
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,360
and then rotate the other coil around that

1286
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,760
primary energized coil and keep seeing what you

1287
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,060
get.

1288
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,920
And if you start playing with this, you'll

1289
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,520
notice that your local transformer, your local power

1290
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,040
supply in your neighborhood, everyone, all the power

1291
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,360
goes out for a few blocks.

1292
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,460
And the electrical companies right now have enough

1293
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,940
sensors that they can almost find the source

1294
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,360
of what caused the capacitor or transformer to

1295
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,860
go out.

1296
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,840
And you get a, first time, they stop

1297
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,660
in front of your house.

1298
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,120
Second time, they knock on your door and

1299
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,320
they said, you know, the power went out

1300
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,620
again.

1301
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,740
Do you know anything about it?

1302
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,180
And what I suggest you say is, I

1303
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:45,700
really don't know.

1304
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,140
I was watching TV and the lights went

1305
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,500
out, man.

1306
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,160
Don't say, hey, come out here.

1307
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,600
I want to show you what, anyway, you

1308
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,240
get the point, right?

1309
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,660
I shouldn't have shared that, but yeah.

1310
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,000
But there are also examples of the technology

1311
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,780
that is electricity that is longitudinal, that is

1312
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,420
instantaneous, that we're not supposed to have, that

1313
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,260
is out in the open.

1314
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,180
Yeah, but how are you going to control

1315
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,520
that?

1316
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,840
Because it's instant, well, you can, Eric Dollard,

1317
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,460
again, I don't endorse him, but he has

1318
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,020
some good stuff.

1319
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,500
You can build a very simple circuit.

1320
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,760
There's a video that's about 15 years old

1321
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,960
on YouTube or maybe 10 years old.

1322
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,440
It was an eighth grader that built basically

1323
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,680
Tesla coil setup, like a tank circuit.

1324
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,160
And he basically showed that it, that little

1325
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,140
circuit that he built was 1.5 times

1326
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,500
the speed of light transmission.

1327
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,000
Very simple to do.

1328
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,800
And the way you do that is a

1329
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,140
tank circuit, which is capacitors in series shunted

1330
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,840
with a coil.

1331
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,800
If you want to do the opposite, slow

1332
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,220
it down, is coils in series shunted with

1333
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,840
capacitors.

1334
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,520
So it's very easy to do faster than

1335
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:46,840
light.

1336
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,460
And that's a longitudinal.

1337
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,520
When you say longitudinal, that's faster than light

1338
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,620
propagation, right?

1339
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,760
So you have to start thinking in those

1340
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,980
realms where things are instant.

1341
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,180
And that's, again, it goes into the, how

1342
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,920
much of, okay, let's just make an open

1343
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,720
question that maybe we can't answer.

1344
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,240
How much of messing around with that stuff

1345
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,220
can you do without the other realities coming

1346
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,620
and saying, hey, what are you doing?

1347
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:11,680
Yeah.

1348
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,440
Right, how much of that can you do?

1349
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,600
Or they'll say, hey, I see you're doing

1350
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:15,780
it.

1351
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,040
Let's invite this guy, right?

1352
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,160
Let's invite him, right?

1353
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,560
And then once you're invited, you walk through

1354
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,180
a door that you may not come back

1355
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,300
in, right, does that make sense?

1356
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,820
There's also a gray area such as that

1357
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,140
person who died 10 years ago who did

1358
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,120
invent and tried to patent a so-called

1359
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,020
free energy device, but was unsuccessful.

1360
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,880
And of course, Bismarck and Kalamnit, I forget

1361
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,240
the name.

1362
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,040
Well, you know, you can't just say one

1363
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,700
because there's many, I believe, and they've done

1364
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,040
many, many different ways.

1365
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,080
And I think they're all very different from

1366
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,060
each other, but using a similar principle that

1367
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,260
they may or may not be able to

1368
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,780
communicate, which is what we're trying to do

1369
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,420
now, perhaps.

1370
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,200
And you can recreate many elements out of

1371
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,340
others that have nothing to do with them

1372
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,220
using the latent free energies of the ether.

1373
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,820
What do you mean by elements?

1374
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,780
Like, I don't know, lithium or water, catalysis.

1375
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,720
I mean, bronze gas, that's supposed to be

1376
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,040
like a different phase of water that we

1377
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,800
didn't even know about.

1378
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,460
I get it.

1379
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,420
There's something, the field is, you know, yin

1380
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,120
and yang, right?

1381
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,160
I don't like discussing it that way because

1382
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,640
it sounds like I'm trying to get into

1383
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,220
a modified Asian philosophy.

1384
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,140
So I've come up with a new way

1385
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,220
to describe it.

1386
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,520
I call it universal principle.

1387
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,240
You know, yin being soft and expansive and

1388
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,120
yang is sharp and hard, right, and focused,

1389
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,460
right?

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,820
Yin is unfocused, yang is focused.

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,380
Again, it's like pressure mediation.

1392
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,940
When I get into, let's just call it

1393
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,520
transmutation.

1394
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,600
You okay with that term?

1395
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,380
Yep.

1396
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,540
Okay, I've done many, many times, I'd like

1397
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,960
to say hundreds of times in my life,

1398
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,200
but dozens of times, public demonstrations where I

1399
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,640
take pure carbon and transmute it into iron

1400
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,700
at a rate of 70% by volume.

1401
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,640
And what's interesting about the iron, once you

1402
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,640
transmute that, the iron does not rust, even

1403
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,600
though it measures as pure iron.

1404
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,740
And what's interesting is in India, there's some

1405
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,600
iron pillars and they're measured to be 99

1406
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,160
.999% pure iron and they don't rust.

1407
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,560
And the reason why it doesn't rust is

1408
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,280
if even you look at the bullshit periodic

1409
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,220
table that we have, when you follow Fe

1410
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,600
iron all the way, I mean, carbon all

1411
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,000
the way to iron, you notice it passes

1412
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,620
through nickel.

1413
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,940
And one of the characteristics or qualities of

1414
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,580
adding nickel to iron is that it won't

1415
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,380
rust, right?

1416
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,340
Stainless steel, for example, just one of the

1417
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:46,580
metals.

1418
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,220
So once you start transmuting elements, you can

1419
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,440
actually control their properties, which are very different

1420
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,460
from the way elements.

1421
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,540
So the iron that, so for example, the

1422
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,240
iron that we get that rusts is not

1423
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,120
made this way.

1424
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,400
Why?

1425
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,080
Because it oxidizes very readily.

1426
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,680
It goes through various stages, right?

1427
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,480
So now we understand that when you transmute

1428
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,200
elements, you can control based on the way

1429
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,860
things are ordered, let's say on the periodic

1430
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,740
table loosely.

1431
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,300
You know, like for example, you brought up

1432
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,600
lithium.

1433
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,540
Helium can be turned into lithium, right?

1434
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,900
And, you know, I'm sure Zanziers are perking

1435
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,560
up because, you know, you've heard about so

1436
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,320
many geopolitical moves being made because there's a

1437
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,800
potential for a lithium mine, right?

1438
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,080
So what do you think would happen?

1439
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,720
Let's say we're on the silver or the

1440
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,360
gold standard and you're able to make gold.

1441
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,860
How would you be viewed?

1442
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,860
As a threat, if you weren't- Yeah,

1443
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,340
exactly.

1444
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,960
In the Yalta conference, you'll find that, this

1445
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,540
is back in the 40s, that the Russians

1446
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,520
were given the go to control the world's

1447
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,840
platinum.

1448
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,220
And if you don't believe that, even platinum

1449
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,660
mines in the U.S. are owned by

1450
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,560
Russian, by Russian concerns, right?

1451
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,180
And through isotopic measurements, about 60 or 70

1452
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,000
% of the world's platinum is synthesized.

1453
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,640
In other words, made in the lab, but

1454
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,920
they can get away with it.

1455
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,500
For example, I've dabbled with this.

1456
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,080
Well, let's just say I'll share it.

1457
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,040
When you turn copper into gold and you

1458
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,000
have a Dory bar, which is about 20

1459
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,660
% gold still and some silver and copper,

1460
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,320
and you send it to a place to

1461
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,240
be tested, they run an isotope on the

1462
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,420
gold and they have a chart.

1463
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,320
And based on the isotope of gold, they

1464
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,720
know from what part of the world it

1465
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,840
came from, right?

1466
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,640
Because they've already mapped out all the gold

1467
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,020
mines and the regions.

1468
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,780
But if you make a certain percentage of

1469
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,060
gold and send it to a lab to

1470
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,400
be tested, and it doesn't show up on

1471
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,060
one of these isotopes, they tell you there's

1472
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,820
no gold in it.

1473
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,100
It's just iron and copper.

1474
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,300
And then you'll say, oh, really?

1475
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,100
Okay, well, why don't you send the sample

1476
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,460
back?

1477
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,820
And they'll say, oh, we lost the sample,

1478
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,600
right?

1479
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,740
And what's interesting, there's a place called Swastika,

1480
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,280
Canada.

1481
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,400
And that was one of the few.

1482
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,620
By the way, when you do this, these

1483
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,340
are labs that are registered that give you

1484
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,380
a certified, right?

1485
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,660
So all the computers are networked.

1486
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,160
Once you go into a system like that,

1487
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,160
now you're blacklisted.

1488
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,140
And all the labs that share that same

1489
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,520
network basically give you the same answer.

1490
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,680
So we sent it to a lab that

1491
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,000
we thought was out of this loop.

1492
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,000
And it was a week, we didn't get

1493
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,520
any answer.

1494
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,880
So I called and did you get my

1495
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,280
sample?

1496
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,620
And he says, yeah, we have your sample

1497
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:24,960
here.

1498
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,080
We haven't opened it yet.

1499
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,660
Is there anything you wanna tell us?

1500
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,920
I said, yeah, do you have it in

1501
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,440
your system?

1502
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,780
He says, let me look in my system.

1503
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
He says, oh yeah, I see you here.

1504
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,100
It sees that you were sending us a

1505
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,400
sample.

1506
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,320
It says that it's iron and copper and

1507
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,380
we lost the sample.

1508
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,620
But they haven't opened it yet, right?

1509
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,420
So anyway, I'm gonna stop right there.

1510
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,120
Let your mind, you know, see us.

1511
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,760
So there are things like that going on

1512
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,260
constantly.

1513
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,700
I recently spoke to someone who was kind

1514
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,600
of like, not a bad person, but he

1515
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,320
got in trouble with the judicial system.

1516
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,220
And he found a way to get make

1517
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,860
the case go away, but they didn't like

1518
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,140
that.

1519
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,220
So they said, well, the case can't go

1520
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,180
away because you have a grand jury indictment.

1521
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,560
Now, when we look at the dates, the

1522
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,600
grand jury indictment was three months before he

1523
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,660
was initially arrested.

1524
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,360
How could that be possible?

1525
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,420
Right?

1526
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,400
This is the kind of stuff that's so,

1527
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,960
sometimes when you see like the fix, the

1528
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,840
fakery, the suppression, it's so obvious.

1529
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,040
It's not subtle, right?

1530
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,640
And where's the outrage?

1531
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,260
For example, just to bounce around socially, how

1532
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,000
many times have you heard people like Tracy

1533
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,220
Twyman or certain people that made controversial, put

1534
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,080
out controversial material on the internet, or books

1535
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,520
or whatever.

1536
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,860
And they said, you know, I'm not suicidal

1537
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,260
or whatever.

1538
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,060
And yeah, you're not suicidal.

1539
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,500
You're very stable, you're sound body and mind.

1540
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,720
And then like a year later, you find

1541
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,320
out they were found hanging in their garage.

1542
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,080
Where's the outrage?

1543
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,320
It's obvious they were offed, right?

1544
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,600
But where's the outrage?

1545
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,960
Why aren't there like millions of people gathering

1546
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,700
around demanding?

1547
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,420
No one cares.

1548
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,300
So no one cares here.

1549
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,100
And you know what?

1550
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,460
They shouldn't care because deep down inside, they

1551
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,060
know they're here to waste their time.

1552
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,280
So why bother?

1553
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,640
And the way they get people to kill

1554
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,360
themselves can even be indirectly through psychotronic attacks.

1555
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,460
Yeah, depends on the character.

1556
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,020
I mean, like for me, no matter how

1557
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,920
many voices they beam in my head, I've

1558
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,840
taught myself to ignore them, right?

1559
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,700
Because I know all the voices are external

1560
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,480
anyway, right?

1561
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,480
Could you go over that?

1562
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,700
Because you're the first person that I resonated

1563
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,960
with describing that you shouldn't have the inner

1564
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,780
monologue and that it's actually something much darker.

1565
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,280
Yeah, I'll give you an example.

1566
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,380
We're taking up space.

1567
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,420
You ever see someone park their car in

1568
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,700
the middle of the road and they leave

1569
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,640
and it's like, wait a second, why couldn't

1570
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,920
you pull over to the side?

1571
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,840
So everybody else can pass.

1572
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,920
Well, that's what the earth is.

1573
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,080
We have parked ourselves in another reality and

1574
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,800
these other beings view us as something to

1575
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,420
be messed with.

1576
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,780
And they have a society just like we

1577
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:48,900
do.

1578
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,380
They have bars and movies and families, right?

1579
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,440
But they're not in our material realm.

1580
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,740
And they mess with us by giving us

1581
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,100
a voice.

1582
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,060
That's why when you try to remember back

1583
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,300
as far as you were an infant, you

1584
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,320
didn't have that inner voice.

1585
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,280
Sort of developed around five, six, seven that

1586
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,020
you can remember.

1587
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,260
And I'm pouring some coffee here.

1588
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,860
So what's interesting is they have beings that

1589
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,720
go through school.

1590
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,840
Like for example, in the West here in

1591
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,240
the US, we have a lot of Chinese

1592
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,880
restaurants with Chinese immigrants and people think, oh,

1593
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,160
they just came over from China to work

1594
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,640
in a restaurant.

1595
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,520
No, there are actual schools in China that

1596
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,280
train people to emigrate to the US and

1597
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,240
work in the restaurant business, right?

1598
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,100
So they have some little schools where when

1599
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,360
you deal with humans to give them their

1600
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:32,900
inner voice.

1601
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,120
And these are the different classifications of humans.

1602
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,280
And this is what they typically think of

1603
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,680
and say.

1604
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,940
And that gets locked into your voice.

1605
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,600
And the voice in your head sounds like

1606
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,640
the way you sound to yourself and you

1607
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,380
think it's you.

1608
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,920
Now, what's interesting is when you have, let's

1609
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,160
say a very mainstream person and they listen

1610
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,280
to their inner voice, kind of like in

1611
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,980
the cartoons, you got the good angel on

1612
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,940
your right shoulder and the bad angel on

1613
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,680
your left, right?

1614
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, they play that with you as well.

1615
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,300
But I can give you a scenario.

1616
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,420
Let's say you got a real mainstream person,

1617
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,980
believes everything on the news and files taxes,

1618
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,680
takes a pill when they're sick, all the

1619
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,540
basic stuff that mainstream does, right?

1620
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,760
Suddenly they go to like Zanz or your

1621
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,060
website and they start listening to some of

1622
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,060
your interviews and they're like, oh man, this

1623
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,460
sounds so intuitive and right.

1624
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,420
And I better read, it's not, you mean

1625
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,080
the world is not like I was told?

1626
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,040
And they start abandoning all those mainstream thoughts.

1627
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,960
That voice can no longer serve them.

1628
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,120
So he puts it on an alert.

1629
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,420
Hey, this guy's learning new stuff.

1630
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,180
I can't give him the voice anymore.

1631
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,820
So then they have to assign a new

1632
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,520
being to give you another voice.

1633
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,580
That's why when you run into people that

1634
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,840
kind of like just started learning this alternative

1635
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,440
stuff, it is the happiest time in their

1636
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,240
life, they're at the most peace in terms

1637
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,480
of their, they wanna learn, they wanna tell

1638
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,720
everyone and all this stuff.

1639
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,520
But when they send the new being over

1640
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,100
to them that's designed for those that go

1641
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,320
into the alternative world or whatever, suddenly you

1642
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,480
notice they start getting angry on why no

1643
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,580
one wants to hear what they're saying, right?

1644
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,640
Suddenly, they all have the same characteristics pretty

1645
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,240
much, right?

1646
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,760
And then when you find out by, for

1647
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,560
example, let's just bypass the whole thing here,

1648
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,480
that inner voice is artificial and they're actually

1649
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,040
keep replacing beings as your level of consciousness

1650
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,940
changes and you keep growing your consciousness and

1651
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,060
rejecting that inner voice, what happens is they

1652
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,160
send like the real big bad ones like

1653
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,580
the Delta Force beings and those guys, what

1654
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,020
they do is they start giving you a

1655
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,960
little clairvoyance, like what's going to happen eight

1656
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,420
minutes from now and you start feeling psychic

1657
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,500
and then you forget that it's still not

1658
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,120
you and now you start telling people that

1659
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,760
you're psychic and you're really not, it's still

1660
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,260
this other thing doing it.

1661
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,820
So, yeah, and I just gave you an

1662
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,800
overview and you've heard me discuss this more

1663
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,300
in depth but that's the overview.

1664
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,800
So, these people that say that they're psychic,

1665
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,360
they are but they're being played.

1666
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,820
They're being played also by a being that

1667
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,220
like, it's like, hey, this person here, their

1668
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,120
heart, the easiest way to control them is

1669
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,020
let's let them believe with a voice that

1670
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,980
they're psychic and then now we got them.

1671
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,600
So, okay, now, what if you know that's

1672
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,500
going on, now you go even beyond that,

1673
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,660
being psychic, oh, Greek or anything, really being

1674
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,000
beyond psychic, of course, and you just keep

1675
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,660
operating and then you get to a point

1676
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,660
like the Truman Show where he takes the

1677
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,980
sailboat out and he finds that it's all

1678
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,020
fake in the set, right?

1679
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,120
So, once you get past that psychic point,

1680
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,820
then you see, oh, it's nothing here is

1681
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,660
worth it and I'm not saying this to

1682
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:47,900
be whatever, a downer, but just enjoy yourself.

1683
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,200
Hey, look, there's plenty of people that work

1684
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,680
in Hollywood and show business with fakery around

1685
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,840
them, even they're even, hey, I'll let you

1686
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,320
in on something.

1687
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,440
Do you know when you watch entertainment movies

1688
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,840
or whatever, you know, they're actually told what

1689
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,640
to say usually and it's reading a script,

1690
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,720
you believe that, right?

1691
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,380
And most of the stuff is props and

1692
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,620
fake.

1693
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,440
Hey, does that mean they're having a terrible

1694
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,840
time?

1695
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,200
No, you can still enjoy yourself in that

1696
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,520
setting.

1697
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,540
You see what I mean?

1698
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,940
Yeah, so every word that you can make

1699
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,120
out is, it betrays this possession, so to

1700
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,920
speak, because you're supposed to think in clearer

1701
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,360
ideas, nothing good.

1702
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,480
Influence, I'm glad you mentioned that because first

1703
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,660
you have influence with these beings and then

1704
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,480
the people that have problems with their cognitive

1705
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,160
ability, those are oppressed, like voices that, you

1706
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,360
know, that's what they use, let's say, for

1707
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,660
example, a beam of thoughts in your head

1708
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,900
to make you kill yourself, right?

1709
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,720
You have the oppression.

1710
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,460
And the final state is possession where your

1711
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,420
consciousness is completely taken over and becomes unconscious

1712
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,420
and this other being now operates through you,

1713
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,240
right?

1714
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,180
And this is all non-material, not like

1715
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,100
the real takeover, this is not being a

1716
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:58,380
host.

1717
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,940
You are a host though, but there's no

1718
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,800
physical entity, it's all mental, so you have

1719
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,000
to watch out for that too.

1720
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,040
Yes, which is not really so much pranking,

1721
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,600
which probably has a much deeper cause, which

1722
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,060
has to do with loosing, I mean, living

1723
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,000
and using our creative powers, which they lack.

1724
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,020
Yeah, and they feed off of it.

1725
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,720
There's a movie called Monsters, Inc.

1726
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,420
where they scare the children and they, actually

1727
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,000
their energy reloads their, right, it's their food

1728
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,320
source?

1729
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:30,800
Yeah.

1730
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,660
That is absolutely, I would say, 99.99,

1731
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,240
almost absolute, one of the situations that's going

1732
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,520
on.

1733
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,460
And if this astral world that people say

1734
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,000
that they go into or these spiritual beings,

1735
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,740
doesn't matter if they're biblical, whatever religion, new

1736
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,880
age, I don't care, if they're so, oh,

1737
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,780
I met a benefactor, a beneficial entity, really?

1738
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,520
So how come he hasn't given you a

1739
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,780
formula for like, you know, curing cancer or

1740
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,300
free energy?

1741
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,820
None of them are beneficial.

1742
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,560
Even if you read the biblical text, whatever

1743
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,180
God in there that you're talking about, show

1744
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,340
me one that's beneficial or benefacted to us.

1745
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,400
None of them are, none of them, not

1746
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,660
a one, so.

1747
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,920
So, yeah, that does away with any form

1748
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,860
of channeling, but there is.

1749
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,820
They're not here to help.

1750
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,680
Mm-hmm, but there is one of these

1751
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,520
communications that is like, let's say, genuine, which

1752
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,840
maybe I shouldn't expose this, but you yourself

1753
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,580
were subject to, which is the one that's

1754
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,460
more cellular and the one that Ashayana describes

1755
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,320
as kelontic.

1756
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,640
Mm-hmm.

1757
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,880
Okay, excuse me, I believe that they are

1758
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,900
operating in a way that we are also,

1759
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,200
in other words, but on a different level,

1760
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:45,760
right?

1761
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,920
So let's say, for example, you have someone

1762
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,280
who's barely making, eking a living because they

1763
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,200
have financial problems, right?

1764
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,820
But then you have someone who's worth several

1765
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,820
billion and they have financial problems that physically

1766
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,740
and mentally have them in the same condition

1767
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,840
that the person who could barely get enough

1768
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,420
food to eat.

1769
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,260
You know what I mean?

1770
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,580
So a wealthy person that's miserable because of

1771
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,540
finances or someone who has no money at

1772
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,480
all that's miserable because of finances and they're

1773
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,760
in the same condition, it doesn't matter what

1774
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,440
level you're on.

1775
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,620
Yeah, the guy who's the billionaire that's degrading

1776
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,420
because of his financial, he's got a Rolls

1777
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,740
Royce and a mansion, but mentally and physically,

1778
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,340
he's in just as shitty as the guy

1779
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,280
who can't get enough to eat, you see?

1780
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,260
So these other beings are like we are,

1781
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,800
but just on a different level.

1782
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,180
You know, they're driving Ferraris instead of horse

1783
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:37,660
and carriage.

1784
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,160
They're just as screwed up as we are.

1785
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,700
Because the sum average, there are people that

1786
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,480
get, there's a little meme, a cartoon, where

1787
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,980
there's some little greys in a flying saucer

1788
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,620
and they look down on the earth in

1789
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,700
the meme and you see smokestacks and pollution.

1790
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,620
And the greys are speaking to each other.

1791
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,260
They say, hey, didn't we send them Tesla

1792
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,300
100 years ago?

1793
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,420
Yeah, but they didn't listen to them and

1794
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,780
they're all laughing, right?

1795
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,620
Yeah, but probably they also don't just use

1796
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,460
the imps and demons, I mean, but also

1797
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:17,580
5G frequencies to instill the confusion and the

1798
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:21,080
subliminal messages, plant ideas.

1799
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,140
I think it's even before, 5G is basically

1800
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,620
a transmission system to operate machines that are

1801
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,500
loaded with a lot of circuitry.

1802
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,020
And it has a very high dynamic range,

1803
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,460
5G.

1804
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,740
What I would suggest the technology to do

1805
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,240
that was more around if you study the

1806
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,940
work of Delgado in the 1960s, mind control,

1807
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,400
where in the 1960s, he went out into

1808
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,040
a bullfight arena and he had a little

1809
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,920
wooden box in his hand and they let

1810
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,220
the bull charge him, pushes a button and

1811
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,620
the bull stops and kneels, pushes another button,

1812
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,620
the bull gets up and charges, pushes that

1813
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,300
other button again, the bull stops and kneels.

1814
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,760
This was in the 60s.

1815
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,460
This was publicly demonstrated.

1816
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,740
Was it low frequency or ultrasound?

1817
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,180
Yes, but it's never one frequency.

1818
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,260
It's kind of like when you sit down

1819
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,960
for dinner, you just don't eat one thing,

1820
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,200
right?

1821
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,460
You have a side with it and you

1822
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,920
have some seasoning, right?

1823
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,320
It's, I'm giving the food metaphor.

1824
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,860
It's a recipe.

1825
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,240
Right, but since we're on this topic, could

1826
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,020
we maybe delineate between the people who are

1827
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,280
body snatched literally, like by aliens or by

1828
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,240
Brill, and the ones who are synthetic?

1829
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,880
Oh, I can't really, I can't say I'm

1830
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,700
expert on that.

1831
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,600
But you were the only one who described

1832
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,640
how the synthetics can be created, let's say.

1833
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,980
Oh, you mean like a clone?

1834
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:50,880
Well, yeah, let's say for simplicity of terms,

1835
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,200
cloning.

1836
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,940
Yeah, but I'm referring to the way that

1837
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,200
you said that you can, through technology, obstruct

1838
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,360
the light that goes from the sperm cell

1839
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,140
to the egg.

1840
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1841
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,640
Well, it's all light.

1842
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,600
That's actually been substantiated clinically, that when the

1843
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,820
sperm, let's say, fertilizes the egg, there's a

1844
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,800
flash of light, right?

1845
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,880
The same with blood cells.

1846
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,280
Live blood testing, they'll see flashes of light

1847
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,140
and then new types of cells appearing in

1848
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,760
the blood sample.

1849
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,600
Yeah, there's many ways to do it, but

1850
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,120
essentially you're going to be, once you create

1851
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,900
a being that you could walk into a

1852
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,920
room and press the flesh, you're gonna go

1853
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,840
into the cloning technology where they have to

1854
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,960
be grown into a tank.

1855
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,840
And I suggest that the tank isn't made

1856
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,600
of any hard material, kind of like in

1857
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,040
some of the newer sci-fi cloning, you

1858
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,460
see it's a soft material, right?

1859
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,440
Because you don't want to twitch and bump

1860
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,840
and break a limb while you're being formed.

1861
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:49,380
So I would suggest that eventually understanding the

1862
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,760
cloning and growing human or whatever animal has

1863
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,480
been going on for a very long time

1864
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,060
as well, which we call a synthetic.

1865
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,860
But okay, synthetic in terms of the impetus

1866
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,400
when let's say a child is in the

1867
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,660
womb being, yeah, when that light is affected,

1868
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,820
you can change the trajectory and the development

1869
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,240
of that being and what spirit will embody

1870
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:11,480
it.

1871
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1872
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,040
And it takes a very short period of

1873
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,480
time, right?

1874
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,540
When you see a flash of light, how

1875
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,800
long does that last, milliseconds?

1876
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,200
So you have to be able to do

1877
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,000
quite a bit of adjusting in that small

1878
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,220
amount of time and to synthesize a type

1879
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:25,600
of being.

1880
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,320
So in other words, yeah, I would say

1881
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,460
maybe, let's say as the breeders keep breeding,

1882
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,340
there is technology that can actually control the

1883
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,220
quality of the person that will be bred

1884
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,240
at that moment.

1885
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,360
Yeah.

1886
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,700
Downgrading or upgrading.

1887
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,680
I see no reason for, yeah, I see

1888
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,160
no reason for upgrading anyone here at all

1889
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,780
because there's just, putting a highly intelligent capable

1890
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:56,180
individual in this world is living hell, right?

1891
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,600
You want low functioning people here.

1892
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,920
But in regards to light, that also has

1893
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,300
to do with, that's behind some of the

1894
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:15,180
psi abilities, like manifestation is just visualizing something

1895
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,120
before it exists and then you bring it

1896
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:18,300
about.

1897
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,420
Well, psi abilities go, like I described earlier,

1898
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,500
where they keep exchanging the being that gives

1899
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,140
you your inner voice and they can't do

1900
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:26,440
anymore.

1901
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,860
They give you someone who makes you think

1902
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,620
you're psychic and usually fall for it.

1903
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,260
And when you're not on that level, when

1904
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,220
you don't fall for it, you'll find that

1905
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,980
the psi abilities are not a big deal

1906
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,780
and that everyone has it and you're wondering

1907
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,020
why they're not using it.

1908
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,560
It's a different level.

1909
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,480
You're not going to say, because I have

1910
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,800
psi abilities, I'm better.

1911
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,980
You're going to say, oh, how terrible this

1912
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,340
is because look at everyone has it, but

1913
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,540
yet they're not using it.

1914
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,400
Another component that is overlooked in the psi

1915
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,580
and other things is the emotional.

1916
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,460
And no one has really been able to

1917
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,220
describe their purpose or their meaning.

1918
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,840
Yeah, I get into a lot of that.

1919
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,340
I'm going to probably be doing a seminar

1920
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,720
on that, a fee-based one.

1921
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,640
I've been speaking on it now for quite

1922
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,320
a few years.

1923
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,040
I thought about it for quite a few

1924
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,720
years before that, doing experimentation.

1925
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,180
I call it the emo work.

1926
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,660
There's no explanation for why we have emotions

1927
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,520
in society, why they exist.

1928
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,240
It's not just, if you believe that we're

1929
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,800
just biochemically stimulated and that's all, then this

1930
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,860
is not for you, of course, but there's

1931
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,600
no explanation why we are emotional.

1932
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,600
But then you'll find, how many times have

1933
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,480
you heard of someone going postal, right?

1934
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,540
Very calm individual, suddenly they were emotionally motivated

1935
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,180
to do some heinous crime or wonderful thing

1936
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,680
also goes the other way as well.

1937
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,220
So once you learn to take control of

1938
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,340
those emotions, you'll find that's where your consciousness

1939
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,660
is and your actual body works by emotion,

1940
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,260
not by the voice in your head.

1941
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,020
And also the emo work creates a field

1942
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,300
around your environment that helps you control or

1943
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,080
influence things around you, people and material, you

1944
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,200
know.

1945
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,820
Yeah, the emotional envelops the energetic and the

1946
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,080
physical.

1947
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,200
That's what it is.

1948
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,240
That's what you're actually reading.

1949
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,060
The emo is the reading of that.

1950
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,680
And it also ties in with the body's

1951
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,140
consciousness.

1952
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,400
Your body has a slightly different consciousness.

1953
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,320
It's a very primitive consciousness.

1954
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,740
Like for example, you can say that, yeah.

1955
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,260
It's kind of like someone's an intelligent guy,

1956
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,900
tired of being here.

1957
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,380
He wants to kill himself through drowning.

1958
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,340
And as he's drowning himself, there's a voice.

1959
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,980
Why are you doing this to me?

1960
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,820
I wanna live.

1961
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,960
Don't do that, right?

1962
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,340
That's the body's consciousness.

1963
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,120
You know, that keeps the heart rate and

1964
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,580
all that going.

1965
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,160
So that also lies in the emo.

1966
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,040
If the body gives you a voice like

1967
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,260
that, it's very desperate.

1968
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,000
It doesn't operate that way.

1969
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,360
The body operates only in the emo.

1970
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,940
I seem to recall serial killers coming to

1971
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,160
that realization when, for example, just after they

1972
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,960
slit their own throats or something like that,

1973
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,080
they regretted it.

1974
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,880
Yeah, it's like this dual.

1975
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,800
I'm not saying duality in a sense that,

1976
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,240
you know, left and right or black and

1977
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:13,400
white.

1978
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,819
It's a very, very minor, small consciousness, right,

1979
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,560
that's there, that runs the body.

1980
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,420
And you brought up yin yang.

1981
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,840
And would you say that that is, you

1982
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,520
know, something you can find anywhere, meaning everything

1983
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,220
that is, let's say, positive has a counterpart

1984
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,060
that is negative and that's how the universe

1985
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,120
balances itself?

1986
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,540
Yes and no.

1987
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,819
It's not static like that.

1988
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:39,439
You know, when you say positive, negative, the

1989
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,939
first thing people go to is a battery,

1990
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:41,319
right?

1991
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,800
You don't put the battery, positive, negative, corresponding

1992
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,180
to the device, it doesn't work.

1993
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,319
And it's that battery always has a positive

1994
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:48,580
and always has a negative, right?

1995
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,660
It's not like that, really.

1996
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,819
I mean, that's a good way to start.

1997
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,840
But it's the constant rate of motion.

1998
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:55,540
The only thing that doesn't change is that

1999
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,520
things always change.

2000
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,680
So everything is in constant flux.

2001
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,520
So when something becomes very yin, it attracts

2002
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,180
more yang.

2003
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,819
But if it becomes so yin to a

2004
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:09,180
limit where it cannot become more yin, it

2005
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,960
flips over and becomes yang itself.

2006
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,740
For example, let's give a grenade.

2007
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,500
Let's just analyze a military grenade.

2008
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,640
You hold it in your hand, it's very

2009
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,800
heavy, it's very hard.

2010
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,100
Everything is packed very tight, even the gas

2011
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,500
that's in there or whatever is packed super

2012
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,460
tight, that's considered definitely a yang object.

2013
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:28,359
When you engage the grenade and the reaction

2014
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,020
begins, what does it do?

2015
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,180
Does it get more yang?

2016
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,300
Or it's as yang as it can be,

2017
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,060
the trigger in a grenade makes it a

2018
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,580
little more yang to the point where now

2019
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,380
it becomes, what?

2020
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:41,080
Yin, which is expansive and very quickly.

2021
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,840
But the expansion happens very quickly in a

2022
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,460
yang fashion.

2023
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,520
So when something is very yin, you counter

2024
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,160
it with something that is yang in small

2025
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,939
measure because you don't want to tip it

2026
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,180
over, right?

2027
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,140
So I'll give you an example.

2028
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,320
The human body is really where we apply

2029
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,760
this to.

2030
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,980
And this might sound crazy, but this is

2031
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,340
a true experience.

2032
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,920
The top of your head is the most

2033
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,560
yang part of the human body and the

2034
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,100
bottom of your feet is the most yin

2035
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,940
part of the body, right?

2036
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,540
So for example, when you hear someone that

2037
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,120
has a brain tumor, that is a energy

2038
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,900
in the body that is very, very yin

2039
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,280
because it rushed up to the most yang

2040
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,160
part of the body, right?

2041
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,240
So anything ailment on your feet or near

2042
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,640
below the knee is a very yang energy

2043
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,740
and it rushed down to the yin part

2044
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,300
of the body.

2045
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,660
And by the way, for the brain tumor,

2046
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,800
people try various things that they need to

2047
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,660
do is various salts, which are yang, to

2048
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,340
contract it.

2049
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,940
But if you really want to hit it

2050
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,760
hard and fast and make it go away

2051
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,360
in a few days, for example, start studying

2052
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,000
the yin and yang and you'll come up

2053
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,800
with something and I'll give you something I've

2054
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,440
come up with and it works, is if

2055
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,660
you look at energy perspective, the most yin

2056
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:09,920
energy, the most yin energy is radioactivity, what's

2057
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,560
commonly known as radioactivity.

2058
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,020
Now, that's how yin, the energy is that

2059
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,300
causes an ailment in the brain.

2060
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,680
So what can counter that?

2061
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,100
Do we know any living organic substance that

2062
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:23,740
counters it?

2063
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,500
There is an insect called a cockroach and

2064
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,080
it's very well known that it could take

2065
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,640
on a manifold many times levels of radioactivity

2066
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,580
and still be unaffected where that would kill

2067
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,700
other living things, right?

2068
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,180
But so that roach, cockroach is extremely yang,

2069
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,040
but let's, is there a way to make

2070
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,800
it even more yang?

2071
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,120
If we take the roach and bake it

2072
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,360
until it carbonizes, not burns, but turns black

2073
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,980
into carbon, let's say 300 degrees Celsius, 550

2074
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,240
degrees for a half an hour you'll have

2075
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,400
some very toasted roaches in a cookie sheet,

2076
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,440
carbonized, you can break them up in your

2077
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:01,760
hand.

2078
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,700
You put them in a gel capsule and

2079
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,420
you have the victim with the tumor take

2080
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,300
three capsules in the morning, three in the

2081
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,320
afternoon and three at night and then go

2082
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,320
get a scan about a week later and

2083
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,820
try to find that brain tumor.

2084
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,100
Sounds kind of crazy, sounds kind of witch

2085
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,060
doctor-y, doesn't it?

2086
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,780
By the way, if you're going to apply

2087
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,520
this, I wouldn't suggest the person that they're

2088
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,740
taking capsules of roasted cockroaches, they don't even

2089
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,240
have to know.

2090
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,860
So I just gave an example of the

2091
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,280
power of this universal.

2092
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,200
By the way, with ancient healers that were

2093
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,400
valid, do you know most ailments were healed

2094
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,920
or cured within 24 to 36 hours, 72

2095
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,840
hours tops, right?

2096
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,580
Within a few days.

2097
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,840
Very rapidly because it's all energetic.

2098
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,360
The thing is, if you do it, when

2099
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,980
you apply energy, principles of energy to anything

2100
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,360
physical, what happens if you apply too much

2101
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,460
energy to that physical thing?

2102
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,660
You can blow it up too, right?

2103
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,680
So you have to be careful.

2104
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,980
You have to know how to dose it

2105
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,180
out.

2106
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:03,460
Do you think that overlaying colors, I heard

2107
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,440
that if you project certain colors in a

2108
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,840
certain spiral, especially the spiral, do you think

2109
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,720
that applying energetics or psi or something using

2110
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,720
spirals has a potency effect?

2111
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,520
Oh gosh, that's a funny question.

2112
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,680
I'll give you a funny answer.

2113
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,040
Try it and report back.

2114
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:23,140
Right.

2115
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:29,660
You brought up the cockroaches and another old

2116
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,280
time scoop of yours is that these insects

2117
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,360
have an elemental entity that governs them and

2118
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,780
they're also- Very much like people do,

2119
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,060
yeah.

2120
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,360
All of these things do.

2121
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,980
If that element withdraws, those insects withdraw from

2122
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:45,560
our reality.

2123
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:46,740
Right.

2124
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,900
So I guess our elemental are the gods

2125
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,280
who put this- I would say they're

2126
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,140
partially withdrawn and kind of, yeah, just have

2127
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,780
minimal influence on us right now.

2128
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,860
Yeah, they use proxies.

2129
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,000
Yeah, many levels of, you know, one of

2130
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,800
the things that I say is I was

2131
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,120
sent here by accident and it was, well,

2132
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,440
you know, if someone's religious, they say, well,

2133
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,060
God doesn't make accidents, he's perfect.

2134
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,660
Yeah, but if you're God, you have admins

2135
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:15,720
working for you, right?

2136
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,680
And they're not perfect.

2137
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,360
So they screwed up and sent my stupid

2138
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,300
ass here and I shouldn't be here, right?

2139
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,180
And because I know I shouldn't be here,

2140
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,780
I'm not gonna act like I belong here

2141
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,780
either, right?

2142
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,000
I don't want anything from here.

2143
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,320
I just wanna skate through life.

2144
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,120
I just wanna skate through and just get

2145
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,240
the F out of here, right?

2146
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,540
I don't want cars or fancy things or

2147
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,860
money or I want good enough fitness, quote

2148
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,700
unquote, health, so I don't act like a

2149
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,600
lab rat sick here, right?

2150
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,560
I just wanna skate through this reality.

2151
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,520
I wanna go through the third grade and

2152
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,380
not do my homework.

2153
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,060
And then just at the end of the

2154
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,600
semester, tell me I'm going to the fourth

2155
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,600
grade, which is in another different school.

2156
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,260
That's my whole reality here.

2157
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,720
And the God with a capital G isn't

2158
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,500
even mentioned in the Bible.

2159
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,980
It's just the fact that all the gods

2160
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,600
have been given that name.

2161
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,040
Yeah, Yahweh is a man.

2162
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,660
If you study it and read it, it's

2163
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,200
very clear in Exodus 15.

2164
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,100
But does he have an adversary?

2165
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,740
Meaning is there a Satan entity?

2166
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,580
Let's put it this way.

2167
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,540
It's purely political.

2168
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,280
Are you pro Biden or pro Trump?

2169
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,500
If you're pro Trump, Biden is the devil.

2170
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,640
If you're pro Biden, Trump is the devil.

2171
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,120
That's all, that's all it is.

2172
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,760
Right.

2173
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:33,920
It's political.

2174
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,960
Yeah, I heard that the state we're in

2175
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,260
now started with the reincarnation blanking and the

2176
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,400
fields that are supposed to suppress us and

2177
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,740
keep our ages limited happened around 25,000

2178
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,200
years ago with the Leviathan races coming and

2179
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,840
taking over Atlantis and putting portals around.

2180
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,860
I think the time thing is kind of

2181
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,380
messed up and I'll tell you why.

2182
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,260
Let's just say we had, I don't trust

2183
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,180
any of those numbers.

2184
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,800
It's fine to discuss them because sometimes they

2185
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,120
parcel out and work well, right?

2186
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,300
If I go shopping and I say I

2187
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,640
have three cans of beans and a dozen

2188
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,180
eggs, you can see that, right?

2189
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,560
Let's say it's even that good, but I

2190
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,860
could show you that those beans are not

2191
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,360
really beans and those eggs are not really

2192
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:18,620
eggs.

2193
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,320
Or an egg is really an entire chicken.

2194
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,500
You know, when you eat an egg, it's

2195
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,860
no different energetically than eating an entire chicken.

2196
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,420
When you eat chicken, you just eat the

2197
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,140
muscle tissue.

2198
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,280
You're not eating the organs, the feathers, the

2199
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,400
head or anything, right?

2200
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,260
But when you eat an egg, you're eating

2201
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,140
all of that, right?

2202
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,560
So you can get into all the fine

2203
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,720
points, the energetics, the portals, the time and

2204
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,120
all that.

2205
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,520
But time is just, do we wanna talk

2206
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,260
about when the event happened or the event?

2207
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,240
Because right now, I'll tell you, like I'm

2208
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,480
working on several projects.

2209
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,460
It'll be eight in the morning and I'm

2210
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,160
working on something and I feel like a

2211
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,960
half hour just went by.

2212
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,220
I should get something to eat.

2213
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,100
It's eight in the morning.

2214
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,480
But I come in and look at the

2215
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,640
clock and it's five o'clock.

2216
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,440
How is that possible?

2217
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,540
I'm not talking about lost time either because

2218
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,160
I know I'm not, you know, I tend

2219
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,840
to look at objects to see if they're

2220
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,940
changing in real time.

2221
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,860
It means I'm in a dream.

2222
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,360
I'm not in a dream state, no lost

2223
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:10,660
time.

2224
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,400
So the whole thing about when things happened

2225
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,060
is I've gotten away from.

2226
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,960
I can talk a lot about things that

2227
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,920
are going to happen and are happening right

2228
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,600
now that I've discussed over a decade ago,

2229
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,840
even gave the year.

2230
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,400
But in terms of how long things are,

2231
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,260
I've really started to separate myself from the

2232
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,740
whole thing about time.

2233
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,040
No, I'm with you.

2234
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,760
Yeah, I heard too many conflicted testimonies that

2235
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,700
I can't believe anything.

2236
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,500
So basically I'm just going by what's most

2237
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:40,880
compelling.

2238
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,000
I agree.

2239
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,420
I agree, always, you know.

2240
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,100
But about the predictions, I think for the

2241
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,400
longest, I mean, for a long time, you

2242
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,820
weren't super clear cut about the exact time

2243
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,240
and the exact date of the reset, but

2244
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,160
after looking at our cakes and maybe other

2245
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,320
sources, I think you have concluded that the

2246
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,240
reset is not around the corner, but it's

2247
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,920
somewhere more along the lines of 2040, which

2248
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,480
also falls in line with the greatest, in

2249
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,600
my opinion, remote viewing experiment based on the

2250
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,640
year 2050, when all the people, they isolated

2251
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,100
that time period as the one that will

2252
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,280
be the most meaningful and that there will

2253
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,500
be no overpopulation, meaning that there must be

2254
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,880
a loss of life in the middle there.

2255
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,840
Yes, yes.

2256
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,120
I think that that'll be more evident around

2257
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,240
the 2030 time, because they tend to push,

2258
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,020
when the powers that be, like Zan mentioned

2259
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:37,120
earlier, they know what's coming.

2260
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,740
Like, for example, you can go underground and

2261
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,280
someone will bring a text to you that's

2262
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,060
3000 years old and it looks like it

2263
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,500
was printed 10 years ago, right?

2264
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,600
So everything, all knowledge is preserved, not on

2265
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,280
the surface though.

2266
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,560
So I would suggest my time, I've always

2267
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,060
speculated and said, this is what's coming out

2268
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,520
of the biblical text, right?

2269
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,920
You have 2000 years here, this time period

2270
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,880
here, this is dictated to repeat at this

2271
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,480
time and I gave certain specifics and that

2272
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,540
seems to be working out.

2273
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,800
With the advent of the material from archaics

2274
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,540
showing it's more astronomical, geophysical and repeatable, mostly,

2275
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,900
there are many events, by the way, that

2276
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,540
were just, just as bad as what archaics

2277
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,880
talks about that happened that he doesn't talk

2278
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,380
about outside of that 138 year periodicity or

2279
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:27,100
that 500 something year periodicity, right?

2280
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,160
There are other events that were very similar

2281
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:29,640
to those.

2282
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,040
Very difficult to tell on that point.

2283
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,440
Again, I've kind of divorced myself from the

2284
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,340
speaking out on time at all, the other

2285
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,480
past, present or future.

2286
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:43,260
And most of the stuff I'm just qualifying

2287
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,540
is stuff that I've derived from the biblical

2288
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:49,000
text because it's such a foundational book that

2289
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,140
everyone focuses on, but no one knows what's

2290
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,880
in it because they don't read it, right?

2291
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,320
They listen to other people who are telling

2292
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,000
them what's in it.

2293
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,520
Well, they can just read it themselves.

2294
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,080
It's pretty simple.

2295
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:03,100
So I would question the veracity of the

2296
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,440
biblical text and its accuracy based on tampering,

2297
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,260
right?

2298
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,300
Or whatever, or how valid it is.

2299
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,680
But I'll tell you this, I'm an Old

2300
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,260
Testament kind of guy, right?

2301
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,580
I would rather get my law from something

2302
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,440
like the Old Testament than what the state

2303
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,520
is telling me to do in terms of

2304
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,820
how I eat, how I do business.

2305
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,140
And by the way, if you look at

2306
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:25,380
all the conventional laws, what's considered common law,

2307
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,900
that all comes from that text anyways.

2308
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,020
No one seems to know it, so why

2309
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,540
not, right?

2310
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,780
And that's how I pretty much operate.

2311
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,620
But I think about the gods, that they

2312
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:40,300
always tend to appoint themselves as our creators.

2313
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,520
That's something that signifies them because they want

2314
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,940
us to worship them.

2315
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,020
Yeah, big egos.

2316
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,000
That's something to find in the testimonies as

2317
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,500
well, firsthand.

2318
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,260
But also, let me give a little diversion

2319
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:56,740
to that.

2320
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,200
Some, let's just say, I'm not a fan

2321
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,140
of the New Testament because talk about corrupted

2322
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:05,560
texts, but when the JES, the Messiah, there

2323
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,200
are more references to those that know, not

2324
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,200
believe, but know what's going on to calling

2325
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,180
them his brother, his family, not someone to

2326
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:14,900
worship, right?

2327
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,960
So just want to put that in there.

2328
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,240
There are some elements, quote unquote, of the

2329
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,800
gods that consider us to be brothers.

2330
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,180
Now, what is a brother, right?

2331
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,260
So not, right, you don't worship your brother.

2332
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,180
So I just want to throw that in

2333
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:30,360
there.

2334
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,400
Yeah, because it's not all about worshiping.

2335
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:37,180
No, and they also apparently see us as

2336
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:42,680
really cherished relations that we're their most prized

2337
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,720
possession, maybe, or?

2338
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,320
Yeah, it's kind of like when, in America,

2339
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,780
they do this, dad spanks the child and

2340
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,040
says, this is gonna hurt me more than

2341
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,420
it's gonna hurt you, but he spanks him

2342
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:53,720
anyway.

2343
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,200
I'm not into that kind of stuff.

2344
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,500
So do we have to go through what

2345
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,060
we're going through right here?

2346
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,600
I mean, most people think about it.

2347
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,100
We can have this discussion as many times

2348
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,800
and with whoever, but 99% of the

2349
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,060
people, let's say 90% of the people

2350
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,640
to be more conservative have no clue and

2351
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,100
don't care, right?

2352
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,720
Everything is fine for them, right?

2353
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,120
So we're still talking about a rare, this

2354
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,620
is the stuff we're talking about here is

2355
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,180
for small, rarefied group.

2356
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,780
True, but there must be also a purpose

2357
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,880
why they would treasure us, which, yeah, has

2358
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,060
to do probably with the ascension cycle, but

2359
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,380
more immediately, what would you say is the

2360
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:40,480
main reason why we are so disputed and

2361
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,220
so coveted?

2362
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,600
Does it have to do with the physicality

2363
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,420
and what advantages do we have?

2364
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,700
I think it's like that material and non

2365
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,200
-material lineage, like someone who's raising chickens, you

2366
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,880
have to guard the eggs that the shells

2367
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,040
don't crack because those eggs, when they mature,

2368
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,920
will become chicks, which will mature and become

2369
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:07,100
chickens to carry on the bloodline and beyond,

2370
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,280
and the notion that chickens exist in the

2371
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:09,980
universe even.

2372
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,120
I don't know, but what I do know

2373
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,220
for sure is that I was sent here

2374
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,920
by mistake and I don't belong here and

2375
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,220
I'm not gonna act like I do, right?

2376
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,200
I know that for sure.

2377
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,860
I know we're wasting our time, I know

2378
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,520
that for sure.

2379
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,920
Very simple, just anyone that you know, love,

2380
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,620
don't like, like or not, try to communicate.

2381
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,900
It doesn't matter what it is.

2382
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,280
It's like, what the hell is going on?

2383
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,780
We are not communicating, right?

2384
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,420
And we're wasting time.

2385
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,300
And I know that for sure.

2386
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,680
I know for sure we're in a spiritually

2387
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,120
semi, well, we're also in a materially toxic

2388
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,480
place.

2389
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,260
For example, materially, let's say you find an

2390
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,200
unadulterated society living on the surface.

2391
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,780
They're living in harmony with the land.

2392
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,520
They still get diseases and storms and earthquakes

2393
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,280
and outbreaks and attacks by wild animals.

2394
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,100
So it's even toxic for the most optimum

2395
01:23:59,100 --> 01:23:59,680
situations.

2396
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,520
It's very toxic.

2397
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,120
How very toxic it is to be here

2398
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,040
depends on the perspective, right?

2399
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,400
So I know these things are for sure

2400
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,100
that I mentioned.

2401
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,580
And the rest, those past few things that

2402
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,400
I just mentioned, the past minute or so,

2403
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,280
is enough for me to chew on that

2404
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,520
may or not prevent me from going further.

2405
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,020
Why are we cherished or why are we

2406
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,720
here or what's going on after and all

2407
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:28,880
that?

2408
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,860
And at some point, you know, there's a

2409
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,220
mind state, you know, like you can be

2410
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,260
hungry and then you get some bad news

2411
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,780
and suddenly your appetite goes away.

2412
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,380
My appetite is gone for many of these

2413
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:40,800
things here.

2414
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,140
I just wanna skate through this reality and

2415
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,260
get the F out of here.

2416
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,260
And then I'll take what comes as it

2417
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:47,500
comes.

2418
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,900
I know there's some people listening to this

2419
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,620
say, well, this guy's a real downer, man.

2420
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,180
Well, too bad.

2421
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:55,240
Wake up, actually educate yourself.

2422
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,400
Because you know, if you go to sleep,

2423
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,700
you know, they say people should wake up.

2424
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,640
Doesn't make any sense, because if you go

2425
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,420
to sleep stupid, you wake up, guess what?

2426
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,700
You're still stupid.

2427
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,540
You have to educate yourself.

2428
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,720
I mean, gain knowledge and workable knowledge that

2429
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,760
you can apply based on your capacity, right?

2430
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,600
Well, yeah, but that just means that you're

2431
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,240
not here to smell the flowers, but you

2432
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,540
still have a purpose because otherwise you wouldn't

2433
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:24,100
have this inborn reason to persist.

2434
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,060
So it just manifests.

2435
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,240
Yeah, there are a lot of good movies.

2436
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,020
Let's say a scenario for a movie where

2437
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,180
someone's traveling cross country on the dog, you

2438
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,380
know, the Greyhound bus, and they get off

2439
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,020
on the wrong stop and they're left there.

2440
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,720
And then the rest of the movie commences

2441
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,980
on their experiences there.

2442
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:40,860
That could make a good film.

2443
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,260
You could write a pretty good script around

2444
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:42,640
that, right?

2445
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,140
Yeah.

2446
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,120
You said once that, which I agree that

2447
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,680
90% of this existence, I mean, of

2448
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,800
what it boils down to is avoiding the

2449
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,660
idiocy around you.

2450
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:57,740
Right.

2451
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:58,860
That puts you in the bedstead.

2452
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,340
And that's one of the, and once you

2453
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,600
realize that, you know you're not supposed to

2454
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,800
be here because it's a waste of time.

2455
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,560
There are too many governors, too many limits

2456
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:08,840
here.

2457
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,300
And it's, we're limiting ourselves.

2458
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,840
You know, like with like, as humans, we

2459
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,600
relate with other humans, whatever term you wanna

2460
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,900
use as people, men and women.

2461
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,060
And when you find out that the majority

2462
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,320
is not interested because of some degraded state

2463
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,580
that they're in, you know, what does that

2464
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,660
do for those that, right?

2465
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,520
It's kind of like unpleasant.

2466
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,300
So you still have to make it pleasant.

2467
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,980
You know, and as I'm getting older, I'm

2468
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:34,060
in my, going into my seventh decade.

2469
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:34,780
I'm 60 now.

2470
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,840
I've realized, you know, I don't like what's

2471
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,500
called atrocities, injustices, treating people poorly.

2472
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,140
But when I start to consciously say I

2473
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:48,140
can see how that can be justified, I

2474
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,120
stop myself in question and say, now I'm

2475
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,200
feeling a little too angry, right?

2476
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:55,720
You know, like earlier when I said, if

2477
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,540
I had the mothership, I'd vaporize the surface.

2478
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:58,620
Yeah, it should be done.

2479
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,740
But would I be the one to push

2480
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,080
the button?

2481
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:01,820
I'd think twice.

2482
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,660
But yeah, that's a requirement almost to really

2483
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,660
clean this place up.

2484
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,060
But when I start noticing that I hear

2485
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,220
about harm being brought to others, I'm like,

2486
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,560
oh yeah, maybe they deserved it.

2487
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,780
And I start to question myself and say,

2488
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,220
you know, it's not for me to think

2489
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,040
about those things at all, even whether it

2490
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,520
should have happened or whether we should do

2491
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,320
anything about it.

2492
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,940
If you can do something about it without

2493
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:23,900
making too big of an effort, of course,

2494
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,160
hell.

2495
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,420
But I'll tell you this.

2496
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,260
I've told people that I know for many

2497
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,220
years now, when you're driving along the road

2498
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,500
in your vehicle, car, your conveyance, and you

2499
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,420
see an accident happen, don't hang around and

2500
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,720
be a witness or whatever.

2501
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,500
But if you see that you can immediately

2502
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,540
do something to help, go ahead and help.

2503
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,180
But otherwise, just get the F out of

2504
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:46,320
there.

2505
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,480
Just get away from it, you know, right?

2506
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,300
Don't try to play the Good Samaritan stuff.

2507
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,500
Unless you see there's a direct opportunity where

2508
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,600
you should do something, yeah?

2509
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,460
Otherwise, don't hang around and say, oh, maybe,

2510
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,220
maybe, maybe I can help.

2511
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:01,580
No, no, no, no, get the F out

2512
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:01,820
of there.

2513
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,280
None of this maybe stuff.

2514
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,620
So in other words, make your movements in

2515
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:06,420
life more sure.

2516
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,520
Instead of like tracking on programming, oh, there's

2517
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,920
an accident, I should stop and see if

2518
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,520
they need some help.

2519
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:12,600
No, just get the hell out of there.

2520
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,040
Right, that's how I see things going on

2521
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:15,360
in life.

2522
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,600
And I'm with you in the sense that

2523
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,800
you can say anything.

2524
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,280
It sounds maybe fatalistic, but in the end,

2525
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,740
it's not what you say that defines you,

2526
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,520
it's what you do.

2527
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:31,640
And I really echo the feeling that things

2528
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,220
have gotten so bad that they can't get

2529
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:34,780
any worse.

2530
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,300
And like we said with the yin-yang,

2531
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,560
I think it reached one extremity and it

2532
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,600
can only get better.

2533
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,100
And that's why you seem jaded, but you're

2534
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,100
just being a realist.

2535
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,780
Yeah, well, there are many cycles.

2536
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:51,240
Like hard times make good people or strong

2537
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:55,380
people, but then the strong people make good

2538
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,880
times, which makes weak people, which then brings

2539
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,700
hard times again.

2540
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,580
Right, and the cycle keeps going, right?

2541
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,880
And we're in the weak part.

2542
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,000
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

2543
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,080
But the thing is, it's a mix.

2544
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,840
We're in the credits.

2545
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,800
It's not gonna make sense this time.

2546
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,220
There's gonna be a group of very strong

2547
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,080
people that are going to just overrun the

2548
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,680
weak people.

2549
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,400
And there'll be nothing to measure it against

2550
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,120
to say like, oh, this happened before.

2551
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,040
It's gonna be very unique, be done in

2552
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,940
a very different way.

2553
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,940
Yeah, so you're gonna see a lot of

2554
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,640
that going on.

2555
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,880
So as time progresses, things that don't make

2556
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,580
sense and they seem like they happened before

2557
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,520
and we could use historical references, but this

2558
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,280
is a new thing.

2559
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,490
Yeah.

2560
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:44,190
Right, and since, just to maybe close it,

2561
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:47,690
since Christmas, so-called Christmas is around the

2562
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:52,110
corner, I just wanted to maybe go over

2563
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:54,590
the fact that I believe it's a celebration

2564
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:59,530
of Nimrod, who is sometimes called Marduk, who

2565
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:03,410
was the Babylonian ruler that was responsible for

2566
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:06,570
untold amount of massacres and was part of

2567
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:09,770
the fallen angelic, so that it's another inversion,

2568
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,030
right?

2569
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:16,250
Yeah, I'd say, but if you discuss an

2570
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,910
agricultural-based society, which we still are, by

2571
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:21,570
the way, there's a computer, a programmer developer

2572
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:24,530
guy, he's arguing with me that we're not

2573
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,510
agricultural and we don't need mining.

2574
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:28,390
And I said, what's that on your blue

2575
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,670
jeans?

2576
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:30,390
It's a metal button, well, you need mining

2577
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,970
for that.

2578
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,430
And are you having lunch today?

2579
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:33,150
What are you eating?

2580
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:34,450
That's agricultural, right?

2581
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:35,290
You can't escape it.

2582
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:40,410
So agricultural, those that master agriculture, master the

2583
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:43,010
seasons and the times, and it would be

2584
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,150
the dark, you know how you have spring

2585
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,150
celebrations when the days are expanding and the

2586
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,390
weather is pleasant?

2587
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,530
You have the midwinter dark times of days.

2588
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,070
So they decided to mark those things with

2589
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:55,930
a feast or celebration or gathering, just like

2590
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:57,730
we have personal gatherings in our lives, and

2591
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,290
anniversaries, whatever, birthdays, people, things that people do.

2592
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,250
On a social level, a national level, you

2593
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,550
have gatherings and things based on seasonal events.

2594
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,110
And one of the things was, you know,

2595
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,050
the Saturnalia, how many things in Christmas?

2596
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,150
The thing that gets me about Christmas, though,

2597
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,670
is this, there's some popular documentaries about Christmas

2598
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,490
and they start out by saying, well, we

2599
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,970
know that Jesus was not born at this

2600
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:22,910
time, it's actually pagan, but, always, right?

2601
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,970
And well, no one knows when he was

2602
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:27,250
born, but if you go to the scripture,

2603
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,830
it gives you an astronomical alignment which transcends

2604
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,050
any calendrical system.

2605
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,270
And if you look at that astronomical alignment

2606
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:37,190
when he was born, it's in the Book

2607
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:41,250
of Revelation, it was around 3 BC on

2608
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,270
the month of September on the day of

2609
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:45,070
11, about 6.20 PM.

2610
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,770
We get it down to the half hour

2611
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:50,330
because there's more than five or six astronomical

2612
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:50,830
bodies.

2613
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,450
You know, the more astronomical bodies you have

2614
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,890
in the alignment, the more discerning you could

2615
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:55,630
be on the time.

2616
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,450
So September 11th, 3 BC, that's why they

2617
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:01,170
had that big birthday party for him in

2618
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,450
New York 20 some odd years ago, right?

2619
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,690
So, anyway.

2620
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:12,070
Yeah, it seems that the most obvious things

2621
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:14,470
are the ones that escape us the most

2622
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,050
and the ones that we need to work

2623
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,470
on the most.

2624
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:20,690
Well, everything is obvious to who, right?

2625
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:21,850
Right.

2626
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:24,450
You know, if we have a really big

2627
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:26,630
secret, I suggest we publish it and put

2628
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,710
it in the public library.

2629
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,730
No one will ever find it.

2630
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,830
Right.

2631
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,570
But yeah, that's about all I prepared for

2632
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,430
today, so.

2633
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,270
Well, that's fine.

2634
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,010
Good, I came unprepared as usual.

2635
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:40,710
Oh, it's okay.

2636
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:42,230
Yeah, no, we're just happy to have you.

2637
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,270
I mean, I could go on forever.

2638
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,730
I have tons of stuff, but I mean,

2639
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,990
Greg, I just wanna be conscious of your

2640
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:49,910
time, but I appreciate you being here with

2641
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:50,150
us.

2642
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,370
Greg, if you'd like to conclude or take

2643
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,430
reins while we both shut the fuck up,

2644
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,690
you know?

2645
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:55,930
No, no, it's fine.

2646
01:32:55,930 --> 01:33:00,070
I have a shitty paywall with Ocelli.

2647
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,650
It's called Rated Y.

2648
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:05,250
You could, I don't even really promote it

2649
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,210
and whatever, like I said, it's behind a

2650
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:07,970
shitty paywall.

2651
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,870
If you contact Ocelli at ocelli.com, if

2652
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,330
you're interested in joining, that's fine.

2653
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:13,230
It's called Rated Y.

2654
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,730
And because it's behind a paywall, it's not

2655
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:18,350
public, and I can discuss things on a

2656
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,030
more deep level and things that shouldn't be

2657
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:20,430
discussed.

2658
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:21,510
Let's say, you know, if you do a

2659
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,550
public website, you're subject to whatever you wanna

2660
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:25,790
call it, you know, censorship.

2661
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:29,670
So I feel pretty free discussing things there.

2662
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:31,050
It's ongoing.

2663
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,370
We do about two, I don't do shows.

2664
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:34,470
They're called sonic events.

2665
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,450
Because, you know, when I hear the word

2666
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,210
show, I'm looking for where's the donkey, where's

2667
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:38,910
the girl, you know?

2668
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:43,050
But anyway, yeah, so there's sonic events.

2669
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:45,450
And right now we're doing more of the

2670
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,270
private, I'm gonna be discussing more on the

2671
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:50,570
human body and discussing more of the realm

2672
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:52,730
here, how to operate in it and prosper,

2673
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:56,150
be completely prosperous in it.

2674
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:01,330
And that just doesn't mean, financial also, and

2675
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,170
prosper, you know?

2676
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,670
And we discuss things like there's no such

2677
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,270
thing as health.

2678
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:06,010
That's a stupid term, you know?

2679
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:06,990
It's fitness.

2680
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:08,670
What level of fitness do you wanna attain?

2681
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,270
And, you know, many of the emo work,

2682
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:11,250
you know, all this other stuff.

2683
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,650
Yeah, I guess I'm shamelessly promoting it, but

2684
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,330
I'm not, you know, don't contact me to

2685
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:15,490
join.

2686
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,030
Just go to ocelli.com, message him or

2687
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,310
whatever.

2688
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,870
He'll show you the way to get there,

2689
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:20,390
you know?

2690
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:23,570
Because it's private, you get into much deeper

2691
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:25,090
stuff that you hadn't previously.

2692
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,350
Yeah, that's how it should be, right?

2693
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,570
I think, Zan, you know about that.

2694
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:33,810
You start going and doing public whatever YouTubes

2695
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:36,430
or whatever long enough and you're gonna, right?

2696
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,090
You're gonna have- That's the first step.

2697
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:39,590
That's the baby step to try and get

2698
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:40,130
you to stop.

2699
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,910
Because if I was really onto something, you

2700
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,130
know, I wouldn't even be here breathing.

2701
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,810
But yes, yes, yeah.

2702
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:46,430
Yeah, yeah.

2703
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,690
So anyway, I appreciate you guys.

2704
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,350
I like you both very much in terms

2705
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,530
of doing this kind of stuff.

2706
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:54,430
I think your audiences, I say your audiences,

2707
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:58,330
or the audience appreciates us three getting, having

2708
01:34:58,330 --> 01:34:59,850
a chat during the Sonic event.

2709
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,890
So it's all good all around.

2710
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:02,950
Yeah, great.

2711
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,470
Thanks for having me.

2712
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,770
Yeah, it's really nice because I just don't

2713
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,250
get this in life or the way I

2714
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:07,990
can deduce things.

2715
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:10,430
And I don't know, it's like, it's like

2716
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:11,890
I wish my dad had this knowledge or

2717
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:13,690
whatever, but I don't mean to sit here

2718
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:14,870
and fawn over you or gush.

2719
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,750
I'm just saying, you know, I just, I

2720
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,070
don't know, man.

2721
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,350
It's like you're the older brother I never

2722
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,030
had or whatever, but it's just, it's very

2723
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:22,270
nice to give us the time of day.

2724
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,730
And thank you so much for letting us

2725
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:26,770
record this session and sorry to hold y

2726
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:26,990
'all up.

2727
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,610
I just like to always express my thanks.

2728
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:30,030
I do not take this for granted, but

2729
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,110
anyway, thank you so much.

2730
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:31,910
Oh, I know you don't.

2731
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:32,410
Yeah, thank you.

2732
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:33,190
Thank you both again.

2733
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:33,930
Take care.

2734
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,570
Bye.
