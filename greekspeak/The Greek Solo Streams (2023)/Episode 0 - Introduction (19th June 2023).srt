00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,220
Greetings and welcome to the Greek Speak Patreon

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,700
recordings.

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
This is a new format that's debuting in

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,360
the wake of some podcast appearances that the

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,720
Greek and I have done in recent months

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,220
on platforms like Hiresite Chats and Mike Adams

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,860
Health Ranger.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,320
The reception to those streams were quite favorable

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,680
and I've received quite a few emails asking

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,980
when we would resume the Godspeak podcast, which

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,320
was discontinued at episode 8.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,280
I honestly can't say, because I just haven't

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,660
had the time to structure the last few

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,820
episodes of that series, so I figured that

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,580
setting up a Patreon would be the next

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,480
best thing, and so here we are.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,220
Patreon will serve as an archive for past

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,720
Greek appearances on streams that are no longer

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,580
available online.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,280
I won't be able to include the recordings

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,440
that are other people's intellectual property, like the

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,780
Ocelli Show or the Freeman Fly podcast, but

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,560
for the material that was on American Freedom

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,300
Radio, which is a site that no longer

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,400
exists, it's probably fair game to make those

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,760
available.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
So, to give a brief breakdown on what

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,560
you'll find on Patreon, there are six tiers,

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,760
starting at $2 a month and going up

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,920
to $25 a month.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,380
Tier 1 is just the Greek Speak and

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,480
Godspeak podcasts, which can be supported for a

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,440
low cost if people feel like doing that.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,780
Otherwise, it's already free to hear on Spotify,

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,560
iTunes, Google Podcasts, SoundCloud, and wherever else.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
Then we have the ascending tiers of American

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,940
Freedom Radio archives, starting with the first season

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,540
of Ocelli and the Greek in 2015, which

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,840
costs $5, followed by season 2 at $10,

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,680
the Greek and Seth Michael at $15, and

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,480
the Greeks Uncommon Radio is at $20.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,880
The final tier is reserved for the Greeks

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,960
present-day solo streams, that'll mostly be ran

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,820
by the Greek on his own, with me

45
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,600
handling the uploads and making the occasional guest

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,840
appearance here or there, and of course each

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
higher tier gives access to all the tiers

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,320
below.

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,120
That's pretty much a breakdown of the Patreon.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,060
I could have added more tiers because there's

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,580
hundreds of hours of recordings between the Greek

52
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,000
and other parties, but honestly I don't have

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
the time to sift through them.

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,380
The files are generally between 3 to 10

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,660
hours and it would take me weeks to

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,020
go through it all, so if I see

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,980
the support for the Patreon being enough to

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,260
where I can take time away from my

59
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,360
regular occupation, then I might sort through those

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,680
files.

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,640
So we'll see what happens.

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,460
Lastly, I've made it a point to edit

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,020
out the overly long intro music and the

64
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,560
ads that appear midway through the American Freedom

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,380
Radio episodes.

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
You will occasionally hear some music in the

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,300
middle of season 1, but it's been taken

68
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,820
out of most other places.

69
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,540
So yeah, that completes the Patreon introduction and

70
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,020
now I'll be talking to the Greek about

71
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,020
this new Sonic event of his, so I

72
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,520
hope you enjoy the rest of the stream

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,760
and thanks again for listening.

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,300
Hello there Greek, how are you faring?

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,740
Yes, hello.

76
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,620
Doing well.

77
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,560
Maybe we could just get right into it.

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,800
The current event is found at ocelli.com.

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,260
It's Ocelli and the Greek, rated Y, and

80
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,140
the theme is the Unculting of Humanity, and

81
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,000
that's the current one.

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,440
Constantly stating with Ocelli that, well, we're bringing

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,460
up episodes, it's episodic and each episode sort

84
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,000
of is a loose conversation with some subject

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
matter and context, and we're bringing up the

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,900
idea of getting deep into these subjects on

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,920
Solos, where I would just have a more

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,140
penetrating insight and instruction on various things, whether

89
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,079
it's health, hygiene, legal, lawful, money, weather work,

90
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,340
you know, magnetism, electricity, all these various things.

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,900
A deep penetrating insight and those would be

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,840
intended to keep them under an hour, and

93
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,100
they're intended to be at fast pace, and

94
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,780
for whoever is listening to use the pause

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,040
replay button to go back and reference them.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,500
So that would be the main purpose of

97
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,980
the latest, most latest, meaning the latest is

98
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,300
rated Y, Ocelli and the Greek, found at

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,920
ocelli.com, but the latest latest is the

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,980
Greek Solo Sonics.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,140
So, there you go.

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,740
Okay, and what has prompted you to want

103
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,520
to return to that?

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,460
Was there some kind of subject matter that

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,780
you felt is more suitable for Solo coverage

106
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,880
than with a co-host?

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,920
All of it.

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,180
All of it.

109
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:07,640
Yep.

110
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,480
There's something about getting into a, how would

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,860
you say, it's a state where you just,

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,820
without being pedantic, let go and put out

113
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,540
everything you can on the subject, right?

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,540
It's kind of like I tell people, if

115
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,800
you want to know what I'm thinking, listen

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,460
to what I'm saying, right?

117
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,260
I have no inner monologue, which is a

118
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,640
good thing.

119
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,300
I get into what the inner monologue really

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,080
is and various aspects.

121
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,980
When I say what really is, it's in

122
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,000
terms of acute observation and testing.

123
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,460
None of us know anything about everything, but

124
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,280
some of us know a lot of things

125
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,100
about certain things, right?

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,780
I don't know if that makes any sense.

127
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,560
So, most of the things that I've ever

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,060
discussed ever is about things that anyone can

129
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,480
access.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,580
It doesn't really make sense to do what

131
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,620
the establishment does is, oh, you can't do

132
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,400
this because you're not whatever professional and you

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
don't have the expensive equipment required and all

134
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,600
that exclusivity.

135
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
What I try to do is bring the

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,260
human inclusive or the mankind, man, woman inclusive,

137
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,980
where pretty much everything you need is within

138
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,760
arm's reach and slightly beyond that.

139
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,540
I suggest that just a little bit of

140
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,460
hints in what direction to go within that

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,520
five feet realm is all most people need

142
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,460
to get pretty much anything and everything they

143
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,040
ever wanted done, done.

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Since you're covering these things that are accessible

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,020
to everyone, where does the bifurcation go between

146
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,280
say the advanced stuff and the novice stuff

147
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,440
and will you ever cross over into the

148
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
prior at any point?

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,060
Meaning advanced?

150
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,980
It's all going to be advanced, but advanced

151
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,580
just means that, means further down the line.

152
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,200
Whenever you start anything, whether it's in writing

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,220
or in Sonics audio, it's good to give

154
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,700
a little bit of a preface and the

155
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,600
preface will pretty much let you know where

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,900
the Sonic is going to be going.

157
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,840
It, all of it will be advanced at

158
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,340
this point.

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,620
It's kind of like to the point where,

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
you know, if you go out in public,

161
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,980
let's say, for example, I'm out in public

162
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,680
and I'm speaking to people on any matter

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,560
and people ask a question, well, how about

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,800
this?

165
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,400
Or how about that?

166
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm like, well, if you're asking that you

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,520
haven't done your homework, right?

168
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,900
That's not a sarcastic remark.

169
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,860
So when the Sonics are going to be

170
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,700
topical, let's say if it's on electricity or

171
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,420
magnetism, you're going to have to have a

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,600
basic rudimentary, even from the stock academic bullshit

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,360
is good enough.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,820
And I could preface all that and then

175
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,260
get into more advanced workings on, on the

176
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,660
subject and it won't take very long.

177
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,220
And just to be humble about it, these

178
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,280
Sonic, these solo Sonics will be like getting

179
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
a four year education in one hour.

180
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,980
What the establishment does actually better because you

181
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,240
actually don't get much, you know, in other

182
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,000
words, what the establishment teaches in academia, academia

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,220
is about 90, 90 to 98% fiction,

184
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,260
right?

185
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,220
But it's functional fiction, right?

186
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,300
Functional meaning that if you go into a

187
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,880
society that is structured around that, you will

188
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,120
have the appearance, you know, of being real,

189
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,020
just like when children go to Disneyland and

190
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,120
they point to Mickey Mouse.

191
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,440
Yeah, that's Mickey, someone in a Mickey Mouse

192
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,200
costume, right?

193
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,900
But if you say Mickey Mouse, it's fair

194
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,280
enough.

195
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,100
And if you go even further, it's a

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,940
fictional character, but if there's someone in there

197
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,039
playing it, so there's, those are like the

198
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,860
different ways to look at the things that

199
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm going to be speaking on.

200
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
And with you starting this in the near

201
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,720
future, what is the timeline for how long

202
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,640
you think this will continue?

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,400
It'll be perpetual.

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,160
Okay.

205
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,720
Has there been any impetus for you to

206
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,220
start these from your own personal experiences in

207
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,600
the recent past or the unfolding of circumstances

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,220
in the environment or world events?

209
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,720
Has that inclined you to want to speak

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:03,960
more?

211
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,240
Well, they have a term for livestock.

212
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,020
It's called human resources, right?

213
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,700
Because humans have been reduced to like a

214
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
livestock status.

215
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,240
They may, those terms are not used, but

216
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,840
if you look at everything, you know, look

217
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
at what, not what someone says, but how,

218
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,500
what they do.

219
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,060
So humans have been reduced to livestock pretty

220
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,840
much under the title of human resources.

221
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,580
And I'm going to harken back to that

222
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,020
and say that I'm looking for a human

223
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,680
resource in terms of not as livestock, but

224
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,700
someone to help me further along what I've

225
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,740
been delving in what in any field, someone

226
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,760
that would be more compatible than just a

227
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,400
spectator or someone just listening.

228
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,660
And I think that sometimes you just have

229
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,320
to egg people on with just a little

230
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,240
more information, a little more insight to get

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,580
them to flip over and be more of

232
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,320
a workman or more of a participant than

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,940
just a listener.

234
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
And that's the real impetus.

235
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,920
I think personally, you've heard me say, I'm

236
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,900
looking for people like me, not because I'm

237
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,420
great or good or anything at all.

238
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,320
As a matter of fact, when someone says,

239
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,780
Greek, you don't have much of a legacy.

240
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,460
I said, legacy?

241
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,460
When I die, I want to be thrown

242
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,440
in a garbage dump.

243
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,220
You know, not, I don't even want a

244
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
funeral or any good words, because being here

245
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,660
isn't really what people say it is.

246
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,560
So how to have the best time while

247
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,980
you're here and make the most of what

248
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,860
you've got is really what I'd like to

249
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,480
get into and find people that are along

250
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,400
those lines as well.

251
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,720
So it's really a headhunting scheme.

252
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,580
But the notion of going headhunting would imply

253
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,560
that there are worthy candidates out there.

254
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you have, have you seen anything in

255
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,100
previous audience response to cause you to suspect

256
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,740
that solo streams and more pointed conversations would

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,220
generate a more engaged audience or advanced audience?

258
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,640
Not really.

259
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,640
But I think an act of futility is

260
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,500
still worth trying.

261
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm not saying I'm not being sarcastic.

262
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm just saying it's I don't think it's

263
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,180
an act of futility is something that might

264
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,720
seem futile is truly futile.

265
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,480
Anyway, I think it's worth trying.

266
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
We can certainly hope for the best.

267
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,740
I mean, I think that it could be

268
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,020
that there are people that have been listening

269
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,460
that have been silent this whole time and

270
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,540
maybe solo streams would prompt them to come

271
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:08,860
forward.

272
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,320
Yeah, I think so.

273
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
There's, there's, you know, we live in a

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,500
fictitious setup.

275
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,700
In other words, the mental, the mental construct,

276
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,540
what people think about how things are put

277
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,520
out from that, that's pointing towards the mental

278
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,180
construct.

279
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,640
Not like for like a building, when you

280
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,380
approach a building and there's a revolving door,

281
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,920
you have to go through that door or

282
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,340
a sliding door or swinging door, you have

283
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,700
to negotiate that physical aspect of the edifice.

284
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm talking about more of the mental aspect,

285
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,740
negotiating the mental aspect, right?

286
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,940
So in terms of finding people that are

287
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,460
able to do that, yeah, that's very, very

288
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,860
difficult.

289
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,700
And I have not been successful to this

290
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:48,960
point.

291
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,600
In other words, looking for peers, a daunting

292
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
task, but surely not insurmountable.

293
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,620
And that's what this is.

294
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,360
These are, this is actually the secret reason

295
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,440
why, and if you want to know what

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,220
I'm thinking, why doing the Sonics, I'm telling

297
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,680
you why.

298
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm just looking for peers.

299
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,220
I have a joke, by the way, I've

300
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,960
used this before.

301
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,860
In terms of, this is in terms of

302
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,720
mainstream and peer review.

303
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
That's the joke.

304
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,180
That's the punchline.

305
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,240
That's all of it.

306
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,520
You've heard of that term, right?

307
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
Or a jury of your peers is another

308
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,580
joke.

309
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,560
That's the punchline also and the joke.

310
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,680
So you see what I mean?

311
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,320
It gets very interesting how these terms are

312
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,660
being used and not being considered.

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,260
One was, I mean, even if we put

314
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,640
aside the most recent Greek speak activity, when

315
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,000
was the last time that you would say

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,740
that you'd come across a peer of yours

317
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,580
in some industry?

318
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,160
I'd say about 15 years ago, 25 years,

319
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,640
my senior.

320
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,020
So most of the people that I have

321
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,900
come across have passed away, but I believe

322
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,400
time works forward and backwards.

323
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,700
So I believe there's some that are much

324
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,600
younger as well that around at this point,

325
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,780
basically to someone who's enthralled about really being

326
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,480
here, not asking too much about why we're

327
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,780
here, but what we're going to do that

328
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,540
we are here.

329
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,360
And what can we do with what we've

330
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,780
been given?

331
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,580
Like in short, I've said before, the establishment

332
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,020
that goes back thousands of years.

333
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,800
And when I say that any criticism on

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
the current establishment, for example, I'll give you

335
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,780
a quote, everything they teach in the schools

336
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,460
are lies.

337
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,060
Well, guess when that was said and quoted,

338
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,940
that was Socrates 25 or 2300 years ago.

339
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:26,680
Okay.

340
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,420
So when I say the establishment, it goes

341
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,520
back that far, what they've done is a

342
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,460
lot of grunt work, like digging ditches and

343
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,140
the heavy lifting.

344
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,820
So when you go through it, and you

345
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,980
find out how you're told things are work,

346
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,000
and it's incongruous to what they show, you

347
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,300
know, in terms of the work they've done,

348
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,460
there's a fine line and putting it together

349
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,540
and excelling in any subject.

350
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,200
That does cast somewhat of a shadow for

351
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,220
what people think education is doing for them

352
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,960
in the current day.

353
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,620
Well, well, Gustav Le Bon, he wrote a

354
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,420
book called The Crowd.

355
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,820
And just to simplify, basically, it's a good

356
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,080
read.

357
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,800
A lot of it is pre psychology or

358
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,800
psychology, pre psychology, which was another scam, by

359
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,700
the way, trying to tell people what the

360
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,800
spirit and the soul and the mind are,

361
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,320
you know, redefining it, because pretty much if

362
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,780
you've heard any Greek speak, everything that could

363
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,240
have been known was known by the late

364
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,120
19th century, the 1890s.

365
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,020
And if you're not aware of that, go

366
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,560
start looking back and you'll see there was

367
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,600
a lot of futurism around that time that

368
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,140
showed that we should have been in flying

369
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,600
cars by the 1960s or 70s.

370
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,260
So we're being, you know, kind of shown

371
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,580
things that we where we could have been,

372
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,080
it's not about where we could have been,

373
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,580
because going back to Gustav Le Bon, The

374
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,420
Crowd, and just to oversimplify the book, no

375
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,760
pun intended, is that when you're going to

376
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,420
present a notion, a concept, or an ideology

377
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,840
to the public at large, or large groups

378
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,660
of people, you have to simplify it.

379
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,640
But what happens is it becomes so simplified

380
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,320
that it no longer represents its original meaning.

381
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,760
Right?

382
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,800
So we end up right where we were

383
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,400
with Socrates' quote from 2300 years ago.

384
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,960
So I think there's a fine line where

385
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,120
people are attracted to doing this kind of

386
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,460
stuff online, and people are attracted to what

387
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,480
the Greek has to say.

388
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,360
And then there's another point where once I

389
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,820
get into doing the Solosonics, and I pretty

390
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,780
much share everything I found out about something,

391
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,440
not what I know, but what I found

392
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,720
out about it, because what you know can

393
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,540
change and what you believe definitely can change,

394
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,720
because that's why it's a belief, I think

395
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,980
will be more inspirational and more to the

396
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,000
point for some.

397
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,660
No, that's encouraging to hear.

398
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,060
I guess my last question is just this

399
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,840
sort of general statement that you've made on

400
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,560
the American Freedom Radio streams, and probably elsewhere

401
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,100
that you only share 10% of what

402
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,520
you know.

403
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,620
And now with it being almost a decade

404
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,360
later, what is that at now?

405
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,680
And what can we expect on the solo

406
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,020
streams?

407
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,020
I'd say a lot more, because there's only

408
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,380
so much you can do, but with time

409
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,820
allotted, when you're trying to nurture a conversation,

410
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,440
let's say.

411
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,700
I'd say all of it if it can

412
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,580
be, right?

413
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,600
Because believe it or not, we're beings that

414
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,960
rely on feelings and emotions, which are more

415
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
in the ethereal realm.

416
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,420
It has a language of its own, and

417
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,680
the language of that feeling and emotion is

418
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,640
silent, which I have been getting into much

419
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,060
with the inner monologue that people recognize as

420
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,360
themselves, because they actually hear themselves in their

421
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,820
own voice.

422
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,620
And I've gone into how that's not really

423
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,400
you, and who you really are is a

424
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,180
very sober, full of sobriety, and very silent

425
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,260
mechanism that communicates into the inner self.

426
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,560
So, how much of that can be communicated

427
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,700
on a sonic, we'll see.

428
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,220
But I always say, you only share 10

429
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,600
% in public, and you hold, reserve the

430
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:01,920
rest.

431
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
So, lately I've been thinking, I'm in my

432
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,780
sixth decade now in life here on this

433
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,859
planet, surface-dwelling earth inhabitant.

434
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,880
And I think the gap is getting bigger

435
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,940
between those who know what they think they

436
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,420
know, and those who say what they think

437
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,839
they know, and those that know, and those

438
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,460
that don't know.

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,500
So, I'd like to just offer a very

440
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,140
simple way, by projecting what I found out

441
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,700
about it in a perspective known as Greek

442
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,600
-speak, and hopefully those that are interested will

443
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,620
be even more interested.

444
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,760
Yes, I agree.

445
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,820
I'm sure that they will be.

446
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,680
There's been a lot of people clamoring for

447
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,240
additional streams, so it'll most likely be appreciated.

448
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,300
Well, I think we've done a good job

449
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,440
of elaborating on the scope of the coming

450
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,800
sonics, and what people can expect.

451
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,360
So, we may as well conclude this introductory

452
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,400
episode, unless there's anything more you want to

453
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,600
add?

454
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,240
Oh, a lot.

455
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,580
Well, what we're going to be adding are

456
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,540
the solo sonics, and I guess hope to

457
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,840
see whoever comes over there.

458
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,340
Yes, it should be a good experience.

459
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,060
Like I said, I'll be jumping in from

460
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,620
time to time to help with stuff, but

461
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,260
you'll be able to find all of these

462
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,680
streams on the Patreon website.

463
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,800
We'll be sending out newsletters to anybody that's

464
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,660
subscribed to Greekspeak.com or Godspeak.com, so

465
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,120
if you haven't done that, make sure to

466
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,520
do that.

467
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,140
And, yeah, we hope that you enjoy the

468
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,760
coming sonics.
