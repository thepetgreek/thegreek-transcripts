1
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,130
I'm going to call this food part one.

2
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,870
So why is it such a big deal?

3
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,950
Everybody's wondering what are we going to eat,

4
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,250
what have we eaten, what should we eat?

5
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,190
Why does it take up so much of

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,770
our energy?

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,590
I think already we've objectified that we're living

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,670
in this body, it's almost like a container.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,130
As a matter of fact, that's how I

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,390
call it, the container, the meat suit, you

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,590
go on and on the body.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,190
But let's define it, what are we looking

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,970
at, you know?

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,950
Look at the container, look at your, those

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,850
in the military, those that are shooters know

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,350
what I'm talking about when I say center

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,310
mass, right, your center mass without the limbs.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,190
If you look at the human anatomy, without

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,870
even going to the adult side of the

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,390
human anatomy, let's go look at the early

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,050
stages of human anatomy, when you have fetal

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,610
development.

23
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,250
You can, you can on your own pull

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,450
up images and you'll see they got all

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,170
kinds of stages of fetal anatomy to a

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,490
point where you go from cells to something

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,390
that looks like what they might call a

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,810
fetus, a zygote, and you'll see how the

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,610
famous embryonic position that's always been described.

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,650
Well, take a look at early stages.

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,070
Early stages, what you'll see is that center

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,670
mass developing and guess what that is?

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,290
That's your center mass, that's your main organs

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,810
and mainly the intestines.

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,310
Not formed yet, they're mostly outside of the

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,990
body, but you know what's interesting about that

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,230
is notice how the head is folded over

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,450
the abdominal area, right, and when you take

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,590
a look at that, you'll see how the

40
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,790
geometric patterns that form the intestines also form

41
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,470
the brain.

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,009
Yep, there's a lot of ancient Asian wisdom

43
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,630
on that.

44
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,550
Not used so much now because everything's gotten

45
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,990
so analytical, but part of just rudimentary diagnosis

46
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,970
of people was the face reading and you

47
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,910
won't see the intestines on the face because

48
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,130
I would suggest, as they did for thousands

49
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,970
of years, it correlates to the brain and

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,030
you know, once you're made aware of that,

51
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,110
you'll say, oh man, yes it does, it's

52
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,170
just the brain is much tighter, much tighter

53
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,650
wound.

54
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,110
Why?

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,150
Because it's up higher and it has to

56
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,990
be tighter wound.

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,730
You don't want to slosh, you have it

58
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,430
sloshing around.

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,630
That's from a very oversimplified point of view,

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,990
but just real quick on face reading because

61
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,310
it does tie in with food.

62
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,270
If you then go by and correlate the

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,130
face development or the head development, let's say,

64
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,750
front of the head being the face over

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,030
the center abdomen of the body, you'll see

66
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,090
that the lungs correlate to the cheeks.

67
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,750
The nose is the heart and so on

68
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,370
and so forth.

69
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,910
And then as we develop, one of the

70
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,110
last things to develop are the sexual organs.

71
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,110
In the old schools of Asian facial diagnosis,

72
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,870
I would say the chin area between the

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,550
chin and the lower lip is the sexual

74
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,050
organs.

75
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,050
But the correlate on the face for the

76
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,410
intestines would be the lower lip is the

77
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,250
lower intestine and the upper lip is the

78
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,850
upper intestine and the bladder is pretty much

79
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,870
the temples around the nose, between the nose

80
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,830
and the upper lip.

81
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,530
There's face reading, there's several, I wouldn't say

82
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,170
corresponding, I haven't looked online that are in

83
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,470
agreement too much, but I just gave you

84
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,070
the basic aspect is the brain or your

85
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,590
intestines, small and large, and lungs are cheeks,

86
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,690
nose is heart.

87
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,710
It's interesting, liver line, liver between the eyes,

88
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,910
between the brows, it's interesting how when caricatures

89
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,070
are drawn when they're angry, there's a contraction

90
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,149
of the brows with a pronounced line between

91
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,070
the vertical line between the brows, I call

92
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,990
that the liver line.

93
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,930
So there is a correspondence for the entire

94
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,190
body and it's also visually checked using face

95
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,070
diagnosis, but I want to get back to

96
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,670
food because all this ties in on how

97
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,410
we spend the food, clothing, shelter meme that

98
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,350
I've been putting out.

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,830
Why is food first?

100
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,510
Well, if you look at the developmental stages,

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,770
we primarily developed to eat food.

102
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,170
If you go ahead and look it up,

103
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,910
41 days and look, I have a, just

104
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,170
a rudimentary image in front of me, you

105
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,970
know, up until the 50 days or so,

106
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,690
you'll see that the predominant development is in

107
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,050
the abdomen and wow, one has never really

108
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,790
stopped and thought that we are just eating

109
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,350
machines.

110
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,550
Well, not as much as cows, maybe some

111
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,350
are, but yeah, it's a, we're, no matter

112
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,470
how contemplative we are or we think we

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,970
are, let's say based on higher things, we

114
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,190
are super attached to this environment to actually

115
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,550
eat.

116
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,190
Now look at the antithesis.

117
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,190
What if we didn't have to eat?

118
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,430
Let's say we're a breatharian.

119
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,330
We wouldn't need all that center mass, all

120
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,870
the intestines wouldn't need to be there.

121
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,590
We would look radically different.

122
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,650
Talking about narrow waistlines, it would be no

123
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,390
waistline and we would be extremely slender and

124
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,770
vertical, kind of like a lot of the

125
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,790
way the Spielberg movies drew some of the

126
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,790
ETs by the way.

127
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,330
Well, so I just wanted to show the

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,250
correlation on how the human development, just the

129
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,410
rudimentary, most fundamental formative development is based around

130
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,950
the center abdomen, which is so large because

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,190
it houses all of the processing mechanisms, intestines

132
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,290
and all the other corresponding organs to perform

133
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,750
the function of digestion and of course induction,

134
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,610
what we call nutrition and rebuilding of the

135
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,450
body and energizing the body and so on.

136
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,050
What's interesting about this is when we go

137
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,110
over and look at the formation of other

138
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,910
things, let's just leave the animals out of

139
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,570
it for a second.

140
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,150
The formation of vegetables, for example, when you

141
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,610
look at the formation of vegetables you'll see

142
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,790
very similar organic shapes that you'll see in

143
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,830
development of all organic creatures, all natural creatures

144
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,470
have a similar archetype and the archetype is

145
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,670
reinforced or enhanced based on if you're an

146
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,230
animal or vegetable or human, and when I

147
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,530
say animal, four-legged horizontal spine.

148
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,830
So what's interesting about this is there's also

149
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,010
a meme talking about actually an ancient diagnosis

150
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,730
where the look of the vegetable corresponds to

151
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,390
the body in terms of specific organs for

152
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,070
specific vegetables or vice versa, specific vegetables for

153
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,530
specific organs of the body.

154
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,390
Now what's interesting about that is one of

155
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,010
the simplest ones is carrots for eyesight.

156
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,690
What's interesting, you look at a development of

157
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,890
a carrot, it doesn't look like it corresponds

158
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,430
to the eye at all, but if you

159
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,890
lay the carrot horizontally and just cut it

160
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,610
in the middle and then look at the

161
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,710
profile of the carrot or the section, you'll

162
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,030
see that it has concentric rings and circles,

163
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,250
yes, and it would look very close to

164
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,430
an eye.

165
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,870
So what's interesting is the clinical aspect is

166
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,330
trying to seek out what's in carrots that

167
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,490
makes the old, let's say, meme about carrots

168
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,390
being good for eyesight, and this corresponds, let's

169
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,970
say, for cabbage for the brain, not only

170
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,510
by looking at a head of cabbage, but

171
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,770
a cross-section of it, right?

172
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,170
Now I'm always going to make lascivious comments,

173
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,850
so you could figure out what cucumbers and

174
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,290
other things are for, but anyway.

175
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,850
By the way, it's the end of the

176
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,350
fourth month here, it's the end of June,

177
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,549
and I would suggest just a little hint

178
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:34,830
here.

179
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,150
Cucumbers are very cooling, by the way.

180
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,010
What's interesting, we'll get more into the types

181
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,090
of foods and things, just very quick things

182
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,450
that are easy to remember that you can

183
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,670
use and apply to change your condition, but

184
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,270
if you're having a hard time in the

185
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,610
summer, and it is, let's say, warm, or

186
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,250
you feel like you're uncomfortably warm, cucumbers are

187
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,170
a wonderful food to have, which I suggest

188
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,590
are in the melon family.

189
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,090
If you walk into a room or a

190
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,610
kitchen where a cucumber has been sliced, and

191
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,970
then go to another room where cantaloupe and

192
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,010
other melons, stone fruit, I think they call

193
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,670
it in the upside down world, known as

194
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,330
Australian New Zealand, cantaloupe and things like that,

195
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,630
you'll have a similar smell, a very, very

196
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,290
similar melon-type smell.

197
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,150
So I just wanted to bring up the

198
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,070
points on how we always consider food, food,

199
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,970
food, and I even say food, clothing, shelter,

200
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,650
food being priority, food and water, in a

201
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,010
sense, when I say food intake, food and

202
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,930
liquid, let's say, because you can actually live

203
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,310
without actually drinking water, and we'll get more

204
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,810
into that.

205
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,130
I wouldn't suggest it, but it's possible.

206
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,670
I would suggest, though, that having a more

207
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,010
broader opinion, in other words, approaching the concept

208
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,170
of food, almost like the concept of sex,

209
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,950
which I recently talked about on Rated Y,

210
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,550
it's for procreation and sexes, and the rest

211
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,230
of it is based on what culture you're

212
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,070
raised in.

213
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,170
For example, in some cultures, having sex three

214
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,050
times a week is under-sexed and you're

215
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,710
made fun of.

216
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,710
Other places, having sex just to have children

217
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,870
is totally adequate.

218
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,650
So when I say places, it's a cultural

219
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,310
geographic.

220
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,930
Now what's interesting is we have sort of

221
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,290
this similar thing with the food thing going

222
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,630
on.

223
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,910
What culture are you in?

224
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,630
Let's just say, what have you downloaded?

225
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,590
What rules of the culture that you were

226
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,070
raised in or decided to adapt to or

227
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,030
have allegiance to have you taken on as

228
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,810
your modality?

229
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,030
What I mean by that is it's just

230
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,170
like the sex comparison.

231
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,430
Do you really need to eat the way

232
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,970
you're eating?

233
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,710
I think going back to basics, I felt

234
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,290
like it was very important to bring up

235
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,010
the human development aspect on how that center

236
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,970
section develops.

237
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,670
And we would be examined and say, this

238
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,450
is a being that's being developed to consume

239
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:11,910
things.

240
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,470
Basically, it needs a lot of input, intake,

241
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,090
I should say.

242
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,710
And it's very important, I've mentioned before also,

243
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,030
if you look at things consumable such as

244
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,170
pharmaceuticals, you're always given side effects.

245
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,170
And they're very elaborate about what they are

246
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,850
and the various organs, but they never give

247
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,310
the side effects on the brain, which would

248
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,370
be your mental condition.

249
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,330
And anyone knows that if you have some

250
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,150
chocolate or wine or whatever, if you're hungry,

251
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,290
you can't think straight, right?

252
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,530
You shouldn't go shopping when you're hungry, right?

253
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,410
Kind of thing, food shopping that is.

254
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,930
So where do we place all these notions?

255
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,530
It's kind of like a reset.

256
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,450
It's almost like understanding like you have feet,

257
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,310
right?

258
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,270
And they're very useful.

259
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,150
It's very useful to have feet.

260
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,170
By the way, to prevent people from running

261
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,330
away in old days, they used to cut

262
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,230
the big toe off.

263
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,330
Yeah, so it's not just the foot.

264
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,470
Big toe is very important, unlike the pinky

265
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,150
on the hand.

266
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,830
I would suggest that once you acknowledge the

267
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,650
importance of your feet, you're always wanting to

268
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,250
seek out good shoes because bad quality shoes

269
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,730
will create distortions in the foot and have

270
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,870
problems in the body.

271
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,050
So when we look, when we consider that

272
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,570
the human body is mostly made in terms

273
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,490
of its center mass and main mass and

274
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,910
the abdomen to accommodate organs for digestion, and

275
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,330
it also correlates directly to the brain geometrically

276
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,090
and also in the ancient ways of diagnosis,

277
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,030
it becomes a kind of a different perspective.

278
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,090
And I'm saying this not because you should

279
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,450
change your perspective from hearing this at all,

280
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,650
because, for example, the Greek enjoys European food,

281
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,170
especially Southern Mediterranean, Levant, food from Asia.

282
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,470
I prefer that over hot dogs and hamburgers.

283
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,710
I've chosen that culture to be, or the

284
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,830
cultures, I should say, Western and Eastern Asia

285
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,130
would be more accurate to say, or just

286
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,810
more broad as my cultural, let's say, imprint

287
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:33,030
desire more than, let's say, Mexican or American

288
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,410
food.

289
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,650
And I hope you Canadians have some good

290
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:35,870
food.

291
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,470
I know you do.

292
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,250
Just a joke.

293
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,530
I would suggest that just keeping certain things

294
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,810
in mind that it's a drive that we

295
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,790
have to eat because we're made that way.

296
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,990
And then how does that correlate to what

297
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,490
we've been shown and raised with?

298
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,010
Right.

299
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,010
And then try to seek a balance between

300
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,350
the two.

301
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,650
This is not about changing anything.

302
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,070
One of the biggest things that I've always

303
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,610
been a proponent of is if someone, let's

304
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,790
say, let's say it this way.

305
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,350
For some people, it necessitates that they change

306
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,470
their diet if they want to keep living

307
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,230
or sustain a certain quality of life that

308
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,830
doesn't maintain them as being miserable.

309
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,430
They have to change their diet.

310
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Yes.

311
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,170
In many cases, most people do now.

312
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,210
So what I always suggest is a replacement

313
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,030
regimen, not stop one and start the other.

314
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,210
And I've mentioned this over and over.

315
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,950
So if you are eating junk food all

316
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,530
day long or whatever meals you have, continue

317
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,050
that.

318
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,070
But keep in mind now you're going to

319
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,130
incorporate some things that you have deemed to

320
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,750
be more nutritious, more vital, more vitality and

321
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,630
better for the health that you want to

322
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,370
maintain or develop, because most people won't be

323
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,090
seeking such a change unless they're in pain.

324
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,830
And you know, when you're when does discomfort

325
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,610
become pain?

326
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,230
Well, that's up to the individual.

327
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,270
So I suggest go ahead and do what

328
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,610
you normally do, but develop a style or

329
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,450
develop a source and quantity of what you

330
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,030
know will remedy your condition.

331
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,610
Whole food, let's say, organic food.

332
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,890
Stick with the whole vegetarian, let's say, as

333
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,270
a basic concept and just start incorporating that.

334
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,550
So when you sit down to eat the

335
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,630
junk food that you normally would eat, whatever

336
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,670
serving size you would have, just break it

337
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:34,870
down.

338
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,890
So eat 70 percent of that and 30

339
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,950
percent of the whole food, right?

340
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,810
And then keep that going until you start

341
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,410
replacing the junk food, whether it's each successive

342
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,530
episode of eating.

343
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,750
You could have a junk food breakfast, a

344
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,390
whole food lunch and a junk food dinner.

345
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,970
And then eventually it'll be a junk food

346
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,410
breakfast, whole food lunch, whole food dinner.

347
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,210
And then eventually a whole food breakfast, whole

348
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,630
food lunch, whole food dinner.

349
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,790
When I say whole food, I mean whole

350
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,990
food and vitality.

351
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,470
And then, of course, just anyone who's ever

352
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,330
done this has noticed radical and rapid changes

353
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,890
in the quality of their life, meaning going

354
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,870
going up with also, let's say, avoiding most

355
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,750
of the adverse effects that people would suffer

356
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,970
going, quote unquote, cold turkey or stopping one

357
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,970
and going into the other.

358
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,570
So I just wanted to bring that up,

359
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,230
that transition, because all these things tie in

360
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,570
very closely together as a balancing, let's say,

361
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,310
a balancing arm or a moment arm to

362
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,290
balance out the culture you were raised in.

363
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,410
Even, you know, what's even more powerful than

364
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,170
that is the family or the child or

365
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,850
the formative years that you've had.

366
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,030
So what I really would like people to

367
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,350
consider is just some of the basic things

368
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,170
that I mentioned just to cover them again.

369
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,750
The human body, just look at how the

370
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,010
fetus even develops.

371
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,570
Look at what develops first.

372
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,910
You could just see it.

373
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,010
And then what what's interesting about that is

374
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,510
that the brain also looks like that area,

375
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:03,790
right?

376
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:04,510
The intestines.

377
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,990
So we're basically made to think and consume

378
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,109
food basically from a fetal point of view.

379
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,010
Even if you look at the human anatomy

380
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,210
as an adult, that's the center area of

381
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,569
the body beside the lungs.

382
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,290
You'll see that everything from the mouth down

383
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,589
to the esophagus, throat down to the intestines,

384
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,950
all that is to to consume and digest

385
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,890
and then eliminate.

386
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,910
So we are really, really, I mean, put

387
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,950
all that spiritual guru stuff aside.

388
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,670
I mean, we are basically very base creatures.

389
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,030
We're really tied to the land more than

390
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,130
we like to admit.

391
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,790
That's why, again, take all this information and

392
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,830
contrast it to the culture you've been raised

393
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,990
in.

394
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,990
You'll see that even any culture, let's say

395
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,990
even in American culture, you celebrate things with

396
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,430
food.

397
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,550
What's interesting, I wouldn't suggest celebrating with American

398
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:00,910
food.

399
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,770
But anyway, I say that.

400
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,890
Take us take a moment and look at

401
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,650
the body, because, you know, why would you

402
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,730
consider these things?

403
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,590
I mean, you have one.

404
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,470
I mean, whatever.

405
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,270
Look at just a basic anatomy cross section.

406
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,350
It has like 70 percent more punch when

407
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,190
you look at it than just talking about

408
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,490
it or feeling it, because what it does

409
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,090
is is it allows you to objectify and

410
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,370
walk away from, let's say, what we consider

411
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,330
to be normal behavior and see where this

412
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,070
is the situation that we're stuck in.

413
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,270
We have to eat food.

414
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,830
And it's very important because it correlates to

415
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,310
the brain based on our development.

416
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,750
So how do we move forward from this?

417
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,990
The whole thing is about finding balance.

418
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,370
And it's not about moving forward or backward,

419
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,170
really, or it's about not being stagnant.

420
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,490
Let's just say it that way.

421
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,510
Stagnation, nature always abhors it.

422
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,510
Even things that that appear to be inert

423
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,430
have what they call a half life and

424
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,470
do age, you know.

425
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,470
So what about the contrast that you can

426
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,470
develop or see if there's a difference in

427
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,190
your life between objectifying what is really going

428
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,490
on?

429
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,210
You know, you're a spirit inside a mind,

430
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,090
inside of a body that is mainly constructed

431
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,570
around consuming and digesting and eliminating.

432
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,470
And how do you contrast that objectiveness with

433
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,090
the subjectiveness of the culture and the family

434
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,390
life or your formative years view on food

435
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,870
and sort of like pull it away a

436
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,110
little bit and see what it's what it's

437
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,430
like.

438
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,910
Like, for example, I'm not a proponent of

439
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,110
this, but if you suck on cigarettes, they're

440
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,810
called smokers.

441
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,710
And some people have a hard time quitting

442
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,970
smoking cigarettes.

443
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,210
What I've always suggested to those people having

444
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,950
a hard time is go into a room

445
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,470
where you know there are people smoking.

446
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,370
And since you've been fighting the impulse all

447
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,330
day of smoking, when you walk into a

448
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,950
smoky room, really, that's where you need to

449
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,730
fight the impulse.

450
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,350
Just sit in a smoky room without a

451
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,010
cigarette and you'll be like, oh, wow, this

452
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,950
really stinks and I really can't breathe in

453
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,170
here.

454
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,730
It doesn't make any sense because that secondhand

455
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,110
smoke has lost its efficacy.

456
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,750
It's not as potent as taking a drag

457
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,390
off of a cigarette directly, right?

458
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:22,970
You'd think.

459
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,710
But what's interesting is that if you want

460
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,230
to stop smoking and you go into a

461
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,870
smoky room where people are smoking, it will

462
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,730
be very offensive to you if you don't

463
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,670
light up as well.

464
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,070
Right.

465
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,730
It's quite interesting how that works, because clinically,

466
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,850
scientifically using laws of conservation and all that,

467
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,830
you think it wouldn't.

468
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,310
So it's interesting when you take a step

469
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,730
back and look at food like, what are

470
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,310
we doing?

471
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,730
Why are we doing this?

472
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,390
And just start with the body that you're

473
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,830
in, because this is not really about the

474
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,470
mind or the spirit at all at this

475
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:53,790
point.

476
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,030
It's just that we are constructed this way,

477
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,610
just like if you look at an automobile

478
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,690
and the tires are worn out.

479
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,410
So what?

480
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,330
Well, you know, when an automobile is on

481
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,950
an engine driven wagon is on tires, you

482
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,630
see these big hunking tires, even in a

483
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,790
small car, or smaller hunking tires or whatever.

484
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,050
But you know, it's only a contact patch

485
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,470
the size of the palm of your hand

486
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,050
that's making contact with the ground.

487
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,750
So let's say you fill the car with

488
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,090
people.

489
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,650
The four tires only have the surface area

490
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,270
of contact to the ground of like four

491
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,470
palms on the, that's called the contact patch.

492
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,370
So it becomes much more critical when you

493
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,130
think about that.

494
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,170
So those tires need to be considered.

495
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,050
You need to change them or don't drive

496
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,410
it, right?

497
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,410
So when you start looking at the human

498
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,370
body and how we're constructed around basically to

499
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,350
consume and eat, and the geometric forms, the

500
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,550
archetypes that prevail from, let's say, early development,

501
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,970
as I suggested, look at the brain and

502
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,610
look at the intestines, wow, the geometry there

503
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,570
and the archetype, and how we don't ever

504
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,590
consider these things.

505
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,570
Yes, we do to objectify.

506
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,650
We just go along with the culture.

507
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,790
So I'm just saying again, pull away for

508
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,430
a moment and see what the body's demanding

509
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,370
because of its structure and the culture that

510
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,390
you live in, your family life, how you

511
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,850
were brought up and how you view food.

512
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,330
And see if that makes a difference in

513
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,510
the way you think about it.

514
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,730
Just like the cigarette smoker trying to quit

515
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,610
who finds being in a room with cigarette

516
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,190
smoke more offensive than smoking a cigarette himself.

517
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,490
It's a very interesting phenomenon there.

518
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,850
So I just wanted to bring that up

519
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,050
because I always ponder that.

520
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,850
I always have conversations, especially people come to

521
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,610
me about, not on the cooking side, but

522
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,870
on what I should eat side.

523
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,650
And that's a very big topic which we'll

524
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,090
get into here in the near future.

525
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,230
So before I leave, I just wanted to

526
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,090
suggest several ways to look at things, perhaps.

527
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,730
This is Greek-speak, so I think I

528
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,310
have license to say these things now.

529
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,010
Back when organic food came around, the idea,

530
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,230
let's say, in the late 70s and early

531
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,930
80s, I was made aware of that it

532
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,490
was normal to poison crops and normal for

533
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,450
people to consume that.

534
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,750
There was another food called organic food which

535
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,450
was not toxified or had more vitality.

536
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,310
Even at that point, I watched the industry

537
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,150
as it got to the late 90s, early

538
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,670
2000s when it went mainstream.

539
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,210
I said, oh, that's it for organic.

540
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,170
It's going to be legalized and we'll eventually

541
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,590
have to do even better than that.

542
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,590
So even though something is organic, yes, it

543
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,470
still will be better quality and I would

544
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,050
go for it.

545
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,990
So if you're shopping for, let's say, Dijon

546
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,130
mustard and you see the organic Dijon mustard

547
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,170
next to it, get the organic Dijon mustard

548
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,690
in short.

549
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,990
I just want to leave you off with

550
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,190
that.

551
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,790
If you ever see something that's organic and

552
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,910
you want to afford it, do it because

553
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,370
it still is a better choice.

554
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,530
The other thing I wanted to mention is,

555
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,350
oh, before I get on to that, the

556
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,530
foods that are not organic, by the way,

557
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,550
have no sobriety, meaning the foods that are

558
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,810
not organic are grown being chemically high, like

559
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,850
a crack baby or a heroin baby or

560
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,430
whatever, from the mom all the way to

561
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,210
when it's adult.

562
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,870
It's not going to function very well based

563
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,990
on the structure being distorted from the drugs.

564
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,790
And it's someone, let's say, using a terrible

565
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,190
metaphor to use, but someone who was grown

566
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,410
up from conception being on harmful drugs will

567
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,930
give the appearance of such in many cases

568
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,390
and will not be able to function in

569
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,050
most cases.

570
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,210
This is basically what the chemical food is.

571
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,470
It's food that grows fast because it's high,

572
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,830
just like athletes take performance drugs.

573
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,570
So that's basically what the chemical food is.

574
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,690
And of course, there are things in their

575
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,570
constituents that change the body and that's going

576
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,710
to be another conversation.

577
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,730
But that's not something that I even want

578
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,090
to dwell on, so I may not have

579
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,450
a big conversation on that.

580
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,250
This includes, by the way, a lot of

581
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,310
the hydroponics.

582
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,490
Not that hydroponics is bad, it's just that

583
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,730
it's very convenient.

584
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,890
They don't have to go out and spray

585
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,630
something, but with an airplane in the field,

586
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,970
they just put it in the water that

587
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,290
circulates through the roots because the plants have

588
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:21,770
no choice.

589
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,850
Again, their feet are in the water versus

590
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,930
their feet are in the soil.

591
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,730
So for meat, I don't have much to

592
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,570
say about that.

593
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,110
People know, I presumed, or if they don't

594
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,030
know, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

595
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,850
And what's interesting about the Old Testament, it

596
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,970
indirectly promotes a vegetarian diet.

597
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,990
Well, how does it do that?

598
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,770
What do you mean indirect?

599
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,470
Well, indirect because there's something called being in

600
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,170
a clean state and unclean state.

601
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,450
And when you eat an unclean food or

602
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,310
touch an unclean thing, you're in an unclean

603
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,750
state and you wash, then the afternoon, the

604
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,090
next day, you know, noontime or evening, you're

605
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,750
declared clean.

606
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,810
So what's interesting, there's a mention there that

607
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,710
anything that touches meat or flesh of an

608
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,710
animal, a dead animal, let's say, I'm paraphrasing

609
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,770
here, is unclean.

610
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,110
So this is how I see it.

611
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,370
That's why I say indirectly promotes a vegetarian

612
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,930
diet, doesn't say be vegetarian or eat fruits

613
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,850
and vegetables only.

614
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,970
But here, if anything touches flesh of an

615
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,850
animal, it's unclean.

616
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,750
So let's see, chicken is a clean poultry,

617
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,090
right?

618
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:25,370
Yeah.

619
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,750
Okay.

620
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,630
Certain fishes, most fishes are, or a hamburger,

621
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:30,970
right?

622
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,630
That's clean.

623
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,390
It's beef, right?

624
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,630
Or goat roti, right?

625
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,930
That's clean animal, right?

626
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,830
Acceptable, right?

627
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,570
But wait a second, it doesn't qualify what

628
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,730
animal, it says any flesh.

629
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,650
So wait a second.

630
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,430
If I'm eating any of those things, am

631
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,350
I touching the flesh of a dead animal?

632
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,250
The answer is yes.

633
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,730
So that's why I say it's indirectly promoting

634
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,310
it.

635
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,130
It's not a prohibition in any way of

636
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,150
eating meat, but it almost gives the Old

637
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,950
Testament, the Torah observer, lots of choices, by

638
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,510
the way.

639
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,210
So, and also I do recall over three

640
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,270
years ago saying within a year or two,

641
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,230
or I said two years, three years ago,

642
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,890
I said within two years, we'll probably won't

643
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,670
be eating meat.

644
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,630
You wouldn't want to eat meat.

645
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,170
So we're already in that time.

646
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,450
And if you are eating meat, meaning hoof

647
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,850
or surf or wing or any of that,

648
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,910
you'll notice that the changes are here.

649
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,390
The quality has gone down and just the

650
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
food tastes differently.

651
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,950
Farmed fish, by the way, I wanted to

652
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,550
bring this up, beware of farmed fish.

653
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,790
They go to scientists, what do the fish

654
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:40,910
need?

655
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,810
They need a lot of protein.

656
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,570
So, you know, they just feed them dog

657
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,910
food and cat food pellets, right?

658
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,470
Or they make fish food pellets that are

659
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,890
made of things that the fish would not

660
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,110
eat.

661
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,430
And you can taste it in the flesh,

662
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,870
by the way.

663
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,370
I can always, if I'm ever out and

664
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,730
have a farmed fish, whatever, I said, oh,

665
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,550
this is farmed fish.

666
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,770
I can taste the feed, right?

667
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,610
So the other thing before I go, protein

668
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,910
versus carbs, forget about that whole argument.

669
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,710
I had a conversation recently with someone who

670
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,590
I consider a very intelligent individual who's really

671
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,190
into blood pressure and pH of urine and

672
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,790
blood and all that stuff.

673
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,010
All those things go into the category of

674
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:23,470
calories as a measurement of food energy.

675
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,250
And of course, if you've been around the

676
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,390
Greek for a while, you know that calories

677
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,430
only count for food if you poop charcoal

678
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,610
briquettes, right?

679
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,290
Because look at how calories are determined and

680
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,570
any poop you might have is still burnable

681
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,470
and it's irrelevant.

682
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,390
So all of these things about proteins and

683
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:48,410
carbs are all quantitative quantities, clinical quantities that

684
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,830
are usually irrelevant to biological functioning.

685
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,230
So again, I think I'm going to get

686
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,610
going, keep this kind of short.

687
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,050
And it's the first one, let's call it

688
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,810
food part one.

689
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,850
And I would like to just leave off

690
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,750
everyone by saying thank you again for all

691
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,170
the time.

692
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,390
If you're here, you're probably not here for

693
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,610
the first time, but if you are, welcome.

694
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,370
And enjoy your traditions, enjoy the things that

695
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,430
you know bring you pleasure and perceive them

696
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,870
as things that are for that.

697
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,810
But if you want to make a change,

698
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,630
you're going to have to be objective and

699
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,990
start doing comparatives to what you're doing and

700
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,170
what you want to do, where you've been,

701
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,850
where you're going.
