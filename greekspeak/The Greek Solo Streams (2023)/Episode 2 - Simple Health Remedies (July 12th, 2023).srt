1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,940
Hey everyone, we're going to call these simple

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,520
remedies.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,380
Simple remedies meaning the ones I use often.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Where do we start?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,280
Depending on the situation, the easiest one that

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
I can come up with that I use

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,920
the most often is referring back to the

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,560
analogy I give for magnets.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,440
What are magnets?

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,020
Well, magnets are to electricity what photographic paper

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,360
are to light or is to light.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,220
Meaning, as the photographic paper captures a moment

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,020
in time when light exposes it, a magnet

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,519
captures the electrical field going through basically a

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,360
piece of iron or iron alloy.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,460
And when the electrical field is released, you're

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,500
left with whatever impression, just like light leaves

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,220
an impression on photographic paper.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,720
Well, what does this have to do with

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,080
remedies?

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,720
The body all day is experiencing many fields

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,920
and many situations which imprint upon it.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,360
And usually by the end of the day,

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,600
you might say, I'm tired.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,880
I need to re-energize.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,100
I kind of feel like I have everything

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,920
that I did today still in me.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,860
I mean, this is a thought that I

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,460
come up with.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,340
I just wanted to share.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
And what I do for that is the

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,740
easiest way to demagnetize the body is water.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, go take a shower.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
All right, so very simple.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,220
Some people I recommend baths and some people

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,880
say, I don't like sitting in my own

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,160
shit.

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,180
I'm like, I never understood that.

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,120
But I just want to bring that up

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,980
because some people don't like taking baths.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,360
If you feel that way, just like at

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,460
the going into a pool or a beach

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,740
or whatever, shower first, then bathe or whatever.

44
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,000
But baths tend to be a little bit

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
better because you're sitting in the water.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,400
Now, what do I mean by demagnetize?

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,240
I don't even know if I said that

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,440
yet.

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,560
But when you wash the body in water,

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,520
it's demagnetizing the body, literally, just like a

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,280
magnet is imprinted or photographic paper is imprinted

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
with the effective fields on it.

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,060
The rinsing off or the water running over

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,380
the body, especially in a bath, when you

55
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,400
have some water trickling in and some water

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,340
trickling out, not a stagnant bath.

57
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,460
But let's say just a shower.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,900
I've run into people that very often, infrequently,

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,720
that bathe where they don't have a bathroom.

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,880
Actually, I shouldn't say I don't have a

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,080
bathroom.

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,620
Off-the-grid kind of situation, people living

63
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,540
in van life type thing, where they have

64
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,120
to improvise showers and baths or truck stops

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,140
and things like that.

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
It's the same thing.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Running water over the body is essentially what

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,680
I mean.

69
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,680
It could be as much as if you

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
live near a lake or a river or

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,600
the beach, taking a dip at the end

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,040
of the day.

73
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,740
Again, what I call it is demagnetizing.

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,200
People that I know, for example, if someone

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
says, I really had a hard day.

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm feeling whatever.

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,240
I said, did you demagnetize?

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,120
Those that know me know what I mean

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,500
by that.

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
It means go take a shower.

81
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,000
It's fast and easy.

82
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,100
It's not even a washing episode.

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,260
It is just a wetting episode.

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,240
It could just be 30 seconds or a

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,400
minute.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,860
I don't know how much to stress that

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,580
or emphasize the positive effects of that.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,820
We usually associate that in most cultures with

89
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,080
just washing because you're unclean.

90
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,860
I mean, you just whatever.

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,040
You need to wash.

92
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,820
But in this case, I'm pursuing the idea

93
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,320
that it is a form of demagnetizing the

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,640
body.

95
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,620
You can take it however you want in

96
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,740
terms of if you want to look at

97
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,700
it spiritually, meaning Old Testament style, or if

98
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,120
you want to look at it from a

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,860
material chemical point of view, or do you

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,420
want to look at it from, let's say,

101
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,040
an emo or emotional point of view, which

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,180
would be kind of an invigorating feeling, right?

103
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
When you think about taking a shower, it's

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,020
an invigorating feeling.

105
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,480
Usually, I suggest that there is a demagnetization

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
process that is occurring.

107
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,980
Why?

108
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,260
Very often when I do feel uncomfortable with

109
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,180
myself physically and others, I always recommend and

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,200
I do take a shower and I always

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,360
feel different.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
When I say different, let's just say I

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,540
always feel better, but I'm saying different like,

114
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,120
for example, if you're experiencing a specific discomfort,

115
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,580
a headache, an ache, a soreness, it might

116
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,240
actually, well, it will improve it, right?

117
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
I don't know how much more to emphasize.

118
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,000
It sounds almost cliche, but I've never heard

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
anyone just implying rinsing the body with water

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,360
changes the state, and I'm suggesting that it

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,700
does.

122
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,360
Just like a magnet is charged and then

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,920
demagnetized, the body works very much the same

124
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,200
way.

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I don't need to get into a long

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,640
idea of expressing how everything that we do

127
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,200
during the day or encounter, and even things

128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,220
that we don't do, imprints itself, those actions,

129
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,720
activities, objects, other people imprint themselves on the

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
physical body.

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,220
And of course, you know, if the physical

132
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,340
body is not reacting well, the mind and

133
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,780
the spirit will not react very well.

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,860
So, when I say these are quick, simple

135
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,800
remedies, I brought this up first, because again,

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,820
it's my first suggestion to most when they

137
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,100
say they're not feeling well, did you demagnetize,

138
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,380
did you shower or bathe?

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Now, there's the second part in terms of

140
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,020
bathing, there's tremendous amount of, what would you

141
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,900
say, culture built around it, you know, the

142
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,860
bubble bath, the salt bath, the Epsom salt

143
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,340
bath, all that's wonderful, whatever you prefer.

144
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm just simply stating that when you have

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,680
a sense of tiredness, whatever, discomfort, soreness, a

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,120
headache, a toothache, a stomachache, even a heart

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,080
attack, rinse off very quickly.

148
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,420
By the way, they call it angina, there's

149
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,620
very technical names, various technical names for a

150
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:54,980
heart attack.

151
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,640
I have experienced that, by the way, and

152
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm not sure if it was a, one

153
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,920
of those vans that drive around with a

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,820
little satellite dish pointed at you or whatever,

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,560
but I was home alone, it was late

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,000
afternoon, I was making a sandwich, as they

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
say back east, and suddenly I felt my

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
legs get really stiff, I lost feeling in

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,360
my legs, and the heart started beating really,

160
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,540
really fast, and I had trouble breathing.

161
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,040
And from all the information I've ever heard

162
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,780
about a cardiac arrest, I was like, okay,

163
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,540
this is what this is, it's the closest

164
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,260
thing to it.

165
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,580
And there's really no such thing as a

166
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,800
heart attack as explained.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,760
When the heart goes into that state, it

168
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,660
stops acting like a breaking mechanism, it's like

169
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,580
having a failing break, right, because the heart

170
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,820
is not pumping anything, it deceives everyone because

171
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,200
we sense it as a pump, and we're

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,540
told since we're young it's a pump.

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,580
It's actually a breaking mechanism, it stops the

174
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,520
flow of blood, restricts it, and then lets

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,540
it mix in the heart and then releases

176
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,080
it again.

177
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,120
So when this heart attack thing is happening,

178
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,140
it's actually, it's like having breaks that are

179
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,720
not working because it's in the wet, or

180
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,900
failing, or because of fluid, or, yeah, it's

181
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,360
a failing breaking system.

182
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,160
But anyway, back to what happened with me,

183
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,880
is I felt this, and the first thing

184
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,220
I did was ran into the shower, cold

185
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,900
water, I had clothes on, barefoot, but all

186
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,820
my clothes were on, cell phone in the

187
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,380
pocket, wallet in the pocket, change keys, everything,

188
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,480
reading glasses on the head, and just ran

189
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,980
cold water.

190
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,559
It was early spring, so the water was

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,539
still pretty cold coming out, and it stiffened

192
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,620
up the body, and I just didn't think

193
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,260
about what was happening, or what I felt

194
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,159
was happening, and I felt fine.

195
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,920
I called the wife about an hour later,

196
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
I said, I think I just had a

197
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
heart attack, but I treated it, and I

198
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,580
feel better now, and I felt quite sore

199
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,340
and tired for a few days after that

200
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,740
episode.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,640
So I just wanted to share that, uh,

202
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,220
why the cold water and all that, of

203
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,560
course, it's a contractive mechanism, right?

204
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,980
The warm water would increase circulation, cold water

205
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
would stop it.

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,620
I let my mind run a little wild,

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,260
I remember a few days later having sushi,

208
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
and I'm pretty friendly with the sushi chef,

209
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
just talking about health, I said, you know,

210
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,780
I had a heart attack the other day,

211
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,100
he's like, you're kidding, right?

212
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,260
Anyway, it's a whole other story for someday.

213
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,280
By the way, regarding that episode, later on,

214
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,920
I did catch up with something on the

215
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,000
internet about that, and one of the treatments

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,100
that are being used now for that situation,

217
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,340
the heart attack situation, is dipping people in

218
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,860
ice water.

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
So go figure.

220
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,380
So intuitively, I think I did the right

221
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,540
thing.

222
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,480
This was back, I'd say, around 2016 or

223
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,500
so, and I let my mind run conspiratorial,

224
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
you know, figuring there was a van driving

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,220
around, you know, with what they call directed

226
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,660
energy weapons, or whatever, because I haven't had

227
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,800
anything recurring since.

228
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,880
Lately, I did have something very similar, but

229
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
not as severe.

230
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,340
So I just wanted to share that with

231
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,680
you.

232
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,800
If you are in a situation around someone

233
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,080
that does have that heart attack thing, ice

234
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,300
water, entire body, quick remedy.

235
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,180
I know it sounds kind of severe when

236
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,520
you're talking about quick remedies, I just wandered

237
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,820
off to that end of it.

238
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Water, demagnetization.

239
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,260
So the lingo that I use is demagnetized.

240
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,220
Not your old VCR tapes or cassette tapes,

241
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,860
but the body.

242
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,500
And I'm suggesting that's exactly what's happening.

243
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,560
So we have gotten into other things with

244
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,160
water, and we will get into some in

245
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,580
-depth discussions about water.

246
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,960
But again, what prompted me to do this

247
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,120
is, on simple remedies, is we're in the

248
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,920
middle of a season.

249
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
Whether you're on the other side of the

250
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,860
world, you're probably in the middle of winter.

251
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,380
Right here, it's the middle of summer right

252
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,660
now.

253
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,500
And what's interesting, when you get to the

254
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,180
middle of seasons, whether it's the big season,

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,420
winter and summer.

256
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,660
And by the way, in the ancient times,

257
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,620
it was winter and summer, and spring and

258
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,720
fall were transition times.

259
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
That's when the most happenings are in terms

260
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,120
of the effects of the season on the

261
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,360
body.

262
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
And I've been very busy lately, extremely busy,

263
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,560
and I've been finding myself bumping into things,

264
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,860
being clumsy, and getting tired, getting sore, or

265
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,960
doing heavy lifting, all kinds of things, especially

266
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,900
even with the mind.

267
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,420
And I found that the best therapy for

268
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,320
the state that I'm in, particularly recently, is

269
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,560
to just have a good, quick wash.

270
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,460
But we'll get more into water.

271
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,840
We've covered the aqueous argentum.

272
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
We'll get into more on how to make

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,300
the devices and some more developments on that,

274
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,440
and also water purification at home and wherever

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,000
you are.

276
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,660
We'll definitely get into that again.

277
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,160
But if I say it another 20 times,

278
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,140
that demagnetizing the body with a quick shower

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,820
will really change the way you feel.

280
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,800
Next thing I wanted to mention, typically for

281
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,020
a quick remedy, most people still experience skin

282
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,780
manifestations.

283
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,520
And this is also going to include a

284
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,160
toothache, an abscess in the mouth, a gum

285
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,100
thing, abscess, swelling, blister in the mouth, anywhere

286
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,060
on the body, I suggest, except for the

287
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,360
very soft areas, the groin, perhaps, or armpit

288
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,760
would be very sensitive.

289
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,400
But for any skin manifestation, including what they

290
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,680
call a pimple, a boil, but not a

291
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,720
rash, not a skin rash, which would be

292
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,100
just a general topical spread on the skin,

293
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,860
dry or red or wet, but basically a

294
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,540
skin manifestation in the mouth in the form

295
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,780
of a blister or a pimple or a

296
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,620
bump, what people call a bump, I would

297
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,120
suggest ginger root for that.

298
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,980
What you do is you crosscut just a

299
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,920
very thin slice of ginger and put it

300
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
over the area and wrap it.

301
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,780
I've been one of the people that have

302
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,300
the fate of having mouth problems.

303
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,700
Ever since I was a child, when I

304
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,480
was 12 years old or 11 years old,

305
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,160
I fell off some monkey bars and broke

306
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,320
out the front teeth, and I've had a

307
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
bridge ever since then.

308
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,980
But now I have prosthetics, and I got

309
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,480
mad at the dentist for not telling me

310
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,880
that prosthetics work so well, but you couldn't

311
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,060
tell, and I'm quite happy with it.

312
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,040
But I've always had teeth issues and mouth

313
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
issues, and ever since I got into macrobiotics

314
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,020
in the 80s, it wasn't suggested, but I

315
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,640
had discovered ginger use, and I would cut

316
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
a slice if I had an abscess in

317
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,700
the mouth or a blister or a bump

318
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,720
or something on the skin.

319
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,920
If you have what they call acne or

320
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,360
a boil, sometimes a persistent, a slice of

321
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,020
ginger wrapped or held on there, and when

322
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,540
I say wrapped, you understand it's like a

323
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,460
poultice or a bandage, but even held on

324
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,740
there just for a few minutes.

325
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,740
The other day I felt, because of the

326
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,040
heat here, I got a heat sore, like

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,760
a pimple on my forehead forming, and it

328
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,580
was quite tough and it was sore, and

329
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,960
I just cut a piece of ginger and

330
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,720
just held it there.

331
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,320
I sat in front of the computer looking

332
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
up some things I wanted to look up

333
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
with my left hand, center finger just pushing

334
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,780
the slice of ginger on this bump that

335
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,320
was forming on my head from the heat,

336
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,280
and within 10 minutes or so I took

337
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,920
it off and it was hardly there and

338
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
I didn't feel it anymore and it's gone.

339
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,300
So, ginger, ginger root.

340
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,900
If you don't have access to it, I

341
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,000
was going to suggest galangal, which is something

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,640
that's found in Asia, but if you don't

343
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,720
have access to ginger, you probably won't have

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
access to galangal.

345
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,520
It looks exactly like ginger and it has

346
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,680
like a white pepper flavor instead of that

347
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,640
floral flavor that ginger has.

348
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm not sure what other kind of root

349
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,360
you would use if you don't have access

350
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,300
to it because, believe it or not, a

351
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
lot of the things, we'll put it this

352
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,980
way, I didn't look into other alternatives for

353
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
it because I'm in a place and always

354
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,080
been in a place where I could always

355
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
get it.

356
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,800
I don't grow it.

357
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,260
It's accessible.

358
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
If it's not accessible to where you are,

359
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,700
I don't know what a substitute would be,

360
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,240
and if you're listening to me on a

361
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,900
computer, you could probably look up on the

362
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,820
browser what would be a simple substitute, but

363
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,960
if we look at it, it is a

364
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,240
root.

365
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,040
It grows longitudinally.

366
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,860
It has bulbs, sort of.

367
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,980
If you look at how it grows, something

368
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,640
similar might be similar, and again, always do

369
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,480
a test, but I just wanted to bring

370
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,300
up the ginger because it saved my butt

371
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,640
in so many ways, not literally, but skin

372
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,000
manifestations, bumps, mouth issues, things like that.

373
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,200
It's really like, for example, if I have

374
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,920
a bump forming on my gum or whatever,

375
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,780
like something that's going to be an abscess

376
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,660
or swelling, I would put a piece of

377
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,760
ginger on that and hold it down, or

378
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
actually, you could leave it in there like

379
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,840
chewing tobacco, and within 20 minutes to an

380
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,120
hour, seems to relieve most of it, if

381
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
not all of it, often.

382
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,820
Instead of something lasting days, it can be

383
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,800
gone within an hour or two using the

384
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,040
ginger.

385
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,380
I can give a quick story.

386
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
There's a lady I remember back in the

387
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,840
1980s.

388
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
Macrobiotics were big on ginger, poultices, and compresses,

389
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,720
and she was a very petite lady, and

390
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,320
she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and I

391
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,340
was poo-pooing it because most people get

392
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,360
false diagnosis on this thing because they just

393
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,380
want to run them through the system for

394
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,960
the insurance.

395
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,460
When someone says they have cancer or something,

396
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,440
I say, what kind of insurance do you

397
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,580
have?

398
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,740
They say, oh, I have the best corporate

399
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,040
insurance.

400
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Oh, they'll tell you you have cancer.

401
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,180
Of course they do.

402
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,380
Anyway, when I kind of poo-pooed it,

403
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,940
she picked up her shirt, showed me the

404
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,200
side of her breast, and held up her

405
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,560
breast, and you could actually see the lump

406
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,200
through the skin.

407
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,980
I was like, okay.

408
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,599
I suggested doing a ginger compress.

409
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,560
She didn't know what it was.

410
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,200
I explained it to her, which was basically

411
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,160
grating ginger in water and then bringing it

412
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,060
just pre-simmer, making it very hot and

413
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,619
turning it off and having some cheesecloth or

414
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,940
a white cotton from old sheets or T

415
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,119
-shirt, dipping it in there, slightly wringing it

416
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,339
out, and pressing it with a towel against

417
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,940
the area for doing it for about 20

418
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,780
minutes at a time.

419
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Well, it turns out she did it for

420
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,520
about four hours at a time for about

421
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,400
a week, and it developed a very black

422
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,380
and blue, almost black in the center.

423
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,080
Half of her breast turned black and blue,

424
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,620
and she was threatening me like, oh, this

425
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,580
caused this.

426
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,500
It's making it worse.

427
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,920
Well, what happened, I hadn't seen her then

428
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,080
for about another week or so, and I

429
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,820
said how she was.

430
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,300
She said she left the hospital because the

431
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,220
tumor came up to the skin and became

432
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,680
a boil, and they lanced it, and it

433
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
all came out.

434
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,980
I was like, wow.

435
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,840
Is that good?

436
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,280
Are you happy?

437
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,560
She goes, that's excellent, because now it went

438
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
from what they diagnosed as a cancer to

439
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,600
a boil that had to be lanced and

440
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,080
relieved.

441
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,260
So the therapy for lancing and relieving a

442
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,980
boil is radically different from being treated for

443
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,580
breast cancer.

444
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,180
So this was back in about 1989.

445
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,540
I just wanted to share that, because that's

446
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,940
always one of the strongest memories of using

447
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,900
ginger on the body other than when I

448
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,820
use it, and I've also suggested to other

449
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,880
people, and most people have very good results.

450
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,500
Again, if you don't have access to ginger,

451
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,280
you might look up an alternative and maybe

452
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,880
email me, uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com.

453
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,240
That's the number one, and I'll help you

454
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,920
maybe find something if there isn't.

455
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
I have not looked into it.

456
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,020
I've been a little lazy on the alternatives

457
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,100
for some of these things.

458
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,100
Okay, in terms of so far remedies, those

459
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,460
are the two major ones that have come

460
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,060
to mind that I've used recently, and I

461
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,180
use very, very often and suggest to people.

462
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,580
It would be the water and the ginger

463
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,040
compress.

464
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,140
Now when we get into more of these

465
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,080
basic remedies, it's just a smattering of depending

466
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,320
on more of a specific situation.

467
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,140
The first one was the most general, just

468
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,060
demagnetizing, and the ginger would be more specific,

469
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,400
but very general, again, because it's the entire

470
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,420
outer skin area of the body and the

471
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,740
mouth.

472
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,740
I don't recommend it for rashes.

473
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,780
I have once I got a rash and

474
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,340
it just made it worse.

475
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,200
It irritated it, and there's a reason for

476
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,520
that.

477
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,420
It's the way the energy flows with the

478
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,660
ginger.

479
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,740
It's very piercing, very penetrating, and a rash

480
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,240
is something that is only topical, and to

481
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,700
put a penetrating energy on something that needs

482
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
to be topical will aggravate it.

483
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,960
So the other basic remedy that I encounter

484
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,900
often, and because I'm extremely active with various

485
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,780
things that I'm doing right now, making prototypes

486
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,980
and doing things, is little cuts and bruises

487
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,700
and burns from soldering iron, sharp bits of

488
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,240
metal that cut into your skin when you

489
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,780
least expect it, or when you're rebuilding a

490
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,100
machine or something, a motor, or working with

491
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,800
all kinds of stuff.

492
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,560
You're going to break your skin or bruise

493
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,620
it or burn it, and that is the

494
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,960
classic thing that I've been shouting from the

495
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,940
hilltops is wrap it and wrap it tight,

496
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,240
whatever it is, whether it's a burn, whether

497
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,860
it's a cut, a bruise, a fingernail lift,

498
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,140
or anything like that.

499
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,120
You get your finger caught in one of

500
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,980
these, get it pinched and you get those

501
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,020
crazy blood blisters.

502
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,700
With that, you only have a few seconds

503
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,420
to wrap it really tight because those are

504
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,100
very fast acting, and also the deeper the

505
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,880
cut, the faster you have to act.

506
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,640
That is classic Greek-speak stuff, very important.

507
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,320
What I want to add to that is

508
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,860
when you wrap it, well, when you wrap

509
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
it tight, you're preventing the loss of vacuum

510
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,620
so the body doesn't have to go into

511
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,620
emergency mode and start swelling all of the

512
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,240
tissue around it to prevent it.

513
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,300
It already senses that you are restoring the

514
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,280
vacuum very quickly.

515
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,540
The other thing is the interstitial spaces do

516
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,100
not, you know, the spaces that the cells

517
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,180
are pressed in together with do not expand,

518
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,600
again, for the same reason, and rapid, very,

519
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,420
very rapid healing takes place.

520
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,520
Now, of course, we know by now that

521
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,860
everything in the body works by induction.

522
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,240
When you take in anything, it doesn't pass

523
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,120
through any membranes.

524
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,080
It's created on the inside via induction.

525
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,500
What's interesting is when the wound is healing,

526
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
if you've ever looked at a wound, first

527
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,520
it drains a clear liquid.

528
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,120
Very rarely do you see blood.

529
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,240
It's a clear liquid, which typically forms a

530
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,320
scab, so it hides what it's really doing

531
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,660
underneath, and then the liquid becomes, that clear

532
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,900
liquid becomes an oily, thicker consistency, not a

533
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,280
pus.

534
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,920
Sometimes that also, there's like 14 different varieties

535
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,000
of what people call pus, and it's not

536
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,520
necessarily white blood cells either.

537
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,380
That is an oily substance, and then forms

538
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,760
into solids that forms the new tissue, and

539
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,560
there's almost like an energetic medium that controls

540
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,660
what is to form.

541
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,800
So, one thing I wanted to add to

542
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,100
the rapid compression, or wrapping it very tight,

543
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,560
is some kind of a salve or an

544
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,860
oil.

545
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
Now, the worst, or the bottom, I wouldn't

546
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
say that, because it works as well.

547
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,640
The bottom of the tier would be what

548
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,100
they call Vaseline or mineral oils, which is

549
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,160
in most commercial lotions.

550
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,620
I think if you're at this stage right

551
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,740
now where you're listening to Solosonics, you know

552
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,160
that, but I just wanted to bring it

553
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,380
up.

554
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,240
You would have to be a vegetable or

555
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,620
animal based is much better than a petroleum

556
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,900
based oil, but if that's all you have,

557
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,040
you know, what they call baby oil or

558
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,800
Vaseline, that would be at the bottom tier.

559
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,080
The next up from there would be your,

560
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,440
any kind of a cooking oil or coconut

561
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
oil or whatever, which is tropical, very thin,

562
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,080
and then up from there would be the

563
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,220
heavier salves.

564
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,080
When I say animal, there was a lanolin

565
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,600
based lotion or salves that were out in

566
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:44,920
the market.

567
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,080
I think they stopped using those for a

568
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,260
while.

569
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,420
Very hard to get that.

570
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,500
You also want to use a salve that's

571
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,780
made from an endangered species of some kind.

572
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,540
No, I'm just joking.

573
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,040
And up higher from that, by the way,

574
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,340
from the animal, would be the vegetable and

575
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,780
the vegetable pertaining to, of course, the temperate

576
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,900
or the climate that you're in and what

577
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,280
would be the season or climate.

578
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,400
So when you have a shift in climate,

579
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,940
make sure that you don't use tropical stuff.

580
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,960
Well, if you have to, it's better than

581
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,280
nothing.

582
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,440
But one thing I didn't never really got

583
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,340
into with just wrapping it tight is applying

584
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,620
some kind of an oil or a salve.

585
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,340
I want to thank personally Frank for sending

586
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,220
me some wonderful Burdock salve.

587
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,320
It's a, I don't like endorsing stuff, but

588
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,520
I have used it recently.

589
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,840
I've had a dry spot on the ankle

590
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,820
and it's, I'm very impressed with it.

591
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,480
It's a Diamond G Forest Products Healing Pine

592
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,180
Salve, Patterson, Georgia.

593
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:00,400
Ingredients, olive oil, pine gum, rosin, beeswax, turpentine.

594
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

595
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,480
It's not the Burdock.

596
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,240
It's pine resin.

597
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:03,760
Yeah.

598
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,140
So that is a very interesting, I've been

599
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,560
using it.

600
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,360
I have a small dry spot on the

601
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,000
ankle on the left side, by the way.

602
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,260
It's kind of blocking excess yin from going

603
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,980
through into the ground and it's been reoccurring

604
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,060
for about a year or so.

605
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,440
And this year it's been okay.

606
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,680
But I noticed when I'm drying off sometimes,

607
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,780
there's a dried little spot.

608
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,000
It's about the size of a postage stamp.

609
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,360
And I've been keeping this on there for

610
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,660
about a week now and it's disappeared.

611
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,400
So it is quite effective.

612
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,500
And it's the, I just read the ingredients,

613
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,580
olive oil and pine.

614
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,700
So again, the reason why you want to

615
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,300
put some kind of a salve, by the

616
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,120
way, it's very old Testament, by the way,

617
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,860
you'll see that coming up that, you know,

618
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,220
you're not putting salve on stuff.

619
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
What's wrong with you, right?

620
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,920
Kind of a comment.

621
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm just paraphrasing in the old Testament, but

622
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,880
in order for the skin to rebuild any

623
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,540
tissue to rebuild it, the energy that's induced

624
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,560
is pure energy.

625
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,660
And it starts to materialize into a gas

626
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,720
form first, and then it becomes a liquid

627
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,620
and then it becomes a gel.

628
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,740
And then it becomes the solid form and

629
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,120
tissue.

630
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,140
And what I mean that like your skin

631
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,480
cells are made of solid and gel and

632
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,740
liquid and gas, right?

633
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,800
So having some salve in the area would

634
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,140
definitely promote the healing only because it's what

635
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,320
the body is striving to do anyway.

636
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,140
It's kind of an interesting thing where it

637
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,180
was a very ancient methodology to put salves,

638
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,120
various salves for various ailments and cuts and

639
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,740
things like that.

640
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,260
It's less popularly used today.

641
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,820
There's first aid cream and things like that.

642
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,020
Again, petrochemical, not necessary.

643
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,180
But what I'm suggesting here is when you

644
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,060
wrap it tight, you can just...

645
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,260
Here's the thing about the reality we live

646
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,400
in.

647
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,380
When you do the wrapping tight, it has

648
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,060
to be done immediately or very quickly.

649
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,780
So don't spend time looking for salves and

650
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,380
things like that.

651
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,100
So the most immediate thing, even if it's

652
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,480
like vegetable shortening, put some vegetable shortening on

653
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,620
it.

654
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,400
The top tier stuff is vegetable based that's

655
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,880
temperate, meaning within the climate you're in, within

656
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,500
the region you're in, within the latitude.

657
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,100
And then the second best would be what

658
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,740
they call their products for skin, first aid

659
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,140
cream, whatever, and animal products, which you probably

660
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,860
won't find.

661
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,540
I don't think anyone's going to be putting

662
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,120
lard on there if it's listening to me.

663
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,140
And then the bottom tier would be just

664
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,720
the Vaseline.

665
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,740
But if you don't have anything and you

666
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,280
have access to Vaseline, don't use motor grease.

667
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,340
That's but in other words, keep it moist,

668
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,000
something there.

669
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,860
Now, if you just have hand cream and

670
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,400
hand lotion around, that's fine as well.

671
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,480
But some of the fragrances that they use

672
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,260
there burn.

673
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,900
In other words, if you have an opening

674
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,660
in the skin...

675
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,300
By the way, when you hear of people

676
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,680
getting cancers from using these products that they

677
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,480
put on the market, whether it's soaps or

678
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,520
lotions or whatever, it's actually the fragrance component

679
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,100
that causes the cancers in the body more

680
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,540
than any other of the components, which are

681
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,820
more inert to the body.

682
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,660
So one thing I always tell people, if

683
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,460
you're going to shop consumer grade, mainstream stuff,

684
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,520
get stuff that's fragrance free, because it's the

685
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,880
fragrance component that makes people ill more readily

686
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,180
than any other component.

687
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,160
Unless, of course, there's something just outwardly toxic

688
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,480
in there like dioxin-based bleaches and things

689
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,820
like that.

690
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,620
There's a long list of that, but it's

691
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,920
avoid the fragrances.

692
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,320
So keeping it moist, keeping it wet, and

693
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,160
wrapping it tight.

694
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,140
This goes for cuts and burns.

695
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,960
With burns, it's very popular.

696
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,380
Most people know about this already.

697
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,240
I've gone into the skin a little bit

698
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,560
very quickly.

699
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
If it's a dry spot, wet it.

700
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,720
If it's a wet spot, dry it.

701
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,960
With drying a starch, if you have a

702
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,460
wet spot on the body, which I don't

703
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,960
really see many topical things being wet unless

704
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,120
the skin is broken, some kind of a

705
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,880
starch, even cornstarch or flour would be the

706
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,860
best to draw that out.

707
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,820
Don't get into mineral powders.

708
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,640
They will burn.

709
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,540
So again, just to so far where we

710
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,520
are is relax the body, demagnetize the body

711
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,460
with a quick rinse.

712
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,380
And the ginger on skin bumps, a pimple

713
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:25,580
or acne or a mouth sore, and wrapping

714
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,300
things tight, of course, and using a salve

715
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,920
or wetting it down as well.

716
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,160
Now, one thing I also want to just

717
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,920
recap because I want to make sure people

718
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,840
are doing this correctly.

719
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,260
When you have a cut, for example, and

720
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,700
it just happened and you happen to be

721
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,960
somewhere where there's a napkin or some electrical

722
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,260
tape or something, even a rubber band or

723
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,340
something to wrap it tight, do so immediately

724
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,860
because it's the first 15 minutes that determines

725
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,660
whether it's going to heal in 24 or

726
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,920
36 hours or 72 hours or longer.

727
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,180
You want to make it as tight as

728
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,140
possible without hurting yourself, meaning if it's on

729
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,940
the finger, after 10 minutes, if you look

730
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,280
at your finger, it'll be numb and purple.

731
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,440
Let it out mostly so you get circulation

732
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,180
again and then put it back, but not

733
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,720
as tight.

734
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,300
And then let it out again after a

735
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,040
half an hour or 15 minutes again and

736
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,400
put it on again, not as tight, but

737
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,600
it should always be very firm, firmer than

738
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,020
just like bandages to stay on, even a

739
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,220
bandage should be firm.

740
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,520
In this case, you want it more firm

741
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,800
than is usually considered application of a bandage.

742
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,360
And that's how you would have it dressed

743
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
for the first day.

744
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,220
I don't think anyone is actually dense enough

745
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,600
to make it so tight that it's like

746
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,380
a tourniquet, but the idea is the tighter

747
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,460
it is, the more it will prevent signaling

748
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,020
to the body that there's an injury.

749
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,740
There's something that the body does that facilitates

750
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,140
an injury.

751
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,260
It tells, it's kind of like when if

752
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,880
there's a car accident and you call it

753
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,860
in, they're going to send someone, you know,

754
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,020
the police or fire department or whatever to

755
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,040
come check it out, right?

756
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,820
So when you, and then they show up

757
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,880
at the scene, the body does something very

758
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,300
similar.

759
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
If you wrap it very tight and say,

760
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,880
it's going to be fine, it doesn't send

761
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,200
that crew out to the injury.

762
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,020
And that crew is basically swelling, right?

763
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,200
Because it will create swelling of the tissue

764
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,820
around the wound to prevent any more loss

765
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,480
to the body.

766
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,980
But that defense mechanism also prevents the cut

767
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,500
or the bruise from healing quickly.

768
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,140
So the entire thing is to not call

769
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,860
the 911 of the body or not allow

770
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,400
that call to take place, right?

771
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,300
That's the whole purpose.

772
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,740
And also, of course, the rudimentary explanation of

773
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,460
the vacuum, maintaining the vacuum in the body.

774
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,080
So those are a few things or things

775
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,300
that I do often, and I don't think

776
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,100
I've ever discussed them in that order or

777
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,940
any order on how I, you know, these

778
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,460
are things that I always consider.

779
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,940
I'm frequently considering when I'm in discomfort or

780
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,520
feel a discomfort or the things that I

781
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:09,740
mentioned.

782
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,980
It's basically the quick wrapping, the ginger is

783
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,540
always on hand and the washing.

784
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,880
The other thing that I wanted to mention

785
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,940
also, which I do often, but especially when

786
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,860
I'm doing a hard labor kind of thing,

787
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,260
if I have to cut a bunch of

788
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,420
things and fabricate something and whatever, and I

789
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,440
don't do that often, and I get sore

790
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,920
and tired.

791
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,740
Especially if you're doing something where you're standing

792
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,560
up often or do a lot of walking

793
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,360
and you're not used to it, your legs

794
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,120
will be really sore and after a day

795
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,000
or so you don't recover.

796
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,920
Or any part of the body, general, it

797
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,240
might be general body soreness, like general upper

798
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,840
body soreness or general lower body soreness.

799
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,860
What I found works best to relieve that

800
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,900
is elevating the legs and literally like lay

801
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,720
down in bed, in a bed or couch

802
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,440
that's, or the floor that's near a wall

803
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,420
and just put your legs up as high

804
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,820
as possible with your back to the floor

805
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,380
and your legs pointing upward.

806
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,740
Doing that as a therapy for just even

807
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,780
five or 10 minutes twice a day will

808
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,360
relieve any kind of soreness in the lower

809
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,780
body.

810
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,460
What's interesting again, I speak a lot about

811
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,180
energy flow and whenever you feel a soreness

812
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,080
in a certain area, especially if it's going,

813
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,900
if it's the direction, you reverse the direction.

814
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,800
So soreness in the lower body, reverse the

815
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,920
lower body so it points up, right?

816
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
And that will relieve that.

817
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,020
And of course there's a very chemical, mechanical

818
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,980
side to that where, well, of course, Greek,

819
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,200
you know, if you lift the legs, the

820
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,420
circulation, all the blood flows out of it

821
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,540
and the lactic acid flows out of it

822
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,360
and all that, yes, that happens to a

823
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,820
degree.

824
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,460
But because remember, it's moving in a vacuum,

825
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,940
right?

826
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,840
It happens to a degree, but it also

827
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,680
creates a potential change where the energy on

828
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,000
the, especially on the left side of the

829
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
legs would be directed more towards the ground,

830
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,420
even on the right side is directed towards

831
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,699
the ground, but everything on the right side

832
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,560
wants to go upward.

833
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,480
Directing them upward, the bottoms of the feet

834
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,080
upward and the legs upward, there's things called

835
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,400
inversion tables and all that.

836
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,280
You don't need to get anything like that,

837
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,719
just simply even laying down diagonally on a

838
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,360
couch and putting your legs over the couch.

839
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,920
I found that relieves any kind of lower

840
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,600
body soreness, even lower body back pain, anything

841
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
like that from doing heavy lifting or work

842
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,320
that you haven't done or a long walking

843
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,260
that you haven't done in a while, if

844
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,840
you're, let's say, not out of shape or

845
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,760
not done something that you're not fit for

846
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,840
doing normally, inverting the body.

847
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,100
Likewise is true, by the way, if someone

848
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,739
spends a lot of time laying down and

849
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,780
they start to feel miserable because of that,

850
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,380
well, what's the remedy for that?

851
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,860
Stand up and walk around a little bit,

852
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,220
right?

853
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,200
And they usually feel better.

854
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,380
So the inversion principle, I find that I've

855
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,360
been doing that recently.

856
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,960
I've been doing some heavy lifting and things

857
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,360
and rebuilding machines lately.

858
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,700
And I'm like, man, I feel like crap.

859
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
So even today, I spent 15 minutes with

860
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,360
my legs up in the office.

861
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,340
I have a small futon.

862
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,740
I just put my legs up against the

863
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,960
wall and in the living room on the

864
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,360
couch, both 15-minute episodes, and I feel

865
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,900
refreshed and it's been hours.

866
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,780
So again, just these are the simple things

867
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,020
that I practice often.

868
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,440
And I wanted to share them in some

869
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,080
order so y'all get a feeling of

870
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,680
what I do and how effective this might

871
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,260
be for you.

872
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,060
And I hope it is.

873
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,220
So again, these are very simple things and

874
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,780
I'm looking forward to doing more of these.

875
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,200
I have tons and tons and tons of

876
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,860
things to say.

877
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,660
If anyone senses any delay, because I feel

878
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,800
like I sense a little bit of delay.

879
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,780
I've just been busier than normal and I

880
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,220
just don't have the energy to sit down

881
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,640
in front of the computer and do a

882
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,060
recording.

883
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,140
So this is an apology.

884
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
In other words, an explanation where I would

885
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
have liked to do things more frequently, and

886
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,000
I will in the near future.

887
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,880
In the meantime, again, simple remedies, figure mid

888
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,300
-season, peak of the year sort of, bring

889
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,820
this forward and hope everyone and anyone finds

890
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,420
this helpful.
