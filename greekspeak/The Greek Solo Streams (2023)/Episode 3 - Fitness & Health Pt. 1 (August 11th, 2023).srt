1
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay, so I want to talk about fitness,

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,580
and by the way, it's been a long

3
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,880
time since we've done anything, or I've done

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,740
anything, because what makes Greek speak so good

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,180
in some ways is that it's extremely focused,

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,180
and maybe because I get so extremely focused,

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,540
I'm on some extraordinary project, plural.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,700
Stuff that is inappropriate for this society is

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,400
lawful.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,520
Some would know it has to do with

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:52,820
water.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,560
Yeah, so again, the apologetics aspect of this

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,080
is that I am so focused that time

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,220
goes by so fast.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,280
I'll be working on something, even thinking of

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,680
something.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,740
Let's say I look at the wind-up

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,600
toy known as the clock.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,420
It's 8 a.m. Ten minutes seems to

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,840
go by.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
I look at the clock, and it's 3

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,480
p.m. It's like, how can I have

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,300
such a time shift?

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,660
So speaking of time shifts, we got together,

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,940
perhaps for some adult supervision or Archon supervision,

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,840
and you mentioned you wanted to talk about

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,540
fitness, and that ties in with a lot

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,820
of things that I've said, but I've never

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,940
spoken on it directly.

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,060
No, certainly.

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,820
I think that your previous stream was about

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,980
simple health remedies, and I thought a continuation

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,260
could be fitness.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,700
The last one, almost a month ago, was

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,180
not necessarily just remedies.

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,520
It was very specific about things that I

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,940
do on the fly, rapid application.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,380
What I wanted to do is just kick

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,980
over to the listenership.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,880
Things that I normally do, almost on a

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,900
daily basis or recurring basis, based on what

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,700
I find works, and I take a lot

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,180
for granted.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,300
We all do, and when I share these

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,240
with other people, they're automatic to me, and

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
they're so simple, but when I share them

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,700
with others, they've never heard of it, never

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,200
even were inclined to think of it.

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,040
So I was like, wow.

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,120
A simple one is avoid all chemical.

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
These are not remedies, but the thing about,

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,020
I always put in a fluid for cleaning

53
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,620
or application, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, aqueous argentum.

54
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,740
I always stick a spray bottle on there.

55
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,160
You know, on the plastic bottle you purchase

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,880
from a shop.

57
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,640
If you don't have that, your only other

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,460
option is to what?

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Pour it out, which is very inefficient.

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,340
If you have a bottle with a liquid,

61
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,740
you're going to pour it out, other than

62
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,660
a potable wine, water, juice, or whatever.

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,720
You're wasting it.

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,060
You don't need that much liquid, and in

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,740
the meantime, what you do is you end

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,380
up replacing all these harsh chemicals and cancer

67
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,380
-causing chemicals with natural things like hydrogen peroxide

68
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,240
and alcohol for around the house for cleaning,

69
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,360
and anyone and everyone that I've ever mentioned

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,880
this to, since I've been on this planet,

71
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,740
since I've been doing it, does not do

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,040
that, and I take it for granted.

73
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,160
That's like totally normal to me, and I

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,040
found that, well, maybe let's nix that part,

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,500
normal.

76
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,160
So again, what I shared the last time

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,020
were immediate things that I do and have

78
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,440
been doing for decades that other people are

79
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,940
not aware of, and I just wanted to

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,540
push it along.

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Another example with that, just not to stay

82
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,300
on this for too long, dishwash liquid.

83
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,060
A very domestic thing.

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,620
People have dishwash liquid by their kitchen sink,

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
and they wash dishes, and they find that

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,780
they have to replace it every month or

87
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,400
several weeks, and it's not the cost, it's

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,240
the efficiency here, but if you dilute that

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,580
with water and put it in a spray

90
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,440
bottle and spray your dishes with it, let's

91
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,540
say mostly water, if you have, let's say,

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
an ounce of 16 ounces of water, a

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,960
half an ounce of soap, you're going to

94
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,840
realize you're not buying dish soap for like

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,160
six months to eight months now, right?

96
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,580
That's a big savings of $3, right?

97
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,360
No, you're being efficient, and you're actually using

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,960
less water on the other end, and I've

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,820
never been to anyone's house that does that,

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,560
ever, right?

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,660
So for me, it's like the most trivial,

102
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,820
non-thinkable, hey, here's a word, non-thinkable,

103
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,360
that I think can help others.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So there you go.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
Fitness.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
Let me just dive right into that.

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,300
You know how many times I've been brought

108
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,280
into a call regarding health, and I just

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,200
yell out a bunch of pejoratives and tell

110
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
people how stupid they are for the 1500th

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,120
time?

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,220
There's no such thing as health.

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,000
There is no perfect health, as a matter

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,420
of fact.

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
They say that when you're born, you start

116
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,900
dying.

117
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,300
Well, it's not really true.

118
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,880
You have incredible regenerative abilities up until about

119
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,660
three months old.

120
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,820
Most people don't know that if you cut

121
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,880
off the last digit of a baby's finger,

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,380
a young baby, it'll grow back, right?

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,860
You have incredible regenerative properties, you know, the

124
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,160
eight-day circumcision, you know, massive coagulation abilities.

125
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,180
So yeah, but you start dying pretty, you

126
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,620
know, you don't regenerate as often as one

127
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,600
can.

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
There's many reasons for that.

129
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,620
So where's the health if you're on a

130
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,100
downward slide since you passed adolescence here?

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,340
So the real issue about health is what

132
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,040
fitness level do you want to maintain?

133
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,440
Ah, fitness level.

134
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,880
We just said we wanted to talk about

135
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,300
fitness.

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,760
And what fitness level?

137
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,420
So you have various levels of health.

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,900
Hey, look, I just bought a bicycle, and

139
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm going to ride that bike ride, you

140
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,700
know, that little bike ride called the Tour

141
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,640
de France next week?

142
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,080
You could say that all you want, but

143
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
what is the possibility that you're going to

144
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,780
achieve that, even if they let you in?

145
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,420
In like 0.3 seconds after the race

146
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,740
starts, you'll be dropped, right?

147
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:51,940
Why?

148
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,580
Because you have a bicycle and you decided

149
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
to ride in the Tour de France or

150
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,640
because your fitness level isn't up there, right?

151
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,260
So the same thing with extreme sports or

152
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,480
the high end of sport performance is what?

153
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,240
Fitness level.

154
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,180
And it's also mental fitness, right?

155
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,380
So someone says, I want to be healthy.

156
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,980
For what?

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
Climbing Mount Everest next week or in a

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,740
month or in a year, let's say.

159
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,780
Let's be more reasonable.

160
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,260
People don't say I'm going to go climb

161
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,580
Mount Everest anytime soon.

162
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,060
They say in my lifetime, let's say.

163
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,420
And I'll prepare for it over a certain

164
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,340
amount of years.

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
That would be the more rational cogent statement,

166
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:28,880
wouldn't it?

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,660
So let's say you take someone who is

168
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,580
reasonably, let's say goes to one of these

169
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,420
quacky doctors and they get a clean bill

170
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,600
of health, they call it, right?

171
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,220
Do you think that if you suited him

172
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,120
up and had him trek up Mount Everest,

173
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
he would fare well?

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,980
Not at all.

175
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,660
It would be farewell, right?

176
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,660
Because there's specific conditioning that's required, specific levels

177
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,780
of fitness, endurance, blood chemistry, respiratory fitness, cardio

178
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,940
fitness, all this stuff that must be focused

179
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,280
on, trained and achieved.

180
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay.

181
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,960
Well, anyone listening that says, yeah, Greek, you

182
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,280
know what?

183
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,980
We know that.

184
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,900
But you don't.

185
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,920
This is what you don't know.

186
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,220
What you don't know is that you're taking

187
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,200
it for granted that there's some utopian health

188
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
condition that you're going to pursue by eating

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,520
something or doing something or thinking something.

190
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
And I'm telling you, it does not exist.

191
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,460
It does not exist.

192
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,360
You must entrain the body with the conditions

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,860
that you are going to want to follow

194
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,580
through as the ultimate test or performance level

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,420
that you want to measure it by.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,860
Very simple.

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,260
Okay.

198
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,280
So let's give a typical scenario, an office,

199
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,000
pretty latent individual, not overweight, not quote unquote

200
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,880
latent with, by the way, I was going

201
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,400
to say disease.

202
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,080
Most of these ailments that you hear from

203
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,460
the medical community are fictional.

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
If not all of them, you've heard of

205
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,040
diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer.

206
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,660
Those are all fictional medical fictions.

207
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,360
They're controlled by the legal system, which is

208
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
a presumptive fiction.

209
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
How many times have you heard the doctor

210
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,400
says, well, legally, I can't do that.

211
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,040
Well, legally, I can't say that.

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,640
I said, damn, are you an attorney now

213
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,080
or what?

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
So it's all fiction.

215
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,980
There's very few things that in fact harm

216
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,540
the body.

217
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,200
When in fact really harms the body, it's

218
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,060
an inability to recover on many levels.

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
So let's go back to a latent individual

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,539
that has quote unquote an office job.

221
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,620
And they know that if they eat right,

222
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,260
whatever that means, and they exercise, whatever that

223
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,360
means, they'll be healthy, right?

224
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,179
So let's take a short cross section of

225
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,440
that.

226
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,140
Let's say he just does his latent office

227
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,040
job, sedentary office job.

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,620
And he doesn't do the other things.

229
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,260
And then he begins doing the other things.

230
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,560
And you ask him, do you feel better?

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,780
Yeah, I feel much better eating right and

232
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,560
exercising.

233
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,320
I feel much better.

234
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
But you can only quantify that so much.

235
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,140
It's purely qualitative.

236
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,400
So there is a qualitative and quantitative aspect

237
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,880
to this.

238
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,300
For example, you can in all your heart

239
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,760
and mind want to climb Mount Everest.

240
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,340
But quantitatively, if you don't have the quantitative

241
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,300
physical fitness to do so, all the mental

242
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,200
rigors in the world, you could actually drive

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,900
yourself into a heart attack, right?

244
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,860
Before you even get two thirds of the

245
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,280
way up.

246
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,240
It's plausible you can make it two thirds

247
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
of the way up, by the way.

248
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,460
You know, the last tenth of climbing Mount

249
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,940
Everest is harder than the other nine tenths.

250
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,220
By the way, what's even more difficult than

251
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,840
Mount Everest, I keep bringing that up, is

252
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,340
K2.

253
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,520
It's the mountain next to it.

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,440
It's not as tall, but it's much more

255
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,000
treacherous.

256
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
So how do I know anyway?

257
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
One thing about this, this, oh, I call

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,520
it microwave.

259
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,120
Well, I call it out of a can

260
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,700
society.

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, when people want to eat, they

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,740
get a prepared meal, they just open the

263
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,560
end, which they conveniently give a Ziploc reseal

264
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,900
for or they open a can.

265
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,240
And that's it.

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,260
You know, you're done, right?

267
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,380
Your dinner's ready, mom, right?

268
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,500
Or, you know, soup's on, right?

269
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,040
I mean, right?

270
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,360
You know, the American white people think, yeah,

271
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,320
eat out of a can.

272
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,100
That's it.

273
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,060
The eat out of a can mentality does

274
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,640
not work.

275
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
And what follows through with that eat out

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
of a can mentality are the pitfalls of

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,160
an eat out of a can idea of

278
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,020
health and fitness.

279
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,920
So then Greek, let's just say this on

280
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,420
the third party.

281
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,860
Would you say that there is no such

282
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,300
thing as fitness unless you're specifying fitness for

283
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,580
what level of performance?

284
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,940
And I'm not going to answer that because

285
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,160
the answer is in that question.

286
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,680
No, of course.

287
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
I think that perhaps some of the reason

288
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,340
for people's erroneous perception of health is that

289
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,620
we've seen over the last 15 years quite

290
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,600
an upswing in people partaking in fitness culture

291
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
as a form of pseudo religion, where it's

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,680
really mostly about psychological comfort over biological benefits.

293
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,840
And all kinds of schools of thought have

294
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,420
come from that.

295
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,280
As somebody who was a former cycling athlete,

296
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,520
what sort of things did you learn early

297
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,440
on about fitness that perhaps would have been

298
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,940
unintuitive to the average person?

299
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,020
Adaptability through repetition, repetition.

300
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,300
In other words, you want to get really

301
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,340
good at cycling, spend hours in the saddle,

302
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,700
do a lot of it.

303
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Now, of course, there's why do you reinvent

304
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,800
the wheel?

305
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,500
But you will actually learn things that you

306
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,200
think you came up on your own or

307
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,240
invent things, but were actually done by others.

308
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:28,780
Why?

309
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,000
Because the bicycle is pretty similar to others

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,880
and their body is very similar as well.

311
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,080
So you're of course going to come up

312
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
with similar things.

313
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,360
But there's an aspect of coaching and training

314
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
where you get the information up front and

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,860
then apply it.

316
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,700
But nothing is a substitute for experiential rigor,

317
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
meaning hours in the saddle if you're going

318
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,020
to do cycling.

319
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,200
Then, of course, there's personal proclivities.

320
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,540
Some people might be built for power, for

321
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,880
power and might be good sprinters.

322
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,740
Other people have a light frame and good

323
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,280
endurance and good for climbing.

324
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,360
So there's a specialist aspect that is shown

325
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,480
in football, like in American football, right?

326
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,960
You have all the different positions.

327
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,620
The linebackers are very big and bulky and

328
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,520
slow, good for blocking or penetrating a defensive

329
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:11,960
line.

330
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,640
Then the running backs are very light, fast

331
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,880
and nimble and have good finesse and agility.

332
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,760
Then the quarterback, who's all about timing, has

333
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,660
a good arm and can take a blow

334
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
and take a hit and repeat the move

335
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,740
in the next play.

336
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,960
We have lines of scrimmage and just like

337
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
the goal, that's inevitable in any of these

338
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,460
games.

339
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,280
It's pretty meaningless.

340
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,960
It's just a score card, isn't it?

341
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
To me, all sports, except for cycling and

342
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,980
a few others, are just a bunch of

343
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,780
people in uniforms chasing a ball.

344
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,020
I think most Americans, by the way, won't

345
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,040
get into cycling because it requires a lot

346
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,020
of cerebral concepts of knowing the team and

347
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,020
knowing the characters, kind of like chess in

348
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,260
a way.

349
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,840
You know how each player in chess or

350
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,240
each piece has its own maneuvers.

351
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,940
So cycling is very simple.

352
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,780
You'll see a cyclist, oh, this guy's known

353
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,380
to be a sprinter, watch out at this

354
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,120
part of the race, or this guy's known

355
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,680
to be a climber, watch out for him.

356
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,020
See, I wouldn't fully discount American sports that

357
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,320
much.

358
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,060
Maybe I feel kind of unsympathetic to the

359
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,960
population perhaps.

360
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,540
But anyway, I would say that repetition goes

361
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,700
both ways.

362
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,600
For example, let's take the latent individual that

363
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,700
has an office job and they get into

364
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,500
eating right and exercising.

365
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,560
In the beginning, it's going to feel different

366
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,220
and odd.

367
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,220
But if they do it more and more

368
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,880
and more, their body will build around such

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,860
rigors and such behaviors that it will change.

370
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,880
They'll look really fit.

371
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,640
So if you run into them, they'll have

372
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,280
clear skin pretty much and a fit body.

373
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,720
And you wouldn't guess that they sat out

374
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,540
of the office for eight hours a day,

375
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:00,800
right?

376
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,220
What I'm trying to get to here is

377
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,520
there's more to intent.

378
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,300
There's the qualitative and qualitative aspect to intent.

379
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,280
It's what you're going to do.

380
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You must structure and design based on what

381
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,700
you desire.

382
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,900
But also, here's the thing.

383
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,000
When I gave the example of the latent

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,260
office worker who says that I will be

385
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,040
more healthy, quote unquote, if I eat right

386
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,980
and exercise.

387
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm using stuff that they say on television,

388
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,640
by the way, deliberately.

389
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,560
If he pursues that, that's by design.

390
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,340
That's by his intent.

391
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
Here's the other thing.

392
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,700
You ready for this?

393
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,700
Even if he pursues the conventional stuff they

394
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,780
put out for the NPCs and the normies,

395
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,300
which would what?

396
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,200
What would be eating right?

397
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,520
Less fat, less meat, less processed food, right?

398
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,460
And what would be exercise?

399
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,040
Walking, perhaps going to a gym, swimming, jogging,

400
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,080
stretching, even one of those dummy loads, which

401
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,860
is a treadmill or a Nordic track or

402
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,360
a weightlifting machine, which is a dummy load,

403
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,560
by the way, a dummy load in its

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,280
engineering sense.

405
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,160
Even if they just follow the stuff that's

406
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,540
put out by convention, they will fare much

407
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,680
better than someone who does not engineer their

408
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:11,960
life.

409
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,380
I'm not saying that the conventional route is

410
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,920
right because it's full of traps that they're

411
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
not aware of.

412
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,660
Avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its

413
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,100
existence.

414
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,940
So ergo, let's say this, quote unquote, healthy

415
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,720
person goes to a lazy, greedy doctor and

416
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,840
tells him that he has high blood pressure

417
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,380
because he has a fictional imaginary system known

418
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,960
as whatever, you know, blood pressure metrics are.

419
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,700
And they get them on medication, starts damaging

420
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,140
the liver, and now their blood sugar is

421
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,620
out of whack.

422
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,580
So now they have type one diabetes, which

423
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,140
none of these things exist, by the way.

424
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,080
And now further damage to the liver from

425
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,980
pharmaceuticals creates type two diabetes, where they need

426
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,640
to be later on on kidney dialysis and

427
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,620
they die from it.

428
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,340
Right.

429
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
So that's a very dangerous protocol to pursue,

430
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,100
where in essence, the man that never had

431
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
high blood pressure or diabetes, there's no such

432
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,500
thing as diabetes, by the way, or blood

433
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,800
sugar.

434
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,180
Blood sugar is something where the liver triggers

435
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,420
the pancreas to release insulin because of hydration,

436
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,480
either dehydrated or just hydrated or for foods

437
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,580
that tax the liver into such a modality,

438
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,320
just like I've gone into.

439
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,860
You know, there's no such thing as AIDS.

440
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,300
Only no one has died of HIV except

441
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,380
for those that took the treatment because the

442
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,860
treatment is a epithelial apoptosis suppressor.

443
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,020
It's an enzyme that when they give it

444
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,100
to the body, it tells the body that

445
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,760
cells have been replaced when in fact they

446
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,100
haven't.

447
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,940
So you wither away.

448
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't know if people have seen the

449
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,280
movie Marathon Man in the 70s with Dustin

450
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,000
Hoffman, but in the end, it's around a

451
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,620
diamond dealer and he's an ex-Nazi concentration

452
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,420
camp doctor that experimented on the prisoners.

453
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,760
And towards the end of the film, Sir

454
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Lawrence Olivier, I think, towards the end of

455
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,620
the film, he's out in the Diamond District,

456
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,380
which is a very Jewish neighborhood in Manhattan

457
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,900
in the 40s off of 7th Avenue.

458
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,220
And some of his victims are walking the

459
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,339
streets pointing him out.

460
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,440
Now, this is never going to happen in

461
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,940
this society.

462
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,720
You have so many AIDS researchers.

463
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,680
And this is not off topic, by the

464
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:21,839
way.

465
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,180
So many AIDS researchers and disease and diabetes.

466
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,580
And when the people thank them.

467
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:27,980
Right.

468
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,680
So you're in really deep trouble as a

469
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,120
society.

470
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,460
Very, very detailed.

471
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,620
It's not going to end up like you

472
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,240
think for that.

473
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,760
And it must be the society must.

474
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,440
And it needs to be reset.

475
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:39,900
Right.

476
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,340
So the other thing is there's a website

477
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,060
called Soft Underbelly.

478
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
And they interviewed this.

479
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,100
The dirtiest cop in history in New York

480
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,560
was in the 90s, was arrested because by

481
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,980
the feds for helping out the drug dealers.

482
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,220
Right.

483
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,040
And he thinks he's still a bad guy.

484
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,940
Oh, my gosh.

485
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,680
And he should.

486
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,120
He was a good guy because he was

487
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,720
a good cop.

488
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,560
He doesn't know.

489
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,260
That when the country went to an unlawful

490
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,060
money system, which it did, you know, fiat

491
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,500
currency.

492
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,480
That the bankers had paper means they own

493
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,440
City Hall and they demand most of the

494
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,540
buildings and cities and they demanded crowd control

495
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,340
for their own private property.

496
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,780
So they developed police forces.

497
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,120
Right.

498
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,120
Police forces developed by the bankers to protect

499
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,420
the prop their properties that they had debt

500
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,800
on.

501
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,080
Right.

502
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
Note carried notes on.

503
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
And anything that morphed into the legal system.

504
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,200
And he doesn't know that the police are

505
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,100
there to defend an unlawful money system.

506
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,220
And the only reason he got in trouble

507
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,440
with dealing with drug dealers is because he

508
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,640
didn't have a license to do that.

509
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,040
The unlawful money system in the society that

510
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,700
procures that all they do is what's called

511
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,760
the underworld and all the darkest things in

512
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,460
the world, you know.

513
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,960
So how do you get this information out

514
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,360
to them?

515
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,780
You know, I told this lady, you know,

516
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
serial numbers today.

517
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,300
I was in commerce on the money comes

518
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,660
from birth certificates and other things.

519
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,680
That's impossible because these serial numbers have been

520
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,020
on for years and there was no Internet

521
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,600
back then.

522
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,780
Oh, my gosh.

523
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
You know, so so we get a similar

524
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,460
reaction speaking to the cop or the person

525
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,040
who is diabetes, high blood pressure, by the

526
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,980
way, or AIDS there, you can't get through

527
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,240
to them.

528
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,460
And this misery continues.

529
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,980
You know why?

530
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,280
Because they have children and then they put

531
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,020
that on their children.

532
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,640
Right.

533
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,140
So how does this connect with fitness and

534
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,360
health?

535
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,180
That's the mental fitness part, because look how

536
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,880
simple it is.

537
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,020
OK, again, the office worker, latent guy decides

538
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,700
to eat right and exercise and he will

539
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,000
look better and be healthier following the convention.

540
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,380
Right.

541
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,360
But here there's something waiting for you.

542
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,780
A greedy, incompetent doctor that tells you you

543
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,280
have high blood pressure puts you on medication

544
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,860
as such.

545
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,540
And you decide to take it damages the

546
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:52,740
liver.

547
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,940
Now you're diabetic, which is no diabetes, by

548
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,360
the way.

549
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,560
You just have liver damage.

550
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,820
And then that further on cause then you.

551
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,180
Right.

552
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,700
You see that.

553
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,500
Oh, then cancer.

554
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,160
Then the body starts to put up roadblocks

555
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
to stop the the energies created by all

556
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,980
this chemistry.

557
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,500
And they call it cancer.

558
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,500
You start removing parts of his body.

559
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,980
And then none of those things exist, as

560
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,440
they say.

561
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,400
Right.

562
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,380
So do you see how even though he

563
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,280
wanted to pursue something he says, even though

564
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,820
an office worker who is pretty latent and

565
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
decides to, quote unquote, eat right and exercise,

566
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,460
like they say on television, do you see

567
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,580
how how susceptible he is to the second

568
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,600
scenario that I mentioned?

569
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,120
Very susceptible.

570
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
So it's a mental discipline.

571
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,200
It's a qualitative discipline.

572
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,840
And what are the chances of all these

573
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,520
conventional people that work in an office that

574
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,100
want to eat right and exercise?

575
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,400
What are the what are the chances that

576
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,980
they will fall for such a scenario?

577
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,440
Very, very high.

578
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,600
Right.

579
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,560
So think about it.

580
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,800
There's there's there's there's a lot that one

581
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,220
has to know to pursue anything.

582
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,140
And hopefully, even though I don't get much

583
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,720
reaction to Greek speak, I think I'm the

584
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,400
only one speaking on these things ever.

585
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,880
I probably will be.

586
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,840
And we just have a very small, partly

587
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,420
people to support it, which I'm grateful for.

588
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,120
And it seems like it's it's that's it's

589
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
that's where it's going to stay.

590
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,160
So I would consider it very highly privileged

591
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,000
forms of thought and very highly privileged information,

592
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
not because I'm saying it, it's because it's

593
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,840
so simple and so easy to apply.

594
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
And it could actually, quote unquote, save more

595
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,540
time on your life.

596
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
You know how they say save your life?

597
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,380
No such thing.

598
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,900
Save it where?

599
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,200
Save time.

600
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,460
So you'll have more events to experience, perhaps.

601
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,640
And that's all I have to say for

602
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:40,980
today.

603
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,440
Thanks.
