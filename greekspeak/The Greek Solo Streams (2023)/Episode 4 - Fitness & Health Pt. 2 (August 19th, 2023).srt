00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,680
Greetings and welcome to the Greek Speak Patreon

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,100
streams.

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm the Archon, and as was mentioned on

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,740
the last episode, the launch of the solo

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,900
streams have coincided with a period of increased

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,140
workload for the Greek and I, which served

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,940
to stymie a few things progress-wise.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,300
So we've decided that it would help to

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,560
return to the previous format with me in

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,480
the co-pilot chair.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,780
It's still going to be about the Greek

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,380
sharing his insight on certain topics and I

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,420
won't be as long-winded with my questions

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
as in the Greek Speak podcast.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,820
So Greek, I thought we could do a

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,040
part two on fitness and health because I

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,120
had some follow-up thoughts to some of

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,300
the things you said before on the previous

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,640
stream.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,360
I was wondering where in the fitness realm

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,560
one tends to find the practices that are

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,040
most optimal for conditioning strength and form because

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,300
if you look at something like bodybuilding, it's

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,000
not uncommon for some of the physiques to

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,660
take on like an unnatural or overworked form

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,500
that's more about pageantry than performance, whereas if

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,220
you look at long-distance running, they have

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,540
great conditioning but sometimes very brittle, almost sickly

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,940
forms.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,060
So where in the fitness world have you

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,200
seen that you find this more optimal balance

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
between aesthetics and performance?

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,240
There is none because it's too subjective.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,580
An example with cycling, you mentioned runners and

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,340
bodybuilding, I'll cover that, but with cycling you

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,640
end up looking like an insect or Mr.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,340
Potato, very thin limbs and an expanded chest

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,900
cavity, so your torso is very expanded up

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,380
to the shoulders, your lungs go all the

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,380
way up to the clavicle to your shoulders

41
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,640
and if you want to see someone as

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,900
a natural cyclist, they have a very expanded

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,400
chest laterally, not front and back like a

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,940
bodybuilder, very wide and the lungs come way

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,300
up into the shoulder area.

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,600
In terms of runners and bodybuilders, just to

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,960
address each one quickly, the bodybuilding aspect should

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,420
not be taken on as it's thought of

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,100
conventionally with weights until you've exhausted the physique,

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,280
development of the physique through calisthenics, which would

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,800
be isometrics and push-ups, sit-ups, pull

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,180
-ups, basically manipulating your own bodyweight.

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,660
That will allow more of a general build

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,640
-up in bodybuilding and then you're supposed to

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,560
go to the gym with specialized movements with

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,520
weights to build up on the areas to

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,620
sculpt the body, right?

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,480
Literally bodybuilding is, you typically would be building

59
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,380
a specific part of the body to match

60
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,900
the rest.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Really, that was the initial idea when it

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,700
came into fruition more in the 60s and

63
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,700
70s, where before the 60s and 70s, it

64
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,860
was just calisthenics and lifting weights and whatever

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,480
development the bodybuilder had was their development and

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,960
then later on it became sculpting.

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,780
So if someone naturally exhausted the calisthenics and

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,880
they were very developed in the physique but

69
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,080
they had small calves, let's say, they would

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,760
go and just find an application in a

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,340
gym that would work on the calves to

72
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,580
make them look slightly more proportionate, right?

73
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,280
A little larger.

74
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,680
That's the concept of bodybuilding and then, of

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,700
course, steroids and all that.

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,020
In terms of the runner, the runner is

77
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,860
strictly endurance.

78
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,700
They don't expand their chest cavities as much

79
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,920
as the cyclists do because of efficiency, because

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,340
of just the tear-down on the body

81
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,280
and the runner can vary in many, many

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,800
ways.

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,920
There's short-distance runners, which would be sprinters,

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,840
very powerful-looking and the long-distance runners

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,300
would be very thin and they do not

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,160
develop like other sports because it's a different

87
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,820
application.

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,980
But the fitness aspect that I wanted to

89
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,020
discuss is not necessarily particular to any particular

90
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,360
sport, actually.

91
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,200
It's just to the fitness mindset.

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,880
Yes, you did touch on that quite a

93
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
bit on the last one.

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,620
I think for the last five, six years,

95
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,220
I've seen a lot of talk about the

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,300
role of intensity and reps in people's fitness

97
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,839
practices.

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,300
So basically, it consists...

99
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,720
Oh, I'm going to stop you there on

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,520
this side because that's information, stock information that

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,580
you get from going on to whatever research

102
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,940
out there in the world.

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,640
I want to give an example where I'm

104
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,340
going to stop you there.

105
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,460
For years, when I was into cycling, I

106
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,260
noticed that most accidents happened when people mounted

107
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,760
or dismounted at very low speeds.

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,280
And it's true.

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,320
The insurance statistics for motorcycle accidents was 60

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,240
% of motorcycle accidents happen within two days

111
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
after they buy a motorcycle, right?

112
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,780
The newbie concept, right?

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,740
So I started doing something called a speed

114
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,840
class and safety class for cyclists and basically

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,100
how to mount and dismount and how to

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,040
lean a bike, how to store a bike,

117
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,000
how to brake properly, how to steer properly,

118
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,280
right?

119
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,920
These are basics.

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,560
And anyone who took them, even semi-pro

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,540
riders, came back and said, wow, I never

122
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,280
thought of these things.

123
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,120
And when you explain it the way and

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,720
bring it forward, I can now technically know

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,860
why I'm doing it versus everyone doing it

126
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,680
their own way, right?

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,620
Well, very successful with that, very successful with

128
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,000
the speed class, how to be 40, 50

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,800
% faster in just 20 minutes of coaching,

130
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,160
right?

131
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,120
Which was a class.

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,220
So I had amassed hundreds of techniques regarding

133
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,780
cycling.

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,540
And when the internet, this is in the

135
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,920
early to mid to late 90s, internet comes

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,840
about and I'm still discussing these things up

137
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,620
until the mid 2000s, right?

138
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,000
Tens, 2010s.

139
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,200
So I started doing research online about the

140
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,840
things that I discussed on the speed class

141
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,660
and the safety class, right?

142
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,560
Absolutely nothing.

143
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,160
Not a word, not a book, not a

144
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,600
class.

145
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Not a course, nothing at all.

146
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,000
Mom, about almost all the points, pretty much

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,780
all the points that I discussed for almost

148
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,720
20 years in the classes that I gave.

149
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
How can that be?

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,840
How is that possible, right?

151
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,680
These are very, very basic things in how

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,140
to approach.

153
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,340
So when fitness comes into play, I tend

154
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,460
to have my own spiel about it, right?

155
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,080
And unfortunately, I can create an insurmountable body

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
of work based on it that is very,

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
very unique, but works really well, right?

158
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,500
So I want to just stay on that

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,840
course, if that's all right.

160
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,460
I just wanted to give that phenomenon a

161
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,000
try on the Sonic here, just to state

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,900
that as fact.

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,300
The things that I used to expound on

164
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,960
in the classes I did with cycling cannot

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,240
be found online or in books anywhere.

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,120
And it's phenomenal.

167
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, well, the first thing the enterprise

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
individuals say, well, guess what, then?

169
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,760
You need to do a website, videos or

170
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,380
a book, right?

171
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,440
That would be the first thing people want

172
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,740
to say if it's so unique, right?

173
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,420
And but I'm saying that these things are

174
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,060
so simple that it confounds the mind to

175
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,560
think that we're on a planet with all

176
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,140
these people and it's not being done.

177
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
So that's how I also want to approach

178
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,740
fitness.

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,660
And the things that you expounded upon in

180
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,340
these classes, were they applicable across various types

181
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,840
of physical activities or was it specifically cycling?

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
Specifically cycling.

183
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,860
They were so specific to cycling and yet

184
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,360
so simple about cycling and the individual that

185
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,500
it was almost silly and stupid to hear

186
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,660
it because it was so obvious.

187
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
And one of the Greek slogans, the Greek

188
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,240
speak slogans, is discovering the obvious one day

189
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
at a time, right?

190
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,660
Or no one's paying attention and the last

191
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,000
thing to discover is the obvious.

192
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,460
But, you know, they were they were more

193
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,240
expanded on based on, you know, observation and,

194
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,880
you know, the way Greek speak goes here.

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,780
Let me just bring something up about fitness.

196
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,140
It's strictly programming.

197
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,060
It really is.

198
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,980
Other than now, let's put aside natural fitness

199
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,860
abilities, right?

200
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,280
Because, you know, the body types mesomorph that

201
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,320
they classify endomorph, ectomorph, right?

202
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,060
The muscular, the skinny and the fat body

203
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,400
type.

204
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,700
Right.

205
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
I don't buy into that.

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,180
I buy more into I suggest more there's

207
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,840
a genotype.

208
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,880
But, yeah, those are the types that that

209
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,440
are people are, let's say, blessed or cursed

210
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,679
with.

211
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:32,919
Right.

212
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,500
Depending on your society.

213
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,140
First thing I want to say about fitness

214
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,820
is there's an element of experience with it.

215
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,919
I'll use cycling again, running or any any

216
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,320
sport.

217
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,720
If you're a newbie in a sport and

218
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
you develop a certain fitness level and which

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,320
means you're performing better and better and you

220
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,680
reach a certain level and then you want

221
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,580
to expand on that, you increase your fitness

222
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,500
level and technique of the sport and you

223
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,460
do it for years and years.

224
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,560
If you stop doing it and pick that

225
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,940
up again, whatever that fitness, whatever that sport

226
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,960
was, let's say this doesn't have to do

227
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,440
with sports.

228
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
It could also be with someone's vocation or

229
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,240
occupation.

230
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,660
Right.

231
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,300
Let's say a carpenter or frame or roofer.

232
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,580
Right.

233
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,880
Or UPS driver or something, something physical.

234
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,760
But let's say you stop doing it, something

235
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,880
you've done for years and develop technique and

236
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,100
physique and fitness.

237
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,500
When you go to pick it up again,

238
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,160
it'll only take you 30 to 40 to

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,180
50 or 60 days to get back almost

240
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,520
to the level where you were at your

241
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,620
best, where someone who just entered the sport

242
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,940
or that activity would take much longer.

243
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,820
So there's an aspect of memory that one

244
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,380
retains when they gain a level of fitness.

245
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,800
For example, when I stopped bike racing, there

246
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,620
was a bike racer around.

247
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,000
I was talking with, speaking with, he was

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,160
in the Pan American Games.

249
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,680
He was older.

250
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,380
And we were looking at these newbie cyclists

251
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,540
coming in trying to get fit.

252
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
And you see, you see these guys only

253
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
been riding for one or two years.

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,320
But you and I get on a bike

255
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,620
and train for two year, two weeks or

256
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,780
three weeks and kick their butts.

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Because in two or three weeks, well, right.

258
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,340
We have memory.

259
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
We remember what it was like.

260
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,620
So now the thing is, there's a thing

261
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,420
about chalking it up to muscle memory.

262
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,200
Right.

263
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,500
I don't know if you've heard that term.

264
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,540
I don't think it's that.

265
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,220
I think it's more of a a mental

266
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,720
memory, literally memory that you have on how

267
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
to apply one's body.

268
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
And of course, this can also go into

269
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,240
the emo work.

270
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,760
So when I say fitness is programming, it's

271
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,580
strictly that just like health.

272
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
What level of fitness do you want to

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
have for what you know that you could

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,720
be in the health category?

275
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,040
Right.

276
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,960
Just to recap, do you want to have

277
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,540
be comfortable at a sedentary job for eight

278
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,660
hours a day or do you want to

279
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,480
climb Mount Everest?

280
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Those require two different levels of fitness.

281
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,900
And that's where health is basically determined.

282
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,040
We've taken the word health and used it

283
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,360
to bid someone well, good health.

284
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,280
Right.

285
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,180
And it's cheapened it and taken it out

286
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,240
of context on how it can be useful.

287
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
And then people just rely on their culture

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,500
or their social relationships or education on whatever

289
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
topic to manage what they think is, quote

290
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,340
unquote, healthy, which is doesn't work most of

291
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,720
the time.

292
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Actually, it never works because they don't know

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
why they're doing what they're doing.

294
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,320
Right.

295
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,900
So fitness, just like health, is a program.

296
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,260
What is a program?

297
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,620
It is a deliberate use the computer analogy

298
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,100
in computer as a programmer.

299
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,600
There's someone that sets down a deliberate code

300
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
or protocols or language based on a language

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,460
for something else to function by.

302
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,760
So in terms of fitness, you would do

303
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,360
the same thing.

304
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, ergo, when you go to the gym

305
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,220
and you get you hire a coach, what

306
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,780
do they give you?

307
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,540
A fitness program.

308
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,920
You know what?

309
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,340
You should do this every day.

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,940
Eat this.

311
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,220
Right.

312
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,060
Right.

313
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,980
Get this much sleep.

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,860
They give you a program.

315
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,940
So let's say you pick a sport, any

316
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,280
sport.

317
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,620
Right.

318
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,440
You find out what that sport requires and

319
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,040
what the general aspects are, and then you

320
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,860
go and see what you can do or

321
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,820
want to do within that sport and apply

322
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,700
what level of fitness you need to achieve

323
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,980
to perform that sport.

324
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,120
Right.

325
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,360
But remember, I mentioned earlier, there's something called

326
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,680
memory that once if you take a pro

327
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,640
that's retired and you put him in a

328
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,540
training regimen of any sport, within a very

329
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,340
short period of time, he'll be better than

330
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,420
the novices that would take years to get

331
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,000
to that point.

332
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,620
So that's where the memory is.

333
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,800
And I'm suggesting that the memory is not

334
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,880
this muscle memory that when I've discussed this

335
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,080
with people, it's actually part of the program

336
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
that all the weaknesses and strengths have been

337
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,960
ironed out and you know how to apply

338
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,280
it.

339
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,000
Right.

340
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,800
Just almost like when you download a browser,

341
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,540
it asks you what color do you want

342
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,120
to pay your personal preferences.

343
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,840
So the memory is actually you've already applied

344
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,400
your personal preferences to optimize the program.

345
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,620
And the program is obviously diet, it's rest,

346
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,600
it's what's called fitness conditioning, exercise, working out

347
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,180
and all that.

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,620
So in essence, with fitness, the better the

349
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,080
program for you that you apply based on

350
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,660
your what you know about yourself, the more

351
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,140
successful you will be and also try to

352
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,480
get as much information as possible from those

353
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,520
that are highly experienced in that particular field

354
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,120
or sport.

355
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,140
Right.

356
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
But there's a problem there.

357
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,860
There's a problem that humans have.

358
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,960
It's called communication.

359
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,520
Like I mentioned earlier, I used to do

360
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,400
two classes, a speed class and a safety

361
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,440
class, and I can't find a stitch of

362
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,300
what I taught in those two classes in

363
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,220
a book, in a video online anywhere, anywhere.

364
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Right now, I haven't sifted through everything on

365
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,280
the planet, but I have been vigorously looking

366
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,040
since then.

367
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,740
I stopped a few years ago for a

368
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,080
long time and asked people.

369
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,680
So let's say so we have a little

370
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,460
bit of a problem here because people are

371
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,300
not communicating.

372
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,380
So if you want to get into a

373
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,760
sport and you read about what people have

374
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,200
written about the sport and how to get

375
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,840
into shape about it, yeah, I hopefully it's

376
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,520
not as bad as the cycling thing that

377
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,960
I mentioned.

378
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,300
Right.

379
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Because those two classes I teach are extremely

380
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,820
effective.

381
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,800
So you're going to have to be very,

382
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,180
very smart about it, literally, because a lot

383
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,000
of that memory that allows you to bounce

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,120
back once you've stopped that fitness level is

385
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,980
how smart you were about it to yourself.

386
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,360
And the oh and this is a this

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,140
is a big, basic problem.

388
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,800
And it's a communication problem.

389
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,640
The other thing that I've noticed is that

390
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,040
when people do things, they want to enjoy

391
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,460
themselves.

392
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:49,940
Right.

393
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh, my gosh.

394
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,000
What did you what did you just say,

395
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,240
Greg?

396
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,740
Right.

397
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
They want to enjoy themselves.

398
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,280
So what does that mean?

399
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,320
They usually practice and engage in things that

400
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,900
they're good at doing more than things that

401
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,080
they're not good at doing.

402
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,480
Right.

403
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,880
That is the biggest mistake anyone can make

404
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,700
when they want to increase their fitness level.

405
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,800
What I mean by that is when I

406
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
used to go on training rides and coach

407
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,120
people on cycling, for example.

408
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,300
What will we be doing?

409
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,020
A course that was uphill, downhill turns and

410
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,440
all kinds of, you know, variable course on

411
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,480
the road and the people that were good

412
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,740
at climbing hills, we got to the hill,

413
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,940
they took off and the people that were

414
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,960
good at downhill maneuvers, we got to the

415
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,980
downhill, they took off.

416
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
And when it got to the flats and

417
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,640
sprinting, the people who are good at sprinting,

418
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,480
they took off.

419
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,960
So I was like, what is everybody doing?

420
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,580
We're a training ride.

421
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,780
Why are you sure?

422
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,240
Why are you practicing and training what you're

423
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,100
already good at?

424
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,060
You should be practicing what you're not good

425
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,340
at right now, you see.

426
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
So when we got to the hill climb,

427
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,780
instead of the hill climbers leading the way

428
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,800
and taking off, we got those that were

429
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,080
not good at hill climbing to lead and

430
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,520
pressure them into seeing how far they can

431
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,200
push themselves and also improve their technique.

432
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,120
So what I find is that people like

433
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,280
to enjoy themselves when they're doing just about

434
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,140
everything and they forget that one of the

435
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,920
things they should do is to train their

436
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,460
weakness and use their strengths for competition or

437
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,660
when they or when they needed to achieve

438
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,140
something.

439
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,420
Right.

440
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,620
They overuse their strengths and they forget about

441
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,260
their weaknesses.

442
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,440
And that leaves a big open weak weakness

443
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,520
in their performance typically, you see.

444
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
So in essence, when you're going to increase

445
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,700
your fitness level on anything, find out what

446
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,260
let's say categorically, let's say it's a sport.

447
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,860
It doesn't have to be a sport, by

448
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,240
the way.

449
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,940
But find out what you're not good at

450
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,480
within that context and work on that.

451
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,020
Make sure you dedicate in your program more

452
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,720
time or a more proportionate, disproportionate time on

453
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,300
the things that you're not good at.

454
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,260
Right.

455
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,420
So very much like learning, if you're not

456
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,339
good at math and let's say you have

457
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,300
to do three hours of studying a day,

458
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,980
you're good at language and you're good at,

459
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,660
let's say, science, but you're not good at

460
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:18,960
math.

461
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,640
I would focus two hours plus on the

462
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,660
math and 45 minutes on the other things

463
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,700
instead.

464
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,220
You see.

465
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
No, certainly that makes sense.

466
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Speaking of you've made a few different mentions

467
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,620
of mindset and perhaps that alludes somewhat to

468
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,560
mental ability.

469
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Also, I do wonder in what ways does

470
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,380
fitness influence mental ability?

471
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,340
Because when I look at the intellectuals of

472
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,260
the 16th to 20th centuries, it doesn't appear

473
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,680
that slothfulness or obesity affected their ability to

474
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,140
contemplate or philosophize.

475
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,620
So you can be fat and still be

476
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,440
somewhat intellectually capable.

477
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,700
Yeah.

478
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,700
No, again, it's programming.

479
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,440
It's what, how, you know how I mentioned

480
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,860
the three body types, mesomorph, ectomorph, endomorph.

481
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,520
Are you blessed or cursed with them?

482
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Right.

483
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,420
Depending on what society and culture accepts.

484
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,640
Like, for example, in some cultures, even today,

485
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,080
if women are thin, they're considered to be

486
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,540
unhealthy.

487
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,480
If we're in certain cultures of women are

488
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,340
overweight, they're considered to be unhealthy.

489
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,060
Right.

490
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,880
So, you know, it's a matter of culture.

491
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,340
Yeah.

492
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,940
I think that there's a correlation between certain

493
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,520
senses, like people who lose their eyesight, get

494
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,000
more acute taste and hearing.

495
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
And, you know, also people who lose their

496
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,120
hearing, their sight becomes more acute.

497
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,380
Right.

498
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,600
I think with the senses, there is an

499
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,200
acuteness that develops with those that are left

500
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,220
in the senses that are left intact to

501
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
compensate in a way.

502
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,280
But with a physical body, I would say

503
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,580
it's very subjective, too subjective.

504
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,320
But in essence, if I were to even

505
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,800
just sum up the sonic right now is

506
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,560
people are spending this.

507
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,260
People could take this the wrong way, but

508
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,240
it's a contemplative thing.

509
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,440
People spend their time wanting to enjoy everything

510
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,720
they do, meaning what's easy for them, the

511
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,700
path of least resistance and what they think

512
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
and they know they're good at in performance.

513
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,580
And what I'm trying to say in terms

514
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,840
of fitness is find out what you're weak

515
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,060
at.

516
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,820
And I guess fitness would be mental as

517
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,680
well as you brought up and dedicate an

518
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,300
extra amount of time for that.

519
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,500
Not not because of you might be weak

520
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,960
in something that will never be used.

521
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,640
Also, you have to decide where you want

522
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,540
to dedicate your time.

523
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,160
But that's part of being a well-rounded

524
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,700
individual.

525
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,060
You know, there is an ancient Greek term,

526
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,220
Pan Metron Ariston, which is everything should be

527
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,240
measured to be, you know, Arista, which would

528
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,260
be high, let's say, you know.

529
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
No, thank you for that.

530
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,580
All right.

531
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,240
I think we covered quite a few things,

532
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,160
so I'm quite happy with that.

533
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:56,880
Good.

534
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,800
I think the point the point is was

535
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,020
made in a Greek speak fashion.
