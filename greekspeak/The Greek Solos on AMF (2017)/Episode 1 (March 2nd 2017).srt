00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
Greetings everyone and welcome and this is a voice you might have heard before and it might be the only voice you hear for the

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,890
Next two hours on American Freedom Radio, and it's the Greek and if you heard me before it's with others

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:19,610
And which are greatly appreciated by the way, and we're gonna give it a shot. I'm flying solo here on American Freedom Radio and

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:26,590
Perhaps maybe without a co-host maybe the listener can be co-hosted on this as well

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,710
We'll see you we're also going to consider

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,770
Having some sonic input from whoever is listening, so we will somehow

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,390
Give you a Skype convention and a telephone convention, but this is also known as uncommon radio, so

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,550
Anyone out there. Thank you for coming, and this is also going to be archived on American Freedom Radio

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,760
and we will see how this project flies and

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,840
Perhaps you've heard Greek speak before perhaps you have not but either way we're going to be giving it a

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
solo kind of thing

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:10,280
Here on American Freedom Radio and also a courtesy website where you can get archives and other ways of getting in touch with the Greek would

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,520
be

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,200
uncommon radio

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,060
calm

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,040
so let's let's maybe get into it before we

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,220
Discuss anything or bring up anything for discussion perhaps. We're going to do

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,940
Give out the call-in numbers for those who might be curious just from the beginning and the call-in number would be

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,580
218 area code three three nine

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,480
eight five two five and for a Skype convention you would pretty much use the

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,240
Uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,100
the whole thing

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,680
As the contact or you could put in the Greek and Skype and scroll down until you see uncommon radio

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,260
And that would be the one so for the Skype it would be uncommon sense radio one

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,440
that's a numeric one at gmail.com for Skype and

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,979
You could send a contact request if you would like to participate so just getting that

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,820
Idea that this is still open for anyone to call in

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,920
Because this is radio folks, and this is not a podcast as some might refer to it

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,220
It is just what we call radio, and it's live radio, and that's what makes it exciting so

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
with that out of the way

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,820
Again greetings everyone, and I will be looking at the chat room as well for any other input if it's so available

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,360
And I have emails open which you can contact the Greek through uncommon radio.com

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,380
So and here we are this is the solo flight

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,200
sort of an impromptu very

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,340
Or not introduced pretty much said let's keep the same time slot as Ocelli and the Greek was and we'll pretty much

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,280
Keep this sonic. Let's say event going I've gotten quite a few emails all positive by the way

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,620
people

38
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,580
Pretty much stating what they've gotten from listening to Greek speak or what the Greek has been reporting on over the years

39
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,300
And it's all been very positive

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,360
And and when I say it's been positive in no way is it ad hominem like well Greek

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,740
I really like the way you're saying it or I like you or whatever none of that stuff

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,120
it's all been very objective very straightforward based on the quality of the report and

43
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,380
Why why give a good report?

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,760
You know that's that's another we're probably get into discussions about

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,400
Things like that and if I'm monologuing it's not going to be much of a discussion unless you folks want to participate

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,880
But on the in the inside thinking of this of doing uncommon radio and continue it on AFR was

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,260
pretty much spurred on by

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,960
the end of the last

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,800
project with Chuck Ocelli there was a

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,660
Pole sort of taken by the Greek I'm speaking a third person here about perhaps

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,900
Having a project like a members area or something more private, and this is just a convention that I've noticed

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,660
Throughout internet world or internet or in a net world where people are offering things

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
On a merchant level

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,180
I've also stated

55
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,760
Directly and indirectly I find it to be somewhat distasteful

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,280
Not because it is but personally I find that and one of the things is not to share up too many personal

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,740
opinions or ideas

58
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,720
But the reason why is because these reports and the reason why they've been done and the Greek has been let's say calling in

59
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,640
years ago into radio shows and participating in let's say public forums about

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,220
not necessarily questioning things, but actually just bringing up a point of view and a mindset and

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,680
this this point of view in this mindset perhaps should continue and and

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,280
There was a desire for it to be done perhaps in the convention that people see on the web

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,320
Many hosts and many other venues do a certain paid members area or something

64
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,100
And and the thing is that there's nothing wrong, and there's it's actually very apropos to have good and fair exchange now

65
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,060
Let me just share this

66
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,560
What's going on behind the scenes in terms of evaluating that?

67
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
What the evaluation was is

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,070
Pretty much setting up a members area on uncommon radio where people now can go and access more like in-depth information

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,860
things that maybe were

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,940
Considered not to be set on a public forum and all these other things etc. Etc

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,220
And I actually started

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,740
Procuring something like that

73
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,520
I realized there was a massive amount of time to do and it should be done in audio format by the way

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,880
I mean treatises and white papers and reports can be given

75
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,300
But really it's best to have things that are written read out loud and what a better way other than audio format

76
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,120
So just not to get into any more detail. It seems like to be more of a project than the Greek wanted to get into so

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,100
Why why why not just continue let's continue perhaps on AFR as we are now and on common radio

78
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,720
At this time slot and consider it a members area and just as an example

79
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,540
I really do appreciate by the way all of the private emails about people

80
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,260
Wanting to do some kind of an exchange or send something this way, you know

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,960
Monetarily quote-unquote, you know their credits and their efforts, but we're gonna do a little experiment because this is a

82
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,900
an experiment before the experiment I mean

83
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,040
Before

84
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:50,260
Uncommon radio develops a private members area or or something like that that people are used to seeing and quote-unquote paying for using that

85
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,200
common terminology

86
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,040
Before that we're gonna try it just an AFR. So anyone that's listening that was pretty much inquiring

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,480
About a special project, you know things that are special, you know members area or something that they can buy into

88
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
What I am asking and

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,320
Suggesting and requesting is to buy into AFR right now

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,190
if here's the thing guys, and this is a private conversation done in public if the Greek comes on and

91
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,020
like tonight and there appears to be

92
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,880
Donations being made to AFR because of this request or let's say consider this the members area then it might be worth it

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,540
For the Greeks actually shell out whatever credits and you're needed and actually get into the supplies meaning manpower

94
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,800
people power woman power and all that other stuff to actually assemble a more elaborate section on uncommon radio, but

95
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,140
just as a litmus test if

96
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,440
not really holding anyone to their desire what they've expressed on joining or

97
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,580
But but indirectly, yes

98
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,380
If you hear this even on an archive go ahead and send a donation of some sort

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,880
To American Freedom Radio you will find how to do that on the home page and put a little mark on there that it was

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,800
Because of the Greek or whatever. It doesn't matter that you that you actually put in that was for the Greek or whatever

101
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,920
but I'm gonna use it and communicate with AFR if there has been an

102
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,280
Influx of some sort then

103
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,580
Everyone who stated they would like to join something that is more in-depth or something that is more in the convention that they're used to

104
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,460
Seeing on the Internet

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,780
Then it might be done. Otherwise

106
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,900
If there isn't a lot of action that way

107
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,360
But would just be clear monetary action towards AFR something being sent in

108
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,260
To AFR to just see how much of an effort can be made even indirectly

109
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,600
Because if there isn't then this will be the members area this particular show

110
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,460
Uncommon Radio open for all to hear now the wonderful thing about it. Is that when people join these members?

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,220
Areas or they feel like a sense of exclusivity

112
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,660
Okay. Well, you know, it's like I'm getting it because I'm paying for this or something, right? That's that's all well and good

113
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,920
but to do it openly right now just to see what kind of a

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,300
Feedback week is gotten from this particular

115
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:18,860
Show on Common Radio on AFR if there is an influx and then then it shows that there could be an investment behind the scenes

116
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,040
So actually develop that because I'm really not going to want to develop it

117
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,940
Turnkey, like everyone else does it's going to be something very interesting

118
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,520
But in the meantime folks if you're listening even on an archive send a donation to a farm

119
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,160
We will evaluate what the the listening public

120
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay is capable of throwing towards a sonic project known as Greek speak or

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,300
something like uncommon radio or this type of venue this type of

122
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,020
Discussion where things are discussed

123
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,240
Well dummy load free perhaps should we say and we'll get into more of the mindset and the and what?

124
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,520
Quality of discussion and things are how things are evaluated and discerned on this planet

125
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:07,820
But in the meantime just to kind of throw this out to everyone listening in a private way that this is going to be

126
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,980
Sort of the quote-unquote members area for the Greek right now

127
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,940
and then you might say well that sounds kind of like an oxymoron because the private area you get a

128
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,380
Password and you go in and then you know

129
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,640
You get this sense of exclusivity and wait a second. This guy's just talking on air. Anyone can hear it

130
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,980
Yeah, but the interesting part of that is the best way to keep a secret is to put it in public

131
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,260
Right. So if you believe that you're comprehending what is being said here and actually listening and not just hearing

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,840
You're going to get more out of it than anyone. That's just hearing what's being said because the whole idea is about mindset

133
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,280
so we're gonna do this little experiment and I'm inviting you guys and gals out there that if

134
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,120
based on the responses again that the Greek has gotten an uncommon radio about perhaps doing

135
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,900
More exclusive project or a quote-unquote members area or private area or a project like that where it's quote-unquote paid as a

136
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,700
Term is used for an exchange of something right now. Let's see what can be done

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,280
by sending it to AFR and

138
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,880
Okay, is this a beg of fun for AFR? Is this a fundraiser for AFR?

139
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,180
No, it's not but on the other hand it is because they can use it and here's the thing. I

140
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,740
always

141
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Kind of like give a little disclaimer the disclaimer for it this

142
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,480
Particular sonic project would be clearly this that the views expressed expressed by the Greek are not

143
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,140
Expressed by AFR or the hosts and they used to put that in quotes not even close. This is very very very unique

144
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:46,260
The reason I'm at AFR is because I'm at AFR and it's it's a really really looking at it objectively

145
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,080
It's you know, it's it's fine. It's great. It's a it's easygoing and

146
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,480
It's a it's kind of a cool place. You know, it's it's simple

147
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,040
It's it's not pretentious

148
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,120
So that's you know, I'm just happening to be here

149
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,400
So again just to tie things back

150
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,540
Let's do this little experiment with all the requests again about somehow

151
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,540
Supporting the Greeks efforts in a private or more private exclusive area go ahead

152
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,920
Let's see. What kind of support can be garnered with just uncommon radio on in public right now on this same time slot as you

153
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,120
as you hear so we'll see how that

154
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,840
proceeds or if it doesn't because to actually put any project together it takes an effort and quite a bit of

155
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,620
How would you say?

156
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,560
Expense and the expenses, you know that the time as well

157
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,020
so

158
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,320
Let's just see how that pans out and again feel free if anyone this is a

159
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,740
Feel-free if anyone so desires to call in

160
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,320
Again on the Skype, it would be uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com

161
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Is the contact it's the email as well and the one is numeric and perhaps let's see on the call-in number

162
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,380
It would be two one eight area code three three nine eight five two five

163
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,320
And let me tell you folks when you get over about a half a century or so the body

164
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,620
No matter how good your vision is it starts to kind of you know

165
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,320
Peter out a little a little unfocused. So I get the little cheaters on and also there's an email where I could be directly responded to because

166
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,020
basically

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,980
Whenever you typically heard the Greek speak before it was either at a roundtable or a co-host and doing little

168
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,220
Joint venture sonic projects and this one is going to be solo. So and there's nothing planned

169
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Basically

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm talking to the monitor talking to whatever's in the room. I'm here alone and and to you folks

171
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,520
So the any requests of any topics or a or any subject matter can be brought up. Of course

172
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,000
This is AFR there. There is no limitation on that

173
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,040
So, please consider that just to reiterate again. I want to thank everyone that has supported at least, you know

174
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,500
So the support being garnered

175
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:11,020
Spiritually meaning by the mind or through intent and spirit by the way is intangible, but it's just a pure information

176
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
Was all very positive and it has been so far

177
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,740
Because the the people I think get a sense I've had discussions with people in there

178
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,720
Even those that are not familiar with what the Greek speak is about a Greek speaks about typically

179
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,700
when they kind of

180
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
hear the point of view

181
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,800
They say people are ready for that, right? And I'm like, well, it doesn't really matter

182
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,420
Does it I mean if they are or not?

183
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,260
The thing is you have to discern is it the time to say it because sometimes it might be the right time to say something

184
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,440
But the people are not ready to hear it and I believe that that's still the time period

185
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,680
one thing you'll see on the uncommon radio site is

186
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,440
Basically discussing the obvious of things that were things that are and things to come

187
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,480
That kind of sounds you know, you know, how do you how do you place that how do you figure out what that means?

188
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,920
well, you just sit back and and use some discernment and listen now one thing that uh

189
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,200
If you've heard the Greek speak before is one of the main things is discernment. Can you discern?

190
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,640
So can you discern the times, you know the times that you're living in, you know, the fashions the culture the trend

191
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,860
Can you discern things in the material world the natural world, can you discern?

192
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,300
Conversation, can you discern relationships? Can you discern basically?

193
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,820
On a qualitative level and that has always been the point or the crux or the crossing point between the quantity and the quality

194
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:50,740
You know, you ever notice how things are mentioned whether they're in positive or negative light a quantitative figure is given

195
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,760
Like for example when Hollywood does a film, oh this film made a hundred million this weekend, right? Okay

196
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,480
What is it? So there's that doesn't say anything about the quality of the film, right or you know this particular, you know

197
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,980
Lecture only ten people showed up, you know, it's like that doesn't tell you if it was a good lecture or not, you know

198
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,460
So the see these things are being done

199
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:22,060
Maybe they're out of time and out of place where people still have not really prioritized

200
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,350
What what level of discernment they should be operating on and it seems like the default in the universe is

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,340
materialistic or numeric

202
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,420
Whenever there is a lack of discernment. It seems that

203
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:40,120
You fall back on numbers big numbers mean it's good small numbers means it's not very good

204
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,780
In one of the things I used to do in terms of big numbers and small numbers

205
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,080
Here's a little discernment thing. I was on before I think about a year ago doing another project on AFR and

206
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Coming on repeatedly

207
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,760
one of the things I want to do is like bust biblical cliches a lot of cliches that people use that you will find in

208
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,320
in the various

209
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,180
Versions that you have but it was not in the original language of preservation

210
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,520
So one of them was that you know

211
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,619
the I'll paraphrase here the road to destruction is wide and the road a certain road a good road is very narrow and

212
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,380
Straight narrow as they say so, you know that has never really been explained. It just gets kicked around

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,560
That is by the way, if you if you read that in context

214
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,180
If a big if you will find that is a point of discernment based on quality

215
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,240
Not on really a big road just being a big road where it's easy

216
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,920
Well, what you might state it was and there's the narrow road being difficult

217
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,640
That's not the context that it's in the context that it's in is how the how the quality of the road

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,260
Exists and say and how its travelers travel on it. For example a very large wide road

219
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,980
Let's just think of these big metropolises that have these superhighways with six lanes in each direction

220
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,300
You've got a lot of litter pollution they may or may not be well-maintained it's dirty

221
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,740
Uncourteous so on right you get the picture now

222
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,340
That's from an engineering perspective. Let's say a very large road will end up having that kind of condition now from an engineering perspective

223
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,100
If you're going to design a road that is very small or short

224
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,400
or a narrow road

225
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,080
That will because it's going to be traveled by very few you have time now to plant roses, okay

226
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,980
You have time to make it well manicured pave it really well

227
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,480
Maybe have maybe have a scenic view and have it well maintained

228
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,720
So the whole thing about the road being narrow and straight as it's translated

229
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,860
Or the version it doesn't mean that it's rigid and unpleasant. It actually means that it's more pleasant. You see so

230
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,800
One one that is perhaps maybe giving an example of

231
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,620
Things that maybe should be discussed because it seems like the easiest way

232
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,820
To pretty much get into the mindset and discern the mindset is to start by looking at the things that you're used to

233
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,200
What are you used to hearing and saying and there's a lot of cliches?

234
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,380
That are you know biblical. Let's say I'll just use that term because it's easy or scriptural and

235
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,660
But by the way folks there I've said many years ago that what you will see is going to be an increase of interest in

236
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
What's called spirituality?

237
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,180
whether it's a

238
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,100
mainstream conventional religion matters biblical matters

239
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,820
Of any what's called really even even in the New Age II

240
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,780
Stuff you know there's just I don't even know what to call that

241
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,500
I mean like the light people and the psychic people and all this there's going to be a less

242
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,400
Drive towards materialism and more of a drive towards the things spiritual or of the mind now not because

243
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,780
People are materialistic and have mastered that in any way not at all because people that are dubbed

244
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,360
materialistic are hardly masters at that at all because if you were truly materialistic and

245
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,980
That means you would be perhaps on a mastership level

246
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,440
Why aren't you complaining that you liquids are being stored in flat-bottom boxes?

247
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,120
Where it's pretty obvious in the material world that all liquids are in an ovoid shape so and it goes on and on and on

248
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,400
So being dubbed spiritual or materialistic that again doesn't give you the quality of that particular category

249
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,340
But to go back to the aspect of the mind

250
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,380
The discernment and the mindset

251
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,080
there's a

252
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,020
Tremendous lacking in a qualitative way. Yeah, I'll give you folks an example since this is radio

253
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,680
And you might not just be listening to the Greek you listen to other radio

254
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:50,000
Have you ever put on either mainstream or to alternative radio podcast videos and a certain subject comes up?

255
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,240
and it's usually

256
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,760
Typically with the big subjects regarding spirituality the universe of the gods or God they usually say all this other stuff

257
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,780
You ever hear them when they say well, you know God or the universe or whatever

258
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:11,740
Or hey, you know, it's it's your soul your spirit or whatever or it's this or that or whatever or you know

259
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,520
or okay, whatever you hear a discussion where a description or a point is being made whether you know, it's

260
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
somehow

261
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,780
Something that can be defined and is being conveyed in the conversation and the whatever is thrown in there. Guess what?

262
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,920
Guess what?

263
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,240
That person is just very happy to have the mic and you don't and that's about it

264
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300
And you could you know read into it or read out of it what that means?

265
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,900
You know like whatever dude, you know, whatever, you know God or universe or whatever people say the universe

266
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm like the universe empty space mostly we talking about or the soul the spirit whatever. What are you talking about?

267
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,060
Those are two different things

268
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,400
You know, it's like grab the car keys in the orange or whatever

269
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,080
What are you talking about?

270
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,880
The thing is now that

271
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:11,440
Nothing much has changed what's it what is truly amazing from an objective point of view is the stability

272
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,200
the stability of

273
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,800
The the level of how things are and yet people feel insecure which which rightfully they should

274
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,860
So, you know, we'll see how that

275
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:32,340
Pans out in the future because I've many times said there is about a another year left of this particular time period as it's known

276
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,440
So here is someone stated perhaps in a chat. There might be a question

277
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh

278
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,060
Perhaps mentioning would talk about the universe any chance perhaps. Yeah, of course

279
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,860
Now the universe is something that is one condition supposedly, but there's many conditions of it

280
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,900
Meaning that there is the scene and the unseen here. Here's the mindset aspect of it when it whatever

281
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,640
Anyone is going to approach any information

282
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,780
Okay, there's a mindset that's involved. How many times have you heard someone in passing or someone?

283
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,900
You know, you start bringing up like, you know, how many eggs are in a basket or like? Oh, man, you know, I'm not mathematical

284
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm not into math, right? They've already decided

285
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,820
On a mindset that you know, they can convey to other people communicate. Oh, I don't like math. Well, what's wrong with math?

286
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,680
Well, I'm not mathematical or if you bring up something regarding spiritual. Oh, I'm not religious, right?

287
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:33,800
So what does that mean? What does that have to do with you see it's there's there's a category for mindsets, right?

288
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,780
If you've ever imagined that you know, yeah, like I'm not mathematical or I'm not religious or whatever

289
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,540
What does that mean is so right away people are using that as a block or a shield?

290
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,800
Or it could be used for its advantage. Like someone says yeah, I like electronics, right?

291
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,100
So I have the mindset to look at circuits and rational things and logic and things like that, you know circuit paths

292
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,420
You know, okay. So, all right fine. So it works both both ways

293
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,920
now there's an interesting thing about the mindset of humanity and

294
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,660
How can it be objective if though if one cannot discern things for their quality and it's again just for their numbers

295
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,480
But again, the main thing here regarding what's called the Sun in the universe and all that

296
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Like I see here in chat. People are asking

297
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,060
Is it a heat source and you know

298
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:32,280
There's fun a heat source and all that the problem with this again having a discussion like this is what I've mentioned in the past

299
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,940
is I

300
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,980
Use the term moron, right?

301
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,540
That's a technical term and technically the term means someone who stopped developing at the age of 12, which is very lenient

302
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,320
most people that you will meet right if you are

303
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,460
Let's say on a path of discernment

304
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:58,780
You will notice that they're pretty much have their characters pretty much very much in common with what's called a nine to ten year old

305
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,680
Well know what I mean by that. This is not a put-down or pejorative of being condescending. Is that typically between?

306
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,060
when when the formative years begin

307
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,220
People pretty much have figured out that what it takes to know things and they stay on that path

308
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,780
When people hear new information

309
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,040
They pretty much attach it

310
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,940
They compare it to a filing cabinet that began developing around eight or nine years old and up until you know

311
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,220
Whatever time they decided to close that file cabinet. It was full

312
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,880
And whenever they hear information

313
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,240
They have to try to match it up with things that they've heard before

314
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,780
Right, and that's the biggest problem by the way with many researchers because if someone sets out to research something

315
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,100
Well, that's not really necessary in the state of affairs today

316
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:54,580
Why because research means to search it again to research it because most things have not been searched out once

317
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,460
anyway

318
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,100
so

319
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,200
This is a big problem for many people in in that field, you know, you hear about a lot of the you know

320
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,020
in the conspirology, for example

321
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,300
They're called researchers and scientific researchers and ancient document researchers or whatever

322
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,740
Archaeologists or you know, whatever is it being properly searched out the first time and

323
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,340
Once it has then it can be researched again

324
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,720
And I would suggest that things have not been searched out now going back to the

325
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,240
Questions about the universe and the Sun is it a heat source and all that? How can one have a discussion?

326
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,740
Regarding of what can be seen?

327
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,220
Right and what can be observed and objectified regarding these matters meaning looking up when someone you discuss

328
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,340
What is the universe or the Sun? It's like you're basically looking up

329
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,780
When the any information that's given is going to be compared to all the things that they've been

330
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:56,080
Taught already before it's the cognitive dissonance thing could kick in and all that. So the point here is can you see it clearly?

331
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,400
when when some let's say if you're asking a question regarding that how about

332
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,340
Maybe giving a little bit of an outline and what you've discovered that you can be known about it already

333
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,540
Right as a baseline, you know

334
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:18,120
You know, there's there's an example for of a trend that's been going on

335
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,580
Regarding the shape of the planet. Okay, if you want to call it a planet if it assumes one shape

336
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,880
Maybe it's not a planet if it assumes another and that is a moot point

337
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,380
For example, the reason I always bring that up. There's a moot point

338
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,300
I'll just say at the flat earth versus the globe or the round is because are you have you already mastered?

339
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,370
Being on the earth because to be a master on

340
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:47,260
Being on the earth. You have to master the movements of the Sun and the planets as such

341
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,280
When you're a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant, the Sun rises in the east and sets in the West. Have you mastered that?

342
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,380
Have you mastered that regarding?

343
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,800
Agriculture orientation of structures

344
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
So on and so forth, right? No because

345
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,700
perceptively

346
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,360
What you will see it's a geocentric universe, right?

347
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,700
That the everything is going around the earth and because of that perception

348
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,780
Well, if you for example understand or want to believe that the earth goes around the Sun

349
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,880
How does that help you? How does that information transfer back to?

350
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,920
What you see which is the Sun going around the earth, right and what's more important if you're going to master

351
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,020
The material aspect of being here in a body is the Sun rises in the east, you know

352
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:46,500
And sets in the West which gives the perception that it's going around the earth and it's important to master those movements now

353
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,280
Let's just throw this in because if you've heard Greek speak you've heard this again

354
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Don't even know what day it is. Do you right and that's a question

355
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,500
Why because seems like everyone is operating under a modality that I call the Pope's work schedule

356
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,980
The Gregorian calendar as if it's a timepiece and it's not let me just throw this in there folks

357
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,820
We pretty much had a 13th moon this year and it appears to be the 22nd of the 13th moon

358
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,540
So about noon wherever you are, and by the way, just to throw this in again, you know

359
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:22,120
How if you are in the Western Convention, you know as you are the northern part of the world

360
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,140
Let's say and you discuss things. Let's see Europe in America. You discuss things with

361
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,960
People in New Zealand Australia, let's say they're in tomorrow

362
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,920
They're actually not lawfully they're behind and if we've done measurements on that to show it

363
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,420
So so what's going on? There's a convention that's been overlaid over mankind and just to throw this in again

364
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,240
I didn't give a time marker on the Pope's work schedule will be March 2nd

365
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,100
2017

366
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,180
But lawful timekeeping, that's what the trees the birds the planets and all that

367
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,640
Operate on and in other words this day will be exactly the same day next year

368
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,680
It's the 22nd day of the 13th month and in fact of 13th month

369
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,060
And you may not have a 13th month next year, but you might have it in four or five

370
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,600
Let's say which is it's very interesting and I've never gotten into the 13th month

371
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,760
intercalation

372
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,280
So again, the question in the chat was regarding the Sun in the universe

373
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,960
That is a huge huge question

374
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,700
Okay, and actually missing okay being the question here perhaps is

375
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,880
Giving giving homework perhaps is the Sun a heat source, okay?

376
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,180
well

377
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,480
Yes, it is a heat source, but it's in a form of induction

378
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,860
It's not the type of heat that you imagine what let me just for the listeners that are listening to this in the future

379
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,160
an archive

380
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,860
It's it's a concept of induction. There's a glass stovetop by a few folks might have seen it's electrically powered

381
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,680
You have a pot of boiling water you move the pot of boiling water to the side you put your hand right on the

382
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:59,960
Stovetop it's room temperature. You put the pot of boiling water or actually the pot of water right on the induction top and it

383
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,480
Starts to boil almost immediately, so where is this heat coming from?

384
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,960
Most of the heat in the that we sense is coming from the Sun because it's directional when you feel it on the skin

385
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:17,060
It occurs roughly 150 miles outside of off the earth's surface, so I agree. How do you know that have you been there?

386
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,580
No, don't have to go there. You can pretty much see what's going on if you can see

387
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,900
Right now the thing is if the Sun is a heat source according to the laws of thermal thermodynamics

388
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,780
Which is the inverse square by the way if you understand the geometry of a circle and its radius you'll understand

389
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,900
They're the inverse square, but anyway and the surface of a circle or the sphere

390
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,440
You'll understand how the inverse square works. It has to do with a ratio a

391
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,240
Pythagorean ratio, let's say

392
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,140
but just to

393
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,280
Perhaps not answer because if you're they're asking the question or asking asking the answer if you're asking the answer

394
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,680
Another question might arise and that is why is it as you travel closer to the Sun?

395
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,060
Which is allegedly a heat source it gets colder and colder and colder

396
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,860
Right because what you're actually

397
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,400
Seeing when you see sunlight or heat is you're seeing the

398
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,780
Degenerative aspect of that source right just like electricity when you measure

399
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:29,540
Current and voltage that is a degenerative aspect the grounding aspect. It's the rubbish part of nature

400
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,780
Well, how can you say the Sun is rubbish? Well? It's not really rubbish

401
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,520
It's just the part that breaks down

402
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,760
into the material aspect

403
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,420
That is when I say material as we have the pressurized material aspect

404
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,440
now these are things that if there is inquiry we can get into it with a proper introduction because

405
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,420
Sometimes just looking at a chat and trying to answer a question is a pretty good

406
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,180
Way to keep a let's say a thought or interact with those that are listening

407
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,800
But you know another thing is perhaps is a light source well

408
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,480
Yes, it is a light source, but it is the moon a light source well

409
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:10,140
It seems that the moon is a light source is being written here of course, but it's secondary not primary. Uh-huh

410
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,400
right

411
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,680
There's a reflectivity there so again

412
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,660
There are so many things to discuss and folks there is a period of tension

413
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,880
I think I've explained in the past anyone's heard this kind of type of speak before

414
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,120
that will be ending in about a year and

415
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,960
And

416
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:36,840
To get off the universe in the Sun topic for a moment one of the things of discussion is that how man is agriculturally based

417
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,360
being agriculturally based agriculturally based doesn't mean you have to get dirt under your fingernails and

418
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,640
Wrangle a plow or a bull or an ox or work on a farm

419
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,620
It just means that your existence here is agriculturally based I once had a discussion with a computer programmer

420
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,800
He said Greece Greek. We're not agriculturally placed. I said, okay fine

421
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,980
I'll lock you in the room with the computers and see how long you can stay in there before you want to come out

422
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,380
For something that's agriculturally based now another way to perhaps state. You know earth inhabitants is

423
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,860
it's turned into a pig farm in a way a cross between a pig farm and an insane asylum and

424
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,179
this might be an interesting trough to come and feed off of because

425
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,800
Most people you'll notice by the way, don't really care unless someone's coming to take bacon off day back. So

426
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,080
Anyway, just thought I'd throw that in for you guys

427
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,960
Especially the you folks in the future that will be listening to this down the road

428
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,460
many of the questions by the way that are asked or

429
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,100
Require pondering and

430
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,460
There's a sitcom mentality or the light conversation

431
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:52,949
Basically that people are used to having amidst all the pranking that they've had already. But anyway, we'll get into that in the future as well

432
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,860
That quick things can be answered and decided

433
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,840
Concisely and quickly. Yes, they can be but again is the mindset there

434
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,760
How do you if someone has a mindset for example, like I'm not mathematical or I'm not religious

435
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,440
How can you bring up even a short discernible package regarding any of those topics if the mindset isn't there?

436
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,680
so the general mindset is

437
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,580
Not necessarily a problem

438
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:27,920
But it can be viewed at how it leads to the way people think and function on this planet, you know

439
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,920
so again, this is uncommon radio if anyone wants to

440
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,480
Call in we could we have someone running the board at AFR

441
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,220
And just to throw that number in again

442
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,460
Let's see, it's a 2 1 8 area code 3 3 9 8 5 2 5 and on the Skype convention

443
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,700
You would use the email for uncommon radio, which is

444
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,620
Uncommon sense radio 1 at gmail.com. It's kind of long and the number one is

445
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,460
Numeric so if you guys want to interact

446
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,740
But again, I want to thank AFR for you know, pretty much agreeing to

447
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,900
Continue some

448
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,420
Sonic let's say reports from the Greek

449
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,700
and continue this

450
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,540
At the same time slot as the previous venture went on or sonic adventure

451
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,000
I should say and for you folks that were not here in the beginning. I

452
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,380
Just wanted to mention a recap. I'm doing a little bit of an experiment. I've gotten a lot of emails and

453
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,150
let's just say correspondence regarding people taking interest in a members area and

454
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,550
Something more exclusive and the experiment in here is okay

455
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,190
let's see what happens if the Greek goes out solo and

456
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,150
Pretty much gives whatever he would give in a membership area for two hours a night once a week and just see how it goes

457
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,570
And if you folks think that it's worth anything

458
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,210
Should it be?

459
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:04,070
Let's just say fair exchange. I mean, are we merchants now? No, we're not merchants. Are we receiving a benefit? No, it's just credit folks

460
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,770
Send it over to AFR. You know how to do that

461
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,410
they have the the electronic conventions in place you go to the home page and if

462
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,930
If it can be gauged that those that are listening even not tonight, but even down down

463
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,890
Let's say in the future. Let's say on archives

464
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,270
I'm going to try to keep some

465
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,630
Accounting on what's being sent in and that will pretty much show the measurement of how much of an effort?

466
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,910
Can be made behind the scenes because there's a tremendous amount that can be discussed again. It's not the information

467
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,130
It's the mindset behind it and can you discern it, you know?

468
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,610
so

469
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,950
Perhaps doing a two-hour

470
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,270
let's say sonic event once a week on a minor Internet radio platform and

471
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,250
Calling it a members area and calling it exclusive sounds kind of asinine, right?

472
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:02,730
It doesn't doesn't make any sense because it doesn't look like the convention that everyone else or whoever everyone else that has an exclusive

473
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,810
or members area is using but

474
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,010
Let's just try it. Let's see. What kind of a response and this would be an equitable

475
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,690
Let's say monetary response towards AFR and if it seems to be

476
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:22,550
Let's say a measurable in any way there might be an effort done on this part here to develop uncommon radio

477
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,010
so

478
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,770
Just wanted to bring that up because we're about a half hour into it just to remind anyone that has heard it or has not

479
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,770
Heard it yet, but there are many things to be discussed

480
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:39,210
But again folks regardless of the subject matter the discernment has to be discussed, you know, there there's something

481
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,990
How would we say there's an emotional aspect to this as well?

482
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,930
You know how people feel like well, I really like that and you ask them why it's like I don't know

483
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,450
I just do you know, okay, so, you know, why all right, you know, okay

484
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:59,990
So all they can do again is describe are we getting any explanations or are we just getting descriptions?

485
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,550
If you're familiar with how the scientific

486
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:11,430
Society or community works lots of descriptions very little explanations the legal society medical society all the same way now people

487
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:18,190
Tend to have fallen into that model and when you ask them why they favor or disfavor something

488
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:24,710
They don't sense that they have to tell you why and really it might be I'm not talking about prying into the personal aspect

489
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:29,570
Or the private aspect of why but I think it could be packaged very neatly and given

490
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,110
The reason can be given or the sighting can be given as the you know

491
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,830
The the yay or nay is given also and you'll see that

492
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,350
That is one of the things that are lacking

493
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,610
Right now with people at large, you know everyone pretty much it doesn't matter where you're from

494
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,970
This has been going on for a very very long time and one thing you might have heard

495
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,850
Discussed in the past with other sonic events, especially let's say in the past year

496
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,250
I've been bringing up the concept that of the level of pranking on this planet

497
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:08,510
Yes, if you want to know what the Greek means by pranking just look up what their word means typically means a ludicrous trick

498
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,790
Right things are not as you have been told now

499
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,170
But some things really are see some of the pranks really are like for example

500
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,750
It starts when you're young when the parents might say something like you know

501
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,850
When you grow up you're gonna have to go to school like I did you're not gonna learn much

502
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:35,430
But you have to do it because I did it right and the other thing outside of the pranking would be

503
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,270
motivation through penalty

504
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,890
well you

505
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,210
so and

506
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:48,210
Speaking of motivation through penalty. We have someone who's motivated to perhaps call in so

507
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:55,370
Let's just see what they have to say caller if you are there, let's see if AFR can bring you in

508
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:56,970
Hello

509
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,050
Yes, greetings

510
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,550
Greetings

511
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,150
It's Chris in Tennessee. How's it going?

512
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,710
All right, Chris. All right. What's on your mind? You're on uncommon radio at AFR

513
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:17,170
Yeah, I got I got I was fortunate tonight. They will come across this I wasn't expecting this I didn't

514
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,730
Expect to hear you doing your own thing, but that's good

515
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,930
My I'll get to my question I'll express it right quick and then I'll ask him a question and I ain't got to let you elaborate

516
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,850
Take your time. Go ahead. Take your time. Go ahead

517
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,790
I've been

518
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:42,270
I've come across your your talks and just recently I should say that with this year

519
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,670
Whatever that might mean depending on who you talk to

520
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,690
And

521
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,710
It's ironic

522
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:59,070
From from some of the talks that I've dealt back into in the previous talks you've done

523
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,290
I've noticed you referred to

524
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,830
Well, I guess I get to my question

525
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,950
Maybe I haven't gotten to that point in my studies yet. I've gone back just recently into

526
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:22,150
Real ancient ancient historical studies of where a lot of things come from that we have in

527
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,110
practice today and

528
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:30,470
It's been a process for me for probably I guess since the mid 90s

529
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:35,950
So it's been it's been ongoing to get to this point to say, you know, this doesn't make sense

530
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:41,390
You know this, you know, this stuff didn't just appear in a vacuum say for instance, I give the example like

531
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,010
What quote the Bible?

532
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,990
And that could be I mean with all the different versions, you know

533
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:55,530
Don't figure but I refer to like the 1611 King James Version Bible. Okay. I say well 1611

534
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:55,910
Okay

535
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:02,890
Well all this stuff that you just didn't appear in a vacuum and even in those that Bible it refers back to stuff

536
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,750
That was going on. Well before

537
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,510
It's time

538
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,290
but

539
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,570
My question is now I'll get off and I'll let you elaborate

540
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,190
Because before it before you get to your question

541
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,990
I hope you got a grip on it because here's the other thing when you said the 1611 King James that was supposed to be a

542
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:33,150
Version or an English version of the scriptures that were pretty much finished being canonized around the first century AD and then you know

543
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,450
The the other stuff prior to that so we're looking at 1611

544
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:42,150
That's roughly 1,500 years after the fact of all these things that were memorialized

545
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,330
You see now, let me just throw in something for thought. It might might help you with the question or not

546
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,270
Is that even today one of the most prolific?

547
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:59,670
Validatable texts that are available to mankind to validate their time is the is the scriptural text preserved in Hebrew and Greek

548
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,470
in other words you see if you in other words

549
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,270
You've heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls when they got put together

550
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:13,230
It took about 30 40 years before they decided to sequester most of it and not have in public view most of it

551
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:19,550
And the reason why I've heard in private discussions with people that were loosely involved with it

552
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:25,490
Was it will ultimately the the last thing they want people to understand and comprehend and grasp is

553
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:31,930
That if you go online or get something called the Masoretic text in Hebrew, let's say language of preservation

554
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,530
It is word-for-word in space for space identical. What was really written?

555
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:43,790
2,500 years ago or 2,000 years ago and and that kind of confirmation seems to give it more importance now

556
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,710
I'm not talking King James. I'm talking about the language of preservation

557
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,610
How something I had still made it to this time?

558
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,150
So when we talk about King James, you know, if you could study the history

559
00:44:54,150 --> 00:45:00,650
Which is very difficult on why that document was put together and by who and how?

560
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:07,410
Yeah, that's a whole other thing so I'm gonna I'm gonna just digress I mean I'm not gonna I'm gonna just sit back and go

561
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:07,950
ahead and

562
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,510
Continue either with the question

563
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:19,370
Yeah, what you just said this got me to this point. It's like okay if these guys had this information that 1611 supposedly

564
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,110
That was you know, the power that be that were

565
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,190
Authorizing these things to be written, you know, it makes me wonder

566
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,830
Did that come from and that's what got me to this point, but

567
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,450
I'm glad you brought you know, you the Masoretic text didn't know about that. That's what I'm taking notes

568
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,450
Well, well before you continue again

569
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:45,310
What did come from the 1611 came from just exactly that little time period that you just brought up right there

570
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:52,650
What's go what went on around that time in England is a period to study all on its own and you'll see how hastily it

571
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,430
Was done, but but go ahead. Yeah. Yeah

572
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,330
So, let me get to my question and I'll get off I'll let you elaborate

573
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,150
I'm having trouble. I've been going back and

574
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,750
I'm an I'm an infant at this

575
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,910
trying to locate

576
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,450
etymological dictionaries, I've been able to find some that were reasonably old but

577
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,850
Not as old as I like for them to be of course being here in the States

578
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,250
You know, we've got limited information

579
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,070
I've spent some time overseas in different places, but

580
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,030
At the time that I was overseeing in different places

581
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,790
I had no clue about reality and real history

582
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,990
So I didn't even have any idea that hey, I'm in a place that has a real long

583
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,730
History to going back well before the United States. I could do some digging while I'm here

584
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,430
But since then I've grown up and learn. Hey, maybe if I go back to the Swiss, I'll do that

585
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,290
but I have a question about

586
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,650
One of your talks previous talks you did with them Shelley. We've done some good work, by the way

587
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,370
You mentioned you guys you get you guys talked about

588
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,810
Soul and spirit and I'm having trouble reconciling

589
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,170
with

590
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:14,110
What I found thus far doesn't mean I'm not gonna try it but what I found thus far. It's only going back to about the 17th century

591
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,970
etymological dictionaries

592
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:21,130
Where the soul is what I've been finding. It's defined as

593
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,650
Actual spirit and not breath up. I'm having trouble finding where the soul

594
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,550
Sure, you might want to go a little further

595
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,670
Let me just cut a step on you just for a second

596
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:35,690
Then you can I want you to continue on on your experience discovering this because on

597
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,730
Previous events perhaps that you may not I may not have up on the uncommon radio site

598
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:47,090
Are you found on archive is that we're living the past 2,000 years in a time period where things are shut down

599
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:53,430
Okay, there was a cosmic censorship 2,500 years ago on things pretty much all all

600
00:47:53,430 --> 00:48:00,910
Extensive knowledge and even when I say extensive knowledge was how man existed pre-flood. That's all been cut off around then

601
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,650
So now the soul in the spirit now, here's the thing about the soul in the spirit

602
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:11,950
Let's just say you're looking for it in English. Okay, I'm presuming you know, you're an English speaker. You said you travel

603
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,450
Okay. All right. Now English is is an agglomeration

604
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,230
It's a it's an interesting language. It's very verbose

605
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:25,310
It's not direct, you know, it can be no, but what well, you'll notice when it is direct their bar

606
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:29,890
They're using Greek technical terms are using Latin technical terms. So so here's the thing

607
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:31,070
Yeah

608
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:38,010
Our existence is dependent on the mind. Let's say us being as a spirit being animated in the physical sense

609
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,770
So that means that you've got you're made up of three things the soul the spirit

610
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,530
Let's just say the breath the mind and the body now, that's headquarters. That's HQ

611
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,450
That's what makes you you you know your mind your ability to be alive, you know

612
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,550
The life force and the physical flesh right now if you

613
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,850
obscure two two definitions out of those three

614
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,710
The vote is against you, isn't it two out of three against you? I mean to get right

615
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:09,570
Okay, so why not just keep the definition of those two other aspects obscured now

616
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,070
We I just threw in a bunch of stuff here for you. Now, let's go back

617
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,650
English is fairly recent if we go back to all older languages

618
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,950
We will always find that the word soul means breath

619
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:27,870
Simply it's a mechanical to pneumatic for example in Greek. It's pneuma PNU

620
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:33,670
that's where you get the in English the prefix whenever you see PNU that means movement of air and

621
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,070
Then the mind is

622
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,970
PSY where you hear psychic psychologists, I call that's the spirit, but you'll see Psyche, right?

623
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:48,110
So in English, it's it was very common to obscure it. Look, you know earlier you brought up the 1611, okay?

624
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,510
Do you know that prior to that not much prior to that around 1500 there before that there was no letter J

625
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:55,790
Okay

626
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:03,330
In my own studies just I mean just from the scriptural studies that I've had over the years

627
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,810
Even within that 1611

628
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,830
version of the Bible

629
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,410
That's delineated there. I mean, I can't when I when I found that I'm like, whoa, wait a minute

630
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,670
Yeah, it was an IE they use instead of a J. Yeah. Yeah, there's no J even during that

631
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,950
You know what that they had actually translated. So I'm like, okay

632
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,490
You know knowing that this was certainly not the original language

633
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:31,430
English being what back in history from what I've seen has been considered kind of like a dog language of

634
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,650
Yeah, like you should mention the conglomerate of a number of different

635
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,210
Like it's a sign of the times

636
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:40,850
right

637
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:49,270
Years in universal in universal aspect 500 years is nothing right in a big aspect, right?

638
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,410
Yeah, right

639
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:55,910
Let me just let me just consider consider one more thing when you're trying to find things in English a lot of these young

640
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,270
Folks right now. They don't know when you say telephone, you know, they reach for one of those silly phone things

641
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,610
You know with the screen on it, right?

642
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:08,330
Screen and whatever now, could you imagine giving one of these jokers a rotary phone and tell them to dial the number?

643
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,830
Think about that

644
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:17,530
Well, it's funny you say that because I worked at telecommunications for about 15 years

645
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,650
back when

646
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,890
In the mid 90s when they supposedly quote-unquote opened it up for competition

647
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,030
Okay, right right alleged competition, right? Yeah

648
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,350
But a competition that's another thing

649
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:36,810
It's like something's being hidden in plain sight if you ever been to a big city anywhere in the world

650
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:42,090
When you go to restaurant row, they got all these restaurants next to each other in one Street

651
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:47,830
You go to the garment district the diamond district. They got a hundred stores all right next to each other. Where's the competition?

652
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,870
They work together

653
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:56,690
Right. The reason they're telling you about competition perhaps is so you could give up 90% of your energy to whoever says you should and

654
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:02,050
Then stab each other in the back for the remaining 10% which you kind of see ever been in a parking lot of a big

655
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,090
box store, but anyway

656
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,110
Think about English now. Here's the thing the mindset. I was discussing earlier

657
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:14,810
Is that we're limited in a the 70 80 90 what a hundred year old, but you know existence

658
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:22,010
That is very very very short to determine things in the way that you just brought up for example now

659
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,410
what I would suggest is

660
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:30,170
If I said to you if you're pretty fluent in English or even if it's the only language

661
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,790
You know I can assure you you got about 50 words

662
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:38,190
Maybe 50 to 100 words in your vocabulary right now that are Greek, and you don't know it

663
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:43,770
In other words you're about one quarter fluent or one about maybe 20% fluent in Greek

664
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:49,650
And you don't know it if you speak English and probably five or ten percent fluent in Hebrew if you speak English you see

665
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:54,790
So a lot of these words have Greek and Hebrew origin and Latin origin so speaking English is

666
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,870
Actually making you well. I wouldn't say proficient, but semi

667
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,510
Workable in these other older languages you see what I mean by that

668
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,210
Okay, see if I if I lost him there, but anyway, maybe he jumped off

669
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:13,170
I don't know. Maybe someone at the board will tell me if we lost him or not or he's just taking a pause

670
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,290
Okay, great

671
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,990
So anyway the question there that

672
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:25,690
The the caller brought up was having difficulty with the soul and the spirit and I have brought that up many times before

673
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,730
Where if you look up a simple definition of the soul it means the breath

674
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,070
But it could also mean the spirit and then if you look up the spirit

675
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:39,010
They tell you well it means the mind and it's ethereal or whatever and it could also be the soul

676
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:43,810
Wait a second folks if that's not a scam. I don't know what is so

677
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:50,130
You have to also remember folks when he said said he was having a hard time finding etymological

678
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:58,190
References those are not popular what are popular dictionaries, and we'll get when we come back after the break

679
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,610
we will discuss the concept of why a

680
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,990
Dictionary is so popular and what that term means so we'll see you at the other part

681
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:09,930
Greetings

682
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:14,030
And this is uncommon radio with the Greek or it might be without the Greek

683
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:18,710
It depends on if you're just listening or hearing because if you're hearing things of course

684
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:24,830
It's the Greek, but if you're listening the Greek is irrelevant. It's what's being said think about that folks

685
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,030
It's not about what you like or if it's likable or not

686
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:33,310
Are you getting what it is and just to want to thank the caller who called in for the previous hour?

687
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:37,530
And one thing I want to just rolling around in the head. I want to just bring up

688
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,290
He says that he didn't know what reality was and actually it's kind of hard to say that because it is reality

689
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,810
It's just not a high-quality

690
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:49,950
Reality perhaps just want to throw that in there for anyone who thinks about saying that's not real or that's fake

691
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,690
No, it's pretty real. It's just not qualitative

692
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,630
Or qualitatively assessed and before we went to the break

693
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:03,390
I brought up the one trying to discuss what the caller brought up was about difficulty finding

694
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,590
etymological sources and

695
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:12,110
In print and of age, let's say and why did I brought up the concept of the dictionary?

696
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,510
really short without maybe elaborating on or maybe

697
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,970
elaborating on it

698
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,470
His diction is how things are pronounced

699
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:26,790
So when you are let's say a ruler or a lord over a group of people and after a while

700
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:33,450
You don't want to be known as a ruler over those who don't know how to pronounce things

701
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,810
So what you do is you give them a guide or a help known as a diction

702
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:38,970
Erie

703
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:44,470
that allows them to learn what how things are pronounced and it seems like

704
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,190
Definitions are ephemeral meaning they change right?

705
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,430
So that's why when you let's say get a dictionary and you look at it

706
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,610
Look up a word you will see how it is phonetically spelled next to the word

707
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:00,090
You know and sometimes, you know the upside-down ease and the little lines and things

708
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,750
That's how you pronounce it

709
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:07,150
Now the meaning of the word that is typically being given is the way that they who they are

710
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:11,570
Would like their subjects to pronounce it or

711
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:17,110
Uncomprehend or unless you got company or understand what that word means, but etymology

712
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:19,810
Etymology and

713
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:25,130
etymological dictionaries go a little bit beyond that they give you a little bit more of the history and the use a lot of them will

714
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:31,550
Describe that etymology is not necessarily empirical. It also is ephemeral it changes

715
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:38,670
What let's say what how words are defined to what they mean, but do they really folks, you know, is it possible?

716
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:42,970
Yes, it is. It's happening, but it gives a little bit more meaning

717
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,990
One of the things that always comes up is

718
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:54,230
Do you say what you mean and mean what you say and is that important and obviously it's not anymore

719
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,470
Why should it be?

720
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:03,910
One of the things I had always is discussed is the concept of cosmic censorship and I want to say always with me Greek-speak

721
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,970
There's you haven't missed anything in other words

722
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:13,510
It's not like missing the bus or an opportunity unless you're over

723
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,890
2,500 years old you have not missed anything

724
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:23,530
You've been born into this reality and based on the limited aspect of one's longevity, you know

725
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:30,470
you're you're pretty much either going to be engrossed in the times or you're pretty much gonna tune out and

726
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:38,130
Not know what's going on in either way. It doesn't matter because the human lifespan is too short. So

727
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,950
Again

728
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:46,730
Do you say what you mean and mean what you say and that's another concept, you know, it could be you know

729
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:52,490
It's taken from a pedantic point of view and say angry. That's pedantic. You know, that sounds like you're really having a hard time

730
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:57,210
You know, how are you gonna communicate and all this well, you know think about it

731
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:03,210
Let's just take the aspect of forgetting about what words mean and are we being accurate because there's some hypocrisy there

732
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:09,810
You know, if you're getting shoes or a door fixed by a carpenter or tires you want them to be accurate

733
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:13,890
But when it seems like there's communication the accuracy and precision tends to not be important

734
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:21,050
And it all it all falls apart, doesn't it to some extent and just to put that aside for a moment

735
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:29,790
If it's not just regarding words, let's say you're having a conversation with someone and it's about maybe associating with

736
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:35,890
Someone new someone you have not met yet, and you would say listen, you haven't met this person yet

737
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:41,410
But he doesn't say what he means or she doesn't say what she means and doesn't mean what she says

738
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,470
Is that someone you want to do business with is that someone you want to have as a friend?

739
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,270
Is that someone most of those are people say no

740
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,150
No, I don't want anyone that has that kind of quality

741
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:52,610
interesting

742
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:59,330
Okay. So where do you draw the line? Do you say what you mean and mean what you say if there's

743
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:05,450
No desire or very little desire to find out what words mean now. I've discussed in the past

744
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,630
The concept of is what's called the Democratic

745
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:15,330
World I've also said freedom is a concept once of course because if you're on this planet

746
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:21,730
You're really are not free and freedom by the way means to be free of dominion or free of a state

747
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:25,790
So it's really interesting when you see a politician say they want freedom because that pretty much

748
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:32,410
It's kind of like a shoemaker saying everyone should be barefoot. It's just don't know what it means either but

749
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,770
if you're if you're looking at

750
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:41,450
the state of affairs on this planet and you're looking at the way people are functioning and

751
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,650
You have come across terms of we say oh

752
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:50,030
I'm depressed or I know the world is not fair or I know this or this is not really great

753
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,750
I just do this, right? Okay

754
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,630
That's fine

755
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,470
But in order to be able to suss things out

756
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,550
Are you able to act with efficiency? Are you able to make a clear decision?

757
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,330
You're gonna have to set yourself apart from it

758
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:10,330
And once you understand what it means to be set apart from it like a third party

759
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:12,530
Then you can go back in with a cool head

760
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,370
You see this often

761
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,410
Hmm, let's say with people in the emergency

762
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:18,850
services

763
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,150
typically if there's a car accidents a real grotesque

764
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:28,410
Outcome the people the bystanders could be anywhere from screaming to throwing up to not wanting to look at it

765
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:32,670
But here come the paramedics and they are just cool as a cucumber. They go about

766
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,690
Whatever that needs to be done

767
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:39,270
Efficiently and they could also be you know be scooping up someone's guts and discussing

768
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,590
You know where they're gonna have lunch in an hour

769
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,190
Because they they already were exposed to all of this

770
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:52,570
Before it happened in through training. So when you hear people discussing things

771
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:57,890
Like for example the when the caller asked the question that he did

772
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:04,030
He and he said he's come across this type of let's say project recently

773
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,250
He's

774
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:11,270
He's even if it seems like he said this year, which would probably be a few months

775
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:16,290
He's fairly new at this and he's probably discovering how much work is involved

776
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:21,950
To do it on your own, even though all of the hints and all of this can be laid out. There really is no

777
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,770
complete advice or how to

778
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:29,930
ultimately, you're going to have to do your part and it's really slow in the beginning and

779
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,210
It seems laborious

780
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:38,030
But you know the work if it if it if it tips your ticket like they say do it

781
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:41,730
Otherwise, you know leave it alone, but I want to go back to

782
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,690
Being a third party if you look at

783
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:53,010
How most of the authorities by the way, whether you view them as being benevolent or benevolent is irrelevant

784
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:57,770
It's always done by third party. Now. How can you be a third party in your own existence?

785
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:03,430
Well simple if you're affected by actions and thoughts separate yourself from it for a moment

786
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,050
So you can see it clearly and then when you become engrossed in it again

787
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:10,350
You already had the time without being in it

788
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:16,110
You're you've had the time of being outside of it not without being apathetic or negligent

789
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:21,670
but you could see it more clearly and more rationally and this is something that you

790
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:30,230
You who is a listener or will come across throughout all media when I say all media, I mean all with a capital L

791
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:34,070
You will see discussions that are being

792
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:35,610
hmm

793
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:40,880
let's say sign of the times or this week's discussion or

794
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:45,920
you see what everyone is pretty much doing and

795
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,680
The interesting thing is in this democratic society

796
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:55,660
You're or what's called the Western part where the individual rights?

797
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:04,140
And all that are not to be tarnished. Let's say they tell you be individual, but whenever you're dealing with anyone of authority

798
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:11,620
Their agents or themselves. They always want everyone to be the same if you start bringing up your individual attributes or points

799
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:15,900
They'll say shut up. You have to be just like everyone else, right?

800
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,260
Inprivate but public they're giving a different

801
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,880
Message you see so there's there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy in this

802
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:31,240
In this existence and it's not something that's going to change. So the only the only thing there is no solution

803
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,900
To it other than when your time is up

804
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,860
the thing to do perhaps is to can you

805
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:44,460
Objectify what's going on? Can you pull yourself out of it? And when you go back into it?

806
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:51,280
Be objective and rational and not get caught up into it because right now an all-media like I said with a capital L

807
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:59,260
They all tend to be swayed whether it's mainstream or alternative in a group think a crowd mentality

808
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,560
And right now if you're picking this up, this is what they

809
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,160
It's almost New Year, by the way lawfully a couple of weeks away meaning the first

810
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:15,140
The first day of the first month is soon approaching in a couple of weeks or a week or so I should say

811
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:21,200
But it's what they call March or the third month on the what I call the pagan or Gregorian calendar

812
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,540
and

813
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,440
what is being discussed now is still the American political scene and

814
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,680
I want to throw something in here because I

815
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,120
Spent quite a bit of time. I was told earlier a Greek you spent 13 minutes discussing, you know

816
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,500
the the experiment of

817
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,760
instead of having a private members area where people would do and listen come some kind of monetary exchange and like a

818
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,500
Convention like other people have just to send it to AFR to gauge

819
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,540
What kind of a response there is or what you know?

820
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,200
What kind of investment should be made behind the scenes to create such an area, you know?

821
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:57,560
so

822
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:05,720
The things that were perhaps will be said here little by little might be something that you would find in a second hour a

823
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,460
type of a

824
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:14,060
Second type, but let's say the premium or the more exclusive side of other other venues

825
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:20,140
And things like that and it would be interesting to those that want to

826
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:27,900
Donate to a cause or buy into something like that to pretty much do it publicly through AFR for this episode and perhaps the next

827
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,300
Just to gauge what it's like, but I assure you that

828
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,240
What could be said

829
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:41,180
Not saying it will be but what can be said here for the two hours on AFR with the Greek would probably much

830
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:46,340
We're probably say rival most of I'm gonna be high on the britches and things like that

831
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,960
But rival what you would get anywhere else, you know

832
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,700
And in terms of putting something together and throwing it out as an exclusive tidbit of information

833
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,600
let's say that you can see packaged and

834
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,800
You know doing good work or giving a good report

835
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:07,860
But you know, maybe something can be thrown in before let's say this night is over got up another 45 minutes

836
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,860
Maybe I could do it now or do it a little bit. I just want to maybe do it now. I don't know if you

837
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:18,820
Folks might agree with it or not, but I'll just throw in something a little tidbit. Have you folks ever heard of 9-eleven?

838
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,180
Researchers, okay, you know what what they all seem to miss. There's someone that kind of

839
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,740
Touted this will for a short time and that went away

840
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:36,280
But you know why bring that up it seems like anything that's being researched as well as such a conspiracy Greek and I'm not for or

841
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,020
Against anything that's being said whether it's the official story or not

842
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:46,520
But why isn't there any discussion on the level of complexity from an objective point of view?

843
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:53,240
I people really looked at everything. No, or do we grab on certain notions and concepts?

844
01:06:53,240 --> 01:07:00,140
Do you know for example the way the buildings came down was very unusual and the methodologies that are being explained

845
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:08,520
Have always led, you know, the contrasting methodologies. Let's say have always led to contention amongst those discussing it. So

846
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:14,560
Why why isn't it possible to find video evidence of other things?

847
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,500
That have let's say

848
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:23,080
Disintegrated like that using a methodology that's been around since the early 60s and it's on YouTube folks

849
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,280
And it's it's funny how no one has found it

850
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,360
the other thing I wanted to bring up is

851
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,900
about 9-eleven because this was a short discussion recently on this and and

852
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,480
What what I do is I don't just I don't like discussing it publicly

853
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,360
But I do it in private because the public sorry folks

854
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:48,440
You don't deserve the truth regarding many of these matters because of your behavior and I'm talking about the public at large

855
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,960
You know, you don't pull your sister's hair

856
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,340
You don't kick your brother in the groin and you won't get any dessert, right?

857
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,140
So you're not going to get the truth of matters

858
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:03,380
You basically like arguing too much and forming little cliques and groups and look what I can do or whatever

859
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,760
So it ain't gonna happen in public, but let me just throw this other tidbit in here or this is the tidbit

860
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,040
Why isn't there any discussion on how let's say

861
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:20,899
Something that happened on that morning was really the result or the product of what you would see in a James Bond movie

862
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,380
Right. I mean what well, that doesn't make any sense and I'll just throw this out there

863
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:30,760
If you want to really understand one of the things that happened that morning not in New York City

864
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,939
But the other place is you're gonna have to look into a character a case called Victor boot VIK

865
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:44,479
Tor and boot B O U T what he's been charged with certain crimes, right? Well, what was his crime?

866
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:51,060
Really? What was what did the Justice Department need to satisfy in terms of case for me?

867
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,600
You're not going to find that in public

868
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:00,319
But what was interesting also when you tie that together with the American political scene right now

869
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,840
There's a lot of discussion about a place called Russia, right?

870
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:10,640
Right. Well, why do you think it's because of some kind of election or something of you? Are you doing your research here?

871
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,279
where's Victor boot from and

872
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:18,080
What was he being charged with that's going to be kind of difficult to see openly and

873
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:24,939
Tie all that together. Why is there still a discussion with Russia? Yeah, it's been 15 years or so

874
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:30,479
I mean, let me just throw one thing one more thing in and this is the most that I would do public

875
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,500
Do you want to curse class submarine is?

876
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,520
Okay, look it up. There's one that made it that imploded and went all the way to the bottom around

877
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:43,340
I think it was 2000 or something the sinking of one particular

878
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:50,520
Submarine, this is very technological submarine things like that don't happen. What was aboard that submarine?

879
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,540
So and it was Russian also, so if you think this talk about

880
01:09:56,540 --> 01:10:04,240
Russians is has to do with what you are being told you have not looked at the whole picture

881
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,760
Let's say so that's just a little bit of that. I mean so much can be done

882
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:15,700
It's not a rabbit hole. By the way, it's pretty open to see if you want to prime one's thoughts in that direction. So

883
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:22,940
Perhaps maybe that would have been a long discussion for a members type area, but let's just start here folks

884
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:29,220
See if you can what you would send the Greeks sent to AFR and let's just see if it's worth it to do something like that

885
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:37,260
So again, I want to thank the caller the the called in the past hour because his point also shows many of the points that

886
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,240
If you've ever heard the Greeks speak before is it ties back to scripture now

887
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,880
I don't like to speak about it because it's not time yet. But on the other hand

888
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:53,740
There is going to be a time where those that understand these ancient things because they all tie together

889
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,880
They all come from the same mindset all of your ancient documents, by the way

890
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:04,800
Those that do have an advantage on comprehension or having a grasp of what is it has been memorialized

891
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,660
Will be in a clear advantage in the near future

892
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,700
All right, but at the time

893
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,080
Currently, it's not the time to discuss these things openly. I've have

894
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,340
perhaps in the past

895
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:24,520
but there's tremendous amount of detail but the details can only be discovered when the mindset is correct and the correct mindset is

896
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:31,420
Stop reading into it what you've been told and learn to read out of it be objective from a forensic point of view

897
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,790
All right, look at what is really being said the other thing is

898
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,700
Get a ladder

899
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,200
Why what I mean by get a ladder the Fox and the grapes

900
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,680
Aesop's fables

901
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,480
Fox couldn't reach the grapes. So I guess the Fox called them sour

902
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:58,240
So when what you'll typically hear is that when people can't well shouldn't say can't but yes can't because of the censorship

903
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:04,140
Understand something or comprehend it whether it's because of their laziness or because they're

904
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,700
Cosmically blocked from it. Guess what? It's no good. If I don't get it, it can't be good

905
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,740
Right. That's where the Fox and the grapes comes in

906
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:19,460
So if you can't reach those grapes get a ladder or make one so you're gonna have to elevate to get the grapes now

907
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,820
Another thing I want to throw in there

908
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,720
It's just a little bit of a help when you're approaching ancient stuff

909
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:29,320
Especially regarding the gods and if you've ever heard me speak before

910
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:37,660
It's the gods. Yes plural. It's not singular, right? The scripture mentioned 36 or I think 38 of them by name

911
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:47,160
There are many gods, but there's only one who is the highest form and what makes him the highest he is not subject to death

912
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,440
You know, so think about that for a minute

913
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,900
but the thing about

914
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,060
Looking at all of this

915
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:01,660
Stuff that you you look at don't read into it read out of it and if you can grasp

916
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,960
anything out of it is that it's not done in futility and

917
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,580
What you've been told about it is probably false and it doesn't matter what it is

918
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:16,660
If it's old because there is a mentality that's still pervasive

919
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:22,920
That the modern current contemporary society is so much better and so much more advanced

920
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:29,660
Right, and these ancients are ignorant and you know, okay. All right granted you want to go that way? Okay

921
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,600
Well, let's say we grant it that the modern and the contemporary man

922
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:43,200
Is far better and less ignorant. Okay, if we grant that point, how about consider this if these things still exist?

923
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:49,240
In memorial form where they can be accessed unchanged or seemingly unchanged

924
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:57,020
What kind of an effort do you think was made or how significant is it that they've made it to this point all of those years

925
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:04,640
Especially the ones not even written in stone because one concept a list in jest or joking around was the reason they carve things in stone

926
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,900
Is because if it was memorialized in paper or something less durable, it wouldn't be around for so long

927
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,640
We have things still that can be accessed that are not in stone and quite prolific

928
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,900
So there's an importance aspect here if something is that old

929
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,300
Unknown because of people's stubbornness and rejection of it because they don't want to do the work

930
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,780
Well, so be it

931
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:29,860
But what is going to happen in the future is there is going to be a desire

932
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:34,320
Towards that direction and those who have the advantage to look at it now

933
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,840
Before the questioning comes up

934
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,640
Right is where the clear advantage is, but you know, I say it's not time yet. But uh

935
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,980
Let's just share this

936
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:50,380
From a private context is that most of the messages that the Greek has gotten

937
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:55,320
through the website and emails has been about scripture go figure and

938
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:02,800
Typically, I don't come out wanting to discuss it because there's the discussion is very very difficult. I recently

939
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,980
Told someone and I'll tell you why it was difficult is because

940
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,000
Someone had said to me, you know Greek you're correct about the accuracy of the statement as time goes on

941
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,980
People will be interested in more of these matters of ancient things and

942
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:19,300
And I said yes, and actually the person actually finished the rest of it

943
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:25,220
Which was complete which is there'll be more discussion as time goes on, but what will be discussed will not be accurate

944
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,080
right, it will not be accurate, but the but the

945
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,040
Getting set up and looking in that direction is what is what to watch for

946
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,520
you see so there isn't going to be much accuracy in these topics and

947
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,420
Why why because it's just not time yet

948
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:49,480
There's a tremendous amount of work as the as the caller that in the first hour said he's been listening to this type of

949
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,260
mindset kind of discussion

950
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,040
information reporting

951
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,680
that is very different and he's

952
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,320
Trying to seek out things that are really where where one would start

953
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:08,280
You see and you have to experience them on your own, but the the timing is very important

954
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,980
and what is

955
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,520
Coming up for that timing is also very important

956
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,620
So if it's not time now for what well would be things ancient especially regarding the gods

957
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,340
It's not time yet. If if this kind of

958
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,600
Reporting what you hear me saying about that

959
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,500
Strikes you as something significant get started

960
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,720
Get familiar. I know it seems like a lot, but it does take a lot a lot of time and a long time

961
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,780
but it doesn't have to there are

962
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,520
things to

963
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:45,180
To look at and just to go back what I started saying before

964
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,620
was any I

965
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:53,060
Try to discuss this topic with anyone or any time without prefacing it correctly

966
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,380
Shows the quality of the discussion

967
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:01,900
What is the preface if any discussion you folks here any discussion no matter where it is regarding Scripture?

968
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,880
It has to be prefaced that even to this day

969
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:11,760
What is known as the scripture that's preserved in Hebrew and Greek has yet to be translated

970
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,560
Period

971
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:22,020
This is a preface you should be looking for there's a tremendous amount of discussion of things biblical people writing books about that book

972
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:30,100
People telling giving positive and negative commentary heck there even religions that are based on it go figure and none of it is accurate why?

973
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,620
Because what they fail to tell you is that they're reading a version now if you have

974
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,580
an unabridged version

975
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:45,500
They usually have a pretty substantial introduction, and they tell you why the version is inaccurate. I'm using that loosely

976
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,680
So one way to see if you're getting a good

977
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,160
hmm

978
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:57,040
Discussion is if the preface is correct, and why is it correct am I being dogmatic? I don't think so

979
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:04,260
I'm trying to be objective the the prep the correct preface is that even to this date or day?

980
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,160
These things have not been translated into the corresponding languages of the discussion being held about them

981
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,280
so if you pick up a biblical text that is in Chinese or Japanese or

982
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,440
English or Spanish or French or what have you it is a King James version

983
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,280
The scriptures have yet to be translated. Do you want to go a little further?

984
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:32,160
How many times have the Greek philosophers been touted as having revelatory work that can help mankind?

985
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,600
Well, I what I say to that is if they're so great

986
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,140
How well is it helped really you know think about it?

987
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,200
The other thing is what you're being told in all the other languages is still a version of that now Greek

988
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:50,480
Are we going to go and read ancient Greek or ancient Hebrew or again coin a Greek or any other ancient language or even?

989
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,340
Aramaic no, you're not you don't have to but what you'll understand

990
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:00,080
is that all languages are made up of a group of letters are usually 22 and

991
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:06,660
Usually these other languages the letters have definitions which help define the words

992
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:11,520
so I don't know how well you are memorizing things, but a phone number is

993
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,980
pretty much

994
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,380
Memorizing seven words isn't it when you say a phone number isn't each number also a word

995
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:24,080
It's not that difficult folks at one point. Maybe we'll get into discussing how to increase memory

996
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,520
Which one thing to think about mem

997
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,340
Means water and or means light

998
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,300
Think about it for a moment

999
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:43,450
So okay, I've just checked out a comment in the chat, and I want to thank anyone and everyone who's

1000
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:49,430
Here on uncommon radio right now on the other side meaning the listening audience

1001
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:56,610
Because this is a first go-around for an intended monologue type or solo Greek effort

1002
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:04,070
Sands the possibility of someone calling in which you know could get interesting just as it did in the first hour

1003
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:07,630
So again what what I would expect to see

1004
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:13,410
being said for the let's say two hours here on AFR is

1005
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,210
as an experiment

1006
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:19,410
tonight and the next episode maybe the next one is

1007
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:24,710
What you would like to hear in a members area or more of a members area type of con?

1008
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:31,490
Let's say something more exclusive than that had happened prior to with prior sonic engagements

1009
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:34,090
Where I had a co-host let's say

1010
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:35,450
so

1011
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:40,390
Is it possible to do something exclusive in public and charge for it now?

1012
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:46,590
That's a crazy statement to make because there is no money. It's it's not about that. It's about is there an exchange

1013
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:51,610
So at this point if you feel compelled that the Greek deserves

1014
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:55,230
Some kind of exchange go ahead and send it to AFR

1015
01:20:55,230 --> 01:21:01,090
And we'll see if there's enough coming in for AFR on that it might be worth for the Greek to invest on

1016
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,590
Developing something more if not

1017
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:12,010
It will just continue these discussions openly because guess what it's probably not time yet still and when I say probably I know

1018
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:17,110
It isn't we still have about another year of the way things have been since the past six years or so

1019
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:22,950
I've always discussed how the the discussion is going to be kind of

1020
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:30,190
Frustrating and full of tension, but not disabling and I've never discussed in public though. Why?

1021
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:38,310
Why it is that way and let's just throw this in there this particular seven-year period is a time

1022
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:42,450
Let's just say where it's part of the setup

1023
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:50,850
For the next seven years and one of the setups that you are experiencing as a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant is

1024
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,230
that you will be

1025
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:58,970
Led into unbeknownst to you and very quite smoothly into what's called a Middle East Union

1026
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:05,810
Well, let me take that back. It won't be called the Middle East Union. It can be described as such

1027
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,510
by description

1028
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,450
And it will be accepted not

1029
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:15,430
Perhaps beginning in the next seven years by the end of the next seven year period it will be fully accepted

1030
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,590
But this is the time where everything will be set in place

1031
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,250
so why

1032
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:24,270
the seven the past seven years of frustration and

1033
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:31,510
Let's just say confusion, but not to the point where it disables the inhabitants on the planet

1034
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:37,570
That is the time where let's just say a large portion

1035
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:45,970
Maybe 30% or 33% of the spiritual entities or gods and angelic beings throughout the universe are being corralled

1036
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,250
And sent down to the earth

1037
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:55,250
Kind of like customs at an airport where you see immigrants coming in and they're all in line with their luggage

1038
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:01,410
Well, this is the time where everyone, you know, you guys on this planet are being

1039
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,130
given fed stories

1040
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:05,070
about missing airplanes

1041
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,250
corrupt politicians and

1042
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,790
impending financial collapse

1043
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:16,610
Which doesn't happen because it can't it's credit based economy and all the other stuff and the dummy loading that you've been getting for the past

1044
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:21,630
Seven years is to keep you in a mellow enough agreeable state, but yet a little frustrated

1045
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,510
so pretty much one-third of all of the

1046
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:30,830
Entities in the unknown unseen world of the gods are descending upon the earth. Think about that for a minute

1047
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:33,690
And you're all missing it. Why?

1048
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:36,230
Because this is the grand final

1049
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:42,950
Showdown that is you've got about another decade and a half on this planet that everyone pretty much

1050
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:47,350
Is going to follow through and be about as agreeable as anyone can be

1051
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:54,070
About what is going to be happening here starting in the next few years on this time period. It doesn't mean there's going to be

1052
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:57,330
You know, everything's gonna be honky-dory and peachy keen

1053
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:00,290
You're still gonna have all your attention and all this other stuff

1054
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:03,010
but what it's going to lead to is a

1055
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:08,230
Let's just say if you have a racetrack you have a starting line and a finishing line

1056
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:13,590
Don't you or where is the starting line? You gotta draw a bead on it with your eye. Where is it?

1057
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:17,010
Okay, and I want you to draw a bead on with your eye where the finishing line is

1058
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,430
same place

1059
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:20,550
Where did everything start?

1060
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,630
Or is it all going to end?

1061
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,350
The end just means this particular era

1062
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:30,510
So I just wanted to throw that in there because that I have not discussed publicly prior to this

1063
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,370
up until this time

1064
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:39,630
so the other thing that I discuss is the agricultural aspect of how humanity is and

1065
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:45,590
Folks that get it get it and just to give another way a loose way of saying it

1066
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:52,630
It's spring it is a time for planting summer is a time for growth and fall as a harvest time for breaking down

1067
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:59,470
Now everything that is a metaphor for everything that people experience in their private personal lives

1068
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:06,350
Culturally socially on and on politically economically, but for example, there are people crying still

1069
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,790
I have not really looked at the media very much

1070
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:12,610
But I recently I did catch a little bit in this moron is

1071
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:17,230
Saying that watch out for what they call March 15th or something for

1072
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,830
Economic because of all these trillions or interest debt. I'm like, oh wow

1073
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,770
I can't comment on that because that is just so bizarre and ridiculous

1074
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:31,070
And the first thing that's bizarre and ridiculous is that all financial troubles happen in the fall

1075
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:34,990
Breaking down event would happen in the fall

1076
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:41,190
This is the time of planting where it's very dynamic and very quiet at a time of growth this summer

1077
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,850
So, I mean there are people

1078
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:47,930
Still that have microphones and shows and media

1079
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:51,930
Outlets that are not aware of it. Now, I think

1080
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:57,090
Even if they were made aware of it, I think they're accommodating the audience

1081
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:01,770
so because people in general are not aware of it that there tends to be a

1082
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:04,130
blame factor that people have

1083
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:11,030
You know if you turn on that TV show, they call the news occasionally they'll say well this such-and-such happened

1084
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,010
We don't know who to blame yet. Whoa

1085
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:18,390
What what is this blame stuff the blame game, right?

1086
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:26,290
You know why you know, oh, it's the globalist elite, you know, or it's the Illuminati's man

1087
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:28,130
Illuminati's gonna get you or

1088
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,770
It goes on and on and on

1089
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:39,350
Why not set yourself apart from it at least in your mind start thinking about it, you know, what's going on here?

1090
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:40,890
Is anyone paying attention?

1091
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:48,490
You know, let's just I maybe instead of just dispelling cliches all the time I get a little bit of about the credit system

1092
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,010
every so often

1093
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:51,750
Think about it folks

1094
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,430
Have you ever heard of?

1095
01:26:55,310 --> 01:27:01,390
Let's say two people standing there and they're gonna bet whether the third person is going to

1096
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:05,930
Move to the left or move to the right. I've actually had your bet. Well, I bet ten bucks

1097
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:10,170
He's gonna move to the left. I bet ten bucks. He's gonna move to the right. Well, and he moves to the left

1098
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:14,150
Well, so one guy gets to ten bucks because that's the completion of the wager or the bet

1099
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:19,990
That's how the credit system works when you hear about interest and debt and loans

1100
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:28,190
And all this stuff. These are people within the financial market that are betting that once these transactions take place

1101
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:32,990
They put a description on them and the description is oh, it's a loan

1102
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:37,310
With interest or it's this with interest or it's debt or whatever

1103
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:43,030
Description and they're betting on how they're gonna funnel it down the market who's gonna buy into it on a bet

1104
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,530
But there is no debt because it's all credit

1105
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:51,790
But the betting is very powerful. You know, have you heard of betting on sports and

1106
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:54,170
you're shooting craps or

1107
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:59,590
Casinos. Yeah. Okay, so it's all paid for

1108
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:04,810
Because you're in a credit based economy. Yeah, and that's really kind of ironic

1109
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:07,850
I might even say because in the beginning of this show

1110
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:13,510
I pretty much said let's use AFR as an experiment for donations to see how much people wanted willing to put behind

1111
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,090
Probably an exclusive project by the Greek

1112
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:23,070
So we'll see that you know, what's really happening there folks is when you go ahead and donate through the electronic convention

1113
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:31,570
That that credit is being created on AFR is financial institution instantly and you're being docked to give you the plausible

1114
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:37,250
Deniability that it was transferred over when the whole time the institution that you're using is

1115
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:42,570
Still holding on to it, but you can't have access to it anymore. It's a single awful

1116
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:48,570
No, if you guys want to understand a little bit more about it's written an eighth grade reading level

1117
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:55,330
Look up USC 12 section 411 United States Code title 12 section 411

1118
01:28:55,970 --> 01:29:01,050
Read it. What does it mean when no other no other use is authorized?

1119
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,410
What does that mean?

1120
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:07,310
Anyway, think about it a little bit talk about what's called money

1121
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:12,290
Is it is it going to wake up anyone? Is anyone going to comprehend it? Yeah, very few

1122
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:17,150
We'll see. I don't think it's a point of contention anymore

1123
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:20,810
There are bigger fish to fry like your existence on this planet

1124
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:25,810
So if you're if you're listening just to give a little marker here

1125
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:32,890
This is uncommon radio and you're on American Freedom Radio, and this is the Greek. Yes flying solo. So

1126
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:36,770
Let's uh, let's you know, pretty much continue

1127
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:42,210
I would say it's a conversation but flying solo pretty much is I'm on I'm at the stick. I'm at the

1128
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:48,410
I'm flying this thing. So and I just got a message here, but perhaps I'll share it with everyone

1129
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:56,230
It says thanks for clarifying the quote-unquote versions of the Bible and elaborating on my question during your

1130
01:29:56,230 --> 01:30:03,050
First solo talk on AFR looking forward to listening taking those further studies understanding. Thank you, Chris from Tennessee

1131
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:06,630
Yes, and he did identify himself as Chris. Thank you for

1132
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,090
for calling in

1133
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,430
and the thing is there really is

1134
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:13,050
there really is

1135
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:18,390
Nothing, that's not viable. I mean everything asked is viable because it'll be shown as such

1136
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:22,190
When you're pursuing the the truth, you cannot be offended, right?

1137
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:27,910
Because you just see it as it is and you can discern whether it's true or not

1138
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:29,310
so

1139
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,090
Thank you again caller

1140
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:36,970
For calling in and that was a very good point because it tends to tie in

1141
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:42,470
With all of the behind-the-scenes messages that I get and folks, you know, you're listening to this on AFR

1142
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:46,790
This is something that could be archived. It's pretty much taking up two hours of

1143
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:49,370
Time and on a minor internet radio platform

1144
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:53,270
But the Greek gets a tremendous amount of message and inquiry

1145
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:59,030
Regarding things scriptural and or quote-unquote biblical and you couldn't believe

1146
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:01,590
How that is still?

1147
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:05,630
considered a major turnoff by society at large

1148
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,650
but privately on

1149
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:16,510
Backdoor and but I say three-quarters if not 90% of the messages are regarding things spiritual and I'm kind of reserved

1150
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:24,670
Holding back on discussion discussing things in more detail up until this point. So I believe that

1151
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:29,110
Trying out more detail on it. We'll see if it'll satisfy the

1152
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:37,190
The inquiry and it should be but like I said before you wouldn't believe how distasteful still

1153
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:39,130
through the society at large

1154
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:44,170
That subject matter is because the mindset they've already decided

1155
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:47,050
You know, like I said, if you count how many eggs in a basket

1156
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:51,910
Someone says well someone might say well, I'm not mathematical. I don't want to know what's wrong

1157
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:57,630
We're not talking about being mathematical. This is can you take a small tidbit of information, you know?

1158
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:04,450
Regarding a subject that might be contrary to a mindset. You've just you've discovered works for you as an excuse or whatever

1159
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,990
But even now to this day typically

1160
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:13,250
Throughout society when you bring up something known as quote-unquote the Bible or

1161
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,290
Scripture or whatever people say well, that's a work of fiction

1162
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:21,750
Oh, I don't believe in that or I'm not religious or or or they'll give you a million reasons

1163
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:27,430
Why not to discuss it or how it shouldn't be discussed or how can anybody know what it's about?

1164
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:33,230
Except for what one can discuss about it is actually what's in it, right?

1165
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:35,470
Or what is trying to be conveyed another thing?

1166
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:41,510
I wanted to share with folks is I've gotten quite a few messages regarding an interlinear, you know seeking one out

1167
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,230
Yes, of course. It's the reference material, right? It's the base

1168
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,270
But here's the thing, you know

1169
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,010
Let's let's be even more practical

1170
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:54,630
there are quite a few people out there that could read the languages of ancient the ancient languages of

1171
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:58,530
Preservation and still don't understand what's being conveyed. So

1172
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:03,410
But if you're approaching it through an interlinear, in other words using the languages of preservation

1173
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:07,750
You are now technically accessing the information whole

1174
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,050
So it's like saying I want water

1175
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:15,090
Would like to drink some water do I drink off from the puddle in the street?

1176
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:20,790
Or the river where all the fish are pooing or the spring that feeds the river where it's pristine

1177
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:27,430
Right now you haven't drunk yet, right because you can make a you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him think

1178
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,270
so

1179
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:32,850
The the only analogy that I can give that sustains a simple

1180
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:37,290
Imparting of what is going on here is the concept of a jigsaw puzzle

1181
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:40,290
If you have a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle

1182
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:46,290
It really helps to look at the image that is cur as a form of courtesy given on the box

1183
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:52,130
And then you dump out all the pieces and you look at the fielding of color and shapes

1184
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:56,350
Let's say in the image and you start fielding loosely the pieces in

1185
01:33:56,350 --> 01:34:02,990
General areas before you start piecing them together and just like a jigsaw puzzle once the pieces are put together

1186
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:08,070
They really interlock well where where if you've put a good jigsaw puzzle together

1187
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:13,890
You'll notice that you can actually pick up the whole puzzle from one piece and it all grabs on really tight

1188
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:18,630
And that's exactly what the scriptures are. The thing is that I've what I've discerned out of

1189
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:24,050
Looking at it for over a decade and a half with what I would consider to be

1190
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:28,530
Objectivity is that the picture at this point?

1191
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:34,730
We are in history is are the people that can see it and explain it clearly and concisely

1192
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:42,490
Right. So at finding someone that sees the picture has been given the picture through the hard work. They've done

1193
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:46,370
It's not you're like you're hearing voices or have any kind of revelatory

1194
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:54,990
Experience right or major download because it's pretty strict about doing the work

1195
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:59,310
It's up to the people to show others the the general picture

1196
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:06,070
That's why I believe in the past discussion. I've had the last one with Chuck O'Kelly and we had a caller

1197
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:09,570
I said the scripture is about three things, right?

1198
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:12,550
And it's not like, you know, there are three types of people in the world

1199
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:16,690
Those who are good in math and those who aren't right that's not like that

1200
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:21,010
But anyway, it's about three things. It's about life. It's about death and

1201
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:22,470
everything in between

1202
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:23,490
right

1203
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:25,850
Think about it. No

1204
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:28,130
What is law?

1205
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:30,130
How you deal with your environment?

1206
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:35,130
We are a type of in existence right now that we are in a physical environment

1207
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:39,550
In other words, you can't write, you know, you can't really displace one

1208
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:46,130
Thing that is physical for another without causing major movement, right when you are a non physical

1209
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:50,150
You can pretty much move around and get about a little bit differently

1210
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:58,130
so what is in in the environment can either assist or impede you and you need a really you need to grasp a

1211
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:05,370
Good set of laws that allow you to work with this material world and they call them laws of physics and things like that

1212
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:10,650
So engineers and mechanics use them but as a society as an individual

1213
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:17,590
Whether it's corporate, you know, meaning a group of people coming together to do something or familial or

1214
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:25,010
On national level the purpose of the law is how you interact with each other and with the environment. It's very very important

1215
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:31,770
And one thing that the Greek has surmised and we've been reporting on for over a decade and a half is that your law comes?

1216
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:32,470
from your God

1217
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,750
Period that is part of the operating system

1218
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:41,490
It sounds dogmatic because there are many people of course who do not know anything about the gods

1219
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:46,450
And they'll say well, I don't believe in that in that well, that's fine

1220
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:48,430
The gods never asked you to believe in them

1221
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:53,590
Anyway, if there's anything regarding belief in in these ancient writs

1222
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:57,370
It's that you're going to believe that there are things that have not

1223
01:36:57,370 --> 01:37:04,150
Come into fruition will come into fruition because they have stated so it's it's sure that that's the strange thing

1224
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:11,190
I don't believe in God. That's not really something that you will find memorialized. It's that when the gods have actually

1225
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:17,410
Said something will happen and those that understand the message will be able to talk about it before it happens

1226
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:22,590
That is what belief is about so until someone tells you I believe in this or that

1227
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:26,690
Well, it has to be attached to something that has not occurred yet

1228
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:32,530
This is just a clear concise report what people do with that word is another thing

1229
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:35,530
But if you run into someone who says Greek

1230
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:41,110
I don't believe in God, you know, so your point that law comes from your God is moot

1231
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:47,390
Well, not really because then you would ask them. Do you believe in the laws of the state and they typically say yes

1232
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:53,890
Well, then the state is your God and April 1st is your holiday and the state supplies a God for your law

1233
01:37:53,890 --> 01:38:00,430
Anyway, it's a statue of a woman. It's called justicia or justice and you serve her

1234
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:06,730
She has a personified in iconography and statuary, I mean how clear can it be and

1235
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:13,150
All the language around it and the priesthood if you ever look at a typical lawsuit

1236
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:14,750
the

1237
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:18,070
Plaintiffs are praying for relief

1238
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,950
Are you folks paying any attention?

1239
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:25,330
The answer is no at large you're not

1240
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:32,990
Because the the level of complaining let's just say the the level of activism complaining protesting

1241
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:35,170
disheartened

1242
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:41,630
Whatever individuals that that voice it through any form of media whether it be public or private

1243
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:46,290
Are not paying attention to any of this and they don't want to because it's still unpopular

1244
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:51,870
But what is going to happen in the future is that there will be more discussion regarding the gods

1245
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:58,050
Why because it's this era is ending and it's not like not to be confused

1246
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:04,210
With anything that you hear of any kind of messianic trippiness from various

1247
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:08,690
Let's say overly reserved or overly conserved religious types

1248
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:13,750
in the world talking about the return of someone or such and such because

1249
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:18,730
That is a crowd Gustav Le Bon crowd type thing. You can't think

1250
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:22,770
By the way, there is in the American fundamental movement

1251
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:29,730
What's called the Bible Belt or the buckle of the Bible Belt or typically in the Western world a fervor?

1252
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,790
Towards a particular religion and it's known as the Christian era

1253
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:40,110
And if you bring up the erroneousness of what they're espousing they say it doesn't matter

1254
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:47,610
Right, right. So what's interesting as they're espousing very definitively these things are going to happen next week and

1255
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:50,050
Yet they don't know how to keep time

1256
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:52,470
They're on the Pope's work schedule

1257
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:58,250
They still haven't figured out that you can't keep time with what's called a calendar and they still haven't figured out that there is no

1258
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,770
Pope's work schedule in the

1259
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,950
text that they allegedly

1260
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:07,330
Some say that subscribe to and if you bring up pretty much anything that they're discussing as being erroneous and being able to prove it

1261
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:10,790
They come back and tell you it doesn't matter

1262
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:14,250
So yours there's your discernment folks

1263
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:19,730
And by the way, I just want to throw this in there people that tend to historically

1264
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:26,030
Historically profess with fervor and great pleasure their beliefs and

1265
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:32,550
When it was investigated that the fervor and belief that they have professed was based on nothing

1266
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:38,330
They tend to not be so pleasant anymore. They tend to be the most violent types

1267
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:40,190
And I'm just gonna throw something in here

1268
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:43,050
this is from a personal experience where I'll keep it real short because

1269
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:48,490
If you've ever learned if you ever learn about the scriptures and you go to one of these quote-unquote

1270
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:53,510
Bible studies in their homes and stuff and they profess things about the King James Version

1271
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:58,010
If you open your mouth about anything contrary to what they're saying you will discover

1272
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:00,610
What a rotten

1273
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:06,830
Vile and violent people I want to say rotten. I mean with a capital T can be

1274
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:14,830
Yeah, I'm talking about like, you know 75 year old little grandmas, you know, they're gonna go they're gonna say you said something about that

1275
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:16,910
I'm gonna go get the sawed-off shotgun

1276
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:22,110
Okay, so this is this is the level of humanity and this is memorialized by the way

1277
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,970
If you want to read something in the book of Kings there was I think

1278
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:32,390
Ahab and Jezebel anyway, so I don't like to bring up a lot of specifics, but here we have a Greek

1279
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,730
How did you uncover the truth objectively?

1280
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:39,030
About scripture the container universe language most of

1281
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:44,170
Us for me have been blocked and blinded by a conventional thought passed down through tradition

1282
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:48,490
Schools pop culture aka the herd. How do we break that?

1283
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:53,770
Well, stop looking at us something you have to break and something as you have to work, you know

1284
01:41:54,730 --> 01:42:00,910
And also when the time is right just asking that question you already began, you know, here's the thing

1285
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:02,890
it comes

1286
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,910
When you have a very large picture

1287
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:10,190
Something like I mentioned 500 years in a cosmic sense is not a long time

1288
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:14,730
When you start looking at how long people live that's even shorter, right?

1289
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:18,890
When you look at what your desires are on a cruise ship, right?

1290
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:25,750
It's it's insignificant compared to the the entire group on the cruise ship going. Let's say from London to New York

1291
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:30,710
Right, so just understanding that the captain's job

1292
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:35,150
Let's say or the ship being safe through its journey or coming to its completion is important

1293
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:39,630
That gives you a little more peace about wondering. What am I going to do on this cruise ship?

1294
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:45,170
Should I go to the theater? Should I go into the cabin and sleep or should I go whatever so many things to do?

1295
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:50,270
Think about it in way that way just the very fact that

1296
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:54,750
People recognize a certain report and want to act on it

1297
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:58,050
and you know what the action is in action and

1298
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,810
It's actually a trick. This is the thing

1299
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:03,050
When you set yourself apart

1300
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:08,590
It takes a tremendous amount of action to do that meaning set yourself apart from it pull yourself out of it

1301
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:14,750
But to the observer who is not aware of what you're doing, they will you will appear to them as being inactive

1302
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:18,210
So I'm actually when I say being inactive or do nothing

1303
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:23,990
This is what you will be observed as right like for example, someone knocks on your door and says hey man tomorrow

1304
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:27,570
You know, we're gonna go downtown and with a bull horn protest this dirty politician

1305
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,930
Okay, sounds good

1306
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:33,510
But you learn a little bit more what the political system in the state of your country is, you know

1307
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:36,990
Like wait a second. This is all you know irrelevant the next day they

1308
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:41,010
Knock on the door and they say hey, you said you're gonna let's go. We're gonna protest

1309
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:47,550
No, I decided not to go because you know what I found out the country was bankrupted is in receivership. There is no money

1310
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:53,290
This is all just a show and oh, oh, okay. So you want to be inactive?

1311
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:57,190
You want to be inactive? Okay, I get it and they walk away

1312
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:03,630
So when you set yourself apart and pursue higher, let's say choir by the way, man's kingdom is vertical

1313
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:07,450
You have the king of the top Street sweeper at the bottom better or worse

1314
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:11,810
You know betters at the top horses at the bottom the kingdom of the gods is their realm is lateral

1315
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:16,370
You're either in or out you're on the left or the right you're in the inner circle outer circle, right?

1316
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:18,450
So that's another little

1317
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:20,150
Hint for that

1318
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:24,130
But you will seem when you do all of the work that it takes to learn the truth

1319
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,790
And there is truth by the way

1320
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:30,290
Now if you speak to people in the legal society that been influenced by it, they're very careful to tell you

1321
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:36,110
Oh, whatever you want it to be or it's your opinion, right? That is the work of the adversary

1322
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:42,190
But anyway, you've that that could be another discussion because when you hear of the God of this world, that is the adversary

1323
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,170
so

1324
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,190
I

1325
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:46,730
Will see here

1326
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:51,590
Maybe another question here is looking for a way out of the mold of the past and reshape the future. Is it possible?

1327
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,490
of course

1328
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:58,870
Lido Jack for the shuffleboard. Yes, the interesting thing here is when you understand

1329
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:03,730
Like I think I mentioned earlier with the caller you're made up of basically three things

1330
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:06,270
You're you're the life force, which is a soul

1331
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:12,010
Breathing is not I try to stress that it's mechanical and chemical which it is, but there's a pulsing

1332
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:17,410
Action that is considered the life force behind it. You're made up of that. You're made up of the physical

1333
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:24,570
Chemical constituents, let's just say and then you're a spirit which is a mind those three things you see

1334
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:31,210
That's that's what you're made of. So once you understand you have to satisfy all three of them

1335
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,350
Yeah, that's a handful

1336
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,930
But there's a lot of distraction in the meantime. So be discerning

1337
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:40,030
Be set yourself apart be discerning

1338
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:45,810
Look for quality. This is this is not advice like I think that was one of the things that was mentioned

1339
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:51,030
On the previous sonic episodes. This is not advice, but it actually is when you think about it

1340
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:57,470
One thing that I always look forward to just to discuss with people is something that they are severely lacking in

1341
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:02,030
Especially in the Western world and I call it. Let me just do it this way back at you perk up

1342
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:03,290
I call it white people food

1343
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:06,590
There's nothing to do with the color of your skin because if you read ancient stuff

1344
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:09,990
Back in the ancient days when something was called white it meant bland

1345
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:15,930
No flavor not really good for you. And what I mean by white people food is for example when I was somewhere in the Midwest

1346
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:20,730
Traveling around saying with people, you know, it's like they brought out lunch and what's that?

1347
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:24,290
You know, that's hot pockets man, or that's what if you know, I think that's a brand

1348
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:31,410
I shouldn't say that but all this frozen food that was pre-packaged full of chemicals that resembled an Italian dish or resembled this

1349
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,950
Resemble that and you would eat that stuff and feel sick

1350
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:39,610
and the thing that is really lacking that I've noticed is really good food preparation and

1351
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:42,050
discerning of food preparation

1352
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:45,170
Because you are still in a physical state where food

1353
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:52,370
Nutrition has to pass through the body and that determines the state of affairs of the character in other words

1354
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:56,570
Good food good drink promotes good character

1355
01:46:56,570 --> 01:47:03,890
Bad food bad drink promotes poor character. You ever wonder why people are talking politics all the time

1356
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:06,110
Anyway, think of I don't think these

1357
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:13,510
these types of discussions mix well with those that are interested in politics because don't you know that

1358
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:19,410
We're gonna have a big financial meltdown on March 15th. Oh boy. How can that be?

1359
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:24,010
Is anyone paying attention? No, so maybe one place to start

1360
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,850
I find it personally that I

1361
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:27,670
speaking out to the listener

1362
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:34,030
One of the most important things that you can do is increase the quality of the intake of the food and drink that you have

1363
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:39,030
Of course of the mind as well things that you hear there you take in

1364
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:44,190
You know, if you think there's going to be a financial meltdown in the middle of or the beginning of spring

1365
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:52,410
You're a moron. I hope that whisper came through. So this is the convention. So start off by

1366
01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:58,170
Clarifying a level of quality of discernment and food preparation. I had previous sonic event

1367
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:01,410
I think we did roughly four hours on food preparation

1368
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:06,110
I think they were called the perfect rice was the name of one of them and it was about certain dishes

1369
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:10,270
We even had a simple preparation that are official. We even had someone call in

1370
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:14,330
Stating how well it worked for them. So again, thanks

1371
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:18,910
donate to AFR so we could see if the Greeks should do a private project and

1372
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:25,430
This is episode one was uncommon radio, thank you everyone. We'll see you again next week
